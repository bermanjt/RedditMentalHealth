0,"I'm 17M and my older sister passed away and left behind two kids. Her former husband remarried last year.

She was not the first tragedy in my family. I've been living with my brother since I was a little kid, and he is very hotheaded and jumps to conclusions. He said we were shunned by our sister's former husband because he got remarried, and we had Christmas without them for the first time ever. I got gifts for my nephews and kept thinking I'd exchange them later. It's tricky to go see them if my brother doesn't want to because they live seven hours away and I'm a minor. He says it's too dangerous to go alone, and I could go to juvy for running away if I defy him. 

I got my brother to tell me the story of why we didn't go there for Christmas and now he's saying it was his choice because it'd be awkward. He just told them we had other plans. I'm kind of pissed he lied, but I'm wondering if he was right. I miss my nephews as much as my sister, but they're trying to move on. I tried calling and asking for my older nephew's (13) contact info, and his new wife picked up who is very jealous, snotty, and insecure. She didn't give it to me. I don't know what her work schedule is to call again when she's gone.",27Jan2019,1
1,"So my best friend knows I like them. We've spoken about it, and we both seem to accept it. I know they find me attractive, but because of circumstances they have nothing will happen for them with anyone right now, including me.

But there's a tiny problem. I don't just like this friend. You see it's been going on for about a year and I may in fact be in love with them. It feels good to say it here, but I want to say it to them. I kind of know that's not a possibility though. Yeeeaaahhh. Sorry, I might be wasting your time.",27Jan2019,1
2,"My sister [25] and I [18M] are roommate and there‚Äôs a lot of shit going on with us but I learned to just ignore them but there‚Äôs this one thing I can‚Äôt ignore, every time she pick up mails she open my mails too, sometimes she throws them away without telling me, and sometimes she stole what‚Äôs inside, and some of them are really really important, I‚Äôve been telling her to stop but no change.
I applied for a loan so I can buy a motorcycle to go to work and today I see her with my loan check and when she see it‚Äôs 5k told me she doesn‚Äôt have any more money for this month rent and I need to pay $1000 and she gives me back other $500 next month (bullshit), I called my father and he supported her(of course)  and at this point I‚Äôm really tired of her shit and I need to do something.

The reason that I live with her is because this way my father would pay half the rent so %25 each of us and %50 him, and I basically cannot afford $1000 room rent, it‚Äôs not just mails and I feel like my human right are not being respected and it piss me of so much, how can make her understand to respect my rights?

3,"I grew up in a suburb with a middle class, but I was molested and sexually abused by a few different people and didn't realize until I was about 17 after a trigger. I got molested by older little boys, by a boy in my class and his older brother, by  girls under a pool table, almost all my friendships have been entirely abusive. I started having bulimic tendencies when I was 7 that blew up into full-on anorexia from the age of 11-15. I was picked on all throughout elementary school and the only thing that got me through eating in the bathroom as a child everyday was the thought that ""they're wrong, one day I will prove to them I'm worth more than this"". I held onto the dream that one day I would be someone famous in movies and as a singer. That's all I've held on to my entire life. 

This dream started getting shattered when I went into theatre in high school, got caught up with a guy named Chris who emotionally and sexually abused me for 2 years. It was a weird friendship that was more like a secret relationship because he was ashamed of me. Eventually I reached a breaking point after girls around me started coming forward about how he'd assaulted them, I confessed to a girl, and I ended up getting forced to report it, he found out, and the whole situation was messy. I had to stay in the same classroom with him 6th period for second semester and it was extremely traumatizing. I started to lose hope in any future.

After graduation, I did a classic runaway and went to school in another country, 1,000 miles from home. It was a religious school, and very strange, so I ended up isolated, with no friends, holed up in my dorm everyday. I met a guy, we dated, and he ended up really hurting me and lying to me, so it just triggered a dissociative episode. I started meeting up with guys from tinder and making out to just **feel** something other than this numbness. Ended up getting **really** sick and almost dying, failed all of my classes because I physically couldn't eat, drink, or leave my dorm. Hospital visits pretty much every week for a month and a half. 10 days before the end of the semester I was feeling better, so I met up with someone (what was supposed to be platonic) and he raped me. Went home, extremely numb and depressed, went on a streak with friends from home drinking, smoking, partying, got hurt by a couple guys, so here I am. 

I've been trying to get a job for a month, I'm going to community college 2 days a week, smoking just to cope with horrible PTSD, anxiety, depression. I'm getting burnt out because it seems no matter how hard I try nothing I do yields any result. Even going to church, I'm finding I can't hold on. I feel like crying all the time, I'm just so empty and depressed and I want a future. I can't even envision my wedding anymore because I don't believe a man out there is good and I don't believe I can be loved. I am stuck wallowing, extremely fatigued, I've gained 10 pounds, I just want a way out with some advice. Anything.",27Jan2019,1
5,"Does anyone have trouble keeping in touch with old friends or new acquaintances? I can keep pushing to reach out, but it feels like these relationships are all fairly one-sided and the interactions can feel forced (i.e. I have to reach out or they don't follow up when I end a conversation by asking them to keep me posted on how X goes). I was wondering a few things:

1. Is this normal? This seems to happen with a wide variety of people I interact with.
2. If not, is this something that I am doing wrong? How can I figure this out if so? I don't really feel comfortable asking anyone about this (which is partly why I am posting here).",27Jan2019,1

7,An issue I have with almost anything is that I can't focus. It's a big issue for school for me. And its not from a lackof trying. I just can't keep my mind on my work for more than a few minutes.,27Jan2019,1
8,"I've muddled along at work for years, struggled really, but have done okay.  Generally considered an ""underachiever relative to how smart he is"".  I took the 'big 5' personality test today and it all came into focus:  bottom 1% of Conscientiousness and top 95% of openness. I.e., I'm the laziest person on the planet and distracted by every change in the wind.

My son (18) took the test and has similar low conscientiousness.  I score medium high in both agreeableness.  He is low single digits in agreeableness and 98% in neuroticism.  

I am very afraid for his future with this make-up, and my future with low conscientiousness isn't so great as I have found myself recently in the most boring and administrative of all possible jobs--and with tight deadlines and high work load.

I'd like to start helping us both with overcoming rock bottom conscientiousness.  What do you suggest?",27Jan2019,1
9,"Td:lr: Mom isn‚Äôt there for me. She loves me, but she doesn‚Äôt try. She has given up on herself, and she‚Äôs always gone and doesn‚Äôt care.She has DID(dissociative identity disorder) Dad is probably going to divorce her, which I think is good. I‚Äôve tried and tried again to be a good daughter and have a relationship, but it just seems like she doesn‚Äôt want one, and it hurts(this has been going on all my life). I take on a lot of her responsibilities, and I just want to live away from her. 

Q: Should I even try again to have a relationship? More importantly, if divorce happens, can I choose to not live with her(older than 16)? How do I cope if divorce doesn‚Äôt happen? What do I do? Should I feel this way? Am I wrong?

I‚Äôm writing this post, as I am sad about this, and I just want to stop hurting. It‚Äôs really hard living with my mom feeling like she doesn‚Äôt love me, even though I know she does.  

My(Highschool age) moms(40s) relationship with me does not exist. I used to really want one, but she just was/is emotionally neglectful. She‚Äôs always gone. She never has really meaningful interactions with me. Someone may say she needs to work, but my dad makes 80% of the money, and he still has time for me.

My mom is a therapist, and she chooses to work long hours. She‚Äôs altruistic in that sense, and she‚Äôs a damn good therapist, but she just isn‚Äôt there. She‚Äôs nonexistent in my family‚Äôs life. 

My mom isn‚Äôt very supportive of my dad. When I was younger she would try to control him(and everyone else in our house), but now that he is his own person, she is always gone. My dad disclosed to me that he is probably going to divorce her. He also feels what I am feeling but from the perspective of her husband. 

I‚Äôve tried to be honest and reach out to her. I‚Äôve told her I felt alone, and that I want to have a relationship,and that I felt like my needs weren‚Äôt being met, but she has shown she doesn‚Äôt care, even if she says she does. It makes me sad.

My mom has dissociative identity disorder(according to her) and she uses that as an excuse a lot. It makes me feel like crap for not trying and not wanting to have a relationship. I‚Äôm trying to be understanding, really I am, but it hurts to feel like I have to be the caretaker and emotional support. 

About 3 moths ago, I quit trying to invest in our relationship. The only interactions we had had until that point were in the car, but I got my license, so now I only see her for less than an hour total a week on average. I‚Äôve been a little happier, but I‚Äôm still trying to understand why it isn‚Äôt working out. I know it isn‚Äôt my fault but it feels like it is. She‚Äôs just never there.

I feel sad I don‚Äôt love her. I feel anger the way she has been treating my dad, and I want them to be happy, especially my dad who is unhappy. She is clueless. She thinks nothing is wrong even when we tell her it is. I feel shame for not trying to have a relationship, and for not having any relationship. 

I feel anger for caring about her, but feel sad and depressed because I know it is hopeless. Yes I have expressed this to her time and time again, as nonviolently as I can, but it just doesn‚Äôt seem to click. 

My current feelings are that of, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to live with her‚Äù I take on a lot of her responsibilities. I clean up after her(she never cleans or cleans up after herself, ever. It‚Äôs always been like this no matter how much anyone has tried.). I take care of her dogs(they are also being neglected by her), as it used to be she would feed them and run them, now it‚Äôs, she‚Äôs too busy, so I need to feed them and run them. 

I love my dogs. They are great, the thing is I don‚Äôt want them. I never really have. It sucks that my family has to take care of them, when all of us don‚Äôt even want them, except the one who doesn‚Äôt take care of them.

When the divorce happens. I really just want to live with my dad. I want my mom to prove to me she can take care of two dogs well-being before I ever trust her again. 

I want to say she is a toxic person, but that just makes me feel guilty. I feel shame for not wanting to be involved with her at all anymore.  I feel like I‚Äôm not good enough to have a relationship(which I know is irrational).

Should I even try again to have a relationship? More importantly, if divorce happens, can I choose to not live with her(older than 16)? How do I cope if divorce doesn‚Äôt happen? What do I do? Should I feel this way? Am I wrong?",27Jan2019,1

11,"Hi soo first time using redit so I apologise if this is badly done/in the wrong place/ very stupid. 
Anyway some background information to this whole setup. I‚Äôm 18 nearly 19 and was dumped on Boxing Day by my long term girlfriend. We had been talking about getting married and having a family so it was obviously serious. Hurt I decided to rebound (a terrible decision I know) by getting on tinder (an even worse decision on my part) and ended up hitting it off with a guy who went to the same college as the one I had just left. I‚Äôm a few months older than him making us in diffident school years. He is still in college I went to university in September  had a sever mental breakdown forcing me to leave and move back home with my parents. So yes we‚Äôre both legal adults. Anyway after talking for a while we decided to meet up on the 2nd of January I‚Äôd made a few hints that I wasn‚Äôt after anything serious and wasn‚Äôt interested in anything long term and really this was just getting out and having some fun. Somewhere during the date things started heating up and we decided to go to his place (it‚Äôs technically arranged living through a charity where a guy opens his house for young men who‚Äôd otherwise be homeless. He‚Äôs got a lot of family issues and can‚Äôt stay with any family bc of that.) and obviously things happened. There was no alcohol or drugs involved and what happened was a mutual decision. Only he didn‚Äôt have any protection and I kinda feeling bad for suggesting it and getting worked up let him continue anyway. I was on top and he didn‚Äôt think to warn me when he was going to finish and ended up doing so inside me. Afterwards we ended up officially becoming a couple despite my original intentions. Now I‚Äôd like to point out if I wasn‚Äôt broke and didn‚Äôt live rural I would have just got some plan b and that would be the end of the story but obviously that‚Äôs not the case. I tried to ignore the whole thing thinking it was unlikely anything was wrong but I started feeling unwell and bought two pregnancy tests (well a pack of two) during my work lunch break. (About 2 weeks after what happened) abd took a test when I got home that evening. Negative. I tried to ignore it again until Tuesday when I thought my period was due. Negative. So today I downloaded a period tracking app and found out I was actually fertile on the 2nd and my period is now 6 days late. My plan is to buy another test on Monday when I‚Äôm at work but is there anyway I can make the test more accurate? In each case what do I do? What should I do if I am pregnant? My parents would kill me if I am and I might well loose my job as the people I work with would never speak to a girl who fell pregnant outside of marriage.. any advice is appreciated and if you have any questions please don‚Äôt hesitate to ask 
Thanks Ellie!  ",27Jan2019,1
12,"I have no idea whether this is an appropriate sub to post this line of inquiry, but I know askreddit wasn‚Äôt. 

My (almost) 3 year old daughter recently lost her favorite stuffed animal on a trip, and it is functionally lost forever. We purchased the toy in Paris, France and we live in the USA.

Basically, I‚Äôm asking you folks who/where I should ask to get more info on this shop, if it still exists. It would likely require residence or intimate knowledge of Paris, and I don‚Äôt speak French. I assume the general French subreddit?

Any advice on how best to find the one who can help replace this toy? Or put to rest any hope?

13,Long story short I was raised by my grandma for the most part because my mom doesn‚Äôt like kids. I‚Äôm 26 and my is 64.

I don‚Äôt date or have fun I work 7 days a week. The highlight of my day and life is that I get to come home to my dog.

I got her healthy again and she quiet smoking. She just started smoking again she‚Äôs been going to our neighbors house and asking for cigarettes. Before we moved she used to ask the other neighbors for money saying that I needed it for gas. I had to go over and tell them that she‚Äôs lying to stop giving her money. I recently found out my dog was diagnosed with cancer. My mom is smoking in the house and it can‚Äôt be good for my dog. I‚Äôm tired I can‚Äôt even come home to clean air.

One of his partners could abuse his male children. And when they get older, everyone will bully them for having multiple fathers and a gay dad.

Our parents are shocked and upset. My mother has mental health issues because of him. They think he is mentally ill and a freak, and they want him to get help.

I think gays should have equal rights to normal people, but I'm not okay with the fact he either lied for a long time or chose to be gay for attention seeking after leaving an unhappy marriage. He's going to lose custody of his kids if the government thinks he's a freak, and then my mother will get even worse if she can't see them.

I am not a Christian or any religion that has dogma against gays, but I think it is very telling that so many cultures have forbade this practice because they realized there was something wrong with what people like my brother are doing.

(First and foremost: My parents were negligent and abusive. Let's not go any deeper into that, since it's besides the point)  
I'm graduated, I'm 18 (19 in May), and i'm currently in a 4 year relationship.   
I live in the middle of a crapchute city, with little to no chance of getting a job within walking distance.   
I have no family avenues to tread, and am currently living with my half brother's dad.   
I have an acl injury, no medical (Live in Mississippi so can't GET medical), and I can't work any job that requires me to stand for more than 4 hours at a time to GET medical. So I can't work because I'm injured, I cant get fixed because I can't work, and I can't work because I can't get fixed.   
My girlfriend, mentioned earlier, and I had been dying to live together and begged them to let her come out (Which they did) I tried to hold a factory job so we could be self sufficient and get an apartment, but simply couldn't. And since I don't have a car (Or even know how to drive), I had no other options. So after 4 months she was sent home.  
Now things feel even worse, getting to live with her was amazing and I've been desperately trying to figure out how to make enough money to get her back out here and get my own place, to no avail.   


I really badly need advice on what to do here, I don't know what kind of options I have. Just, give examples. Help me find something to help myself.

24,"It wasn‚Äôt the worst day ever, it was just a bad day. My day started off by having to tell some dumb ass yo shut the fuck up because he was making very, very personal ‚Äújokes‚Äù. The reason that‚Äôs bad is because I‚Äôm probably not able to sit with my table at school, because everybody thought what I did was ‚Äúwrong‚Äù. Listen if somebody fucking makes jokes about my personal life, and things that are personal to me, I‚Äôm going to tell that person to shut the fuck up so that other people don‚Äôt start doing it too. Anyways, that wasn‚Äôt that bad. Then I went to chemistry and when I tried to use the restroom my teacher told me to sit down and to not drink ‚Äútampon juice‚Äù. Yeah you can imagine how confused I was, along with the class. Then when I did eventually go to the restroom, the second I came back my teacher asked me some question about chemistry that I didn‚Äôt know. The entire class was just fucking staring at me. Then we had a quiz in chemistry, which I failed because I didn‚Äôt finish. I understood the material. I just had to think about it since the questions needed a lot of math. But we only had 15 min. So I didn‚Äôt get to finish so I failed the quiz. Since it‚Äôs the beginning of the quarter I have an F for the class. That‚Äôs my only bad grade. I have A‚Äôs B‚Äôs two C‚Äôs and a fucking F. I don‚Äôt know how the fuck I‚Äôm supposed to bring that shit up. We had to do a lab report. In that lab report there were equations we had to do. Each equation you get wrong is a letter grade off your lab. There were 5 questions. So let‚Äôs say I some how got all those questions wrong, that‚Äôs a pretty low F. Since I have no confidence I‚Äôm worried I did get them wrong. That lab is 60 points and it‚Äôs worth 60% of my grade in the class. That means if I failed that, my grade will be so low in the class that bringing it up will be damn near impossible.

25,"So I used to teach at a great high school where I taught chemistry, physics, calculus, Siamese, and Mongolian. The kids were really smart, the admin was great, my coworkers (teachers and counselors) were so smokin' hot (seriously, some of them looked like Ashley Graham, Kim K, Emily Ratajowski and Nina Dobrev) and I was paid really well. I even scored a date with like, two really hot teachers, even though one had been married for 5 years already.

Sadly, my girlfriend (who wasn't a teacher there--the teachers were just my sidehoes) broke up with me over Winter Break and the next semester was total shit. I barely came to school and went high when I did go, and I turned to other stuff because I was so sad and missed my GF's sugar if you know what I mean.

Sadly, weed costs a lot of money, as do escorts, so I had to tutor, teach, and coach cheerleading on the side!

I literally just skipped around and said ""Yay!"" THAT WAS SO HUMILIATING!!!

I was so overextended that I failed at EVERYTHING! NO ONE PASSED THE AP ORGANIC CHEMISTRY EXAM! EVEN SOMEONE WHO NOW WORKS AS A JANITOR DIDN'T PASS! Also, I had to teach math over the summer because I was so broke, and two of the kids had to go back to preschool after I taught them (from their original level!) HOW?!

A year later, I guess I was fired from the school. I was watching a video with a really hot brunette actress, and man, oh my god; whewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww! I couldn't wait till I got home!

Sadly, I had a student come up to me and say that she didn't know how to do anything in the Mongolian packet, and I guess she saw me watching a video of that foxy woman. I screamed ""–≥–∞–ª–∑—É—É–≥–∏–π–Ω ”©–º—Ö–∏–π –±–∞–∞—Å!"" when that happened. I also had weed in my cabinets, soooo...yeah :/

HELP! I currently have no source of income and I have to survive off of my girlfriend's money! I couldn't even get a job at McDonalds because I fucked up the interview! I also worked at a Catholic school for a while but it sucked ass and I quit and was fired for not being Catholic! I just don't believe in Pope Francis and Vladmir Putin (who is Francis' homie for life).

Is there any way I could be hired back at the old school? I really miss all of my students, who all unfriended me after I was fired, and some of the counselors, who were, you know, really attractive and all that. One of them looked like Ivanka Trump, in fact. I wanted to brominate all of the counselors' tertiary carbons, or would have least dated the most hot counselor and/or teacher there if they weren't already married. Their husbands LITERALLY WORKED AT THE SCHOOL! HOW?!!!

I HAVE A PHD IN ORGANIC CHEMISTRY AND I AM UNEMPLOYED! THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE! HELP! HOW CAN I GET REHIRED AT THAT OLD SCHOOL?",27Jan2019,1
26,"Hey Reddit, I'm in a bit of a quandary. Yesterday, I chatted with a friend on Facebook that I hadn't talked to in a while, and he wants to go see the movie *Glass* tomorrow, so he said he'd get back to me about the showtimes. Then, I got a couple of texts and E-mails from a volunteer organization I belong to asking for volunteers to go down to a certain city in my state where an emergency has broken out and go door to door to check and see if people are okay. 

On one hand, this volunteer opportunity seems like it could be an uncommon opportunity to bolster my resume and help me get out of this job I hate, plus I could go to the movies some other time. On the other hand, it's an hour's drive from my house to the city where this emergency is taking place, whereas it's only a half hour's drive to the theater where my friend wants to go see the movie. Also, I'm really not sure how much longer this particular movie's gonna be in theaters for. What do you folks think?",27Jan2019,1
27,"Hi Reddit, 

I'm not sure where to post this as I'm pretty new to the site and have only been lurking in the confines for a few days, but I have to know whether the thing is an actual thing. Ive been thinking about what I would like in a potential partner and realized that I have a bit of a dilemma. I've recently stumbled upon the lovely subreddit r/RoleReversal and realized that I would very much like to be in a relationship with a guy that absorbs my high levels of affection and general caring for him like a sponge. However, I would also like the same partner to do the same for me to an equal degree. Basically, I want a man that will fall asleep on my chest while I card my fingers through his hair and tell him how much he is adored and loved and valued but I would also like the same man to pick me up, throw me over his shoulder and walk me out of a room caveman-style. I realize that in the BDSM community, there are switches, though I'm not sure if that applies here. Is this a thing? Am I the only one? I like to think of this as two sides of the same coin, but cut down the middle to get half of each side. So, am I making stuff up or do people want and possess both sides? Please advise. Thank you.

30," 

I'm at a loss of what to do at the moment.

I'll state the facts first, then tell you what I want to happen, and then I'll tell you what I feel like doing.

My grand daughter is 7 years old. She has always been very close to me (56 years old) and we have been very close ever since she was born. I love baking, and as soon as she could hold a rolling pin, we were baking partners in crime.

Now, her Mother and Father both work, and I'm retired, so I often take care of her during evening and weekends.

This particular evening, before I told her it was bedtime, we went through the usual routine:

Me: ""Have you brushed your teeth?""

Her: ""Yes grandad.""

Me: ""Toilet?""

Her: ""I can't.""

Then I paused.

Me: ""What do you mean? Is there something wrong with the toilet?""

Her: ""No, it hurts a bit at the moment.""

Me: ""Hurts in what way?""

Her: ""It just hurts.""

I kept asking her what type of pain it was, and she just kept saying it hurt. Then I asked her when she first noticed it. She said:

Her: ""After Daddy looked down there.""

I froze for a second, because I didn't really want to immediately think the worst of the situation. So I said:

Me: ""What was he looking for?""

Her: ""Daddy just told me to lay still, and that he was looking.""

Me: ""When was this?""

Her: ""Friday."" (We had this discussion Saturday evening).

I wasn't sure what to say to her again. Then she said.

Her: ""It's a secret, okay?""

Me: ""Did he tell you it was a secret?""

Her: ""No, Mummy did.""

Now, ""Mummy"" is abroad, and has been for the last week, so I'm sure Mummy didn't tell her it was a secret. So I said:

Me: ""When did Mummy say it was a secret?""

Her: ""Last time it hurt, I told her, and she said it was a secret.""

So this was NOT the first time.

The first thing I did was tell her she was a very brave girl, and she asked me ""for what?"". I almost cried.

I asked her if it really really hurt down there, and she said ""No, it's just a bit stingy.""

So I ran a bath, put in a very small amount of antiseptic solution, and asked her to clean herself, clean down there, and pee in the bath to wash out all the bad stuff. She went and did this and I put her to bed.

So that's what happened.

Now, what I want to happen is:

\- My grand daughter to live with me.

\- Cut ties with my daughter and step-son.

\- Have them both jailed.

What I feel like doing is:

\- Put on my ski mask and hoodie.

\- Visit them.

\- Kill them.

I won't do what I feel like doing, since I need to take of my grand daughter.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to the police and family lawyer first thing in the morning, and I won't be answering any calls or correspondence from my step-son or daughter. I'll tell my grand daughter that she will stay with me for a while, while her parents are at work. We're going to bake apple strudels and play nintendo switch so I forget about this, for a moment at least. 

Once CPS get in touch with me, or I with them, I'm sure she'll go to counselling.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything else I can do to help her? Anybody who has been in a similar situation as the victim, was there anything anyone could have done to help you along?

&amp;#x200B;

I fully intend to give my grand daughter to lovely upbringing she deserved. ",27Jan2019,1
31,"Let me give you some context.  
I have known this girl for about 4-5 months, because of school.  
I've noticed from very early on that she shares way too much with people. In the first month, I already knew about way too much, she told me stuff that I've honestly never cared to know, and never asked her about. Once, she was telling me something and she said ""I'm telling you this because you're one of my best friends"" and I was like..*??* Mind you, at that time I had only known her for a couple of weeks and she was *barely* an acquaintance, she was just a mere person from school that I had to *deal with.*  
And, she wanted to know about aspects of my life that I didn't want to share with **anyone** other than close friends (of course I didn't tell her anything).  
Once, I let her see my journal, but I told her ""please don't read anything, just see the drawings"". I've shown a lot of people my journal and I've NEVER had anyone *actually read* what I write. I just let her see because she had shown me hers (she had told me not to read anything, and I didn't, *like a respectful person*), so I thought that she wasn't going to read anything, and as soon as she did, I snached my journal away from her as quickly and as harshly as I could. Yes, you could say this is my fault, because it is. I shouldn't have shown her anything at all. But she should have respect for people, she should know that.   
I began acting cold and...well, simply cold. I don't tolerate when people that I *barely* know try to invade my life. It's not cool.   
For about a month, I tried to keep my distance and I only talked to her whenever it was necessary. (By the way, I didn't get away from her just because of the journal thing, I had tolerated a lot other than that. I tried to be her friend, especially because I had already made a group of friends in my new class, and she was part of it. I didn't want to exclude her because I know that being excluded sucks, as I was in that situation for about 4-5 years. That's just not how you treat someone.)   


# This is the harsh part, so trigger warning.

  
Then, I found out she self harmed. I didn't know about this. I knew she was depressed...I just didn't know that she self harmed. I tried to talk to her about it. I didn't like her, but that didn't mean that I was going to ignore something like that. She told me it had been a one-time thing and that she hated the experience. She told me that she would never do it again. I told her that I would keep an eye on her whether she wanted it or not. (I don't think she has self harmed since then, btw. I check her arms normally, and even though I know that there's more places where you can self harm, she hasn't done anything. Other than checking on her, I can't really do much.)   
I felt quite bad. If I had known that I probably would have tolerated her. She told me that it wasn't because of anything I had said or done, she just told me that she couldn't cry, so she did that so she could cry. Never in my 16 years on this earth had I dealt with something like that...It made me so nervous for her. I know stuff like this happens, but seeing it in real life is terrifying.  
But then I started paying more attention. She never really...hid what she had done. I don't know much about people that self harm. I have very weak mental health, but I just never got to that point and also, I try to not know too much about it, just in case I ever get tempted to. Either way, I know that people who self harm don't exactly like to show the cuts.   
Or start to get happy whenever anyone shows that they're worried. I mean...correct me if I'm wrong, but don't people that self harm want to hide everything? And pretend like they're ok? She just...was so happy whenever I showed any type of worry. I'm not saying she did it for attention, I'm just saying, all of it felt very suspicious.  
Then she started to get clingy again, getting all up on my personal life, looking at my phone whenever I was texting my best friend - who she has always been jealous of -, she picked up my journal and started reading it even if I told her that I didn't want to, she followed me anywhere I went, invited herself when I went to eat with my friends, wanted to get on groups for projects with me, always looked at what I was doing in my computer, asked me what I was doing when I *clearly* was only minding my own business...that and much more. But, when I turned around to the desk behind us in class, and she slapped my ass, that was ***absolutely*** my boiling point.   
So much so that my patience was over and I went back to only communicating when it was necessary. I still checked if she was self-harming, I still wanted her to be okay. I just wanted her to respect my privacy, and also my fucking body.  
That was also when I started suspecting that she liked me. All of my friends in my friend group thought so as well - not only did she do all those things, but she also did absolutely everything for me, all unsolicited. If dropped a pen, she would immediately get it for me, before I could get it, she opened doors, if I said that I was hungry she offered me her food...it was almost creepy. I'm a small person, and she constantly says how cute I am, because of how small I am. There's someone in my class who is the same height as me, and she is friends with her too, but she doesn't tell her that, even though I'd argue that she's cuter than I am with her pink hair and all, but I digress.  


Now, I know that she's a lesbian - not that that's bad, just a detail - so her liking me wasn't out of the realm of possibilities.   
I'm straight...well, I think I am, still figuring that one out. Even if I wasn't, the feelings just wouldn't be mutual. I made that apparent. I'm not one to lead people on.   


I started feeling awful again. I know she's fragile, so more and more I started to tolerate her again.  
But I just don't want her to be clingy again. She thinks I'm bisexual. I've told her I'm not, but she believes it almost like she wants me to be bisexual. Again, not that that's wrong, I just don't want her to assume things she knows *nothing* about.   


That's where I'm at currently. I try to tolerate her, I have to, for school work, in case I get paired up with her. I don't want to make her more sad, and I also don't want to get into more fights and drama, but my patience is very low and I'm not sure how much more I can take...Could anyone please tell me how I'm supposed to still be friendly with her, but keep her out of everything that's personal without getting all fired up? Thank you in advance. And sorry for the long explanation.

33,"I am an amateur artist and I am trying to become more of a professional recently. I did a black and white drawing of my roommates cat that she loved and I gave it to her to frame in her room free of charge. She liked it so much that she wanted to get it tattooed on herself, which I said wad awesome because I want to start doing tattoo designs.
Her friend is a tattoo artist and she booked the appointment a while ago. 

She is a good artist and I was surprised she agreed to do something I designed. I messaged her a while back and asked if she would like me to clean it up a bit and she said she had it handled, so I was like cool she‚Äôs a professional.

So today my roommate goes to get the tattoo and I see a picture of the flash and the artist changed a lot of the drawing but it‚Äôs still the same concept and has a lot of the same elements. Like it‚Äôs a rip off of my drawing, but not the actual drawing.
I‚Äôm really pissed because I was under the impression that my roommate was getting this done because she liked my design! I didn‚Äôt charge her and The artist never asked if she could change the design. She‚Äôs most likely going to take credit on her page for a concept that I came up with.
It‚Äôs a weird situation because it‚Äôs too late to do anything about it now. She‚Äôs currently getting inked. I feel like every time I look at it I‚Äôll just think about how my idea was stolen.

39,"I am postgrad student. So far I have had this lecturer who seems to have a grudge with me actively try to make my experience here hell.
In my meetings with him, I have had my personal belongings such as my notebooks flung off the desk, he also attempted to snatch my phone out of my hand and on a separate occasion my pen was snatched out of my possession while I was writing notes down. The lecturer has also threatened me saying that without his help and his signature I would not be able to get a job or graduate. I believe all these were done in order to agitate me or as a manipulative sort of power play.

Since working with this lecturer, my project has been delayed for the past 3 months. He does not respond to any emails and tries to shift the blame to make me appear as an incompetent student. 

When I am supposed to attend meetings with him, instead of having it in a meeting room or even in any of the available classroom he insists on having it out of campus.
 
I have also read that there has been a case where another lecturer in this same college was sacked for harassing students.

41,"Hello I just turned 20 and I want to start my life correctly, i don‚Äôt have much of a support system so I didn‚Äôt get much teaching about how to be successful.

I was born to two minors who were raised lower class and remained there. They split up immediately and i was raised primarily by my mother until my teens. both of my parents had mental health issues and my childhood was not easy or nurturing. i was homeless a few times as a teen when my parents kicked me out or they were too much to be around so i left. around 17 i was homeless for awhile and once i got on my feet and was living with roommates i primarily focused on finishing school with As and Bs and learning about the things that interest me outside of school. I‚Äôve always been a learner and a dreamer, and as such i never liked school. I always felt i could learn more by reading or researching on my own time; and so i didn‚Äôt care about getting As and Bs until i hit 10th grade. I also neglected a lot of the opportunities i had in school to learn about the process of going to college.  I knew i wanted to go but i also know i was born poor and was living on my own and working at 17. Now I am 20 and I have a strong knowledge of computers, electricity, history, physics, and the American government and politics as well as some geopolitics.  A few months ago in october I lost my warehouse job where i made $17 an hour and worked 4 12 hour shifts a week. I‚Äôve felt really lost ever since, and haven‚Äôt had a job. I‚Äôve done some side hustles to pay my bills the past few months but i feel like i‚Äôm in a really bad spot. I have good work experience and i‚Äôm a smart guy with ambition but the job market in my area is horrible. the pickings are very slim and they all want bachelors degrees or years of experience for anything over $10 an hour that isn‚Äôt a warehouse job. 

I can‚Äôt go back to warehousing as i was in a nearly fatal electric turret truck accident due to someone‚Äôs negligent placement of full pallets in the racking(this incident was also pretty much the reason i lost my job shortly after), and have been traumatized to the point that i don‚Äôt feel safe operating heavy machinery and am really anxious and paranoid the whole time. 

I‚Äôve been living with roommates for a while but they‚Äôre moving in with their girlfriends now and i have nobody else to roommate with as my warehouse job killed my social life. My lease is up in a month and i have no money after this next round of bills, no family or friends i could stay with, no responsible friends who could be roommates, and no idea what the f*ck i‚Äôm going to do with my life or how to give myself a purpose. I currently feel like a total waste of space and a failure and can barely force myself to  do things with consistency like go to the gym every other day and do basic things like shower and hygiene every day and keep up with laundry. All of these things are unlike me but i‚Äôve fallen into a very deep depression where i feel lost and powerless and like my life isn‚Äôt worth living. I‚Äôve had dark times in the past with PTSD and depression from being abused and manipulated physically, sexually, and emotionally as well as mentally in my childhood and was in a deep depression for a few years in my mid to late teens when i was thrown on the streets and had no love in my life. I‚Äôve grown to accept my experiences and not let the past get to me, but i am still excruciatingly lonely and have no family or really any friends. I have a very hard time socializing as i don‚Äôt feel the day to day places i go are really places where it‚Äôs acceptable to socialize as it‚Äôs all strangers. I was free of my depression and was moving upward for a while but now i am at my lowest low and i‚Äôm all alone.

i‚Äôve always had really big dreams for what i could do with my life with all my learning habits and interests as well as the strength i gained by being through the mud of my early life. I want to start my own businesses and use the constant ideas i have about improving technologies or goods, using science to help the environment, and using software to streamline small businesses and large ones to make everyone happy. I want to make a good living and make enough money that i can pursue my passions and use my influence to make the world a better place. 


SHORT TERM:
Right now I have no idea how I‚Äôm going to make the transition as my only potential jobs are really mindless repetitive jobs for low pay. all the job sites i use are filled with MLM schemes, bogus marketing companies, bait and switch positions that leave you as a commission only salesman, or the aforementioned low pay no benefit jobs that i feel would be a waste of time and have nothing to do with my interests or skills. 

With skills in electronics, software, and science; I am in a position where any job that would give me relevant experience requires previous experience or a degree. I can go get another low pay mindless job but i will only have enough to pay my bills(not even in some cases) and won‚Äôt be able to grow as it takes capital and i don‚Äôt want my dreams to die. I need something that i can do to start myself going and get the money i need to either go to college or start a business and the job market here is not cutting it. I‚Äôm not the type of guy who stays an employee, I have the drive, the ideas, and the will to be the employer and take the risks but i don‚Äôt have a clear path to get started. 

LONG TERM:
I am only getting older, and i don‚Äôt want to work a dead end job until i‚Äôm 30 and then finally have 10,000 dollars saved to pursue my passions. I don‚Äôt want to work as hard as i do just to make someone else rich. I don‚Äôt want to invest in stocks with all the shady things the banks and stock market people do to manipulate the system through speculation, artificial inflation, and the like. the market looks extremely volatile to me as it‚Äôs all held together with duct tape and lies. cryptocurrency is being disproportionately mined by powerful companies and third world governments like the oil rich nations and so that market is ridiculously oversaturated and ultimately not a good investment anymore. With these complications and their effects over the next 10 years, I don‚Äôt find these viable options even when i do get capital. 


Any advice on the short term situation or the long term would be greatly appreciated. i‚Äôve been reading Rich dad poor dad by Robert Kiyosaki and i‚Äôve been reading more recently about personal finance, business, marketing, sales, and personal growth but it always starts from the point of having worked a dead end job long enough to have 10, 20, 30 thousand saved  up or having gone to college and being able to get a 40K+ a year job but where i live the job market is just plain trash.

Thank you for your time

TL;DR what would you as a successful business owner or entrepreneur do if you started over at 20 years old, got off to a rough start in the lower class, had an extreme learning spirit and many ideas and passions; but had no good job openings around, opportunities to get a foot in the door, family to help, or money to go to college?

43,"Hello, I'm the 16 year old brother of my 6 year old sister. She goes to elementary school as a Kindergarten student. Lately, my little sister has changed, she isn't the jolly, normal, little sister I've always known she was. Though I may not communicate with her a lot due to our age gaps, she was completely fine before she got a new teacher. 

&amp;#x200B;

Prior to this, I'll provide some background. My little sister had a different teacher in the beginning of the school year. She was a nice old lady who was very nice to her students. Christmas Break comes, and she goes for medical leave until March. The school had to provide a substitute teacher for my sister and her classmates for the time being. They gave my sister and her classmates this teacher. This particular teacher teaches the upper-graders, (4th or 5th) and is known to be very strict with her students. She is not afraid to use her voice at her students. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now you have a strict upper-grader teacher who is now supposed to take care of a bunch of Kindergarten students. These young children like my sister, haven't fully matured mentally to realize that not all teachers are jolly and happy. And this has taken a rough toll on my sister and one of her best friends at school. It's completely broken her.

&amp;#x200B;

Lately, my little sister would be extremely clingy to my dad, always say, ""Bye"" or ""I love you!"" in the most heartbroken way whenever he leaves for work. When he is at home, my little sister just loves to be around him way more often before she got this strict teacher.

Today, she was unable to cope with my dad leaving for work. She was literally about to run out the house bawling to chase after him. Screaming ""come back!"" as my mom holds her tight. She was never like this. It was usually a quick kiss and goodbye, then that would be all. My dad would leave for work, and she would be on her way to do her homework.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week, my dad and I went to the school with my sister to talk to the principal's office to address my sister's behavior at home because of her new strict teacher. The principal herself also knew how she is as a teacher and how strict she can be. After talking to the principal, the 4 of us decided to stop by to drop my little sister off to her class. She couldn't let go, couldn't look at her teacher, and couldn't say a word. It was as awkward as it could be for at least 5 minutes. The principal, the teacher, my dad, my sister, and I were just outside her class. The teacher even explained to the principal how my little sister was just ""not getting used to the letting go part"", or how my little sister is more sensitive than her peers. Her teacher even says she is fine in class. 

&amp;#x200B;

It just seemed so fake. It hurts to type this knowing my little sister is being traumatized by her teacher at school. This ""letting go"" part should only happen at the school, NOT AT HOME. I just want to go to the school tomorrow and give her a piece of my mind. She doesn't seem to fully understand what she has done to my little sister. I just don't know what to do. It also hurts because this strict teacher is the school's teacher of the year. Though the award has nothing to do with this at all, I just want my sister's innocence back, she's way too young to be exposed to such negative energy from someone like a teacher.",27Jan2019,1
44,"So I (15 M) work in this little kitchen and I really like my job because it's great pay for my age.

However, recently I've also been on the same shift as this one guy who we'll call X. X is gay and I've got nothing against that, but it makes me feel a lot more uncomfortable having a guy hit on me than I would if he was a girl, because I don't want to react in a way which would accidentally seem homophobic. 

A lot of the stuff he does started off small, things you could brush off as just wanting to be my friend, or get to know me more. It was things like making sure we were on the same job, hanging around the room I was in not doing anything, talking to me a lot (and I mean A LOT, not letting anyone else get a word in, or completely ignoring other folk). 

Then it changed a bit to flirting and calling me pet names like ""hon"". He'd ask to meet up after school or work ask if I wanted to see a film. He'd DM me on instagram a lot all hours of the day. 

Then it escalated to him touching me a bit. X would put his arm around my waist/put his hand on my arse, he'd hit it if I'd walk by. If the boss called us round for her to talk to us, X would stand incredibly close to me, like I could feel him and his breath, if I moved he would too. 

Sorry for posting a whole novel, but I wanted to show the progression, its been escalating a lot recently and it makes me super uncomfortable. 

What should I do about this? ",27Jan2019,1

49,"Last couple months or so I've been extremely bored. My free time is normally ate up mostly by working my old chevy, with gaming and watching anime taking up a solid few hours of the day. Lately though it just hasn't been enough for me. I find myself constantly to the point of being bored to tears. At least once a day though sometimes more I'll try to take a nap when I'm not even remotely tired just because I'm that bored and can't be bothered to find something else to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have basically 1 actual friend. We hang out about once a week to once every 2 weeks. Those days are honestly the only days I'm not bored. Would hang out more with him but conflicting schedules and a few other complications make it difficult. Normally for us to hang out one of us has to do an all nighter on a work day. I used to have a small handful of friends, but last year I've just kept losing them and not replacing them. Had one friend just completely cut me off, wont even respond my attempts to figure out what I did to rub him the wrong way considering we were really good friends for years. I've had 2 other friends end up moving out state, and another friend is still in the same state but now lives extremely far(like a 3 hour drive to just get there). If you haven't figured this out by now, I'm very socially inept and making friends isn't easy for me.  


Last few weeks I've been going to the rec center up the road to play some basketball. Growing up basketball was life to me, I had a little basketball court in my backyard. So I thought it would be a great idea, only cost 5 dollars to get in, gets me out of the house, something to do that I like, be a chance to meet people but it hasn't gone as well as I thought it would. Hardly any pickup games ever go on. I'll find like 1 pickup game for like every 3 days I go. And just shooting hoops for me gets boring after a couple hours. I normally will stay at least 5 hours to see if any games happen but I normally have fun shooting hoops for like 2 hours then I'm bored to tears for the last 3 and just wanna go home. Even when I do find pick up games the people in the games I wanna go out and try doing other things but money is really tight for me right now so it's really not that easy.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just looking for a way to cure my boredom and maybe make some new friends. Any feedback appreciated.",27Jan2019,1
51,"I have known this girl for years. She's a friend of a friend. I see her a handful of times each year at social gatherings. She's fun and all, but not someone I really have time for in my close circle. Not much in common etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, within the last year she fell in love with my best friend. He likes her as I do, a casual acquaintance, but nothing more. But she's obsessed with him. Messages him constantly.

&amp;#x200B;

I let her open up to me about her feelings for him and offered some advice to try and steer her away as I know he's not into her. The advice falls on deaf ears and months later she's still heavily messaging him.

&amp;#x200B;

Now she initiates contact with me often too. More often than I'm comfortable with. I reply when I can but it's just too much. I don't message my closest friends as much as she messages me and it's becoming annoying.

&amp;#x200B;

This is when I get pissed off.

&amp;#x200B;

Last month my best friend's mum passes away suddenly so of course he has a lot on his mind. She helps him with a few things but her attention towards him becomes more obsessive than usual. She's concerned for him but her concern becomes excessive. To the point where he needs to politely addresses it and ask her for space. She STILL doesn't back down.

&amp;#x200B;

As polite messages fall on deaf ears, I send her a heavy message asking her to back off. Not excessively rude, but very direct. I felt I needed to protect my friend. She backs down a bit but still persists.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today. I am also starting to enter a rough patch where important things in life need my attention meaning I don't have time or energy for close communication with her or any other fringe friends. I only have time for my small social group and they're all the support I need so I'm happy with that. She still messages me often and needs a lot of attention and I just don't have time to play friend anymore. I hardly reply and get reams of messages before offering basic replies.

&amp;#x200B;

So today I finally try to address it with her with complete honesty. For her same and mine.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Fringe friend attached to my buddy. Buddy not interested. She won't stop messaging him. Buddy's mother dies. He asks her to give him space. She doesn't. I let her have it. She still won't stop. Issues of my own. No time for this girl. Ask her to stop messaging me. Am I an asshole?

&amp;#x200B;

Me:

Hey. I'm sorry but I have a lot going on now and for the foreseeable  future and I don't have time to reply to your messages/calls or really be the friend/support you're looking for. I know you'd make a great/supportive friend if needed, and you're fun and sociable. But I just don't have time or energy for such a friendship at the moment. I have that relationship with the few close friends already in my life and honestly I have little time for them either right now. I just have too much going on.. I enjoy seeing you from time to time on a night out etc, otherwise my time is full. I don't want to offer a half assed attempt at a friendship as it's not fair on you. I hope this isn't hurtful for you. It's not intended that way. I like you, you're a great person. I just really have zero time at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

Her:

That‚Äôs ok I‚Äôm not going to lie I‚Äôm hurt cause \[HER BEST MALE FRIEND\] has told me he won‚Äôt ever speak to me again and asked me to never text or ring him again today.

\[He just had a bad break up with her best female friend causing a rift in the social group. He has also asked her explicitly for space.\]

&amp;#x200B;

Me:

Breakups are tough and it seems he needs space to suffer alone. Again, sorry I can't help. Nothing against you. I just don't have time. Many important things in my own life need all of my attention. But I wish you the best in making progress.

&amp;#x200B;

Her:

The thing is I want to help you I won‚Äôt talk about my own stuff if that means you will still be my friend

&amp;#x200B;

Me:

I don't need help, I need time. But thank you. I don't have time to commit to a friendship at the moment. I'm sorry.

&amp;#x200B;

Her:

Ok I‚Äôm really worried about you now

&amp;#x200B;

Me:

I'm just extremely busy.

&amp;#x200B;

Her:

Ok don‚Äôt know what to say really. Are you saying you don‚Äôt want to my friend at all? I only rang you today to see if you wanted to come out just wanted to see cause you have been away for ages

&amp;#x200B;

Me:

I don't have time for a close friend at the moment. If I see you on a night out or something as usual, cool. But all my time is taken elsewhere at the moment. I'm saying see you around.

&amp;#x200B;

Her:

Ok just feel this is my fault because I‚Äôve talked about \[MY BEST FREIND\] to much and I‚Äôm sorry

&amp;#x200B;

It's nothing to do with \[MY BEST FRIEND\].

&amp;#x200B;

Her:

Ok just feel it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve done and I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm still  friends with him. Or maybe I‚Äôm not I don‚Äôt know anymore. Just feel I‚Äôve annoyed everyone. all I can do is apologise. If the others don‚Äôt want to be friends with me either can you let me know. Can you please tell me if that‚Äôs the case because I don‚Äôt want to keep trying to be friends with people who don‚Äôt like me

&amp;#x200B;

Me:

I can't speak for anyone else. I just don't have time for a close friend at the moment. Or frequent messaging or advising you or meeting up etc. You're not the only person I'm pushing back. I don't have time for a lot of people at the moment. I have too much going on. l hardly have time for my closest friends because other things need my attention. I like you. So to see you out from time to time is cool. But I'm addressing it with you because you're quite sociable, chatty in text etc. I don't want to just ignore you. I'd rather be open about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Her:

But this makes me worry about you. I won‚Äôt be able to able to sleep cause I‚Äôm worried. I don‚Äôt even care if you hate me I just want you be ok

\[She worries about me landing on a flight etc or getting home OK when we're not close at all. I find it cloying. She's an extreme worrier.\]

&amp;#x200B;

Me:

I don't need you to worry. I need you to give me space as requested. Because you require too much attention and you're overly concerned. And I'm telling you, in respect to me, it's concern about nothing. I'm fine, I just don't have time for such a friend at the moment as explained. But thanks anyway. Don't make this about you. This is not about you. Nobody hates you.

&amp;#x200B;

Her:

I‚Äôm not making this about me. I just feel gutted because I thought we were better friends. That‚Äôs all

&amp;#x200B;

Me:

I'm sorry.

&amp;#x200B;

Her:

It‚Äôs fine

&amp;#x200B;

Her:

52,"I‚Äôm angrily and sadly typing this. My mom is in a hospital bed, and I don‚Äôt know how long she‚Äôll be there. I feel super sad, concerned, and even angry, angry at the universe, angry with myself. I shout ‚ÄúWhy does this have to happen to me?!‚Äù Throughout my life I‚Äôve always acted out of emotion, letting them guide my actions. I‚Äôve never had any self control. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do at this point. I feel super helpless. ",27Jan2019,1
53,"I‚Äôm a 23 year old female. I was born in the US, and am a US citizen but spent most of my life growing up abroad in the Middle East. I‚Äôve been here in the States the past 6 years and to be honest, lately I‚Äôve been wanting to return because I‚Äôve been feeling things haven‚Äôt been working out for me here. I don‚Äôt have relate substantial friendships, struggle to find permanent enjoyable unemployment, paying high rent etc. Whereas back home I would be living with my parents, wouldn‚Äôt have to pay high rent, and have my best friends there too. 

Until today when I found myself on a phone call with my parents. They were yelling at me about not finding a job and being ‚Äúlost‚Äù in America and how they want me to return. They said they don‚Äôt want me to be stressed anymore and want me to have a relaxed life. After that phone call, I started having second doubts about returning. While I do love my parents I feel this is more about control than anything. What if I return and they don‚Äôt let me come back? How will I make enough money there to buy a ticket home if I needed it?

Although, they have gotten old and would allow me more freedom. They were liberal enough to send me to study here in the States which is rare with Arab parents. Yet, this phone call with them made me have second thoughts about what it‚Äôd be like to return to the Middle East especially as a woman. 

Does anyone have any insight into my situation?  I‚Äôm so conflicted on this, I don‚Äôt know what to do. Thanks so much in advance. ",27Jan2019,1
54,Hey guys I'm 17 and also a male. I need some suggestions since my current routines have very little effect. I don't know how to come up with a diet plan and I need more work outs since my current ones hasn't been resulting the best results. I'm not overweight but I'm not really fit either like last year. ,27Jan2019,1
55,"Recently I decided that I wanted to be a medical professional when I'm older. I realized that after being in Anatomy &amp; Physiology and discovered I loved learning about stuff like the human body and how it functions. Biology and Chemistry are also my favorite subjects. I'm generally a science-focused person.

Anyway, I have one problem that's keeping from fully comitting to this dream - I have a tendency to stop working when things get hard. This is because I was raised being praised for my intelligence and how I could 'naturally figure things out'. Of course, that resulted in a mindset that if I don't get things right the first time, I'm not worthy to do it at all.

I was planning on volunteering at the hospital this summer to get an idea of what it's like (I have to apply and be accepted first, though).

I guess my question is: **How do I move past these feelings and what's the best move for me to make right now?**

I'm a 16F Junior in HS btw.

56,"I'm a high school senior. I had this bad misunderstanding with a teacher yesterday that I feel really bad about. I'd been talking to some friends, venting about my parents- how my parents control where I can go or what I eat. My teacher was in the classroom and had asked me about it, telling me that my mom seemed unusually strict since I'm basically an adult. Then, I told my friends that my mom's dad used to beat her with a rod in China (I'm Chinese American) and I saw my teachers face and realized she thought I was implying that I was beaten too (that they were slightly abusive)- kind of like justification. But that's not what I meant- I just was trying to say that people have it much worse, and I can't tell my mom to stop being strict when her dad was really, really bad. My parents are strict, in a way that most Chinese parents are- straight As expected, need permission before I go anywhere, etc, and while they occasionally slapped me lightly, it wasn't really bad, it barely hurt at all. I'm just a really sensitive person and can get overly intense or melodramatic because I get angry even when my parents are fairly reasonable.  My parents are really nice, just a tiny bit strict, and while they do use ""Asian style parenting"" that isn't as condoned in the US, I have a normal childhood. Chinese parents are just more likely to use light corporeal punishment and can be harsher verbally- it's cultural. But my friends told me my teacher seemed worried. She's the best teacher I've ever had and I'm so scared that I made her worry but I can't explain this to her next week because it looks even worse. I feel like I'm this lying kid looking for attention and worrying others to get attention and it's stressing me out and I don't know why I even care that much...

Maybe this is a rant. I just feel awful and like a lying attention-seeking person",27Jan2019,1
57,"So, my father recently passed away and it was recommended by her grief therapist that she not live alone, so I told her to come move in with me until she felt comfortable living alone.

Well I'm a working man, I work 8am -6pm. I wake up every day at 7am to prepare for work, or I used to. 

Now I'm woken up at 5am everyday because she refuses to use her hearing aid and cranks the TV in the guest room well for now her room up to basically levels that could damage your hearing if you don't have hearing issues.

I have asked her not to do this, and well she told me ""it helps me cope"". I asked her to put her hearing aid in, she said ""That reminds me too much of your father to use"" Which the hearing aid thing is just an excuse not to use it.

So I'm woken up way before I need to be.

Now stretching out to the few other things. She will constantly just leave dirty plates and trash around the house. I have asked her to at the very least to put it in the kitchen where the cats can't get it. She won't, she'll leave it on the living room table or dining room table, I've found my cats eating her food she didn't eat, it's not healthy at all for them but so far no damage has been done to the cats. Not to mention she lets it stack up in her room, and the smell is awful. She's been here a week and her room looks like it hasn't been cleaned in a month, and she won't let me in there to clean it because ""The trash allows me to block out bad thoughts"".

The final thing is, she usually goes to bed after me, and she will leave the front door open and unlocked because she smokes. Now, my cats will not go outside which I am not worried about, the one time they got out, the grass scared them which I found funny but also good they won't make a break for it. 

But we've had a recent string of break ins and what's an easier target than a house with a open door? 

I have told her many times it's not safe to leave the door unlock and she goes into stereotypical old person mode ""Well back when I was your age we left our doors unlocked and nothing ever happened."" 

I've talked to her therapist about all this and they literally told me I would have to deal with it and she'll get better with time.

I'm at my wits end here, I can't tell her off because she's my mother, but honestly, I could grab my cats and leave and stay at her house and let her stay at my house if the therapist didn't recommend someone be with her.",27Jan2019,1
58,"so I have a friend who‚Äôs a compulsive cheater, him and his girlfriend have been together for a few years (we‚Äôre in high school), and he‚Äôs done stuff with multiple girls while they were together, including losing his virginity to another girl and then having sex with her multiple times, and a couple incidents where he‚Äôs kissed me at parties (I feel insanely guilty about it, but more on that later). A few of my friends and I found out that he‚Äôd been having sex with this girl (one of our other friends, she eventually left for college as she‚Äôs older than us) and we were going to give him the option to tell his girlfriend about it or we were going to tell her. 

Eventually he got word of this plan before it took place and broke up with her without telling her what he had done. Directly after they broke up I had some sort of relationship with him, we were pretty much dating but we never really talked about what it was and kept it a secret from our friends, as I‚Äôm kind of known as an innocent little sister to most of them because I‚Äôm 1-2 years younger (we‚Äôre all in high school, and the boy in question is only a grade above me).

I told myself that it was just for fun, and that I could never actually have a serious relationship with him because he‚Äôs not that great of a person and I‚Äôd just get hurt in the end, but I ended up developing feelings for him and I didn‚Äôt realize this until it was too late.

after a few months of our little thing, he texted me to tell me that he had to end it because he realized that he was still in love with his girlfriend and had to go back to her. He apologized and said that I mean a lot to him, but this is something he had to do. It hurt to read but I knew there was nothing I could say that would stop them from getting back together without ruining our friendship, so I told him it was ok, no hard feelings, and wished him well.

It‚Äôs been a few months since they‚Äôve been back together and seeing it hurts a lot. Not only do I feel guilty and anxious around her for doing stuff with her boyfriend, guilt that I admit I deserve, but I just feel genuinely bad because she‚Äôs so in love with him and has no idea what he‚Äôs done. I haven‚Äôt heard of him doing anything after they‚Äôve gotten back together, so what if he‚Äôs changed? Do I tell her? And if so, how can I do it without him finding out it‚Äôs me?

I don‚Äôt know what to do, but thanks for listening. I know that this all sounds like stupid high school drama and that I come across as a terrible person and a flaming whore, I‚Äôm just really stuck and I have no idea what to do.",27Jan2019,1

Whenever we do talk in those classes or in the hallways I make her laugh but I don't get to see her at parties or other outer school functions because I don't get invited/ don't really want to go. I'm also very unconfident and beta so cant just approach her and ask her out besides I don't even think she likes me. How do I further our relationship and do you have any other advice? Much appreciated! (btw I'm not extremely attractive but I'm not ugly as I take care of myself well by going to the gym 4 times a week and playing football).

61,"TL;DR at end

My younger sister, let's call her B, is 12 and in 7th grade. Up until this school year she's had a solid group of friends who she hung out with consistently. She's been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder since 3rd grade and was diagnosed again last year. 

Her friends were very loving and supportive until they got to 7th grade. A girl, let's call her M, transferred to my sister's school and started hanging out with my sister's friend group. At this point, nothing is wrong and the group goes to get coffee or boba tea a few times a week. 

The bullying (though I say that's simplifying it) started in December. Around the beginning of the month, M started to pick on B and her best friend, G. At this point it was minor stuff, like being unnecessarily sarcastic. Over the last 2 months, however, it's gotten much worse. M made friends with 2 other girls, N and T. My sister knew N from elementary school and therefore knew she had a history of lying. T had been in the friend group and my mom had even given her a ride home as we live near each other. The three would exclude B and her best friend, and be nasty both over text and in person. This gave my sister pretty bad anxiety, so she naturally tried to talk to M, N and T. 

This is when it got particularly bad. I wouldn't hesitate to say they were gaslighting her. They told her she was overreacting and that 'anxiety isn't an excuse.' This infuriated me. They were telling her that the mental disorder she had been struggling with isn't real/isn't as serious as it actually is. She's now scared of bringing her emotional problems to her friends in fear of being called 'dramatic.' B stressed every night over this. She's been crying every night in dread of going to school. 

Everything came to a head when M, N, and T try to make B and G not sit with them at lunch. This might not sound like a huge deal but to a 12 year old it definitely is.  They told everyone on a group chat to not let B and G sit with them the following Monday. A reliable friend took screenshots and showed B and G. They tried to confront M, N and T, but naturally were criticized for 'causing drama.' As far as my sister knew, they were all going to shun her on Monday, leaving her to stress over it all weekend. 

She tries to ask her other friends to stand up for her, but they're conflicted as they don't want to 'take sides.' This probably means they don't want M, N and T to shift their focus to them and start bullying them.

Nothing came of this particular incident, but B's anxiety got crippling. It made her unable to do homework or even think about school. My mom got my sister to see a therapist after winter break and talked to the principal. Therapy worked for a while, but eventually nothing was changing and she got frustrated. The principal is very understanding and makes the kids take counseling. M and T think it's all a big joke and N doesn't go at all. 

Everything's calmer now but my sister's still having breakdowns almost every day. It's painful to listen to. I don't know what I can do to help her. I've tried telling my friends but they think I'm exaggerating, with me being the type of person to not take things seriously. I don't think they know I'm actually serious about this. I don't want to tell them B has an anxiety disorder and risk her privacy for that matter.

M, N, and T aren't trying to exclude B and G anymore, but the situation's shaken her entire friend group. Friendships she's had since 3rd grade are almost ruined, and B now worries that all her friends secretly hate her. 

While I'm writing this, B is getting ready to go to her friend's bat mitzvah and will have to act like she's happy in front of all of her friends, when she was actually sobbing just an hour before because she dreaded seeing M, N, and T there. 

I don't know how to help her with this. I don't have anxiety and my friends have never caused drama like this. The most I've done is tried to ask my friends, which didn't work, and give her small advice which didn't help her at all.

TL;DR: My sister, who has an anxiety disorder, is being gaslighted by her 'friends' telling her her feelings aren't valid and that she's 'creating drama' by telling them her feelings. She's having breakdowns almost every day and I don't know what to do. Please tell me how I can help her.",27Jan2019,1
62,"ive been told that internet ppl  hold me back from living a full life but i just find ppl irl boring and idk how to change that plus by having autism i cant be friends with the ppl i want as i dont have the social capacity to be. How/What do i do?

Honestly before i turned to the internet, I had two close friends, one at age 16-18 (we spent like a day together every 2 weeks for 3 months) and one at age 20-21 (we walked every night for an hour for like 5-6 months and spent some weekends) i have destroyed both of them when they became boring and then decided that real life friendship sucks (cause my two close friends became boring, what more can you want than close friends???, so i wasnt allowed friends anymore,)

Im an attention whore and a whiny fuck, ive been like this for on the Internet 10 years, only talking to different people (taking a break in 2011-12 to try an foundation course to cultural sciences at uni) and generally not being interested in the world around me but in the Internet.

Idk why im like this, internet is just easier, you can put it off for a few days and it doesnt need constant attention.

But what has been said to me makes total sense. Yes i want real ppl rather than internet ppl but i dont want to settle for meh people but thats all i can get so ive stopped looking irl but what has been said to me makes so much sense, im honestly wondering why i talk to ppl at all cause internet ppl are amazing but not real and real people are boring, so i honestly dont know what to do right now? cause i know internet ppl never become real but real people are just not interesting to me???

can you please, please, please help me?

65,"My girlfriend and I have been dating since the Summer of 2016. This summer will mark three amazing years with her. We first met when we were both in high school, and fast forward nearly three years later, we are living together and building a life together. I love this girl dearly, and am happy with our relationship. There is only one main problem. My best friend of nearly ten years has become a strain on our relationship. 

It really all started a couple years back, when we had first started dating. He had just gotten out of a toxic relationship where he had been cheated on, and around the same time I had just entered a happy relationship.  My current girlfriend and him had ‚Äútalked‚Äù much prior to us even meeting, therefore before I moved forward with officially dating her, I asked him if he was comfortable. He assured me it was 100% okay and that they literally talked and hung out once and it wasn‚Äôt even a bother, even told me he was happy for me. This lasted maybe four months. Eventually I began to notice his jealousy, he began insulting my girlfriend to me, and eventually to her. I am not talking petty insults, he really crossed the line. He called her a ‚Äústupid bitch,‚Äù a ‚Äúcontrolling cunt,‚Äù a ‚Äúfat cow‚Äù etc. He even got to a point where he threatened to physically assault her after doxxing her and finding out where she lived. He is a computer hacker so he also took the time to hack both of our social media accounts and lock us out just to fuck with us.  It was pretty bad for a good amount of time. Not sure why he was ever this angry, but regardless I cut him off for like a year. 

Come a year later, I had realized something that everyone had been telling me for years, that my best friend was a manipulative narcissist. But he was still my best friend, so I tried to make it work with him. Nearly a year later, he apologized all while telling us he was just a very angry person at the time and should never have acted the way he did to someone who was basically his brother. So we gave him another chance, my girlfriend and I both forgave him and allowed him to slowly enter our lives again. From the time we made up until right now there have still been many instances of ‚Äúsorry‚Äù from him, just less important things than the first time. Regardless I have heard sorry one hundred fucking times from this guy. In that one year apart my friend had became addicted to opiates. It became all he would ever talk about. Getting high on oxy, heroin, pills etc. was the only thing that he revolved his life around. We were 18 years old at this point, while the rest of us were working long hours, and paying bills, and building our lives he was focused on getting high and buying drugs on the dark web. Eventually it became an actual problem that I was forced to confront, he had overdosed a handful of times already and still showed no signs of wanting to quit. Eventually his addiction made him violent and aggressive to his own family and they decided to kick him out. 

My friend worked as a part time cook at a bar, and found a co-worker who was also fellow drug user, and stayed with since he had been kicked out. Knowing the circumstances made me really sad. I didn‚Äôt want to see him living with a fellow addict. I didn‚Äôt want to wake up one day to find out he was dead. This dude had been like my brother since we were 11 years old. Therefore I reached out to him and gave him an idea. I told him I would let him stay in my home with my girlfriend and I for one single month, with the ultimatum he checks himself into rehab after the month had ended. His parents are very wealthy, therefore he had great healthcare, so he had complete access to get clean. I told him the one rule was to try and not use in my home when he was living there. Him being homeless, he agreed. I even told him he could smoke cigarettes and weed all he wanted, just no hard shit. He agreed, and I felt that was a good compromise.

He had recently been prescribed to suboxone, a drug that would help him quit craving opiates. He promised me he was taking it, eventually I found out he was lying to me and taking it very little, so he could continue using behind my back. The time he was there, he snorted and shot up cocaine, was smoking oxy off tinfoil, and had bought morphine pills on the dark web and was shooting them up when I was at work. Then when I was at work he overdosed in my house, and luckily was able to make it to the hospital in time to survive. Before he got back to my house, I began packing his stuff up because he had crossed the line, completely lied to me, manipulated me, and used me. When packing, I found some needles, cotton, and measuring cup he was cooking his drugs in. When he got back, I had my girlfriend hide in the bathroom out of fear he would violently lash out due to the drugs he was on. I finally got him to leave, and had yet to hear see him for weeks. I remained a friend to him via social media, because I still cared for him and his sobriety. I was just done enabling him. 

He eventually committed himself to inpatient rehab. It seemed like things were going uphill finally. Until about a week in that is. After seven days he had managed to get kicked out for apparently ‚Äúvoicing his opinion that opiates should be legal.‚Äù As if he wasn‚Äôt aware that would get him booted. It is fucking drug rehab, what did he think was going to happen? So he got out, and to no surprise I found out has continued using. Pretty sure him committing himself was just a ploy to please those around him like me, his parents, and his girlfriend. He never wanted to get clean, he told me that, even when he was living with me he told me he would go, but didn‚Äôt want to get clean, and believed he would be using for the rest of his life and was okay with that. So I am sure was elated when he was discharged. Fast forward about a month, we got in a small argument via Facebook Messenger over a post that was made, it really was a pointless argument, probably never needed to even happen. How my girlfriend was brought up? I have no idea. But before I know it, he was back to calling her a manipulative cunt, a stupid bitch, told her she deserves no respect, and basically said he owed her no appreciation for letting him live in her home for a month. All this new anger stemmed from the fact that he blamed my girlfriend for him being kicked out for breaking our rules, he had the audacity to blame her for being kicked out of my house. He didn‚Äôt acknowledge he broke OUR rules, and was using on our premises and lying to us, but instead blamed it all on her, telling me that my relationship was shit. Telling me that if I wasn‚Äôt with her those rules never would have been implemented. Zero responsibility for his own actions, and zero accountability for anything.  He was also very upset that my girlfriend didn‚Äôt want me to smoke weed with him every single night, something I had agreed to do in moderation prior to him living there.

I have had him cut off for over a week now. Now just recently he is using a situation he is in to try and get us to hang out again. Because he is caught up with the law he wants to ‚Äúmeet up in person‚Äù continuously to talk about it telling me ‚Äúusing messages is too dangerous because it can be subpoenaed in court.‚Äù He could be facing prison time at this point, the crimes he committed are federal crimes and highly illegal. I don‚Äôt want to be involved with it at all. I don‚Äôt want to be involved with him anymore. I don‚Äôt want this fucking narcissist to continue to walk all over me like a doormat. I have let him do it for too long, and I really do feel that cutting him off for good is what is best for me right now. He is no longer someone I even know, he has turned into a complete narcissist, a drug addict, a manipulative person, and a complete roadblock in my relationship. Do you know how many times the subject of the arguments with my girlfriend involve him? Too many. We aren‚Äôt little kids anymore, situations change and so do people. I want feedback. Rarely have I had a third party in any of this, because it is always between him and I, and maybe my girlfriend when it involves her. I want to hear an unbiased opinion on my situation, how the fuck do eradicate this person from my life for good? ",27Jan2019,1

69,"To begin with, i should give you the setting. Since the 1st grade of elementary school i have forged a friendship with two twins (girls) and on other guy (let's call him Jake). All four (including me) where very close friends till high school, we share many mutual friends and our parents are very good friends too. In middle school me and the twins went in a different school from Jake

So the problem starts this week. We went on a school trip abroad starting at the beggining of the week. The hotel we happened to be accomodated to, wasn't very good but it was descent and also the dinner wasn't good at all. As usual most of the time i spent there was with the twins (Jake wasn't there cause he ain't in our school) . The twins especially the first daya were complaining usually about the food. Keep that in mind. Despite that the rest of the trip flowed vert well andwe had a very good time

Now we come to the last day of the trip. As we are on the bus and heading towards the airport the one twin (lets call her Liz) starting crying. She was crying mostly because the trip had come to an end. So after some time had passed trying to calm her down a girl from the front seat told her ""You didn't had a good time at all ,why are you crying?"". Then i immediately say ""Lets not spend our last moments of the trip arguing"" but as appeared this is ecxactly what happened.

Few minutes later we are waiting on the line to get our tickets. I was in the front ,the girl and the twins were on the back. Things then escalted and an other very close friend of mine was backing up the girl and stared arguing with the twins too. They were shouting but i couldn't hear what they were saying.

So a few moments later we are on the duty-free and i'm buying stuff when i saw the twins coming to me.  The moment they reached me Liz (which has stopped crying) was about to tell me what happened. Before she even told her first word i say ""I don't want to talk about the issue"" and then immediately she stared crying again and left. 

Now it's today, one day after the incident. The four of us were invited in a party and we were all present. Liz didn't talked to me but her sister did. But the most important things is that Jake told me (which he had talked to Liz) that things from tommorow won't ever be the same.

Tommorow i'll probably have talk with Liz about what happened. I do not want that much to be back together cause she treated her other friends in a very bad way behind their back during the trip. And the idea if creating a diatance had passed through my mind many times before and during the trip. Also i should mention that i have overheared Jake and Liz talking behing my back and i have discovered that the had hang out multiple times while all three had told me they were staying home. 

So the advice i need is hiw to behave and what to tell tommorow. The most important thing to me is to be ethically correct. Also are there any phycological tricks for helping reinforcing my arguements? And also a question for you guys was it very bad what i did?

Sorry for the long post and my bad english ,any advice will be hugely appreciated!!! :)

70,Whenever I ask my friends to hangout they always say they are busy or can't and ive tried everything from setting up a time or asking them the day before and they always reject me but then I see their Snapchat story and there I see them hanging out. What makes this hard for me is I go to a small school and so there aren't many groups of people and the other groups I don't fit into at all. And so this is the only group I'm kinda a part of but I just sit at the table during lunch basically alone because they are all friend with each other. I used to be really good friends with them but after freshman year they stopped inviting me to stuff and basically ignore me. I really don't know what to do at this point and it has basically made me depressed because i am super nice to people but it seems no one wants to be my friend. ,27Jan2019,1
71,"Hi! 

Thank you for taking the time to read this post and give me some insight on my situation.

So roughly two weeks ago when I was on GSP in New Jersey, I hit a medium sized pot hole with my 09 Civic and it caused my car to swerve out of control and caused some serious damages. The front and back bumpers probably needs to be replaced along with two rims and front crash bar being bent. That‚Äôs just the extent of damages that I can immediately diagnose.Thankfully, I am alright and got away with not a single scratch. 

I thought about getting the repairs but I am worried the repair cost will exceed the value of the car. The car was in great condition before the accident with only about 75k miles when I got it from my mom. I have Geico for insurance and will be calling them to see if they can have someone to assess the damages. 

Is there anything that I should be watching out for when calling the insurance? This is my first accident so I want to be sure that I am covering all grounds in solving this issue.

Thanks in advance!",27Jan2019,1
72,"Hey guys! I'll get straight to the point, I would like to ask for some insight, be it in the form of hate or advice, I'll take any new point of view into my psyche.

 I find it extremely difficult to find things to keep me satisfied for long periods of time. I'll address that 'Boredom' is such a privileged problem to have, that people would trade anything to be in a position where the only worry is boredom and yes I do feel grateful for my life, I do cherish it, so I understand there must be some problem with my outlook in that I always feel unsatisfied.

 For some quick background, I am 18 years old and have only started college, this does make me naive I know. I find as though my days are being wasted, either studying or spending time with my friends there is still an empty feeling, I find the end goal of my studies as menial, a good degree for a good job ( I come from a well off family so I never had to worry about money or take a part time job, so once again I do see how this could be the most spoiled thing you will read). I've never had a significant other, only dated once but for a day, as after weeks of excitement from texting I was suddenly overwhelmed by painful boredom of spending time with this person (this is a recurring theme with my interactions with people, I think this might suggest I am too self centered? as I subconsciously see them as a means of entertainment? but I'm not so sure as I do value them genuinely).

I find myself losing interest in things very quickly, uni life has gotten dull in just over a semester, the parties, the clubs, TV shows, books, games, I somehow managed to convince myself I have seen everything that could ever excite me if I stay in this place, this place referring to my planned out uni life to job. 

Where my head is at right now is that I need to make a drastic change to bring the life back to me, I often daydream about not simply travelling but taking up a new life altogether somewhere foreign, but I doubt that would solve anything. Alternatively I think I may be able to give myself some sort of satisfaction If I did something productive such as volunteering or maybe a business, but my cynical side emerges and I always convince myself the pointlessness. I think maybe its the lack of any hardship that I feel so 'bored'? Haven't had to work a day in my life, loving friends and family, no losses of loved ones, I lack perspective and I feel lost as to how to gain any. 

I have brought this up with friends recently and main theme that I take away is that I should just try to live a happy good life, but this problem seems hardwired, anyways thank you again for reading, I am totally open to any criticism or advice so please don't hold back!",27Jan2019,1

74,"  Probably a long post, but hey, it's my first one. Obligatory apology for any formatting errors.

 This is very difficult for me to vent to a bunch of strangers, but I'm so uncomfortable explaining this to people I know (parents excluded), and I hate talking about it. I'm 18, turning 19 soon. Growing up my entire dream was to join the US Air Force. My father served, and his before him. After high school ended, I completed a semester of college locally and I absolutely hated it. I knew I had to get my degree, but I decided I didn't want to do it in my home state, and I'd rather get it in the Air Force. After meeting with a recruiter, going through the process of getting all these medical records, things began to look grim for me. I was the perfect candidate. I've never touched a drug, I don't drink, and I've kept my body as completely healthy as I possibly could. As a child, however, I was diagnosed with asthma by my pediatrician. Now I'm not one to argue with the Doc, but it just didn't seem right. I have never, not once, had suffered an asthma attack or any issues related to the disease. The only way I could see myself joining is if I hadn't had been prescribed Albuterol ( or any asthma related medicine/inhaler) in the last five years or I haven't had any issues since I was 13. 

 The big issue with that is that I *was* prescribed Albuterol, when I was 14, 15, and 17. I was prescribed when I was 14 and 15 for soccer (No attacks or issues with asthma, it was precautionary for my parents). When I was 17, however, I had a bad cough (chest cold?) and was prescribed the medicine. This gutted me. My mother called my pediatricians office and they said that they believe I had ""chronic bronchiolitis"", which from my understanding is treated the exact same way as asthma, or at least that's how I was treated. I was devastated to hear this. My mother set up an appointment with a pulmonologist (a month from now) to once and for all decide what the issue is and get a true diagnosis, but obviously my hopes aren't high.

 This has taken a massive toll on me emotionally. I may not be able to serve because of something completely out of control, and that's what hurts the most. My plan was to serve, get my education, get experience, and become a police officer after I serve. I love the idea of an investigative job and being able to serve people. Now, however, I'm not even sure I want to pursue a career in the Criminal Justice field. This event has made me just rethink everything that I could want, I may even consider changing my CRJ major to something else, more financially beneficial to me in the future, as I know CRJ jobs don't pay much. I've always had a strong attraction to all things eSport related, and have been considering changing my major to something valuable pertaining to that field. My hope is that in the next few years as I complete school, eSports will have more open and available jobs as growth in the field has been increasing in recent ones. Most eSports positions do require certain degrees/experience, but I know if I'm dedicated enough I could do it. 

 So, my question to you Reddit is: How should I proceed? I skipped this semester of school so I am able to return in late August. What would you do? Is pursuing eSport related fields just a pipe dream?

TLDR: I more than likely can't pursue my original career choice due to a disease out of my control, and may have to shift my whole life around.

Any feedback appreciated.",27Jan2019,1

I have no idea what the fallout was about but at 21 I'm trying to make an effort to reach out to them and get to know them - often get into a Facebook conversation with them and say the whole 'we should meet up soon' and it rarely happens.

My grandparents (dad's side) travel a lot so it's difficult to see them regularly but it's difficult to get that familiarity or pin them down for attending my wedding. My grandparents said not to mention I was my dad's daughter if I ever got to meet the extended family and still will not tell me what the fall out was about. So there's some history that no one is telling me about but still affects me.

77,"Hey reddit. I could use your feed back on a somewhat unusual situation I have found myself in. 

Here is some background information that‚Äôs important to understand the situation:

- my grandpa is very wealthy 

- I am very close to my grandparents

- My grandma lives with my grandpa and my mom, step dad and I live only a few miles away. 

- I am a full time student 

So this year has been very rough on my family, specifically for my grandma, who turned 80, broke her hip over Christmas, had an ulcer in her throat and has been in and out of hospitals and rehabs almost constantly sense September. She can‚Äôt walk, cook, clean, use the bathroom or really do anything while her hip heels. 

So my grandparents obviously need a lot of extra help. They hired some outside nurses who do a good job but our very expensive, and they asked me if I could take over as their part time nurse for half the price.

They offered me 20 dollars an hour 12-16 hours a week, which is way better than my old job even though the hours are cut in half. 

My mom dosent see a problem with it and it would help take a load off her sense she‚Äôs been working full time and going up there every night. My step dad dosent see a problem with it, my grandparents don‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt know it just feels kind of morally wrong.

I ensured them I would still spend time with them outside of working for them as I do usually. 

It‚Äôs just I feel like I should be taking care of them on top of work and school but I just don‚Äôt have time. This keeps me employed and them taken care of and it works for everyone, it just feels kind of dirty and morally wrong.

What do you think reddit? Do you think it‚Äôs morally wrong to take care of your grandparents or any member of your family,  for monetary purposes?

81,"I'm 18 and a uni student in the UK. This story is definitely going to be too much info but I need to vent and I don't want to talk to anyone close about it till I go to the doctor.

I got home from work today (~20 minute cycle) and noticed my shall we say manhood area was hurting a little. I figured I just bumped the boys on the seat a little as it gets bumpy in places on my route and it happens occasionally. Then like an hour later I went for a walk and noticed it was still hurting which is unusual. I get pains there sporadically but never think much of it as it almost always passes.

So I got home and figured I'd have check up. I've never done a proper check since I'm 18 I never figured I was at risk for that sort of stuff. Now I'm going to go into detail here since I don't know how else to put it. My immediate notice was that lefty was hanging back a bit more than usual and didn't seem to be oriented correctly shall we say. I also felt around gently and noticed a lump on one side that I've never noticed before. The pain went away but the dread didn't. I checked later and was sure that I found a smaller lump on the other side. Now I'm not here asking for medical advice because my mind is already racing through the worst case scenario of finding a lump.

I registered with my university doctor and am going to book an appointment but they were closed by the time I got home from work and they're closed tomorrow (Sunday) so I can't book an appointment till Monday morning. Now I don't think (touch wood) that anything awful is going to happen between now and when I get my appointment but I don't know how to calm myself down. 

I guess I'm anxious I don't know how to describe it I'm constantly racing between thinking it's the worst case scenario, thinking its nothing. Thinking I should ring my family and ask them, thinking I should wait till after my appointment.

It's now 2am and I'm sat up just trying to watch TV and chill and I can't. I'm 18 surely I shouldn't be worrying about this stuff. I don't think I'm going to be able to sleep tonight. I've got a lot of work to do for Monday but I don't think I'm going to do any of it I just need to occupy myself until I can get this appointment booked.

Sorry for the ramble I don't even know if this is the right sub. I just need to get a human response about this and don't know how to bring it up to my gf/dad/anyone else in the family. ",27Jan2019,1
82,"(Im going to my big trip with my friend who Ik for many years, and lately, me and him, we rarely talk too, this sudden changed happened, so I'm  rather anxious about the trip with an additional 3rd party to the group.)

 Im really anxious about my trip next month that my guy pal who ik for a long time that he an I planned and agreed, that I come along the trip, just the two of us, instead of letting it be like last time; my bro, him, and I.

But the thing is- a sudden change in plans occured, my dude is bringing his gf over and thought itd be fine if she came a long, like no questions asked and think it'd be fine. 

No discussion, nothing! It immediately setted me off guard and anxious about who this person is that he never told me. 

I immediately got anxious,  even to a point of an anxiety attack over it. 

After my narc abuse over the summer, I feel like I'm not ready to trust people, myself, my friends or strangers, not after what i went through.

I seriously wondered if my guy pal knows what i am going through, mentally and emotionally. 

(Maybe I'm not ready for the trip.. I- I don't know.)


We agreed to talk it out before the trip for me to get to know her and maybe befriend her. 

I do trust my friend, but not some stranger who he personally knows, but after my narc abuse over Aug. Im worried that I'll fk things up over me an my pals friendship, even my many ""what ifs"" scenerios over what could happen at the trip as well. 
Or that he'll choose her instead of me, etc etc.

 What should i do?",27Jan2019,1
83,"Okay so, I'm 16 and I've narrowed down a few car choices for myself currently. Given I need something reliable, I went with either Toyota or Honda (I'm also a Japanese car fan personally). And seeing as those are the two preferable brands, I went with these vehicles:

Honda Civic Hatchback ('91-'99)

Toyota 4runner ('84-'89)

Toyota Celica or Corolla (Again, all gens)

Now seeing as I'm obviously ""not"" a fanboy of Toyota, I'd want something of the brand that speaks to me, which is why I chose these cars. All of which I aim to use for reliability, driving experience, and potential modification. Given the aftermarket scenes for all of these cars listed are fairly sizable, I've had difficulty choosing. The 4runner for me is the big ""Should I or shouldn't I,"" because of the 4wd and offroad capabilities, versus the speed and handling of the other cars listed. So, the big question is, which one of these cars should I get? Any ideas?",27Jan2019,1

86,"So during the first month or so of 1st year College about 5 people including myself (all guys) made friends with one another, we‚Äôre not all on the same course, but we all got along pretty well, went out drinking pretty often and generally we had a great time. 

Then one of the guys met a girl on his course, and he invited her along once or twice which was cool, we all wanted to meet her but we quickly realised she wasn‚Äôt our type, none of us in the group really liked her that much, but they were pretty much dating at this point so we were cool with her coming out now and then. 

But she was the only girl in the group, i guess she felt kind of left out because one night she brought along 3 other girls with her without letting us know, which was a bit surprising. Once again, they just weren‚Äôt our type, none of us really knew them before this but we understood she wanted another girl in the group, they just weren‚Äôt for us. 

But now they‚Äôre always out. They just turn up to every event, uninvited and she doesn‚Äôt seem to care. They even turned up when we attempted to organise a guys night out, specifically with just the original 5. 

I guess what i‚Äôm trying to ask is what kind of approach should we take to this? I know the guy would be pretty upset if we straight up told him none of us liked her and to stop inviting her but nights out are way less enjoyable and we all just want it to be like old times. We also want the guy to keep coming out with us but its like walking on thin ice.

88,"TLDR at the bottom. 

I‚Äôm 17, Detroit Michigan and I wanna do a part time job so I‚Äôm not a burden to my parents. Now we are not In IMMEDIATE need of me start working. Both my parents work hard and just want me to stay out of it till I‚Äôm old enough. Fuck I‚Äôm 17 I don‚Äôt wanna ask them for money every time. They don‚Äôt want me to work because am not the most physically fit person. I‚Äôm literal skin and bones and they feel like it‚Äôs their job to help me focus on my studies and have a good future. They feel me working might ruin everything they‚Äôv for me. (Like Moving to America for better opportunities)

Now I‚Äôm pretty smart at school and no one ever has to supervise any of my school stuff. They just expect an A. I  want to buy stuff like games, ps4 pc and other stuff that u want when ur young. But if any ask that shit to ur parent every time when ur a grown ass kid. We are from lower middle class. 

Now the first ‚Äújob‚Äù was at this acquaintance of my dads. U see my dad isn‚Äôt the best guy for negotiation. He never spoke about the money or pay or anything. He said I want to work. This place was like a ticket booking place for people who can‚Äôt do it at home. I work there 8 hours a day, a whole week. Ma man hands me $25. I‚Äôm dumbfounded. Never went back.

Next place, at this fast food place. My moms bosses second establishment. Now u see, u need to be 18 to work there. I just turned 17. We are immigrants so we use our language in private conversation. My mom told her boss , in our language, *im running 18*. It‚Äôs a way of saying I finished 17 and on the way to 18. But I can see how it‚Äôs confusing right. She kicks ma dumbass out after 2 days of hardcore training. OMAGWAAAD.  I was sooo done. Imagine memorizing 50 menu items, trying to learn how to stand in boiling heat, and talk to high customers. 

Now after that, it was this small super market in Detroit. It‚Äôs next to my moms workplace. THEY CALL HER OJ MY INTERVIEW. SHE FORGETS ABOUT IT FOR 2 DAYS AND THEN WE FIND OUT ITS GONE. honestly this was going to be the easiest one. A.C stay blowing, inactive ass place just put ur headphones in n get the checks. But fuck my luck. 

THEN at this GHETTO ass fucking fast food place called church and chicken. Omfg. The most UNPROFESSIONAL bitches on earth. It‚Äôs my training day. The boss picks me up with 5 people crammed up in his car. Ok not the best feeling in the world but there hope. I walk in, taken to the back door to their work space. MA GUY LEAVES ME AT THE DOOR FOR A GOOD 15 MIN. M just waiting there . Some female worker asks me if I‚Äôm the new guy they were expecting. I said ya. Then she started showing how stuff is run here. THE WHOLE TOME M HERE THINKING SO MA GUY THE DAMN BOSS LEFT ME AT THE DOOR and FORGIT EVERYTHING ABOUT IT. After like half an hour the boss comes to the back from the counter is like, ay kiddo so how‚Äôs this going. U think u up to it. Ma face. Ohh. Ooof. I just said ya it‚Äôs all good. I stayed there till 2 am from 3pm. Can u imagine first time ever and my luck. U see usually we close at 11. But it was that one day of the month when u dismantle every thing in the kitchen and clean everything. Wow. Stayed there till 2am. I did EVERYTHING anyone else there has done. At lest even once. On top of that, they have no schedule for breaks or anything. You eat when there‚Äôs no one at the counter. And no staff room. Not even a damn table to eat food at. U just eat. U never sit anywhere. M done never came back.

Hello r/Advice, so as you can read from the title, I caught my 16-year old brother masturbating. I‚Äôm posting from a throwaway account since my family knows my regular account.

Anyway, this just happened last night. I went to my brother‚Äôs room to tell him that I‚Äôll be sleeping early and asked him what time he‚Äôll sleep too. However, upon going to his room, I noticed the door was locked and there was no light coming through the slits of the door frame. I knocked and knocked and I heard his frantic shuffling in the room (closet opening, to get dressed I guess). In the process, the light in the room came on also. He eventually unlocked the door and by this point I was fuming.

There he was, wearing shorts only. I confronted him (I was really angry and I was basically shouting) and asked him what the hell was he doing just now. He couldn‚Äôt answer. At this point I already knew.

I asked him, ‚Äúare you masturbating?‚Äù He just gave a faint hum. Then I left the room, not saying anything. I slept and didn‚Äôt tell anything to my parents. 

Since last night, he has been quiet around me. I haven‚Äôt brought up last night‚Äôs incident yet to him, and I don‚Äôt know how to. I‚Äôm afraid he‚Äôll turn into me‚ÄîSee, I‚Äôm recovering from a porn and masturbation addiction. I haven‚Äôt told anyone (not my conservative parents or my brother). 

I know he‚Äôs looking at porn too because I set up OpenDNS on our home router a few years back, and when I checked it last night, various porn websites were caught on the filter. However, visit times were just one so I guess the filter is working.

I really need someone‚Äôs insight on this‚Äîhow can I process this correctly to my brother and prevent him from being addicted to masturbation and pornographic material? I can‚Äôt ask my parents‚Äîmy mom and dad are good people but I have the feeling they‚Äôll blow this out of proportion. 

I‚Äôm scared for him. I don‚Äôt want him to have the same self-crisis as I did. What do I do?",27Jan2019,1

It was bad enough that I started doing homeschool in 6th grade.

101,"I'll try to make this as short as possible while giving the required information. I (21F) and my at the time boyfriend (24M) moved from our home state to another so that we could both finish school, undergrad for me, graduate level for him. Before moving, we'd been together 4 years. During the process of moving states his 95 y.o. grandfather passed in July, he took it very hard. We moved in September, things went down hill. He says I wasnt there for him in the way he needed me. He'd leave me alone in our new apartment so that he could go home to be with family for holidays, I couldn't go due to work/school and couldnt understand how that made me sad. We had a HUGE blow out in December, a lot of things were said from both sides and we broke up, we both went back home for the winter break. Now that we're back living in the same apartment and I've had time to rethink my actions, I think that learning from the mistakes and moving onward with a relationship would only make us stronger. Things are going good again, we have fun and are able to do things together again, my feelings are just as they were for him before. When I talk to him about it, he says he cant get back into a relationship with me, but would like to continue doing what were doing to see what happens. Makes sense. The problem is:  he needs me to prove that I've changed, so over this time as I'm maintaining/ builiding feelings and feel as I'm still committed to him, hes just observing. He's free to talk with other women if that arises and investigate that if he wants. I feel that if I stay in the apartment I'm just going to be falsely building something in my head that doesnt exist. Just to wait and see if he wants to be with me or not. He has the best of both worlds, he cant act as if he's single, but has the woman he's living with doing everything she can to be back together with him. What would you do? ",27Jan2019,1

103,"I don't know what to do. I know it's not a big problem, but I really dislike going to the church. 

The drive to the church is 40 minutes long, bumpy/twisty turney, and I have motion sickness. So for the rest of the day I feel very sick. I sit in this church for 3-4 hours each Sunday basically hearing that we're all just mindless drones for some supreme sky daddy and if you're LGBT+ (which I am) you need to be fixed and no one loves you. After that my parents usually get mad at me for not being social, which I don't see why they're mad. I'm an introvert, and what's worse than putting an introvert in their most disliked habitat and asking them to be a social butterfly? Unless something else redeeming happens during the day I feel like shit the rest of the day. 

This has been ritual since I can remember. I'm over it. 

And of course I have the worst of luck. Today I haven't felt good, and I'm particularly unstable today. Not to mention I started the stupid female menstruation today and my stomach has been in severe pain ever since. I've also had a headache for a couple of days. 

So my parents are forcing me to wake up at 7 in the morning tomorrow, get sick and sit in boredom for 2 hours (I occasionally start to pass out. By this I mean everything get's heavy, my eyes can't bare to be open anymore and everything feels very disconnected. I hate this feeling. It makes me feel off for the rest of the day.), eat food that makes my stomach hurt, and then drive another head wrecking car drive back to our house. 

As I'm in such a horrible state, I just don't feel up to it. I don't feel like it's fair that I have no say in whether or not I have to go. I feel like shit, to say the least. 

This isn't even brushing the top of my hatred for how t hey force me to participate in their religion, either. It's just a  regular Sunday. I just don't feel like I can go to church tomorrow and I don't know what I can do to make them let me stay home.

109,"I wouldn't do it, because I don't want to go to jail and I care more about a living soul more than the dark side of me would like to think, but my depression and self-confidence is incredibly bad. I'm on medication and am currently contemplating getting it upped, or whether I'm taking them at the wrong time. Something I'm diagnosed with is Aspergers, but the day I was diagnosed was the day my problems began. I wish my mum had never told me that she had suspected I had Aspergers - a form of Autism, or a form of low intelligence according to Reddit and Alt-Right YouTubers, but I'll get to that.

I don't like the thought of being different, I don't like being told that certain behaviours I have aren't simply due to my upbringing, but due to some incurable handicap, it makes me uncomfortable. On the other side of the spectrum, I also hate groups that call people 'neurotypicals' for simply not being diagnosed. I have other handicaps and learning disabilities, but I want to focus on the topic at hand. Not only does my depression give me insomnia and horrible bouts of loneliness, it also gives me anger issues and a lack of being able to control my temper or patience.

So what happens when the Internet thinks that thing your mum constantly labels you is also a synonym for 'fucking idiot' on most of the Internet? So much that nobody can actively call out the problem without also being troll/flamed and downvoted to oblivion? This is my problem, and over many years I've still not gotten a solid grasp on my anger. When I see someone using the word 'autist' offensively, I just want to smack the little fuck across the wall, because I know they won't listen to reason and don't actually need to. They're protected by anonymity, other people upvoting and validating their use of the word, and downvoting anybody criticizing them. Similarly, go to any YouTube channel that 'exposes SJWs' and screams about the overuse of political correctness and free speech. These people call feminists autistic constantly.

I just can't take it sometimes. I'm okay half the time, I just shake my head knowing they're probably just kids who don't know any better, I also like to think I'm okay when I can't see my Karma *(I use Reddit Enhancement Suite which lets me hide it).* But when you've got people downvoting you to oblivion, **and** people responding to your comments with overused memes, **and** the person you're responding to is ruining a perfectly decent post by unnecessarily attaching autism as an insult, **and** they're getting like 30 upvotes, it makes me lose faith and then my emotions spiral.

Is it normal to feel this way? I don't even trust therapy, because as soon as you walk in they threaten to tell the authorities if you talk about suicide - something else I also think about a lot.

I probably wouldn't wish this upon them if I met them IRL, I'd probably think ""what an idiot"" and move onto more enjoyable company. But I don't know these people, I don't know what they look like, I don't know what they sound like, I don't know what they're called. Mob mentality validates their toxic words and it builds this picture of a pampered nerd in his room who becomes an even bigger arsehole the more he's upvoted for abusing the ability to be a hostile fuckbag.

If I start school now, I imagine it will take 7-8 years making me a lawyer at 34-35. Assuming I work to around 50, that gives me about 15 years to practice law. Is that enough time to have a successful career in law? Or should I just stick to what I am doing now? ",27Jan2019,1

114,"So, I'm in school for design and right now I'm taking web design. 

I really enjoy the coding part of it but we're also doing layout comps at the same time for a tourism website. 

The first round of critiques, I scoured web design websites looking for ideas. I really liked the minimalist style design, so that's how I laid out my website. Well, during critique my professor says, ""This is what everyone's doing right now and it's really basic. I don't get a sense of personality for your destination at all. Like, I don't get a feel for it."" 

So, I spent hours redoing the entire thing so it had more ""personality."" Second round of critiques, she says it's ""too heavy."" And barely any other critique than that, just ""too heavy."" And she also says it looks ""dated."" 

I'm looking at more website examples and I just keep seeing modern websites with my same style of layout! So, I don't understand what's ""dated"" about it when there are popular websites out there right now with the same layout. She also said it needs more white. 

Well, another girl in my class's website was almost entirely white space and she said it looked like stuff was ""floating"" and it needed more color. She said it looked more like a blog. 

So, I'm sitting here looking at my website and I have no idea what to do, I'm about to break down because it's like every change I make on it to adjust it after critique, I have to overhaul the entire thing and it takes hours. I have other classes with homework too but this professor keeps assigning hours worth of homework and won't give anyone any valuable critique except her favorites. 

She kept saying to her favorites during critique, ""This is why I love you, because I know you can handle harsh critique and  I know if I tear this apart you're going to come back with a masterpiece."" 

Which just made me feel like shit because it makes me think she's not giving me constructive critiques because she already thinks my work looks like shit and it isn't going to improve. 

I just don't know where to look for ideas because I was looking at Awwwards and got ideas from there but she said it's ""too basic."" And then when I changed it, ""too dated."" 

So now I'm just feeling panicky every time I look at my edits because I know I'm going to be told it still looks like shit no matter what I do to it.

115,"Okay so this is my first post. I really need the advice. I‚Äôm a caregiver and I care for and work with seniors with Alzheimer‚Äôs and dementia along with mobility issues and a whole other plethora of things. Been in my field for about 3 years so although I‚Äôm young and still somewhat inexperienced I‚Äôve seen some shit. 
As of recently I‚Äôve been with a client that I‚Äôm new with. I don‚Äôt believe I was adequately warned to the fact that she is combative. Her other caregiver has been with her for a couple of years so she knows how to work with the client and all that. Obviously me being new to the care team I don‚Äôt (yet) 
But my question being, with her being combative (hitting, punching, slapping, she actually scratched me on the arm yesterday leaving a mark and actually slapping me across the face today more than once while trying to pull my hair)

No she doesn‚Äôt hit super hard but hard enough that I‚Äôm not with that. I don‚Äôt normally have problems with combative clients but she slapped me hard enough in the face today that caused a migraine. So what do I do? Should I stick it out and she if she gets better? Or should I tell my employment that I may not be a good fit for her? 

TLDR; client is combative, enough to where she left a mark and caused a migraine should I stick it out and learn her or move on to a client I may be a better fit to?",27Jan2019,1

118,"24 year old male here. I wanna start this off by saying I‚Äôm NOT suicidal by any means. I‚Äôm able to compose myself in tough situations. That being said I‚Äôm going through probably the most massive amount of bullshit that life has ever thrown at me at once. I‚Äôm setting here trying my hardest to keep from bawling my eyes out.

I‚Äôm gonna have to go back to the beginning for this. It all started in October last year (2018). I was at a job in which I didn‚Äôt mind but could pay more. I had been working this new position that was SUPPOSE to have a pay raise on it. But one day I check my pay statement and there is no raise. I pull my supervisor to the break room and she informs me that I am not eligible for the raise until my attendance looks better (even though I was TOLD when I was put on the position that it came with a raise). I had been absent for 55 hours total (63 and you‚Äôre fired) but was almost at my year hire date. To add insult to injury, I was already at 50 hours when I was put on said position so I was ALREADY out of eligibility for a raise at the moment I was given the position. I decided ‚Äúfuck this‚Äù and I no call no showed, effectively quitting.

This was then followed by an incident in which my girlfriend (who sadly suffers from multiple mental illnesses) was bothered by something that one of my long time friends was doing. I decided to confront said friend. Since then, this friend has barely talked to me and has even told me they‚Äôre cool with me but want nothing to do with my girlfriend. All because I told them that they were bothering her (and me) with a certain way they were acting.

On top of all this, there was an issue where one of my best friends, it has now come out that they abused the person that they were with at one point. Although I AM upset about my friend doing this, and I have even told my friend that what they did was ultra shitty and that they need to get help for it, I have been called a ‚Äúpiece of shit‚Äù for refusing to drop my friend of 7+ years. Once again, I‚Äôm pissed about what they did and have let them know this but I can‚Äôt justify myself dropping this friend when they‚Äôve done so much for me. And apparently, that makes me a piece of shit.

Fast forward to now and, for back story, me and my girlfriend live with my mother, my stepfather, and my little sister. My girlfriend and I and obviously my little sister have been unemployed. And then my stepfather was fired. This put us in a very tough financial situation with my family having to scrounge up everything to keep the house, the car, etc. Although I had already been applying, I decided to start applying harder.

I re-applied to the place that I quit over getting fucked on a pay raise. I was rehired. So not only did am I back at a place that I don‚Äôt wanna be, I‚Äôm now at a lower wage than I was by the time I quit and I‚Äôm back at square one (I was three weeks away from vacation time and I already had benefits, now I‚Äôm restarting and I‚Äôm a year from vacation and 90 days from benefits).

So basically there‚Äôs everything that has happened to me. The only part I left out was OTHER friends also starting to distance for reasons that I honestly do not know but that would make this longer than it already is.

I guess I‚Äôm just looking for advice on how to handle any of these but I‚Äôm also just looking for reassurance that everything is gonna be okay because, although I‚Äôve always told myself shit don‚Äôt last forever, I‚Äôm slowly starting to not believe it.",27Jan2019,1

120,"Basically I have been single pretty much my whole life. I became close friends with a guy and we dated for 4 months in which I fell madly in love with him. And he was the same way and then his feelings suddenly changed and we broke up :( 

The reason for our break-up was that we both wanted to go to medical school (but we are a year apart, so we would be different years, he was applying to medical school that cycle) and he said it's very unlikely we will end up in the same place and maintaining a LDR as medical students would be too hard so we should just end things and not let them get more serious. I completely disagreed with his reasoning but of course his mind was made up. 

It's been 7 months since the break-up. The break-up really fucked me up. I was not expecting it whatsoever. I obviously miss him so much, but I just my life with him too. I go through stages where I really really miss his friend group, I miss the area in which he lived (he went to a different college 30 mins away), I miss the places we used to go. I always want to tell stories that include him but then I have to keep myself quiet because it's just weird talking about an ex and it makes me miss him even more when I say his name out loud. I really just don't understand how he ended things like I meant nothing. He was/is soooo special to me. I've been no contact with him; however a few times we started texting and snapchatting continuously like when we were dating but when I asked him about getting back together he made it clear that he does not want that. I have not spoken to him in 3 months now which has been really difficult, but I know it is the healthiest thing to do. 

I have always been a really independent person. I did not have many friends in high school until my senior year, so I have always been used to being alone a lot. I used to bike to places alone a lot for fun. Then when I got my license I would take my mom's car out alone and just go to the mall by myself, or a coffee shop or even a restaurant alone. I made really good friends my senior year of high school and have had good friends through college, but I do still do things independently and I think I have a strong sense of self. 

I honestly think about my ex all the time. I don't stalk him on social media or anything like that since he has been blocked since the break-up. I honestly have no idea what's going on in his life. But still I just really love him so much. I have not had feelings for anyone else since the break up, and it's been a while. I went on few really cute dates with the last guy I liked before I met my ex (he happened to ask me out 2 weeks after my break-up; it was a total coincidence). I think had I not been heartbroken I would have really liked him, but I just couldn't feel anything and I decided to stop seeing him. I have not seen any other guy since. I haven't been asked out on a date or even had a crush on anyone. 

I was never happier than I had been while in a relationship. There are just some things that cannot be replaced by friends like cuddling, physical touch, talking on the phone all night, etc. And I just feel like I need those things in my life. I know it's probably not a good time to get myself into a relationship since I'm applying to medical school in a few months, and I want my next relationship to be the person I happily spend the rest of my life with. But I just really want someone :( How can I make my life feel fulfilled without a relationship? And will I ever get over my ex? :(

123,"A few days ago I‚Äôd skipped school for the first time to hang out with friends. I needed money so I came back home since my parents work until a few hours after school for me. 
I got home and opened the window to my room when I heard noises from my parents‚Äôs room across the hallway. Sometimes my dad stays home because he gets sick easily. I was quiet anyway and there‚Äôs no way he would‚Äôve heard me so I just wanted to get in and get out.
However, as I was about to climb out of the window again I heard a clear female moan. It sounded really high and my mom‚Äôs voice is pretty deep so trust me when I say I knew it wasn‚Äôt her. My heart was racing but I still crept over to their room and peeled in since the door wasn‚Äôt completely closed.
Of course, my dad was with another woman. 
I got incredibly angry and kicked the door open, screaming for the woman to leave. They were shocked and she left while my dad said nothing. I called him a coward and few other names I shouldn‚Äôt say. 
He started crying and apologizing, but I wasn‚Äôt having it. I walked out of the house and made more bad decisions. 
When I came home that evening, my dad wouldn‚Äôt look me in the eye. But when my mom got home he still kissed her and she was happy.
My mom had told me a long time ago that her first love and previous husband had cheated on her. She expressed to me that she was so happy to find a good man and have a wonderful kid. 
I feel sick to my stomach looking my dad. He feels like an intruder here at home and we haven‚Äôt said anything. I thought for sure he‚Äôd say something but it‚Äôs been a few days and I don‚Äôt think he will.

Obviously I wouldn't be posting about this if that wasn't total malarkey...but on top of that when I had asked to see the evidence that they were holding against me they admitted to having none and that I had ten days to move out!

126,"Ok so a little bit of a background. 

The other day I was in school and we had partner work to get done and the whole class was really loud.

I am a theater technician (manager/tech designer) and one of our cast members is inside my class and we begun to talk about the play. We then began to talk about it and what people I should try to keep a close eye on. 

This person then mentioned that someones boyfriend was going to be working backstage. Then we began to talk about it a little more and out of nowhere shes says that ""******** (Girl) forced ******* (Boy) to have sex with her.""

I was lost for words and simply said ""Wow"" and then continued working. This really caught me off guard especially considering that these 2 people are some of the most kind hearted and innocent couple I have ever known.

So I decided to ask her about it. She then claimed that they had been doing things, but everything had been entirely consensual. 

This really really caught me off guard. As I mentioned before this is one of the most innocent couples that I know (very religious). I would never expect them to ever even think about anything like this, let alone actually have sex.

She then asked if she could tell her boyfriend about what I just told her and asked me who told me this. I told her who and she asked if she could tell her boyfriend what I told her (without using my name of course) . I then told her she could.

So a brief summary a friend of mind tells me that a girl in a couple forces sex. I ask the girl if she did, she admits to having sex (something that I would never expect out of them), but claims it was consensual. I tell her who told me and she tells her boyfriend what I told her (without using my name).

127,"Hello, I may have worded the title awfully but basically - 

A few years ago my mental health was completely awful. I‚Äôm talking numerous suicide attempts, not being able to sleep, intrusive thoughts 24/7, just all around awful quality of life.

It got to a point where I attempted suicide in a specific store in a neighboring city. Obviously I survived, thankfully, and I am nearly COMPLETELY better than how I was a few years ago. Complete 180 and I can‚Äôt be happier.

However, I forgot exactly where the store was, I sort of blocked it out of my memory and didn‚Äôt really think about it. A few weeks ago I was driving to my friend‚Äôs  house, and on the way there I passed the area of my attempted suicide.  I was not expecting to see it at all - I completely forgot about it. I couldn‚Äôt even drive I was so distraught when the memories flooded back to me. I can‚Äôt seem to stop thinking about it. A week later I attempted to drive that route again just to see if I‚Äôll react better and I didn‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt sleep at night again because the memories of how bad I was won‚Äôt stop coming. I have panic attacks thinking about it.

I am not suicidal. I have not contemplated suicide in a LONG time. I just feel like I‚Äôm back to where I started every time I think about that store/event. I wasn‚Äôt able to sleep last night.

131,Basically going to try to sum up what's happening. I have had the same group of friends since elementary school. We have always been that group of friends that would just go home and play video games all night. We were a group of 6 and most of us have been playing together consistently since we started.¬† Throughout High school many people have came into the group from one of my friends but very quickly after they joined someone from the group didn't like them and they fade them out. Recently we added another group of 4 friends. It brought our friend group up to 10 which is the first time they have ever brought more than one in at a time. Over the months we have been playing online I noticed my old group doesn't have anything in common with them and are making the moves to fade out the other group. Stuff like making new calls and just going offline and still playing with each other. This should seem normal to me and I should of expected it but I don't feel the same way about this group. Two people from the new group are super enjoyable to talk/play with and I feel closer with them then I did with some in the original group. The worst part is right before I even noticed they wanted to fade them out I was talking to one of kids from the new group and found out they basically joined our group because their old group of 8 had a huge argument and split but joining our group helped them a ton. At this point I don't know if I should say anything to the new group about what's happening. I also don't know if I should stay with my old group and join the new group.

Gave up spending time with my friends and everything for him. Fast forward we broke up and he used my feelings of wanting to get back together to have sex with me while with his girlfriend. It has affected me ever since and I get crazy in relationships and usually find the thing I was looking (proof of cheating) for lol. Anyways my mom lost her job and I ended up living with my dad. She had her little ‚Äúpsychotic breaks‚Äù but it was all a scam to get with her boyfriend (who‚Äôs double her age he‚Äôs Old) and I‚Äôm left here. Mind you I live in a house with five other people so I have no room. My grandmother is OCD so she literally makes my bed while I‚Äôm in it, sweeps under my bed (I place my shoes under my bed) just to check what the fuck I have under there. I make my bed and anything that‚Äôs under it she checks and moves it somewhere else and I just have to deal with it. Or I can quote on quote ‚Äúget the fuck out‚Äù my grandmother treats me like shit and calls me a moron all types of bull crap. A solution you would suggest is ‚Äúoh go get out the house‚Äù My curfew is 8pm :) I‚Äôm 16 back when I was living with my mother I had a curfew of 11 sometimes 12.  Even if I go out on multiple days and come in at 8 my Aunt catches attitudes with me and talks shit. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm afraid to have friends I only have boys I talk to in school sometimes and even if I had friends as girls I have to beg to spend a night at a damn girls house give my dad all the information everything. I went to a hotel party (it was a goodie goodie one) and I went through too much trouble to lie about it. I‚Äôm not willing to go through that again to sneak around. All I do is sit in the house and play fortnite. I can‚Äôt even stay on it all night to release my anger lol I have a curfew for that too. everything about me is controlled. I feel so trapped. When I‚Äôm 18 I‚Äôm going to have to work and go to school to get out of this house I will have no time for myself. I feel like shit bruh and I feel as though I‚Äôm a beautiful girl and shouldn‚Äôt feel this way but I just wanna die. Even if my dad were to get his shit together I would still have to stay home all the time with my brother (he‚Äôs 4) . And even if my moms boyfriend by some miracle let me move in my dad wouldn‚Äôt allow it and all hell would break loose. I feel like absolute shit and don‚Äôt know what to do I can‚Äôt keep living like this trapped. I can‚Äôt even do retail therapy cause my dad can never give me money and my mother is greedy and only gets me shit like deodorant. All she gave me for Christmas was adidas superstars.

144,"Hey everyone. So I recently just got out of my first relationship about a month and half ago (very short, only like 2 and a half months, but very toxic with not a grateful person). Her and I only ever made out with light touching from the waist up, but I feel super inexperienced with all of the sexual stuff. I am obviously a virgin, but is making out seem far behind for my age? I am currently attending my freshman year of college and it seems like everyone I stumble across has more experience than me and I'm concerned this might become a conflict for me? The reason my ex and I didn't progress any farther than making up is because she pressured me most of the time to escalate things, causing me to lost interest and it was also the fact that deep down, it didn't feel right to do it for the first time with someone who didn't really seem grateful for anything.",27Jan2019,1
145,"I really just don't have any motivation to pursue anything. I have nothing that I'm passionate about and I don't have any hobbies other than sitting in my room and wasting time on my phone.

One of the main reasons that I'm still a virgin is probably due to the fact that my life is so monotonous and uninteresting.

To add to this, I'm also pretty socially anxious which makes it difficult for me to even interact with girls my age, let alone date and get to know them. 

I'm also just really lonely while I'm at school, especially on the weekends where I'll typically go for more than 48 hours without having any conversation with anyone past a ""thank you"" when someone holds a door open for me.

This loneliness is what really gets to me since I'm just alone with my thoughts and I'm really not too kind to myself.

As of now my grades are fine because school is the only bit of order that I have in my life, so it's not too hard to keep up with. 

At this point I feel like I'm just lost and have too many problems to begin to solve.

It felt kind of good to organize some of my thoughts here. Any advice on finding a passion or hobby would be great.

Thanks.

I‚Äôve known this guy sconce year 4 and I‚Äôm currently in year 10 and he‚Äôs still around. he‚Äôs made my life hell and some people think of us as best friends. And so do Also want him to burn in hell for all he has done to me. I like to think we have a Batman joker relationship, hell he even looks like John Doe from Batman the telltale series (look it up trust me).
Even before we were friends he would have the same friends as me, he would always tell me ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt play with us‚Äù even though my all my other friends let me. Then in year three I decided life would be a lot easier if I just made friends with him, he would fall out with everyone over the littles things. like one time he fell out with me because I borrowed an idea for a drawing.     A fucking drawing. In primary He would creat rifts in our group of friends yet he was the centre of attention, I guess you could say he was charming but he wasn‚Äôt physically attractive in any way except his eyes according to some of the girls. I remember he never complimented anyone, and his catchphrase was ‚Äúyou suck‚Äù. We went to the same high school as each other and it was really hard for me because from my primary it was just me him and someone else, plus I have trouble making freinds. I remember wanting to move schools and he got pissed and fell out with me (for the nine thousandth time) and left me for this kid who had ADHD like I do, so i tried my best to stay in Contact with all my freinds. But it was no use, But met these two guys who where genuinely decent. After realising his friend was stupid he came slithering back to me and seeped his way into my new freinds he brings some other kid with him (who actually turned out to be a pretty good guy) aswell and they started sucking his dick just like my old friends.  after a while he told me he had been having sleep overs and hot tub party‚Äôs with my old friends, witch made me feel like shit. He even prank called once and said ‚Äúis this the pizza guy?‚Äù  With my freinds giggling I‚Äôm the background And hung up, so that hardly counts. Anyway he pushed me out of my old friends and I met this kid (let‚Äôs call him backstabbing bastard or BB for short)witch helps slightly. One night me and my cousin are exiting this trampoline-activity place when I see all my Friends and (let‚Äôs call him physcho) walk in. Witch emotionally fucks me up, one day physcho ‚Äúforgives me‚Äù and me, BB and psycho are freinds. BB later stabbed me in the back by flirting with my girl who is only been with for a short time and started telling lies about me to her, breaking us up and she starts shagging him, but when he moves out of town they break up and I don‚Äôt hear from either of them lucky, anyway i was basically suicidal after everything that happened when befor the night in planned I was gonna attempt suicide  three people from primary reached out, we started having Skype calls and its was one of the best times of my life until we stopped talking scince one person fell out and I still talk to the other two. Anyway they convince me not to speak to Pyscho and I go back to the group (witch has gotten bigger) that I started high school with, turns out they hated him aswell and 2018 was one of the best years because of it, except during the week between Christmas and the new year they all randomly forgave him and now he seeped his way back into my friend group.

The search was long as its not easy finding a good spot (Toronto) for a good price. We finally settled on a rental house half an hour outside the city. It took a bit to come around but after a month we loved it.

We are currently in month two and we were just informed by the landlord they are selling the home. They asked if we'd like to buy it and told us they were listing it at 900k. Obviously we cannot afford that. Is there any rules in regards to this? I figure we can't be told to leave before the lease is up but it's only a one year lease. I'm feeling a ton of stress as we were told in the rental process they were looking for long term tenants. We even painted the whole house, did work on the basement and bathrooms.

For the past few years I've been going to a very small college, and this semester I transferred to a huge university. Lets just say I've been having a bit of a time adjusting. I've previously been diagnosed with social anxiety plus generalized anxiety, and this huge campus is really overwhelming me. The first day I had trouble finding classes and wouldn't go in when I found them if they'd already started because, well, social anxiety. I could not find this particular art class, then skipped it again because I got there late and didn't want to awkwardly walk into the wrong class. So this spiraled into not going because I didn't have work done for the class and was not caught up...so now I've missed several classes and don't know what to do. They've already completed one assignment from what I can tell, and I'm behind by a significant amount at this point. I've been putting off emailing the professor because of it being a bigger college and the excuse of ""I legitimately have anxiety and am at a new school where I'm having difficulty adjusting atm"" would not fly. I take medication, have documentation on a diagnoses but haven't filed anything with the disability office yet? It feels like the professor would brush this off and not work with me because this university is bigger. Plus I only have the chance to drop a class 3 times before I move up as an upperclassman? Also my mom will probably kill me if she finds out how much class I've skipped. Do I just email the professor? What should I say? Do I just go ahead and drop the class.

She showed up 5 or 6 years later (around the time of my 2nd grade graduation) and immediately started to want visitation rights. It was first every week, but it narrowed down to 2 weekends a month when she moved farther away, and has now been reduced to school holidays, as I am in a different state as her. She has not been paying for any of my school funding, including my school lunches or any other expenses, has tried to pay the least amount for me as possible, and complained last year when I broke my leg and she had to pay for some of the expenses (as I was under her insurance at the time). Actually, my birthday gift for my 14th birthday was the fact that she would never help me pay for college. She is famous for trying to manipulate my feelings in order to get what she wants (more time with me usually), and made me emotionally distraught on multiple occasions when I was younger. Even when I am at her house, my time is very boring, as she doesn't know me or try to get to know me at all, and I end up hanging out in my room for most of the time. Now that I am in a different state, when I go over, she doesn't even let me go and hang out with my old friends, as it would be ""too long of a drive,"" and there is ""nothing for \[her\] to do over there."" Since my stepmom married my dad, she has been berating her and calling her a bad parent, and she has done the same to my dad on multiple occasions. She has said to me on multiple occasions that she doesn't care what happens to me in my life, as long as I live close to where she lives after I get out of college.

&amp;#x200B;

Tonight I am going to start separating myself from her, as her connection to my life has just been sapping me of energy, and I honestly can't say one time where I have thought of her as more of a mom than I have my stepmom. I'm nervous and a bit scared of what her reaction to this will be, and I just don't know what I'm going to do if she becomes crazy and starts belittling my thoughts or whatnot. I plan to send an email to her detailing how I feel (her relationship to me has been detrimental to my emotional health and needs to stop) and what I want to happen in the future (less time or no time at her house, less time talking to her on the phone).

&amp;#x200B;

But a few days later, one of his friends accidentally lets it slip to me that my ex smoked a lot when we were broken up. I was really upset, but only because he didn‚Äôt tell me and when we were dating he made it a really, REALLY big deal he didn‚Äôt want me smoking or drinking ever. So I didn‚Äôt feel like I could trust him to tell me the truth since he never told me about the girls or the smoking. I decided to give it time to see if we would be friends and maybe I could get through it and we could be together again. But I feel like this isn‚Äôt going anywhere. He sleeps half of the day and only asks me,‚Äù what are you doing‚Äù as if that‚Äôs a real conversation. I know he shouldn‚Äôt treat me like this but at the same time, our relationship was really special to me. He was the first person I truly loved and connected really well with my family. He was a jealous when we were dating but he was a really good boyfriend to me. None of my friends think I should let him back in but I have a soft spot. He was my best friend. I don‚Äôt know what to do.",27Jan2019,1

178,"Sorry guys this is long, it's basically my while life story in brief I needed to talk about it.

I met my best friend in the first year of high school, we were both 12 years old and lived across from each other for 4years. We were together everyday and as we started to grow into independent teenagers we both had quite different groups at school. Even though this was happening we always hung out on the weekends and walked home together. 

I had a few things happen that changed me  a bit and I started to Rebel, I guess out of confusion and anger. I'd always been a pretty smart but not particularly looked at as popular, and at this time started wearing make up ect and started hanging out with more popular girls and started experimentally drinking. Me and my bestie were still close but she was getting bullied. I always stood up for her. 
I started to go off the rails, left my mum and step dad's house and on my 15th birthday was suspended for trying to smoke weed for the first time. 
It was my bestie who had told the teachers and honestly at the time I was a bit guttered. We had fallen a bit distant and I didn't understand why she'd nark.

Fast forward a year I went through some pretty horrific abuse including being forced to take drugs. I got out of this situation and tried to deal with the trauma me bestie started being close again, I meet a guy, later had my son at 19 and all was well.

My bestie was always there and we grew as young women in there early tweenties. Untill a massive earthquake upheaved my life and through everything into turmoil.
I had post partum depression and my relationship with sons father became abusive, I left him and basically found he'll in the name of a guy I'm going to call b. 

B was a drug addict and I was broken. I wasted four years of my life destroying it with intravenous drugs and trying to block out my past. Before this happens my abusive ex took my son due to me not being able to cope with the depression. I was diagnosed with bipolar and I tried self medicating, any way point is B was not a good influence. 10yrs my senior he took me deal into the junkie world and it took years to recover. All this time my bestie was worried and would try maintain contact. But I had moved islands.
I lived a life I'm not proud of, and finally I had enough and got help. 

It was not easy and I fully committed myself to the program of narcotics anonymous, B also went to rehab. His seventh rehab and soon after got out relapsed. 

Constant lies of drug use, trying to gaslight and temp me to relapse and some physical abuse lead me to finally leave. 

My bestie let me move in, I told her of my past events, she seemed to see them differently to what I did and stuck by me through recovery. I was still in love with b.
And my bestie was with the love of her life an absolutely great guy who also would feel emotionally upset just like my bestie if I mentioned B.

I spent three years forcefuly making myself to try never contact him even though I was worried, to ignore my feelings and move on. I never told people but they new.

B had ruined my family's lives and my friends hated him I did try to see him a few times but it never worked. I was absolutely heartbroken and full of guilt that I was getting clean with out him. 

5years clean, at 28 year old I'm studying, have my son back in my life, my own flat and my besties wedding coming up. So excited. 
I change bipolar meds as mine aren't going to well and I flip. My secure relationship I'd been in for the last year falls apart and I started to loose my mind. 
I look up Bs Facebook, at this time I still see it as the man I loved but lost and never Wana see hurt. He has a sad post up hinting at suicide.

I contact him... I pick him up from the city shelter and I let him stay in my house.

I really think I'm doing a good thing here, I feel like I really am strong enough to help him stay clean now and I want to see him succeed. I still love him I know we'd never work but I feel so much more secure knowing I won't go through the pain of loosing him and wondering if he's still alive if he keeps in contact and we stay friends. This last two weeks, B lies manipulates and secretly takes drugs and yup u guessed it I'm oblivious. In fact I'm proud of how well he seems.

My best comes over to see me, she arrives as a surprise I sit her down and tell her look your im really sorry I hope u understand but B needed help and I felt like I had to help her.

B comes home in that moment.. she looses it. IV never seen this amazing composed women lose it like this, she tells him how worthless he is and how I deserve better.

She text me that night and ends our relationship. 

I'm very upset, but I still think I'm doing right by helping some one out of addiction. If I don't he will die right?

A week later B shows his true side, he rings me he's been hurt apparently he relapsed and he's sorry but he's been stabbed and needs me, he calls me pet names like he used to when we were together, I'm worried, he won't let me call my paramedic friend he just wants me there I turn up to a house to make sure he's ok.

This is night, and I don't drive, I'll just add that in. I get there it's a gang house and he's high on crack. He had small marks on his legs and he offers me the pipe.  It's been years. And I take it. I take a puff and he laughs, he knew I would cave, infact he started talking about how I'll always be just like him. How I was so nice when I was young I never knew he was constantly cheating. He even text my friends and asked them to come over to have sex with him adding he knew I was still in love with him but he just doesn't feel it with me. 
Basically he never got clean and I never remembered a lot of my tweenties because he was purposely trying have in a state of mind where I was almost in an overdose so I could freak out when gang type stuff was taking place. It was to save me.... He also admitted to overdosing a young man who he convinced to try drugs for the first time  because he wanted heroin.

It was like a light switched. I saw what everyone else saw.... I had spent my life in love with a sociopath and I felt sick.

I left I called the cops, I have a protection order due to the abuse he caused when I said he had to leave and I started really working hard with my therapist.

Sad thing is my besties wedding wasn't far away and after dealing with the anxiety this incedent had caused I contemplated writing a letter to apologize.. to tell her I understand why she had to ditch me. I had tried to text before but she'd blocked me.

Any way it's been a few months since besties wedding I basically cried all day on the day at home. IV since picked myself up and in pushed myself to spend more time with my son, IV not only kept off drugs, I'm never touching them again I was so disappointed in myself, IV quite alcohol and got a stable dosage of new bipolar meds. I'm doing the best Iv ever done in my life right now and I even got back on track with the relationship that had broken down just before seeing B again. 

This man's amazing and actually does not abuse me.. and I can actually see what abuse is now... and I have a voice! I don't let people manipulate and walk all over me now, I'm very cautious about trust but for once I have healthy boundaries.

Today I wrote my bestie a letter
She wasn't home I left it on her step.. I haven't heard back. I may never here back.
It's an apology, I never saw how much my actions could hurt others that mean so much to me. It hurts them emotionally to see you in pain and I was very selfish to not have seen this.
But I also said I'm glad that I this happened. The timing was terrible, but I may have never seen Bs true colours and been able to let go and grow and heal if it didn't.

I still care about my bestie. I know she's likely to hold a grudge, she's done that to others for years. But she was always there for me. She was my rock and we always had each others respect and support.

She narked on me because she didn't want to see me go down that rabbit whole, even way back then she cared and I was nieve.
IV made some pretty dumb mistakes in my life, but we've never really been distant she was always the one who would really try to understand and help me.

I'm sorry this is so.long but I'm wondering have I done the right thing trying to write to her? Or could this just make her upset and suffer from more of my actions? As that's the last thing I want. Should I just had left it be and accepted that she no longer wants to be friend? 16 year friendship. It hurts to lose that.


Recap: my best friends always been there even when I hit rock bottom. I took this for granteed and didn't see the emotional toll on her.. 
I got back in contact with a sociopathic junkie ex to 'try do the right thing and help him' and she told me I was no longer a bridesmaid to her up coming wedding and our friendship was over.
My new view on life is letting see how much of a ride in been taking on and how foolish I am. I want to talk to best, I left here a letter... But is this selfish? Should I just accept the friendships over?

179,"Just to preface this, I know I'm probably being shallow by thinking this but here goes.

So I've had this friend, we've been friends for maybe like five-ish years, and then things sort of fell apart and now we're not. Nothing bad happened between us, it's just that kind of thing where you grow up and just change, mentally-wise and friend group-wise. Now I safely can say that she probably doesn't care about me at this point, probably doesn't even think about me. But that's the problem, because I just can't stop thinking about her.

I don't even know if it's because I miss her. I think it's because... she's changed, and I feel as if she's become more successful, and in a way, more popular than me. I KNOW. It's super shallow but I can't help but feel jealous at the fact that she's now very athletic, is smart, really pretty, and has a solid friend group. Whereas I feel like I've become the opposite. I have friends, but not anyone that I feel super close with and go to a bunch of different places outside of school with. My self-image of myself is not the best, I'm essentially the farthest thing from a star athlete, and my grades aren't bad- just so so. 

Every time I see her face on social media, it hurts. There's this little thought in the back of my brain, what would have happened if I'd tried a little bit harder to remain her friend? Would I have this kind of life too? Would I have friends like this? And to make matters worse, I've begun comparing my current friends to her and her friends. I have thoughts like ""Me and my friends now aren't this close"" and ""I'll never have friends like that"". ""I'll never be as pretty/smart/athletic"" etc. as that. She becomes the go to person I compare myself to when I'm feeling like shit. 

I don't know. Maybe I'm putting her on a pedestal, maybe I'm regretting not sticking to being her friend because I have a secret innate desire to become popular that I didn't even know about. Maybe I really am a shallow bitch who takes things for granted. Sure, I'll probably grow out of this and by the time I graduate school I'll have forgotten about this, but for now, it's like stepping into a puddle in your socks. It's really annoying, and I'd appreciate NOT having to constantly compare myself to her as if she's some she's some perfect child of God. 

So all that stuff being said, do you guys have any advice on how to overcome the jealousy?",27Jan2019,1
180,"Hello, I tried to ask for advice in the dating forum and a poster there was more concerned with judging me personally and assuming things about my situation and my maturity level.  I didn't write this post for people to comment about my maturity level, I'm asking about what I should do with someone who acts like a boyfriend but won't properly and official ask me to be his girlfriend and we have been unofficially dating for two years and he's not dating anyone else, either.

More details below:

Hello, I tried to write a post earlier but didn't get any good responses and the person that commented misinterpreted my post and that person was more concerned with insulting me and down voting.  I'm hoping to post my question in a different advice forum to get a proper answer.

I've been having split answers from my friends in real life, too.  Some friends said if I like to hang out with him and we're not dating anyone else, I should still keep him as a friend.  And other friends said if he won't make it official, he is stringing me along then I should cut contacts with him, so I really don't know what to do because I'm tired of him acting like a boyfriend yet not properly asking me to be his girlfriend.

It's either we are together or we aren't - not not cause this sort of confusion, yet he still holds my hands and cuddles wherever we go so it's totally confusing and he's sending me mixed signals.

I've been unofficially dating a guy friend for 2 years. He holds my hands and comes over to take naps with me and cuddle so I think it's safe to assume he likes me as more than a friend. We haven't hooked up we just take naps together and give each other little kisses. He has said he loves to hang out so I don't know why he won't make it official especially since he likes to cuddle, too.

I'm the first girl and anyone he has ever dated so I'm wondering if that's why he is taking time to make it official.

And if he thinks I'm just a friend then he should stop holding my hands and doing boyfriend stuff.

Tl;dr I'm confused why he does boyfriend things for me but he won't ask me officially to be his girlfriend. I'm not trying to pressure him but it's been two years already of unofficial dating. We have not hooked up and barely kissed in the 2 years. When is enough waiting for him to be ready?",27Jan2019,1

183,"So I've been at my job for almost 3 years. Today I was offered a position in a salon.

 Went to a local salon today to get my haircut, after talking with the stylist that was doing my hair. It came up that I was a former stylist. She right away asked me if I wanted a job because they were short staffed right now.  All because she liked my personality and my style. 

I really like the people I work with at my current job but It's not something I want to do forever. It's an easy job though, I'm a custodian at the moment, and I honestly think I'm just really comfortable where I am. Maybe I'm just too afraid to take a chance. I had some really terrible experiences with other stylists in previous salons I worked at. I never thought I would go back to working in a salon. 

Tomorrow the stylist that offered me the job wants me to come in for a more formal interview and to show my skills. 

I'm just worried that it will be like the other salons I have worked for and I'll end up miserable there. I really do love doing hair but I don't want to end up with shitty hours or jobless. I'm so afraid of failing. What should I do?",27Jan2019,1
184,"Hello. I'll just quickly provide some background knowledge: I'm a 26 year-old college student who will be graduating soon. I have one semester left because I need to take a foreign language course that is required. I'm also graduating a bit late because I served my country via military service and also switched majors along the way.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to now. There is a friend who works at a cybersecurity startup. I met him at a former workplace because he was close to the general manager there, and he's always been asking me when I graduate and saying that he really wants me to work at his company.

Recently about a month ago he messages me asking me if I would be interested in doing some part time work a couple days a week. I told him that that would be great since I'm technically still in school and being able to get some extra cash and exposure would be extremely helpful, especially for someone who's not 100% sure what they want to do. It would also be good because I was planning to take some extra courses while I fulfill the graduation requirements.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been called in for an interview the same week that he messages me. I was basically interviewed by my friend and another guy who I've also met before. Honestly, I didn't like the interview. Not because I wasn't able to answer questions properly or because the two were mean or anything, but the atmosphere was not professional. My friend was basically just there saying ""Oh yeah I like this guy a lot haha"" and the other guy was the one asking the actual questions.

A couple weeks later, the same guy who interviewed me (not the original friend) messages me saying that ""some other friends from the startup"" are in the country and ""it would be nice if you can come in and say hi before everything starts."" I also thought that comment was inappropriate because I haven't even gotten the job yet, but whatever.

I visit the office expecting to say hi and have a nice chit chat with whoever's there, but it was basically an interview. They just asked questions like ""Oh cybersecurity has a lot to learn do you think you'll be able to teach yourself"" blah blah.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, here's what's really putting me off a bit: I'm still a student and this job doesn't seem like they're asking for a part time position. I made my position clear that ""I'm sorry but if anything's going to get in the way with school and my graduation, I can't take the job and you'll have to find someone else.""

My friend texted me after that day I ""went to say hi"" and I told him that I honestly wasn't expecting an interview. He then tells me that the other guy is ""having his own ideas on who to hire from within his network because the business needs a senior level consultant."" I'm thinking to myself ""What?? I thought you told me this was a part time position, why do you need a senior level consultant??""

&amp;#x200B;

I guess the advice that I'm asking is: What would you do if you were in my shoes? I'm thinking that I need to message my friend first and ask him what exactly the job needs and if I would be able to juggle school and work, as was initially promised. Because after everything going on, it doesn't seem like they like the fact that I'm in school either.

His IQ is somewhere in the 80's, so it's just high enough that he never qualified for many services in childhood / early adulthood. He still lives with his parents. Both parents are in their mid 70's, and both aren't in the best health. He's never been able to hold even the most basic low paying part time jobs for long. He can't handle basic math, including even making change or properly counting money. To this day he heavily depends on his parents for day to day living. He lacks many basic interpersonal skills, and strangers often don't know how to take him. He's a person with a good heart, and for those of us who understand his situation we often enjoy his company. However, it's hard to be with him for longer than an hour or two for a number of reasons. He can show temper at times, and he often acts like an out of control teenager. For this and other reasons he can't go live with his siblings' families. His siblings have tried to get his parents to make plans for his future on numerous occasions, but they tend to become upset and shut down the conversations on the topic. They're very good people, but I think the reason they shut down these conversations is they don't know what to do either.

190,"'ello kind reader  

I'm a sophomore in college, and due to various academic and financial reasons I had to be placed on a leave of absence at my university. Currently going to community college at home, but things are looking good for me to return to my school in the fall or maybe even for summer classes.

I'm male, and my best friend since the beginning of freshman year is female. What it boils down to is I caught feels last semester. A couple days before I left, we were both drunk at a mutual friend's gathering and ended up hooking up, and talking for a bit. I revealed my feelings and she said she felt the same way. We've always been really flirty with each other, very touchy-feely, throw the love word around a lot. Problem is, even after she confessed she also has feelings for me, I still don't know where our relationship stands. Even though I'm 8 hours away, we talk all the time through social media. I know from conversations we had while we were still just friends that she doesn't like long distance relationships, she's been hurt before. I brought it up the day after the hookup, while we were sober, and she basically said she didn't ""think"" she wanted to be in a relationship if I wasn't going to be there every day in person for her. I didn't want to push it because I know the last relationship she was in, the guy cornered her into it and she was miserable the whole time. So, I just let things be and said my goodbye. She's the president of both a sorority and a dance group on campus, on top of being a biomedical engineer, and as such it makes sense for her to be busy, and she talking to me less and less. Sometimes just taking a long time to respond, other times straight out ghosting me. I also happen to know from my time as her best friend, and shoulder to cry on, that this girl is very fickle and is often drawn to people who give her attention, and is most times hurt by these people. I'm trying to be logical and keep a level head, but I can't seem to go two minutes without her popping into my thoughts, and every time she does I am reminded of how lonely I feel away from her. I really think I love her. I know I'm being stupid, jealous, and possessive for thinking so, but I can't help but feel she is moving on from me since I'm not there physically. Not out of malice, but just by virtue of her personality. I really want to ask her about our status and see what her opinion is, but another fear of mine is that by revealing my thoughts I'll make things awkward and possibly taint any future chance of a real relationship when I return to school. Does anyone have any advice on what I can do to ease my thoughts? Another factor is that I've never been in a romantic relationship before. Mostly because I never really met anyone that I felt overly attracted to emotionally, and was never the type of person to want a relationship just for the sex or for the sake of having a girlfriend. This girl is the first girl I've ever felt this way about, and I don't want to ruin it. Nor, however, do I want to become so emotionally invested that before I realize it I'm too late and I'm left broken (it may be too late for that :/). Any thoughts? Even if nobody has any, thanks for letting me vent online, getting my thoughts written down feels good. ",27Jan2019,1

however a few nights ago one of our mutual friends made a shitty joke about his ex (""did she call you back yet?"" ..yeah) so i got a little weirded out and kind of started... interrogating him? not necessarily interrogating, but i did sort of grill him to try and understand what the hell that was supposed to mean, to which i've gotten no other response than ""it was a joke"".
since maybe wednesday he's been acting distant, but tonight was different, it felt different; leaving me on open, half assed replies, you get it. i asked if i had done anything or if i might've said something that would've prompted it, and he brought up my reaction to our mutuals joke, saying that ""he understands trust issues"" and that i should ""get it together"".
fair enough and understandable, i apologized sincerely, i could understand his emotions and told him that his feelings were completely valid. i then asked if he would maybe like to start over on a better foot, i didn't understand the context of the joke and had i known i wouldn't have gotten so upset, disregard that, start over clean slate.
so he left on open, yikes, i couldn't hold water for the life of me and just broke down, ""please forgive me, i won't do it again"", ""you really want to throw away a potential future over something so small?""
he told me ""if you say so (regarding my promises of changing), but i'm good"" i honestly was crushed by that, i guess because i didn't realize this was going to influence what we had the way it did, but also because i care about him A LOT, and like i said, he really wants to throw everything away just because i got a little irritated at a stupid joke?
he's in bed now, i told him that if he wants me to fuck off he should just tell me rather than beat around the bush, some more desperate attempts at asking for forgiveness, more apologies, you get it. 
i've been up for hours debating on what to do, i really do have feelings for him, i really do want him in my life, but i just can't shake this feeling of guilt honestly, my mind is racing- maybe this was just a reason for him to end things because he wasn't ever actually into me? 
i guess my question here is what should i do? as i mentioned before i care about him a lot, i really want him around, do any of you think this could be resolved? if so, on my part, what can i do to just fix this? should i just forget about him entirely and move on with my life?

Plus, I can't even ask her about it, because she is in a relationship at the moment, just passed one year.

209,"Background: High school senior (and so is he) with strict asian parents. Catholic and only willing to date if I could see myself marrying him.

The title says it: how do you know when to break up with someone? I‚Äôve had this thought throughout the whole relationship. We‚Äôve been solid friends for a few years and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd even miss not having him as my boyfriend. This is all new to me and I‚Äôve never liked anyone before,so I don‚Äôt know what liking someone really is like, and I‚Äôm quite detached emotionally from people. Even initially, I wasn‚Äôt sure about my feelings when he confessed. And it‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt love him, but I just don‚Äôt know what loving someone is like. It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm not emotional, it‚Äôs quite the opposite; however, I just don‚Äôt know if I like him. To put this into perspective, I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôd be sad if someone close to me died, that‚Äôs how unsure and detached I am. 

My main concerns
1. Is hiding him from my parents is worth it? I‚Äôd know that they‚Äôd reject him because he‚Äôs not asian, his physique,  his being atheist, etc. 
2. He‚Äôs my first boyfriend and we‚Äôre pretty serious. We‚Äôre going to most likely have a long distance relationship, and I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôd still be that connection or if it‚Äôs even worth the effort. 
3. How do I know he‚Äôs the one? I mean currently, I‚Äôd say yes, I do like him, a lot. But does that mean I want to spend my life with him? 


BUT,  I love how much he cares for me and respects me. Seriously, he is so emotionally mature.  I love how happy he makes me, but should I end it and stop lying to parents or is there value in waiting until the relationship ends  (not saying that it will) so that I don‚Äôt have this ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù feeling with him?

210," 

My friends and family will never accept my ex-boyfriend as a friend because of what happened.

I  wasn't perfect in the relationship especially afterwards, but he  constantly lied and hid things from me. Towards the end of the  relationship I was too because I couldn't help looking at his phone  because I caught him in lies. I know that's not an excuse to go through  someone's phone and I should've ended it once I found his emotional  affair texts with his co worker.

After  the break up, I called out his co worker because I was tired of her  underestimating me and treating me like a doormat who was one of those  aloof girlfriends who didn't know what was going on between them. I knew  and I tried to respect their 'friendship' at first. And at first I  wasn't worried because at this point in our relationship, our lives were  pretty intertwined, we went to family events together and celebrated  holidays with each other. I thought she'd eventually move on and find  someone new but, she never did and never stopped reaching out. I know  that he encouraged it, he played me just as much as he played her. So  after the breakup, she had no problem sliding right in and crowding his  dms. It made me furious because I was still moving my stuff out of the  apartment.

The reason I stayed with ex  longer than I should have because he'd always assure me that he loves me  and could never love someone like her. He'd say it would never work out  because she didn't like to do anything beside shopping and sitting at  home.

It's been almost a year since our  breakup and we still talk and hangout. Mostly because we share similar  activities and interests. We were able to put aside everything that  happened and carry a 'friendship.' However we only hangout one on one  because none of my friends or family accept him as my friend. His  friends and family know we still hangout. I've written off a lot of  friendships I have had with men and most always my doing but later down  the road, I realize I shouldn't have. And I don't know if I am not  writing him off because I don't want another situation like I had with  George where we don't speak anymore and from that I feel guilt. Also I'm  the type of person who tries to be loyal and doesn't like to give up  easily on someone.

When we hangout it's  like we're still friends and we get along, we laugh and still have  things to talk about. We still ask each other to do things together  because we used to be each other's buddies when someone wanted to go to  this event or do this thing. Somehow it doesn't feel wrong and even  though I know it should considering everything he's put me through. I  don't think he realizes or ever will realize how much pain he put me  through but I don't like to hold on to grudges which is why I choose to  forgive.  And I'm not naive and I know our relationship can never go  back to what it was nor do I want that.  I know I can't date him again  because it'd be the same.

Even now, I  wonder if he physically cheated on me. I worry he's still lying to me  about not seeing anyone and that right now he's being unfaithful if he  is with someone. I told him and keep saying if and when he starts seeing  someone, we should probably take a step back so that person doesn't  feel the insecurity I felt.

I've asked  him if anything happened with his coworker and he denies it but I  would've thought he would've tried after our break up. Each time, I  bring it, he gives me this disgusted face like how could he could never  hook up with her which makes me think maybe something happened but it  didn't work out because if he was with her, I doubt she'd allow us to  talk and be friends. I have a hunch she probably noticed that we were  still in touch and she probably said that he can't talk to me anymore  and he probably bounced because she was controlling which is the  opposite of what I did. I never asked him to stop talking to his  coworker and I would just ask him to not text her back when we were  together because most of the time it was late at night when we were in  bed and if he responded, she'd text him right back and it was never  ending.

That being said, I just don't know how my ex fits into my life anymore?

If  we can only hang out one on one than it will be like when were dating  and first trying to get to known each other. My ex forfeited his right  to be a boyfriend right now because he lied, hide, and allowed some many  inappropriate things to happen between him and his coworker.

I  do want to find someone who wants to be with me as much as I want to be  them and in order to do that I know I need to start dating again. I  never had a problem with boundaries and I'm a pretty faithful person so I  know if and when I start seeing someone, that person might not be okay  with me being friendly with my ex. The last thing, I'd want to do is  make someone feel I care more about hurting me ex's feelings than  theirs.

Should I phase out my ex? Even  though we enjoy each other's company, it doesn't feel wrong and actually  feels naturally right when we hangout. Or is that because of the  familiarity? There are a lot of aspects I loved about our relationship  like we enjoyed a lot of sporty outdoor activities. I know I can't  compare the next person I date to him and I don't want to but I do  worry, I won't find someone who likes to do all the things that I like  to do like my ex did. That's where it makes me sad, that I'll have to  compromise on that part even if it's minor. My ex picked up skiing and  excelled in it, we appreciated fine wine, various foods, camping,  hiking, and my ex was always down to do the something if I found  something to do like a beer dinner pairing, pop up dinner, driving far  to ski, boating, tailgating, binge watching tv shows we both liked.

217,"Hi folks. I don‚Äôt really know how to start this. I‚Äôm just gonna get into the details immediately:

When I was in second grade, my older brother asked me to play with him - this was the first time he abused me. Things continued like that until I was in seventh grade, at which point we began to go to the same school. He was very hostile towards me and I never knew why, as I seemingly had blocked those memories out of my mind for years. 

When I was in ninth grade, my brother told my cousin about what we had done when we were younger, and convinced him to do things to me. He did so for half a year, and then pretended as if nothing happened. 

After this, however, my brother began to be very physically aggressive toward me (everyone, really). He would shove me out of the way, yell at me, push me down and kick me - it was tough. 

Then, finally, this summer, I realized all this had happened because of his abuse of me. I had forgotten all of it, and the memories came rushing back this year. I am now halfway through my senior year of high school. 

I want to tell my parents what happened, because recently my brother was very physically affectionate toward me over winter break and I‚Äôm terrified of what he might do. He‚Äôs a gym rat, so he could very easily force himself on me. He‚Äôs off at college now until June, and I want my parents to know what‚Äôs happened before he‚Äôs back in a position to hurt me more. 

What‚Äôs worse, my parents only recently found out about my anxiety (I never told them, due to it being largely tied to my past from my perception) and got me diagnosed and medication - and they want me to go into therapy. I love my parents, but I also know them - so I know that whatever therapist they scrounge up would tell them if I ever mentioned abuse. 

So: I have pressure from my parents to tell them about my mental health problems, and I‚Äôm so scared that I‚Äôve been sleepless a couple nights now. I want to open up to my parents, but they‚Äôre very religious (traditionalist, conservative Christians) and already refuse to accept me as a gay guy.

218,"So basically I am in high school and I'm a sophomore and my girlfriend is a freshman. the guy I am talking about is a senior. We will call the guy Alex. This went down in marching band.

To give some backstory (there is SO much I can't write all of it), Alex is a very methodical type person and everyone thinks he is an asshole and says it's like a personality trait. He chose to single me out after I was friends with him and I saw him as an older cool friend last year and the beginning of this year he apparently made my girlfriend stay away from me (she wasn't my girlfriend at the time) because he made it seem like I was the punching bag of the section. He plays it off and totally acts like he's joking, but I feel like that's part of his plan so people can't really do anything about it because it's just all a joke.

The big reason I don't like this guy is he forced himself onto aka raped one of my friends in the section and she has scars and has tried to kill herself before and he did a lot of damage. They were friends and he took advantage of her and he also made her life a living hell in general taking away friends and stuff.

I feel like he tried to do a similar thing to me but not as harsh when he made me seem like just a dumb joke. He one time physically pushed me out of a group circle of my friends including my girlfriend (best friend at the time) and it made me so mad but he just laughed it off and it made me laugh it off. Its so hard to tell with him.

But basically my girlfriend and I have the same passion for music and their instruments and both want to have the same career and I respect that. He knows her and I are dating and has actually made a comment negatively about me and my girlfriend was not happy about that and told him to not say that and she told me about it and I was mad. They do a lot of after school band stuff together so I'm not there and don't know the full picture but he compliments her a lot apparently which is totally fine like they have the same interests and are friends thats fine. My girlfriend has been told he raped that girl before I think but she may have forgotten it or maybe thought it wasn't confirmed. I don't know.

OKAY but the big reason why I made this post is my girlfriend kicked him from a group chat like he did to me and he went ""this isn't fair this is bullying"" and I feel like that was acting like a victim for sympathy by her because he like maybe is grooming her IDK MAN I DONT WANNA SOUND LIKE A JEALOUS BOYFRIEND I JUST FIND THIS SHIT FREAKY IDC IF SHES FRIENDS WITH GUYS AT ALL I ACTUALLY AM FRIENDS WITH MANY OF HER OTHER GUY FRIENDS AND LOVE THEM BUT HE JUST SCARES ME. This is all speculation but ok here is the MAIN THING: after he acted like a victim all like that he went ""luv u üíôüíôüíô"" and like that made me sick to my stomach almost and made me uncomfortable my girlfriend showed me these screenshots she initially said it was gross but said it didn't made her uncomfortable because she ""knows his personality"". She respects him for being a really good clarinet player and stuff and maybe looks up to him in a way.

I get it he has a little sister and maybe just really likes her in that way and I'm not at all saying my speculations are right or fair I just am getting weird vibes after knowing him for a couple years and knowing the way he is. He is very very manipulative from what I've gathered and has probably done tons of messed up stuff. I just don't want my girlfriend to get hurt in any way. I'm not the only one who thinks he's a bad person either other people accept that and have told teachers but apparently it's not enough idk. 
There are tons of other examples I could give you for him but I don't want to make this too long and you'll have to take my word on how he is. 

I like to think I am a good judge of character. He's said many many things behind people's backs and to their faces, whichever the situation calls for, including me. He has raped a girl multiple times. He has tanked my grade and stressed me out when he was in a position of power.

My girlfriend is not oblivious to all this one bit, she has told him not to bully me and he has listened from what it looks like and so yeah. My question to you all is do I tell her to stay away from him or just not worry? I actually think the only thing I could do is say be careful because they hang out a lot since they are in many clubs together since they share the same passion for clarinet so yeah. I just want her to be safe and also I don't want him to be saying shit behind my back.

I was dating him for 2.5 years and it was straight up abuse. Emotionally, mentally, verbally. He was possessive and very aggressive. Controlling. He was sexist towards women, racist despite being a minority, and unkind. He fantasized the idea of me sleeping with other men, while hypocritically tried to manipulate me to allowing him to sleep with other women. We fought often because i was accused of infidelity even though I never gave him reason to question my loyalty- i stopped speaking to many friends to ‚Äúprove‚Äù something to him. In short- I was stuck in a cycle of fighting and accusing of being a cheater for two years.

The last 6 months however he left to the military and even through letters he accused me of cheating. I couldn‚Äôt send letters at the time because of hurricane irma. When he graduated, and had phone privileges we would call and fight everyday because he‚Äôd accuse me of cheating and proceeded to call me names. I stopped loving him after a big fight. At the time I was coming terms with it my best friend at the time was trying to get me to leave him. But I didn‚Äôt. I should‚Äôve around November of 2017 but I didn‚Äôt. Instead I stayed in the relationship and slept with my best friend. 

I cheated. 

I didn‚Äôt want to. I felt disgusted. I felt my boyfriend was right the whole time to never trust me. My friend wasn‚Äôt even a good guy, a guy I‚Äôve told myself that he‚Äôs a good friend, but the worst when it comes to treating women. I slept with the same man my boyfriend would fantasize me sleeping with. It finally came true. I didn‚Äôt sleep with him once though. 

It was many times. 

Around January of 2018 my boyfriend told me he cheated on me with a girl on tinder. I didn‚Äôt even feel sad. I just felt nothing. I thought if he did it, I‚Äôd feel sad and would‚Äôve stopped my infidelity, but I didn‚Äôt. Because of the constant fighting we broke up mid Janurary but stayed in contact of each other. 

He found out- in February. He found out about my infidelity and called me a lot of names. He said I was willing to throw away the best years of my life for a good time. He told me that the only way I could repay him was to have sex with him, but in his way. 

I didn‚Äôt want to. I said no many times days before but I felt like I had to. I felt like I owe him for treating him so terrible. I remember crying in the car before I walked into the motel room. I remember considering calling a friend to pick me up so i wouldn‚Äôt have to go through with it. I remember telling myself over and over I‚Äôm going to be raped because i didn‚Äôt want this. I still proceeded to do what i felt like i owe. I still don‚Äôt know what to label it. I cried while we were doing it. He verbally abused me and physically abused me but without bruising. He filmed it while calling me names. It felt like it took forever. I just wanted to get over with it. I don‚Äôt know if I enjoyed it. I can‚Äôt remember. I want to say I did but I can‚Äôt be sure. It was the last time I slept with him. 

This all happened almost a year ago and it just now hit me that this event even happened. I know what I did was wrong and believe me- the punishment and karma I am currently paying for is unimaginable. I‚Äôll never see him again. But still, I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm wrong for feeling this way or wrong for attempting to analyze all this even after what I‚Äôve done. ",27Jan2019,1

228,"I have a hard time getting close with people, so i have been best friends with these two for eight years, through thick and thin. we do a lot together, and i do have tons of fun being around them. that being said, i worry about some of their actions. i dont let them influence me to do bad things, but i feel like i might need to stop associating with them. i will just list off things one or both of them do on a consistent basis.

1) both have a tendency to drive drunk. one does it much more than the other. they feel no 
guilt, even though i call them out for it every single time. they will reassure one another that its not a big deal.

2) they arent always there for me when i need them and sometimes belittle my problems. for example: two years ago my girlfriend (at the time) got pregnant unexpectedly. it was a hard time for me, but eventually her and i became excited to be come parents. she ultimately miscarried and i was devastated. one of my friends was a little more caring than the other, but overall, neither cared that much. in fact, my other friend pretty much told me i needed to just get over it because im not ready for fatherhood anyways. i normally only talk to one different friend about things like that, but i wish my two closest friends were more helpful when im going through a hard time.

3) one of my best friends has been hooking up with his ex for about 8 months. she has been dating another man for about a year and a half. i tell him this is morally wrong and he should stop, but he just acts like its not a big deal. he sometimes seems guilty, but i doubt he really is.

4) one of my friends is extremely experimental with drugs that are potentially dangerous. he is a heavy weed smoker and we are often late to concerts and events because he has to consume extreme amounts of weed immediately before we leave. 

all in all, these two have been really fun to be around a majority of the time, just having silly fun, but lately ive been wondering if im actually even benefitting from the friendship. i kind of have more fun with other friends im not as close with, but my best friends kind of see them as squares. maybe im a square. i dont know. i feel so lost about all this and need advice. thank you.",27Jan2019,1
229,"We met last month through a forum of common interest and began dating in the beginning of January. To put our relationship in a nutshell, we have a surprising amount of things in common. Seeing how well we connect would make you think kindred spirits really existed. I really am enamored with him. 

We both live in the same state - however, he lives 30 mins away from the northern state line whereas I live towards the southern border. A roadtrip to see him would easily be upwards of 5 hours, if my clunker could even make it. 

His family has been aware of my presence in his life pretty early on and have been relatively supportive of it. To me (and I assume his parents), the age difference is acceptable. I graduate and turn 18 later this year. He goes to college and I plan to as well. 

Onto my parents. To their knowledge, he would be the only person I‚Äôve ever dated. I‚Äôm worried they will think he is manipulating me, trying to groom me online, insert more parental paranoia here. These assumptions would greatly reduce my chances of ever meeting him in person, which I REALLY don‚Äôt want to happen; we plan to move halfway across the country in the summer so my time to see him is slowly ticking. 

Here‚Äôs where my sticky situation boils down to...I can tell my parents about my online/LDR boyfriend and be met with: A) extreme disappointment/disdain for the relationship in general, quoting his age and the fact I met him online, or B) some support, with relative interest in who he is. Problem is, I don‚Äôt know how well they‚Äôd react.

232,"Sorry for formatting, mobile and my brain is fried.

Last summer a female coworker of mine suddenly quit in the middle of her shift. She was a wreck. Our manager came all the way from their home to comfort her and escort her out. I never asked what happened, I figured I'd give her space and if she wanted to tell me the story, so be it.

A month or two ago she made a Facebook post in support of abuse victims where she mentioned she had a #metoo situation earlier in the year, which sent up a red flag to me that something may have happened at work.

I've recently gotten texts from her asking if a certain male employee is working that day; *I  know I cannot give that information out*, but I still let her know whether or not he's there, all in good faith bc I had no inkling they left on bad terms.

I got a text from her today asking about him, I tell her he's on vacation. She told me she never wants to see him again, which then sounds all the alarms in my head and I ask her if everything is okay. She remained vague but made it apparent that this guy is tied in closely to her sudden departure. I told her I miss her, I'm so sorry about what she went through and I'm on her side. Not much else I could say tbh.

Now this puts me in a very weird and uncomfortable position. I really don't know what to do, I just know I'm nervous for myself and other female employees. None of this involved me and I wasnt aware of how deep this rabbit hole goes until I started receiving the texts asking about the male employee. I don't know if I should bring this up with my manager or how I'd even approach the topic if I do. Either way nobody wins and it's a shitty situation.

233,"So as I mentioned above, my two little brothers are very close. I'm not sure if it counts as strange, but they do things like cuddle in the same bed, sit in each other's laps, and spend almost the entire day together either playing video games or wrestling. The older one even went through a period of time where he would just kiss the younger one's head or just kiss him in general. I remember that he kissed him on the lips at some point when we were all in the car and the younger one was grossed out in that melodramatic way kids do, while the older one just laughed. That happened around a year ago and I'm not very close to either of them so I don't know if it's still happening.

I also have a little sister who is ten years old. I'm not very close to her either, but the way my brothers treat her is appalling. She's on the chubby side and kids are cruel so I tell her to lose weight so she won't be bullied at school. It's pretty blunt and cruel, but it's tough love. I don't particularly like doing that. My brothers on the other hand, they live for making my little sister miserable. The older one in particular (not that the younger is any better). For the past three years, the older brother has been insulting and yelling at my sister for every little thing. He is extremely immature about it and does things like give her the finger and call her a bitch over and over whenever our dad gets mad at him for bullying her. When I'm around I ask my siblings to clean the house. My little sister could sweep the whole house up and down and my brother will call her a lazy bitch. I hate it so much and I know I have to do something, but my brother won't listen. The only one he cares about is our Dad, but our dad is stressed with work and is honestly not the best dad. He tends to be unaware of things going on in the house. When my brothers bully my sister to the brink and my dad let's my brothers play video games and asks my sister to wash the dishes or something she snaps and is very rude and standoffish. My dad then gets angry at my sister and won't let her use the computer or watch TV. He then gets mad at all of them as a family and then my brothers blame my sister and the cycle just disgusts me.

My parents put most of their attention on me as I was their first child. I'm pretty successful I would say, but because of my harsh upbringing I suffer from mild depression and severe anxiety. I am pretty cynical and I hate a lot of types of people. I won't lie, my brothers are the exact kind of people I hate, but I want to have hope because they're family. It's not just their personalities, but their interactions with each other. I have no problem if they were gay, but their behavior with each other seems near incestuous to me and it disgusts me. I just need advice on whether their behavior is normal and what to do about my sister's situation. Should I go to my parents about it? They're stressed out with work and four kids. I really don't know..

Some extra info
- I'm not actually sure when my brothers' strange relationship started because I think their behavior is normal up until a certain age, but in the past few years it has become really noticable.
- Some time before bullying my sister, the older of my brothers suddenly started sucking up to Dad. He would hug him, try to get piggy back rides, give him candy, etc. My dad was fine with it, but it bothered me because of the abrupt change.
- I have considered that my brothers, the older one especially, may be gay. Our family is extremely conservative Christian, but because of my bad relationship with my parents I took everything they said with a grain of salt and they never managed to convince me that gay=bad. The rest of my siblings on the other hand.. I cringe and have to excuse myself when the topic of homosexuality comes up. I don't mean to offend anyone gay by suggesting that incest is a biproduct because I don't quite believe it myself. Why express your feelings through your little brother and Dad?
- I have also wondered if I am the problem. Have the years of mental torture finally broken me?
- Neither of my brothers are comfortable around girls. If they see a couple kiss on TV they will look away and cringe. I worked with a classmate of theirs once and she mentioned that the younger one would flinch and say ""Woah!"" when she said hi.

I'll add more information if needed, but please help me. I don't know where else to go. ",27Jan2019,1

Every morning we text each other ""Good morning,"" and the first person to say it varies depending on who woke up first.

I am pretty depressed as far as I can tell, I go days where I don't talk to anyone besides a simple ""hi"" to my family members whenever I leave my room. (Which is not very often) all I wanna do is cry and sleep the day away. I have no friends and nobody to really talk to.

I keep making plans for myself &amp; the future but I never pursue those goals for myself. Like for example, I want to get my GED so I can go to college early, I want to study 1 hour every day. That goal was set over a month ago and I've opened the book once.

271,"I'm a 25 year old male who's gone through a lot of changes in the last 6 months. 

I moved out when I was 18 because of problems with my father, and have lived on my own ever since. I worked a job for the first 2 years, and then enrolled in school at 20. I met my ex-girlfriend in school, and she moved in with me 6 months after that. 

Over the next few years my life was dedicated to either school or work, as my family didn't have money to help me pay any my way. While most of my friends were enjoying their lives partying and doing things that a person in their early 20's should be doing, I spent most of my time working to afford living (my bills being around $900 a month) and I missed out on most of that as I had a conservative budget. I ended up losing many of my close friends during this time just through created distance. I built a decent life for myself, buying a car and building a home, and graduated from college in April.

This summer my girlfriend and I decided to move away to complete our schooling as the university offered a condensed program reliant on. We made a 1500km move in June, and enrolled in school in July. Unfortunately, I was unable to pass my entry classes and my entry into the program was delayed until the following summer. I decided to stay up there with my girlfriend, but unfortunately the town was a very small Northern town of 30,000 people and finding a job was incredibly difficult, and after 4 months I had to return home because I couldn't afford to live there anymore.

I moved back in with my mom in December for the first time since I was 18. Over Christmas time my girlfriend returned home and we decided that it would probably be best to end the relationship.

So for the first time since I was 18 I'm living with my parents, and for the first time since I was 20 I'm single. I feel like the last 5 years of my life passed me by very quickly, and I didn't really get to enjoy them because I grew up too quickly. Many of the people my age are now starting to transition into the life I was living (moving in with their girlfriends, buying/renting their own places, settling in) and have had their fill on being a young adult, but I have a desire to make up for what I missed out on during my early 20's. 

Is there a way to salvage those years in my mid 20's, or have they already past me by?",27Jan2019,1

She told me how she‚Äôs on 1h of sleep which is pretty crazy but that day I was on 4-5h myself so we had something in common. We suck at sleeping üòÇ. Anyways we study for 2-3h and then she asks me for my number to send me some sort of page that will help me or some shit. Regardless I give her it cuz she seems chill. 


As we were walking to our lecture she says something pretty concerning. She says she works 3-4h a day and pays $25 a day for Uber‚Äôs. I get taken back by this because the math didn‚Äôt make sense to me. I told her how it sucks how much it costs to get to work where you pay most ur money to take u there and back.

So I offer to help her out on the days I have my car (share wit my sis) so she doesn‚Äôt have to walk in the freezing cold.

(She lives alone parents in Albania she is 18) I ask her about her roommates which she brushes off as being gone. Anyways we talk she asks me when I‚Äôm gonna take the test and I tell her Monday. She asks if I could pick her up for a ride there which I say ok to if I have the car. Am I being used? Like I think it‚Äôs safe to say we are friends and she‚Äôs very sweet. We get along very well and there‚Äôs give n take whenever we work together. I just can‚Äôt help but think maybe I‚Äôm just a pawn in her ways to get help.

Because I have been with my current company for over 10 years my resignation period is 2 months. This is however as my contract states (and when I called HR they confirmed this) possible to change when my location manager agrees with a shorter date. 



I asked for a resignation date of March 10. His answer: ""I gain nothing by stopping you, or by being difficult"". That to me sounds like he agreed. I called my new employer to confirm my new contract starting March 11th. 



Now comes the fun bit....I am somewhat of an anxious person, so just to clear my mind I straight up, via text (to get it on paper), asked again whether my current boss agrees with March 10. But now he is giving me the runaround saying he needs to talk his superiors because he needs to find a replacement and if they don't find one I need to adhere to the 2 months resignation period. Which I can't do anymore because I already closed the contract with my new employer! 



My call to HR was very informative besides the date of resignation, they also told me that the only one who determines anything about this is my location manager. His superiors are not necessary!  
This all worries me because I know that we are currently in a district managing switch, my boss' superiors are changing in February, so none of them are responding to anything right now.
Meaning that the answer to my question will be posponed or pushed ahead until my March 10 no longer will be possible.

305,"They've been together for 30 years. My dad is this big burly ex-con who's been living the tender teddy bear straight life for the past 15 or so years. I've haven't heard him cry since my grandfather (his uncle) died and now he won't stop.

My mom dropped me off at the airport a month ago and I guess she just didnt go home that night. Shes been spending the night 3 days out of the week and my father cant tell her no. He just wants her near him even his shes destroying his universe. Hes tried giving her an ultimatum saying the other man or my father and she said the other man so fast and without a blink. He caved the next day and let her back in.

I called my mother asking where she was and she lied to me and said she was home alone.

She swears hes this abusive neglectful man. I've known them both for 20 years. Hes never hurt her. Hes been nothing but good to his children. Shes always been the verbally abusive one. She swears hes a deadbeat because they discussed it and decided he should quit his job and go to school at 40. Shes been the breadwinner for 4 years and now shes grown to think hes this week useless man. He has 6 weeks of college left and shes so impatient that she cant wait. Shes been trying to get him to quit college for years now. Go back to the back breaking construction that destroyed his body.

I never would have thought. 30 years is so much to throw away for some other man. Shes mislead and acting foolish.

My dad made me swear not to discuss it with her for fear she'll stop coming home. My dads in full damage control mode and she doesn't care at all.

I'd under different circumstances just say screw her.

But its SO EASY for her. It's so easy I think shes forcing it. I think shes lost and wants to come back. Shes just made a mistake and locked herself into it.

My mothers has raised 10 children with my father. 5 of her own, 5 adopted. They've bought houses and cars and gone laking and motorcycle riding and run away to Vegas.

My fathers entire existence has revolved around doing right by this woman and shes wronged him in the most disgraceful disrespectful way imaginable. ",27Jan2019,1

309,"I want to start off by apologizing. This is some pretty difficult stuff, nobody should have to solve another person's life problems for them but I don't know where else to go.

I'm in my second year of college, and I still don't know what I'm doing here. I lack motivation, I can't make big decisions for myself, and as a result my day to day life has just turned into waiting around for me to figure it all out.

I attend a very large, public university with an extremely competitive and toxic academic environment, and my lack of motivation is punishing me severely. This lack of self-motivation, I think, is due to the fact that my life has been extremely structured up to this point, as my parents were very active in my life and did everything they could to help me succeed. Maybe they did a little too much, I don't know. To be clear, that's not what this is about. I do not resent anything my parents did for me, I appreciate them immensely, of course. I just want to live up to what they wanted me to become.

I think that I wasn't set up properly for what was to come when I went off on my own, and now I feel like it's already irrecoverable. My ability to make good decisions for myself just isn't near where it should be right now.

I genuinely can't see a way to rapidly become motivated enough to take advatage of the opportunities I've been given. I can barely motivate myself to study. I have terrible time management skills. And I'm still not really even interested in anything. To achieve what I know I could have if I hadn't messed up my life so bad, i would have to get my classes under control, explore my interests to find a direction of study, start filling my time with actually useful stuff (I know I need to start cultivating my interests for my own good and, realistically, to have stuff on my schedule to keep the option open of going to grad school) and all of that requires me to fix my time management problem and my inability to just make a decision for once.

315,"
I‚Äôm not sure how, why, or whose to blame but for some reason at the age of 20 years old, while obtaining an associates degree and graduating with a 3.9 I have managed to somewhat ‚Äúslip through‚Äù the cracks of the education system in a sense, let me explain and also let you know that I‚Äôm making this post so that I don‚Äôt feel alone, I know this can‚Äôt be the only time a situation like this has happened so I‚Äôm just looking for some support :)

Now let me step back to when I was in whatever grade when they teach how to add and subtract with negative numbers. I‚Äôm not sure if we spent a lot of time on this in school or what but I definitely don‚Äôt remeber and can‚Äôt do it. It‚Äôs something about a negative number that messes me up when adding and subtracting so it‚Äôs like a 50/50 shot if I don‚Äôt have a calculator and need to do a calculation. This alone puts me at such a big disadvantage mainly because at the college I attend we were not aloud to use calculators on math tests. I once got a 73 just because I wasn‚Äôt adding and subtracting the negative numbers right, I knew all of the other material and lost almost 30 points due to missing that skill.

So why is this relevant if I already have my degree? Well that requires a little more back story to explain. 

So in high school I took a split algebra class so instead of doing it in one year it was two years. This was due to me never doing my homework in 8th grade and almost failing the class due to it so they put me in there. Then I took geometry and that was it, nothing else. So when I took my math placement test for college I wasn‚Äôt expecting a high grade because every question on the test I had never even seen before and guessed on all of them. Well by some crazy ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù I placed into the normal algebra class and actually got a higher score than average, like wtf. So I was already in a class that was about 1-2 levels above me jjst because I didn‚Äôt have a lot of the prior knowledge that you need to get to the level I was  apparently ‚Äúat‚Äù if thag makes sense. So I got a tutor (because I was extremely nervous and was basically destined to fail) and by another ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù my professor for the class got switched last minute and this new professor gave us multiple choice tests. No one else got these tests and after my class was over the college banned them from the department. With the help of the tutor and the tests questions being easy and MC I passed the class with an A, but I didn‚Äôt learn anything and still had no skills (ex: factoring, long division, etc).

So I moved on to trig and passed again with an A mainly because there wasn‚Äôt much algebra stuff I was ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to already know and then that was it or I thought. 

I graduated from high school in 2016 and from college in 2018, I took this last semester off (fall 2018) for medical reasons and found out that it would be beneficial to take a calculus class since the school I wanted to transfer to for my bachelors required calculus. 

I was extremely nervous to take this class because it‚Äôs 4 credits and I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs soo hard and I‚Äôm already kinda shaky with math. So my teacher gave us an assignment on the first day to hand in a week from then, and it was a sheet full of stuff we should already know for the class and that we need to be proficient in, or we wouldn‚Äôt do well. So I started working on the sheet today and the first problem was factoring 6x^2-x-2. It took me a whole hour to finally figure out how to do this problem. This was one of 3 in the factoring problems and one of many problems on the sheet. I even watched a video that was called ‚Äúfactoring for 5th graders‚Äù or something idk but it sure made me feel extremely dumb that I somehow got through 2 college level math classes and had no idea how to factor. As you could imagine the rest of what I got through on the sheet went in a similar way. 

So now I‚Äôm kinda stuck because I will have to complete a calculus class in order to get my bachelors but I‚Äôm not even sure if I can or have enough time to teach myself all of this knowledge that I‚Äôm supposed to already know. 

Any feed back on this or questions would be helpful!! I think I‚Äôm going to drop the class so I don‚Äôt lose out on too much money, and maybe try and teach myself the stuff on the sheet so when I transfer to my new school the class won‚Äôt be as hard anymore. 

And I want to clarify I‚Äôm not blaming my school or anything, I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôve just plain forgotten the information or if I somehow never learned it? But either way this is definitely a weird situation :/

316,"That‚Äôs pretty much it. She shows up at my place to hang out after not seeing her since before Christmas and I immediately notice something is off.

Later my fianc√© noticed the same thing and he got the same response. It was weird...she‚Äôs usually pretty open about things with us. 

I saw her in a different light and realized her nose was totally different too. Before, it was sort of just a straight, normal nose but it now slopes way up...think Whoville. 

The obvious possibility here is she got rhinoplasty. It would be really unlike her but she may have been living with this huge insecurity and never wanted to bring it up. That being said, her nose looked kind of severe and a little off‚Äî not what I would expect from a nose job. Maybe it‚Äôs part of the healing process? 

I‚Äôm kind of at a loss here. I just want to make sure everything is okay and nothing bad happened but she clearly wasn‚Äôt wanting to mention it herself. It also feels SO disingenuous to just act like I don‚Äôt notice anything.

Okey. So, My mind‚Äôs been killing me about a decision I‚Äôm bound to make somewhere in the next 4-5 months.

I have lived all of my life in Colombia. I‚Äôve got all of my friends there, and I like it‚Äôs culture. 
I also have an European citizenship.

After I graduated high school past December I just wanted to get away from my family, not that something specially bad happens, but the family dynamic ever since my little brother has been a drug addict has been awful to live with for the last two years, and I just can‚Äôt bare to stay home. So, looking for a getaway I took 6 months ‚Äúoff‚Äù, the plan being to travel around Europe (Camino de Santiago and Italy).
Also, after I got here my mother told me it‚Äôs in the family plans to come live in Spain I less than a year, my parents company being in Spain, and a Spanish stepdad: it‚Äôs kind of easy.

The decision I‚Äôm having problems with is either to:

1) Stay in Europe, living next to, or IN the family drama I can‚Äôt psychologically* stand no more. University being academically the same as in Colombia. And in a culture that even though I like, I am not familiar with. And I do know that the fact I haven‚Äôt met people and being stationary in Madrid I fell a little lonely, and that would change once I enter Uni and meet that world and people.

2) Go back to Colombia in June-July. Start studying with the people I know and in the culture I know after having some time off and having travelled (my dream for the last two years). Live alone**, and with a car. And away from the before-mentioned family drama.

‚ÄîI should mention that, living in Colombia would give me lots of opportunities to visit Europe, my family being here. But living in Europe would leave me without said opportunities to visit Colombia and my friends.

‚ÄîAlso, so that you understand me a little bit more. When I came to Europe I was fixed on living here. But as the plan came to a reality I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking ‚ÄúWHY do I want live there?‚Äù And I just can‚Äôt find another reason than to get away from my family. Yes, the quality of live in Europe it‚Äôs better, it has better transportation and, well, just an overall better quality of life. But being from a wealthy but not fuck-you-rich family, life in Colombia wouldn‚Äôt be so different. I understood thins when my mom offered me the option to stay in Colombia and live on my own.

*I do love my family and I‚Äôm thankful and appreciative from the opportunities given to me. But for the last two years the spotlight has been on my 17 year old brother whose a drug addict. And, I can assure you, it‚Äôs being treated with the best help one could possibly imagine (therapy, rehab, etc). So, waking up because I‚Äôm hearing my mother cry, fighting with my stepfather (although they have a fantastical relationship) or because of my brother, and the subsequent house instability. Is just something I want to get away from. I have done my part and played my role. The role of a father to my little brother, and the one of a brother; the role of a friend to my mother before she got married, and the role of a son. And somewhere alone the line I forgot I should be playing my own role in my own life. 

** Either because of the family stuff, or because a natural desire for independence, I love and I‚Äôve wanted to live on my own for a while now. I‚Äôve been a month on my own in Spain and I absolutely love it. Go in and out without telling any body (even though in my house my mom always gave me the liberty I wanted and needed), cooking my own food, doing my things and concentrating on my self. I just can‚Äôt get it into my mind to go back to another way of living.

I should mention I consider myself very mature, and very responsible. Not that I‚Äôm looking to be on my own because I want to host house parties or whatever. 

So, I just wanted to open this conversation to thousands of internet strangers and rear what you all have to say.

Thanks for reading this, it already feels better.

323,"Hi guys. About a year ago, my friends' dogs got into some grapes and had to be taken to the vet, which led to an expensive vet bill.

A mutual friend of ours had purchased groceries right before hanging out at friend A's place. Friend A had dogs, so they kept the food in the kitchen behind the dog gate.

Fast forward a few hours, friend B leaves for the night and forgets their groceries at friend A's house. Friend B got home and texted me upset about leaving 2 weeks worth of groceries behind, so I offered to bring it to my house so they could grab it asap. Several hours and many beers later, friend A was getting tired, and I got ready to leave. I grabbed all of my stuff, got my shoes on, left, and immediately realized I completely forgot about the food in the kitchen. I was only a minute out the door so I called them to see if they were still awake, but no answer. I tried once more but couldn't get through, so I gave up. I figured it was safe in the kitchen, at least, although friend B might be out of luck as there was no time during the week to pick them up.

I wake up the next day to news that at least one of friend A's dog had consumed the groceries overnight. All the food was demolished by the morning. Among the eaten food was an empty grape bag, and of course upon discovering this my friend immediately rushed his dogs to the vet. 

Friend A couldn't afford the high vet cost of the procedure. Luckily, friend A had another friend who stepped in and covered the costs entirely out of their own pocket. Now, they want friend B to repay the money: the groceries were friend B's, so they argue friend B should repay friend C, who initially covered the bill. The owner (friend A) does not think they should be responsible for paying any amount of the bill, friend C of course wants the money back at some point, and friend B doesn't think it should be their responsibility either. Friend C certainly deserves to have the money repaid to them, but it wasn't exactly their responsibility to pay it in the first place. I'm in the middle of all of them and am totally unsure what to do.

Fast forward even more to recent months, and friend A/C want me to pay the money now, as friend B is unemployed and has not been able to give anything. Friend A is now acting as if they approached me a year ago to repay and I refused, which never happened. They texted friend B telling them that I used them as a scapegoat and threw them under the bus for the incident, although I never directed the blame to anyone. I didn't even know he blamed me until friend B told me. 

I do feel some responsibility for the incident - if I had not forgotten friend B's groceries this might have never happened. But I don't really feel right accepting responsibility if the owner accepts zero.

Any advice on what to do here? How should I be thinking about this situation? I know friend B wants to help, but is unable to financially. I want to avoid issues between friends, but at the same time I'm unsettled about the situation. It seems like friend A is manipulating the situation, lying about things that happened and talking behind backs. They talk to me one way and about me another. I'd like to sit down and talk about the situation with my friend but I don't know how to feel about this at all.

328,"(TL;DR at the bottom)  I don't know what happened to me!  Growing up, I was introverted to the extreme; it actually caused a lot of friction between friends and family (according to my mom, I was ""a hermit"" who needed a life, and according to my friends, asking to hang out was awkward/discouraging because I always made up excuses for why I was busy).  But, sincerely, I adored spending time alone when I was younger--there was nothing I loved more than going home on a Friday afternoon and knowing I had *absolutely no plans or obligations* to see anyone until Monday morning.  Maybe that sounds pathetic and lonely, but I thought it was the shit to be in 100% isolation.

Then, when I was 22, I met and moved in with my now-ex-girlfriend.  Our relationship was far from blissful, but it was definitely codependent--we did *every*thing together for 3+ years.  (Eventually, I even started daydreaming about being single again, because I realized how long it had been since I'd done something as simple as go to the grocery store alone.)  When I finally ended things between us (last September, just before we would've hit our 3.5-year mark), I expected to go through some introvert renaissance of shuttering myself in my apartment with Netflix and a stack of library books.

Instead, I was hit with total despair at the thought that I'd come home from work to an empty apartment; I'd wake up on weekends with no one there; etc. etc.  It made me feel like a failure, somehow, to spend any time by myself.  So I did two things very quickly: got into a new romantic relationship (which kept me busy most nights, haha), and started constantly asking my friends to hang out (which filled the rest of my nights and weekends).  And I guess this was a ""solution,"" but I'm starting to notice some significant downsides.  They are:

1) I don't really like the person I'm becoming/have become.  I feel like my personality has changed--it's like I'm putting on a show for everyone around me, always trying to be the center of attention, etc.  Sometimes, when I'm socializing, I feel like I'm watching someone on TV, and I start to wonder, ""why is she so...*bawdy*?  And loud?  And dramatic?  Do people actually like that?!  Does *she* actually like herself?""  I don't know how to explain it, but it's like I've lost that essential, quiet peace that so many introverts have.  

2) My bf, understandably, wants to have alone time, and while I understand this and don't hold it against him, *I don't know what the fuck to do with myself when I'm alone!*  I mean, I do things--I go to the gym, I clean my apartment, I read books, I go on the Internet--it's not like I stare at the walls and cry.  But I find myself constantly waiting and hoping that *some*one--anyone!--will call or text and give me a reprieve.  It's partly embarrassing (like, when did I forfeit all my independence?) and partly sad, because it's like I'e forgotten how to experience joy unless I'm in a crowd.

Basically, how do I get back to the person I was \~4 years ago?  I miss her, especially her self-reliance, and especially, *especially* how she was her own best friend.  Without completely abandoning my social and romantic relationships, I'd like to get back to the place where I loved my own company.  I'd also like to drop this creepy faux-extrovert personality that has apparently become my new default!!

TL;DR My ex and I lived together and did everything together for 3.5 years, and ever since our break-up I've been allergic to spending time alone.  How do I get past this?",27Jan2019,1
329,"I have a very close friend who I really like a lot and care about. She has been very supportive during my difficult times and I have been trying to be there for her as well. 

Recently (for the past few months), she has been acting strange, being mean or distance even when we are doing something with other people (dinner, drinks etc.), like in some kind of jealousy, because of the attention I get from people wherever we go. 

I have been trying to handle it but it started to make me feel super uncomfortable around her as well as other people who are around us. I m not sure if I should talk to her or not. I don‚Äôt want to lose her and I m not sure how to approach her.

331,"So I‚Äôm a female, and I‚Äôve liked this guy for about 6+ years now. He doesn‚Äôt seem interested but he sometimes does these little things that make me believe he likes me.

Sometimes I sneakily catch him smiling when I talk or he usually avoids eye contact when I‚Äôm presenting something to the entirety of the room and I catch him sending me a glance or two (he only does this to me).

We‚Äôve had a rough history in the past, he never liked me but we‚Äôve gotten close this year and things are different. He started talking to me more which is a good sign but sometimes it gets really confusing.

He‚Äôs not the type to swoon a lady, let me tell you that. He‚Äôs quite isolated and has no female friends at all (and we only talk about school work so me talking to him doesn‚Äôt count as a ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù conversation). He barely texts anyone (and a lot of things led me to believe he‚Äôs an asexual but I doubt). I think he‚Äôs just not the type to initiate a conversation (every time I talked to him, it‚Äôs me who started the convo and not vice versa).

I‚Äôm just wondering - if a guy is interested, does he act like he doesn‚Äôt care? And is that why he seems to avoid me only? He doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúavoid‚Äù me in the way you avoid a stalker but I mean in the essence of not making eye contact, only smiling when I‚Äôm not looking, etc.

If there are any shy guys (or girls) out there who like someone and do the same things as this dude does, if you can please explain why he‚Äôs doing it or if he even likes me at all, I would GREATLY appreciate it!

335,"For the past few days this has really been gnawing at me and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it

I have very little good memories about my parents growing up. 

It‚Äôs been sitting in my stomach making a pit and I‚Äôve been actually losing sleep desperately trying to remember anything positive to add to the shocking small list. Part of me always thought I had this wealth of experiences with both of my parents even though I knew I didn‚Äôt have that great of a childhood. 

I should say that they aren‚Äôt bad people. To this day they still are fantastic parents who support me and love me unconditionally and do what they can to see me be happy...that said...almost every childhood memory relating to them are not great. I had plenty growing up, toys and game consoles and trading cards and whatnot but...no amount of stuff grew me closer to my parents 

Growing up my half sister took most of the attention. She was involved in a lot of after school activities and was star athlete and required a lot of busing back and forth to practices, rehearsals, and whathaveyou, on top of playing games usually once a week when the season was in. My sister was always the top priority and I‚Äôm not really jealous of that but it does explain my parents lack of involvement with me. Even later on when she was a junior and senior and she hit her rebellious stage pretty hard, she was always the center of attention. Even to this day, me being 22 and her being 29, she still takes much more of my parents‚Äô time than I do. I got second fiddle quite often, forcing me to be drug around from place to place, wherever she needed to be. 

My parents got divorced when I was in sixth grade but before that their relationship was one of those ‚Äúlet‚Äôs stick together for the kids‚Äù sorts and it was pretty obvious. They weren‚Äôt happy and the situations they found themselves in didn‚Äôt help.

I was a latchkey kid as early as age 6. Both my parents worked and I took the bus to school, often times I‚Äôd come home to an empty house for about two or three hours unless my sister was with me. The nearest neighbor was 2 miles away and we lived 6 miles outside of town. Needless to say, I spent a lot of time by myself. 

My mom worked a lot, five days a week on a 9 to 5 in two towns over. On the weekends she did her busy week that she couldn‚Äôt do during the week like grocery shopping or gardening or things of that nature. There‚Äôs a few okay memories floating around but on the whole I can‚Äôt really remember anything too overwhelming positive with us exclusively together. Yeah family vacations happened but I don‚Äôt even remember her being apart of any of them. Most of my memories are of her crying or her fighting with my father or her coming home tired from work or her dealing with grief over her parents/relatives dying over the years or her protecting me from my angry father. 

My father is a different case entirely. Where I don‚Äôt have a lot of memories about my mom, I have plenty about my father and nearly every single one isn‚Äôt good. Growing up my father had a lot of anger issues. I remember being afraid of him because he was so quick to fly off the handle. The littlest thing set him off and it terrified me. Though he taught me hard work, those aren‚Äôt exactly memories I hold dear. The sweaty autumn days splitting firewood were plenty but I wouldn‚Äôt say they are good memories. 

I know my father was a bit disappointed in my for a long time...I really didn‚Äôt turn out to be the sort of son he had hoped for and I think he was a bit resentful for it. Before the divorce he tried desperately to make me like the things he liked. He took me hunting, fishing, camping, etc. He put me in little league, Boy Scouts, and peewee football. He really wanted me to latch on to something he could relate to and whenever I didn‚Äôt, I know that upset him. He did want to be close to me but we were completely different people and I resented him for an incredibly long time for trying to change me to be like him. So all of those memories of him forcing me into the things I hated don‚Äôt sit well either. Then we have all his trips where it was entirely focused on him and his friends, going to run down camps where they could talk for hours while I sat bored and waiting, waking up early on a Sunday just to go carry his tree stands out of the woods, plenty of trips he took me along with to try and bond but he completely failed to realize that it really wasn‚Äôt going to work. 

Going on into my teen years I grew distant from both of them. My mother, stepfather, and I moved to upstate New York, five hours from my actual father. There my mother adopted a very hands off approach to raising me. She was then too busy with going back to school and trying to rediscover herself so I was put on the backburner when I needed guidance most. I didn‚Äôt see or talk to my father much so on both fronts there wasn‚Äôt many more memories formed both good or bad from either.


I know this was long but...it‚Äôs been eating me up inside. I love my parents dearly and realizing you‚Äôre not as close as you had thought fucking hurts. I don‚Äôt know if I should talk to them or keep searching to try and find more memories deep down somewhere but...this really has been taking a toll on me and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated

337,"So.. Me and my best friend are very close (both female, both attracted to women). We are both kinda weird introverted  people who don't open up easily. We have troubles forming and keeping close relationships but we're both working on yourself and helping each other in the process. And lately we're both really needy and clingy, perhaps because things are changing and we're gonna go on different cities to study abroad. We talk all the time and spend a loooot of time together, which is something new to us but normal in a friendship I guess..
Things have been changing in an odd (for me at least) way. She started hugging me for long periods of time and I slowly started reciprocating, she takes my hand when she's cold to warm her cold hands and we even started snuggling. We've slept in the same bed while snuggling many times even though we both have extra space in our apartments for guests. I even ask her ""won't you be more comfortable in your own room"" and she tells me she prefers my bed. When we snuggle she takes my legs and puts them on top of hers and so on and so on. She even expressed jealousy about 2 other female friends and claims that one is hitting on me and the other one will one day confess that she's in love with me (which is a whole lot of bullshit). 
I obviously have strong feelings for this girl. Idk if it goes both ways.. But this behavior has me really confused. I want to tell her how I feel without risking our friendship but I'm afraid I might be misreading the situation. 
What do you guys think? Is this a simple friendship or something more? ",27Jan2019,1
338,"I let both my district manager and another of my higher-ups know I wasn't feeling the best yesterday and that I might have to call out today. When I told my district manager, she told me to call the other guy (who we'll call Ralph), so I did. He started saying things like ""Bro I was throwing up for six hours straight and still came into work, and you're telling me you can't come in because of a little fever? Unless you have a 102 temp I still want you in so you can make some money bro.""

I woke up at around 2:00 AM last night throwing up and I sent Ralph a text letting him know. When I woke up this morning at about 7:00, I took my temp and it came to be 101.8¬∞. I took a picture of it and sent it to Ralph (who still hadn't responded to my text from last night) with a note/timestamp so he knew I didn't pull a random picture from Google, along with another text that said ""not quite 102 but I still don't think I can make it in."" 

I spent the next hour or so trying to call them, but Ralph's voicemail is full and my district manager won't answer, so I left her a voicemail explaining the situation and that I'm not coming in.

I have always thought myself as a straight guy. I had my first crush on a girl when i was 7-8 yrs old and i've had 10-20 crush on girls till now. I've always watched straight porn. I had a crush on my English teacher[Female] when i was 16-17. I mean just 2-3 months ago i moved on from a girl. Also when i talk to men i don't feel anything. But when i talk to girls i get some feel something inside me. I feel kinda nervous, anxious. I can openly talk to men but get ""i don't kbow what to say"" feeling around women.

The thing that is confusing me is that i have been moving on pretty quickly recently. 3-4 yrs ago, i used to put maximum efforts to get girls. I had my youtube subscription filled with videos on how to get girls. Now i am not even attracted to most of them. And if i am attracted and i don't enjoy talking or anything i just lose interest. 2 yrs ago a girl dumped me, i viewed every article, watched every video on how to get her but yesterday she texted me after months. We talked a bit, i looked at some of her picture and i am not attracted to her anymore. I mean i was sooooo attracted to this girl.

347,"I have two friends and a family friend that I feel so concerned about, I don‚Äôt think anyone would take the time to read this but it‚Äôs worth a shot. 

The first friend we‚Äôll call A,

A has thoughts of ending his own life because his family is super harsh on him, they never acknowledge his accomplishments they always focus on his failures, no matter how good he is his family always focuses on the bad side and puts him down,

His parents have an ego problem they both argue a lot, his dad constantly cheats on the mom and beats both A and his mom but never the younger brother who he favours. The mom on the other hand is threatened by her husband that if she reports what he does to the police he‚Äôs come back and kill them. So she doesn‚Äôt do anything but she‚Äôs still super hard on A.

A and his younger brother don‚Äôt get along well, they constantly fight and it ends in A getting beaten by his dad. 

A also feels as if that every group he joins they just fall apart, like the group we were both in. But that‚Äôs another part of the story I‚Äôll get into later. 

Now yesterday was the card giving, A and I got put under academic probation meaning if we fail again we could either be sent to summer school or kicked out. 

A and I both failed one subject, A got high marks in most of his subjects. He just failed AP, but he‚Äôs parents saw he failed one subject completely disregarded that he had high grades on the other subjects and punished him and took away the only thing that keeps him from killing himself, his phone which had all his music , all the photos of all the good times he had with his friends, the only way to communicate with his friends. 

His thoughts of suicide started popping up in his mind more, he can‚Äôt take it. His parents took away the only that keeps him from taking his life.



My other friend, whom we‚Äôll call E, had been doing a shit ton of self harm. 

Her parents don‚Äôt give a damn about her they fight often, her older brother treats her like she‚Äôs not even a person. She was molested by her grandfather, who‚Äôs now dead. Her mom beats her every time she fucks up or just beats her in general. She gets bullied by the popular kids, but A defends her because he‚Äôs popular. And had trust issues and had social issues.

But she‚Äôs been cutting herself lately and the cuts have been getting deeper and there‚Äôs more. She‚Äôs tried to end her life so many times before, like through overdosing or jumping off a building. But she doesn‚Äôt do it because I talk her out of it. But she‚Äôs been cutting more because she‚Äôs been feeling numb and she wants to feel something. 

Recently our group had a falling out, and she‚Äôs mad at my family friend whom we‚Äôll call R but R also has problems I‚Äôll address later on. 

Today, she‚Äôs mad at A for making an anorexic joke, mind you A has a huge crush on E. 
A finds out and this makes him feel like shit even more and he becomes hard on himself now. 

It seems like E is pissed at the moment and started making her replies more blunt. 




R. R is my family friend, she thinks of me as a good friend even though I‚Äôm close friends with A and E who both are irritated with R.

R is a kid who has gender dysphoria, so R is trans. R also seems to suffer from either borderline personality disorder or bipolar disorder. 

R comes from a rich family but also a dysfunctional one as well. 

R was raped and molested for a long period of time by her older half brother, her half brother was eventually taken away. R‚Äôs dad is depressed, R‚Äôs mom sleeps with her dad‚Äôs best friend. (I‚Äôm using the pronoun that‚Äôs actually R‚Äôs gender a female, she wants to become a male)

Her grandma on her mom‚Äôs side did something that made her get arrested, she changed her name and moved on with life. Her driver once planted weed in their lawn which almost got them arrested. 

R‚Äôs mom is very controlling, she‚Äôs homophobic it‚Äôs no surprise that she‚Äôs also transphobic. She can‚Äôt accept that her daughter is trans and forces her into being straight. R and her mom get into fights a lot, R‚Äôs dad isn‚Äôt around that much. 

R‚Äôs parents work abroad but every time her mom face times her or calls her it ends in a fight most of the time. 

R in school, had issues keeping friends because she suffers from either borderline personality disorder or bipolar disorder. Whatever it is it‚Äôs either one of them. Meaning that she‚Äôll be rough around a lot of people, that‚Äôs why people don‚Äôt really like her. 


R, is also verbally abusive to people and sometimes she gets physically abusive. That‚Äôs another reason why people don‚Äôt really like her.


R doesn‚Äôt really have anyone to talk to because people seem so uninterested in what she has to say, but she speaks a lot so it‚Äôs no surprise people get tired of her speaking, she‚Äôs also brutally honest as shit. She also had anger issues and has to take meds.


So basically, 

R was being herself, she‚Äôs being brutally honest and all. E couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and started fighting against R. A was also getting sick of the verbal abuse from R so he also fights back. It ends in our group falling apart. 

It ends in R feeling bad about herself and her wanting to end her life more, it ends in E still pissed at herself becoming numb and angry at R. It ends in A still being hard on himself.


I made a post more in depth about R I‚Äôll try and find it and I‚Äôll link it if y‚Äôall are curious.


But anyways I‚Äôm so stressed because both of my closest friends (A and E) want to kill themselves. And I feel like if R kills herself I feel like could‚Äôve stopped it but I want able to. 


I feel stressed I don‚Äôt want to lose any of them. What do I do? I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do?

ThisSo he then blocked me off everything possible. I then messaged his friend to talk to him again and he got upset about that. That hurt a lot and still does. So over the fucking course of 4 months, I sent a letter to him apologizing for my actions and I've also sent him small gifts which was really wrong to do since he simply hated what I did, and didn't want to talk to me at all. 

     I wasn't even doing No Contact and that was, of course, wrong of me to do - I let my emotions and thoughts take over I've finally stopped sending anything to him, so he'd eventually stop getting upset with me.

I learned I shouldn't be doing any of that again, but it makes me question if I was really in the wrong.

354,"Hello, I‚Äôm 18 (F) and I‚Äôm in my 2nd semester of community college. I moved to this area about two years ago, so I haven‚Äôt made that many friends and I was hoping to find some in college.

No success really. I have made some really nice acquaintances, and people I even see and talk to just about every day. When I say I‚Äôm looking for a friend I don‚Äôt mean just people to talk to sometimes because I‚Äôm lonely, I want real, genuine relationships.

Back where I‚Äôm from, I used to have friends I could stay up with all night drinking wine and just talking about everything with. People that I truly understood and they understood me. I haven‚Äôt had that in so long. 

I have a boyfriend that I live with, I have been with him since I was 14 and he was 16. We have a solid, awesome relationship. I just miss having a best friend. 

I feel like I meet all of these people every day that I can‚Äôt truly connect with on a higher level. I feel like I don‚Äôt even have much in common with a majority of people that I meet at school. 

Does anyone else have this problem? And if someone says to join a club, I‚Äôm the senate of my club and I love my club and all of its members and I‚Äôm very involved. However,  I still haven‚Äôt met that someone yet.  ",27Jan2019,1

We have already legally signed a lease on an apartment so I‚Äôm financially obligated to pay for rent, etc. 

My issue is, I am not happy with my girlfriend. I haven‚Äôt been for a while now but I don‚Äôt know how to end it. She is crazy (no I don‚Äôt mean the typical guy saying she‚Äôs crazy, I mean she has threatened to beat my ass and whoever else‚Äôs ass she needs to if I ever leave her) and she gives me very bad anxiety to the point of me becoming depressed.

Back to the apartment, I have two weeks until move in day. Did I mention we also have two other roommates who are expecting me to be there and contribute? This situation sucks and I need help

Girl B is perfect. I like her so much and we‚Äôve even discussed us dating. So I guess technically I‚Äôve cheated which I‚Äôve never done before. She knows the situation I‚Äôm in right now so she‚Äôs a little hesitant, but I‚Äôm confident I want girl B.

357,"This sounds really silly but I hope it makes sense.

When I was little and I first started primary school (aged about 8) I didn't get on very well. I was bullied. Except now that I'm 21, I don't remember any of it? 

I remember crying to my mum, I remember having to go to meetings and my parents getting upset, and I know who it was that supposedly bullied me, but I don't remember anything bad actually happening.

As I got older I got into more arguments with other children and I would tell my mum who would tell the school and we'd go through the same processes, but around this time (or maybe shortly after) I started questioning whether I was being picked on or whether these were just small tiffs that I was being too sensitive about. Even when I reached secondary school any argument I had my mum would contact the school, which by that point was really embarrassing for me because I knew that these were definitely just normal school girl arguments and having my mum contact the teachers about it was over the top and made me look like a baby. 

Now as I'm older, and I don't remember any of the supposed bullying, I'm starting to question whether any of it was bullying at all or whether this was just me being too sensitive about small events that are too insignificant to even remember.

I feel since this I don't trust my own experiences on anything, any arguments with my partner for example I always question whether I have the right to be upset about things or whether it's just the best of the moment. I always feel like any of my experiences are too heavily influenced by everything else in my life up till that point and I wish I had someone completely separate and objective to observe everything and tell me if I'm right or wrong.

I guess none of you can give me a definitive answer, but I was just wondering if anyone had any advice or opinions.",27Jan2019,1

I was a bit shocked because he woke me up a lot during middle of the nights to have sex. He knew I make a lot of noise but asked nonetheless.

359,"So I moved cross-country to attend grad school and found the perfect spot to live in (in terms of rent and location). Well, for 6 months it was... pretty good. I'm renting a room out of this guy's house, so I live with my landlord. He also let a friend of his and his wife move into the other spare bedroom a few months after I arrived.

These roommates have been nice but they're quite messy, they don't clean up after themselves at all, which makes my very neat-freak landlord VERY upset. Well not too long ago they got into his food and he told them to get out of the house within 30 days. They went NUTS on him and started throwing shit at him. He chucked a bunch of their stuff out on the front steps and then my roommates and him called the police on each other at the very same time. It was a horrible night. We're lucky the cops just sat them down and deescalated the situation and got them to agree to let them stay until the 10th of Feb while they slowly move their stuff out.

In between then and now, my landlord said he was selling the house and moving to his second house across town because this was just too much stress for him. (Note: this was his first time ever being a landlord) The next evening he apologized, saying he didn't want me to move out and he was just upset at the situation, and to start talking to friends who were looking for a room.

Then this morning, near the asscrack of dawn, I wake up and I hear what sounds like someone falling down the stairs. I look out into the hallway, and it's a bedroom door that's fallen the stairs. Yes, a *bedroom door.* And the landlord and one of my roommates are physically thrashing each other in my roommates' bedroom. I threw on some clothes, threw a bag together, legit ran out of the house without a shower or any deodorant or anything, and now I'm sitting in my school's library waiting for a decent hour to ring up a friend to hang out/crash at their place.

""Sounds like you need to move out!"" You might say. Yeah, I would, but I just paid this month's rent and I don't have the money for first and last month's rent or safety deposit because I literally just got downsized at my job 2 days ago. If my landlord finally decides to sell the house (which, after this, I'm almost certain he will... I mean I probably would if I was in his situation) and boot me out along with them, I don't know where I'm gonna go or what I'm going to do. 

Even if he lets me stay, I don't feel safe in the house until they're gone. I grew up in a home with a mentally ill alcoholic father so I'm having PTSD flashbacks. What are my options???",27Jan2019,1

361,"My best friend (lets call her Jen) is 24 years old, and we've been friends for about 5 years now, and her and I are both Filipino-American. (I mention this for reasons I'll explain). Jen lives at home with her parents, whom she has been butting heads with quite frequently. Every time her and I hang out she talks about how much she thinks her mom is a bitch, and I don't say anything because I don't want to get involved. 

However, I am starting to get worried about the way she views her mom because of the 'relationship' she is currently in. Jen met 'Ian' about 3 years ago now at a fast food place. Ian moved here to live with family since both of his parents are dead. Ian is 2 years older than us and he has no high school diploma, no drivers license, working a minimum wage job. Mind you, I worked in fast food for years while going to college so I don't look down on that profession at all. Here's the thing, when he had no one else to turn to, Jen offered him a place to stay at her parents house. Her parents reluctantly agreed but under the guise and understanding that they're only friends and not in a relationship. 

Fast forward 3 years and he STILL sleeps on their couch. He's worked 3 other jobs since then (in the food business), but has not learned how to drive, has no high school diploma or GED equivalent, and doesn't pay a single penny to Jen or her parents for letting him stay at their place. Also, the fact that Jen is hiding her relationship with him from her parents in order for him to stay there for free is another issue on top of this. 

Well, her mom is mainly the breadwinner of the family. She pays for the majority of the bills (her husband contributes some) and Jen and her boyfriend are staying there at no charge whatsoever. Supposedly, Ian was only supposed to stay there until he got back on his feet, but its been three years since then. My friend would tell me stories about the stupid ways he's spent his money (taking an uber to take a ferry to go to the city to get an $80 haircut) but he offer to help her family with anything at all. 

Okay, so Jen's mom broke down on Jen and asked her if this was going to be the rest of her life where she bends over backwards for this guy. In Filipino culture, there seems to be a pattern with some women who dedicate everything to a guy who ain't shit (portrayed often in the teleseryes, tv, etc.) My friend feels like without her, Ian would have no one else to turn to since he doesn't know anyone here. She blamed herself for not teaching him how to drive, but he is a 25 year old man. I feel like if he really wanted to learn how to drive he would've found a way by now. It isn't her job that her man isn't being the best version of himself. 

Jen told me that what her mom was saying was 'verbally abusive.' I know it shouldn't affect me this much, but I really hate to see my best friend burn bridges with the people who truly care about her over a man who is not taking care of himself. I have kept quiet for months about it, but I feel really torn. If this was your best friend, would you talk to her? If so, how? ",27Jan2019,1
363,"This happened yesterday while eating lunch.

&amp;#x200B;

I received a text alert from T-Mobile that 3 new phones were added to my account. I then checked online for recent purchases and saw that 3 iPhone XR's were purchased and placed into my account with 3 new phone lines. I contacted T-Mobile Support and the rep immediately started investigating.

&amp;#x200B;

The purchase happened at a store that was an hour away from me. I was able to confirm my location at the time the phones were purchased because I have receipts from Wal Mart. The T-Mobile rep was able to confirm what happened by calling that store. The man that used my information had a fake ID with my name and information on it but with his picture. The T-Mobile store has footage of the man entering the store and purchasing the phones. The rep then blocked and bricked the phones and sent out an alert to other stores about the man.

&amp;#x200B;

Once I was done with T-Mobile I contacted 911. A police officer came over to my house and took down all the information. He told me he was going to hand over all the information to his detectives. I told him about the T-Mobile store having footage of the man, and if I should drive there and see for myself. He told me not to do anything further besides check my credit report for any newly opened Credit Cards.

&amp;#x200B;

I have my family under my account. I was told the man knew everything about me. He knew each person's name and what their relation to me was. Now everyone is afraid because he knows where we live. I don't know what more to do. What more can I do?",27Jan2019,1
364,"So my little sis (25) just bought a house with her husband (26) but, having just bought one myself I know she can't afford it. Let me explain...

She is in a middle management position and I know she earns no more than ¬£26k (I got the job specs from her company)

He's a recruitment consultant, so around ¬£22k, but for a questionable firm... More on that later

The house they've bought cost ¬£196k and is on a new build lot. I've run a mortgage calculator and their down payment to secure the house HAD to be 20% (¬£39,200)

They have also been away 16 times in the 12 months running up to them buying the house. I've planned the same trips for next year with the same dates, flights, destinations etc and taken around 6% off for inflation. I calculated the price in total at  ¬£33,997 and that isn't including any spending money. Given the fact that her New York trip resulted in a diamond Typhany(?) Necklace, another ¬£10k would be conservative.

They also lived in a flat the whole time that cost ¬£1300 pm whilst saving.

He also just bought a Merc at ¬£45k just before buying the house. 

When you add the usual food, bills, phones, nights out etc into the mix, I get it around ¬£158,800 for the year. 

Now I have already quizzed my sister about this. She's either naive or covering but she said, 'he goes to France once a month to recruit CEO's and directors, and when he gets back he always gets a large cash in hand bonus of a few grand'

So about this firm he works for...

He's done the job for only a few months. He's junior as far as the sector goes, yet he's apparently landing CEO's in the energy sector to which he isn't even slightly qualified. (Sport science 2:2!)

I went to the HQ of this firm and its an unmarked building above a barbecue place. The windows are rotten and noone was in on a Tuesday at midday. The only way in is through the kitchens of the restaurant. 

The business is shown as not trading online and the owners happen to be 2 of his mates from uni. My sister has never mentioned this to me

Furthermore, he comes from a questionable place. He's Northern Irish and a member of the orange. His Father is very high in the orange army and leads the march each year. His father is also ex sas and a defence contracter in the middle East (sounds like a cheesy spy novel but it's true)

Now his dad will be earning a few quid, but not enough to subsidise over ¬£120k in handouts to his son. He has 6 other children also.

I think the husband is going to France regularly but I can't tell why. 

Any advice on working this out? 

My sister won't open up to me or anyone else and tell the truth, she's just making out it's these bonuses. The husband absolutely won't tell the truth. Asking both of them is a pointless endeavour.

I'm willing to hear any grey solutions if anyone has any. Can't get close to his tech any time soon though.

TLDR

Sister and husband earn about ¬£40k but spend ¬£160k in a year and they're definitely up to something but..  what??",27Jan2019,1

He also sometimes doesn‚Äôt cut his food and will instead spear it with a fork and take bites of an entire chicken breast or sausage. 

The first part bothers me even when it‚Äôs just us, because it disgusts me. I‚Äôve spoken to him about it many, many times. I‚Äôve suggest he take allergy/decongestant medications and he refuses, I‚Äôve been much less polite in my suggestions and he hasn‚Äôt done anything about it.

The second part rarely bothers me when it‚Äôs just us, but when he‚Äôs eating with my family it really bothers me. He has no table manners. I‚Äôm not sure how to put this but I have particular members of my family that are wealthier than my immediate family, and they definitely have hard views on table manners. They‚Äôre too polite to say anything but it definitely has affected their view of him. Even my parents have side-eyed him when he eats with us. I was raised to be polite, and this is definitely something that embarrasses me when we eat with said family members because I want them to think of him as the caring and kind man that I know, and since he rarely talks to them (he‚Äôs shy) his actions are what speak loudest. 

I‚Äôve talked to him about both issues, and he brushes it off. I‚Äôve never seen an improvement in our 18 months of dating. I do not want to break up with him, and this is not a reason for me to break it off because my parents at least like him a lot. I know I can‚Äôt make him change, but I hate feeling disgusted by him even occasionally, and I have no idea how to explain to him table manners at this point in his life. He has 4 siblings and a huge family so I know it wasn‚Äôt a priority for his parents to enforce manners at the table, and honestly I feel like a snob trying to even talk about it, but some parts of my family come from totally different worlds than he or I do and I don‚Äôt know what to do.

She has always wanted children so bad and when I would bring up trying again she would say things like‚ÄùI don‚Äôt want kids anymore‚Äù‚ÄùI am dead inside‚Äù she blamed herself for the miscarriage and I could not say anything to make her think other wise, I tried so hard to be there for her but I was grieving too I wanted to be close I wanted this to bring us closer I started to talk to her and tell her we can make it through this we will have our family things will get better and every time I did she would say ‚Äúno it won‚Äôt god didn‚Äôt want us to have this baby‚Äù she got to were she shut me out completely I felt like a stranger in my own home it got to were I was begging her to get help I wanted to work it all out and she just wasn‚Äôt willing to do it, it was a daily argument of me asking her to get help and her saying it‚Äôs a waste of money and that she will always be like this until that night in October she had her father come and get her...since then I have been an emotional wreck I am completely lost without her she was my other half and I can‚Äôt help but feel as if it‚Äôs all my fault I said so many horrible things that I can never take back...daily life is so hard lately I had to take a leave of absence from work because I can‚Äôt even hold it together 

She is living with her parents now and has cut off all contact with me.she deleted me on all social media and changed her number, the last time we spoke was through text me pleading with her to at least try and work things out and her telling me she wants divorce..through a damn text message. It hurts so bad that she couldn‚Äôt even face me.

Toward the end we were fighting quite a bit but I never thought for a second that she was considering and was going to leave. That‚Äôs where I took shit for granted I took my vows to heart ‚Äúfor better or for worse‚Äù and I thought these were just the worst times and they would pass. It‚Äôs like we didn‚Äôt even try to work things out, I feel abandoned and I just don‚Äôt know what to do. She seems to be carrying on fine she is part of a nonprofit charity group of women and she still goes to events and goes out to the bar often with them (she never went to bars when we were together). I can‚Äôt help but be insecure about it all I had vocalized my concerns of her wanting to move on or wanting to be with anyone else and she would say things like ‚ÄúI just want to be alone‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be with anyone else I would just ruin there life too‚Äù‚ÄùI just need to die alone‚Äù‚ÄùI don‚Äôt want to move on‚Äù there was and has never been a question of infidelity but she‚Äôs just such a beautiful woman and going out to the bar just makes me uncomfortable.

I miss her so much, it‚Äôs like she is all I can think about. I can hardly sleep or eat and I just can‚Äôt picture a future without her in it. I feel like I am erased and she is just starting over and she seems to be doing fine all the while I feel like my legs are cut off it‚Äôs hard to make it trough the day. I have been trying counseling and seeing a psychiatrist but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be helping and neither are the meds.. didn‚Äôt mean to make such a lengthy post just not sure what to do I try to set small goals throughout the day but I struggle with even the smallest things ",27Jan2019,1

Not sure if this is the right place to post this. The relevant images are here: [https://www.flickr.com/photos/161404016@N03/with/45860345754/](https://www.flickr.com/photos/161404016@N03/with/45860345754/)

So I have this flimsy hollow core, i think, door that has some damage, doesn't sit evenly in the frame etc.. The walls around it are, i'm pretty sure, a few cm of concrete on the outside with a hollow center containing some insulation and wiring. The floor is wooden and creaks in places. It;s covered by wooden boards on one side of the door and by carpeting on the other. It also has a a hollow inside. . The whole thin is on the first floor/storey and the only acess is via a carpeted staircase, unless you count windows.

Anyway I want to replace the door with something better; a door of some kind , maybe including wood/ metal/fiberglass/plastic/layers of something or other. I don't know too much about the subject.

The door would need a cylinder lock, or at any rate, something that enables you to lock/unlock it from either side. Also It should be something that can withstand a few kicks or hammer blows. You know, something sturdy. Can I use the Existing frame or/and hinges? Maybe a hole could be cut in the frame to facilitate the part of the lock that enters it? I'm thinking that could make things easier. Would it be better/necessary to get a whole new frame, possibly a frame and door combination, ready to go? Could i get it online somewhere, at a hardware store, or something off craigslist or freecycle that may need to be cut to size? I've got some basic tools and stuff; battery drill with various ends for wood/concrete, screwdrivers with a variety of endings, hammer, assorted nails and screws. some paints/glues.

 What would it cost approximately? I'm in the UK, East Midlands, near Moulton, by the way. Also I will probably have to have the whole thing done, at least the stuff on location, within a 2 week period in April, or else it will have to wait a few more months.If any stuff neede to be obtained ahead of that period (the door for example?) it would need to be stored somewhere else. Budget: maybe ¬£600/¬£750. Thanks for any info/advice/help with getting a door and getting it installed.

Oh right, i found this via trustatrader.

Any info on whether you could do this  and, if so, what the cost and timescale and process would look like would be great. Looking forward to your reply.

386,"My ex husband of 16 yrs got caught by me with a secret phone five yrs ago, This caused me to call time on the marriage.

He has always been a bit tyrannical and I have always given in for a quiet life, he initially thought it was just a battle of wills and he would soon be back home.

However the things I found on the phone were appalling, he was meeting strangers for sex with no strings, even couples.  he was also having homosexual relationships, I had no idea of any of this till I found that God damn phone. I didn't know he lied men at all.

He would insist of seeing our daughter everyday...she was 9, he refused to give me any money and would not speak to me at all, he acted as if I was the one with the secret phone, he would send me appalling texts calling me a whore and slut and telling me he hoped my COPD would hurry up and kill me. He would be later for access or not turn up at all, If I said anything he would scream loudly that I was just having a go because I wanted him back, he would do this in front of an audience....In the end where as he was supposed to bring our daughter home at 9 pm I would still be waiting at gone midnight, he wouldn't answer the phone  and I would be frantic with worry. If I said anything he would be abusive and physically threatening toward me.  
I got a solicitor and we served a restraining order upon him, his access was set out and he was ordered not to abuse me in anyway including via electronic communication.

He got worse and he would either not turn up, turn up hours late or text our daughter drunk at stupid o clock...because he could no longer abuse me directly he began sending the foul text to our daughters phone, such gems as tell mum hurry up and die I cant wait for her to die i will dance on her grave. So back to the solicitors we go again...he has a letter to  reiterate access times and remind him should he continue the abusive texts to our child he was in breach of the restraining order....She also told him how inappropriate his texts to our daughter were and if he continued we would stop access and contact.

That's the long and short of it, now he hasn't seen his child in three yrs, his choice, he had let her down dozens of times and one day he just stopped coming....but he is telling people we know that I stopped his access because I am scorned that he didn't love me. Friends are taking sides, I look the villain because he is a very charming chap to others

I have random women messaging me telling me what a bitch I am to stop him seeing his daughter and they have even contacted our daughter to tell me what a scorned bitch I am. I have even had threats to assault me.

My daughter knows the truth but it upsets her to be reminded of him as she feels utterly abandoned and betrayed by him.

Do I ignore and carry on regardless or should I publicly air my dirty laundry on facebook and address it all and posting my side of the story?

402,"To make a long story short.. My dad hasn‚Äôt always been in my life. When I was born, he was never around. On drugs, partying, and never paying a dime to support me or my mom. Now I‚Äôm 21 and he‚Äôs changed his life around (for the most part) and we‚Äôve had a decent relationship since I was about 14. About 2 years ago he asked me to move in with him so we could ‚Äúmake up for times that were lost‚Äù. I wasn‚Äôt crazy about the idea, but he was going to let me live there rent free so I accepted the offer. 

I‚Äôve pretty much regretted that decision everyday, and here‚Äôs why.. My dad is in 40‚Äôs, but has the mindset of a 25 year old. He‚Äôs terribly afraid of getting older. He wears the same clothes as I would wear, tries to hangout with people my age, and even dates girls way younger than him. He tries to say things like ‚Äúswag‚Äù and ‚Äúdope‚Äù and it‚Äôs ridiculous. I‚Äôm not making any of this up.. To make things worse, he has an extremely defensive personality. He never admits he‚Äôs wrong about something, every decision he makes is right and everyone else is wrong. Yesterday, I asked him why he acted that way and he responded, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been very popular, I‚Äôve always had a million friends, and I‚Äôve never had a problem hooking up with women. It‚Äôs just who I am‚Äù. I seriously can‚Äôt understand why he‚Äôs so insecure and why he has to say things like that. He brags about himself constantly and it‚Äôs disgusting. It‚Äôs like living with a cast member from Jersey Shore.. The only reason I‚Äôm torn and can‚Äôt just cut him off is because he owns a fairly successful real estate business that I work for and he‚Äôs grooming me to own it one day. He‚Äôs put me in positions to make really good money.. Eventually I‚Äôm going to get my own place this year, and that‚Äôs when I really plan to separate myself. I want to do business with him, because I‚Äôve made his company a lot of money. But I think it‚Äôs time I cut off the father/son relationship. I don‚Äôt want to hangout during holidays, I don‚Äôt want to take family vacations with him, no father son fishing trips, I‚Äôm just done. This isn‚Äôt for me anymore.. He could, and probably will, take this very badly and fire me from his business. But I already have more successful companies that want me to work with them anyways.

408,"Hello the people of Reddit,

I have been with my girlfriend friend for nearly 9 months now. We've been having sex when we can. But we both have large families so neither of our houses are ever free to use the space. So we've came up with a solution to stay over at budget hotels to sleep and have sex with each other. As my family are old fashioned/strict on me staying in the same room. And it's a similar story for her household.

This has been going on for 7 months or so now, she would say ""I'm staying at (OPs name)'s tonight. And I would say the same. This has worked great as we haven't introduced each others parents to each other yet. But...

Now they want to meet. This could just be overthinking the situation, but it's a very possible out come. We've only ever stayed at eachothers house a hand full of times. So if they ask about it, it could lead to question to answers which they aren't going to like. As well as this, if the question isn't brought up. We have the issue of if we continue to stay in hotels and use said excuse above, and for instance my mother and her mother message each other to ask how everything is, when we are ""staying over"". You can see the issue here. We aren't at either house. So how could I explain that. 

IMO we'd have to stop using hotels, but would mean I wouldn't be ""staying over as much anymore"" making things a little strange for my family as I've just stopped. And our sex lives would decrease, meaning a little bit of friction could start between us. 

Any suggestions or kind words would really be appreciated.",27Jan2019,1
410,"Both a year long. One was horrific (infidelity) and the other was one sided (me contributing way more).

I'm 36M and have been single for most of my late 20s early 30s as I travelled. Had some flings etc but nothing serious. Wasn't interested in a relationship but was open to trying, and at 33 I did. One girl screwed me over and the other was selfish and cared about her own comfort over mine.

I'm a bit of a dreamer and used to view the world with a little wonder and joy. These relationships switched my view. I'm now cynical and skeptical about relationships and people in general. Being alone I was much happier. I'm alone now and feel I can build a better life for myself but my wonder is still gone and it saddens me. I don't even care to travel anymore.

I feel like people really don't give a shit about you. And we're ultimately alone in this world. I am finding strength in this revelation as I will consider myself more from now, albeit late to realise at 36. But I'm sad that joy has left me.

Is this it? Life sucks without wonder. How do I stop being such a cynic now?",27Jan2019,1

We have been able to park in our lot THREE times since we moved in. The other three spots are taken by the same cars every day, none of whom have permits. We have put notes on their cars, they just take them off. We've put another, larger sign up, they take it down. We've called our landlord and he says he'll get them towed but he doesn't.

This girl and I have known each other since our school days yet in more recent years we have grown apart a lot. There is also a lot that has been done and said and I do not want to be friends with her anymore. 

We used to be like sisters but since I moved an hour away and got a full time job after uni we have barely seen each other and the times that we have hung out there have usually been other people there that I did not know about, alcohol (lots of it and I don't drink yet she gets pissed when I don't and her new friends seem to ""gang up"" on me) or she tells me how much she does not like that I don't visit enough. As if I have the time to travel an hour there and an hour back. I don't drive so there have been times where I've been stranded in this town she lives in. She also has it in her head that my other half likes to control and keep me in our town and not let me visit yet he is nothing to do with it. Her attitude towards him has also begun to piss me off but she isn't listening.

There is also so much bitching going on about another in that group and recently they have started experimenting with all kinds of substances and I am trying to stay out of it. Granted do it while your young but I don't want her to get hurt. I don't want to watch her drink/smoke herself to death.

I have voiced my concerns before about certain topics and they just seem to be brushed off. She has texted me asking to meet and I just want to tell her that I don't want to and I certainly don't want her to come to where I am living as it's not my house (it's other halfs and his parents) and after all she has said about him makes me mad.

How do I tell her without sounding like a jerk or a flake? ",27Jan2019,1
420,"I‚Äôm going to start with why this scenario even happened.

All my life, I was super feminine. Not in the way I dressed or acted, it was my body. I‚Äôm frail and small, and I probably have more estrogen in my body than testosterone. Whenever I transferred schools or had a new teacher, the teacher would always think a girl in my class do my work for me because even my handwriting was feminine. I was assigned a pen pal in foreign language class, and that pen pal was going to come to my school the next semester for foreign exchange. The teacher wanted us to write to that person to get to know them before they came. That pen pal thought I was a girl until they asked, four letters later because they were ‚Äúattracted to me.‚Äù My unisex name doesn‚Äôt help. Because of my femininity, people made fun of me for it. Harassed me constantly. Even my friends joke and call me their ‚Äúgirlfriend.‚Äù And a few days before the assault happened, I found out some boys had a sexual fantasy about me, especially cause at the time my hair was a bit longer, just touching my chin, and was dyed blue and purple. They thought because I had a feminine hairstyle means I‚Äôm asking for it. Apparently, a lot of the boys in my high school have trap fantasies. 

Anyway, you get the jist. Here‚Äôs what happened.

I was at a friend‚Äôs 16th birthday party. I started talking to this guy (M18) and we were just slightly tipsy. I‚Äôm bicurious, so I thought I might as well explore my sexuality since he‚Äôs already getting handsy. Plus, I trusted him. He thought my femininity didn‚Äôt matter, and people are just creepy. We eventually were in the guest room, and to put it bluntly, he was jerking me off. That part was consensual. Everything was going okay until I heard snickers in the room. The room was completely dark, and you couldn‚Äôt see a thing. I thought it was nothing, and it was just the guy I was with. Then it happened again. It sounded like a female, two females. I tell the guy to stop, there‚Äôs someone else in the room. He didn‚Äôt respond. I yelled at him to stop, and kneed him in the face. At this point, I knew there were four people in the room but I didn‚Äôt know who, because there were only four voices that seemed familiar but I couldn‚Äôt quite put my finger on it. I tried to get my pants on and leave the room, but the guy pinned me down. I don‚Äôt remember exactly what he was whispering in my ear, but it was always along the lines of ‚Äústay still‚Äù or ‚Äúwere just gonna have some fun‚Äù and trust me, I was freaked out. I tried to do everything I could to get him off me, but he was stronger. He didn‚Äôt realize he was raping me, because he did everything he could to make me ‚Äúfeel good.‚Äù Surprise, just because you use lube doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt hurt them. And while I was crying and telling him to stop, those four people just watched. I think one even took a flash picture. After he was done, they left me there, door wide open and turned he lights on so if anyone walked in on me, they would think I‚Äôm some creep and kick me out. But, no one walked in. I was just laying there. After an hour or two, I got dressed and left the party. I walked home even though it hurt to take every step.

When it was school again on Monday, I figured out who those four people were. My good friend told me that those four people who I thought were my friends/acquaintances told a lot of people what happened and they pretended that I was a slut and wanted it, and I put on a ‚Äúshow‚Äù for all of them. No one believes I was raped besides that one good friend.

What do I do?

TL;DR- Taking advantage of my femininity, a person raped me and four people watched and told everyone.",27Jan2019,1

427,"Hi, this is my first post so bear with me! I decided to use a throwaway account since my main account username is my fianc√©‚Äôs last name and I‚Äôm not sure if the people I‚Äôm about to talk about use reddit. 

My fianc√© (M 23) and I (F 21) have been together for almost eight years. I essentially grew up with his family, so I‚Äôd like to think I know them pretty well. 

My sister-in-law (25 F) is pregnant. She found out in November and immediately asked me to plan the shower- and by extension, the gender reveal as well. I was excited (because I‚Äôm awesome at planning and have like fifty Pinterest boards dedicated to baby showers for when my fianc√© and I get pregnant). 

About a month later, she tells me she still wants my help, but also recruited her two best friends (same age and sex). I was bummed but as a nursing student who also works third shift, I was happy for the help. I know when we get pregnant, I‚Äôd for sure want my BFF‚Äôs help over my SIL. 

Anyway, she finds out the sex on Jan. 31st and is having a gender reveal the following Saturday. She sends a group chat to the three of us (and MIL) asking if we‚Äôre available on Saturday. I work Th, F, Sat, S and M night and I sleep during the day. I tell her I‚Äôm working and she immediately replies ‚ÄúI thought you worked at night.‚Äù 

Duh. However, this is an entire party. It‚Äôs in the middle of my work week and even though it‚Äôs at 4 P.M., I‚Äôd still have to set up the party + bake the cupcakes. MIL immediately chimes in and says we‚Äôll do the party when I‚Äôm available. This made me feel awkward (because it‚Äôs about my SIL, not me) so I just agreed to Saturday. This is what I signed up for, right? 

Then we start discussing location. She originally wanted to shoot something/blow something up. We‚Äôd only be able to do that at FIL‚Äôs house since he lives in the country. SIL thinks people won‚Äôt drive 30 mins. to the GR so has decided to have it at her house instead. 

I ask about the reveal she wanted to do (which I researched/found links where to buy, etc.). Everyone comes at me with this ‚Äúit‚Äôs freezing outside, are you crazy?‚Äù attitude and I‚Äôm just like ‚ÄúThis is what SHE wanted. I was only asking.‚Äù I felt kind of dumb. 

Everything I had been told suddenly changed and I was playing catch up and being talked down to for simply asking?

The reason I‚Äôm being so sensitive to this behavior is because she has a history of always wanting to one-up my fianc√© (especially when they were teens) and once again, by extension- me. Anytime she ever asked for anything, it was only so she could magically have a better solution. 

Am I being way too sensitive or should I just cut my loses and let her best friends plan it? 

TL;DR My SIL always wants to ‚Äúone-up‚Äù me (and my fianc√©) and even though she asked for my help, I feel like it was only so she/her friends could make me feel dumb. ",27Jan2019,1

So recently, I met this girl. She has everything that my dream girl has, but there is one problem. Me.

So, I am a person that likes to try new things, to be more precise, to take drugs.

I simply love doing drugs, from smoking weed to doing speed, coke, pills, xans etc..

And, I was talking to this girl ( at first she didn't know I was doing drugs ), and after about 15-20 days, she hits me up, with a text, and the text was: "" I like u, but we can't be together, because of the way you live. ""

The text crushed me.

I have left everything. Left drugs. Weed. Cigarettes. Alcohol. E V E R Y T H I N G. for her.

She still doesn't want me.

I won't stop trying.

But I really want to know, how to prove her that i'm not the same.

Some of you may think, "" dude she is making u change, she is not right "". No, I need a change, and I need to change everything about me.

And, I think, that she is the one, that she is the reason I needed to get off these stupid things.

You don't know how many people look at me like a scum. They treat me like i'm garbage.

Well. Im not anymore.

And I don't know how to change the way I live.

437,"I am a sophomore in a small college. Since I got here, one of the longest lasting friend groups I had was with my girlfriend, my roommate, and a friend who for the sake of anonymity I will call Ted. Ted was always a quiet guy but we all got along so well. As freshmen this group would all get dinner together every night, go to see bands play at house shows together, watch movies, hang out, etc. 

Last semester, however, we all started drifting apart. We all still hung out but didn‚Äôt get dinner together every night anymore. My girlfriend had a class with Ted so they were close, and we still spent a lot of time together, just not as much as the semester before. 

In the very end of the semester, about 2 weeks out from finals, Ted went home. He lived relatively close to campus so this seemed only slightly odd. However, as we got through the last weeks of class he didn‚Äôt come back. He then texted us to let us know he would be taking a medical leave of absence, due to his extreme anxiety (which, until this point, we weren‚Äôt aware of. We knew he struggled with depression when he was younger and that he was getting better but we didn‚Äôt know this). This surprised us, and we were disappointed to learn that it meant he‚Äôd have to skip the next semester, the one we are currently in. 

We all tried to keep in contact with him after he left, but we noticed he answered less and less, until he totally ignored us. A few days ago, I reached out to him with no answer. Then, last night, we all received text messages from Ted at the same time. 

He basically told us that his anxiety and self loathing were so bad, that whenever we hung out, he‚Äôd carefully only show the parts of himself that he thought we wouldn‚Äôt hate, and he‚Äôd hide the rest of himself. He said he always lacked the courage to reach out to us and that it‚Äôs not our faults that it escalated to this point. He said he only ever had small talk with us, and hid most of his personality from us because he was so self conscious. He hated himself, and he needed to go home to get proper mental health treatment. He doesn‚Äôt think he‚Äôll ever be able to face us again after telling this to us...

He has decided he won‚Äôt be coming back to school. He wished us good luck and said goodbye.

Then I looked at my phone and it turns out he had already hung up on me. 
How disrespectful is that! He said he needs to go and then just hung up on me no bye nothing. 
And before you say maybe he was going somewhere or needed to do something. No he isn‚Äôt going anywhere nor was he doing anything but playing the game still I looked and saw he was still playing. 

I called him back because that actually got me so annoyed he said because I needed to go I want to go.

I'm 20 and recently became sexually active. My mom has never talked with me about sexual health, and there has always been a tension with her about sexually-related issues. I am realizing how important it is for me to get a Pap smear exam/get on birth control, but I don't know how to bring this up to her, as I am still on her insurance. I also don't have any sisters, so this is a new stage for both her and I. 

&amp;#x200B;

Women of Reddit, how did you bring this up with your mom/family? She knows that I have a boyfriend, and probably assumes that we are sexually active, yet I am so nervous to have this talk with her. She is tense when it comes to intimacy and sexuality, and it has always been a topic that has been swept under the rug during my upbringing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would be appreciated.

I have always had a slightly strained relationship with my parents because our core views on life are quite a bit different and I am fiercely independent but nonetheless they have helped me and I am grateful for that. 

Unfortunately now that help is being held over my head with comments like ‚Äúwell we do this for you‚Äù and ‚Äúwho‚Äôs apartment/car/phone is it?‚Äù. They still pay for many things in my life and I‚Äôm just ready to begin putting financial space between us. They can not understand that. Why would I pay for a phone if they are willing to do it, even though it means they hold control over it. Why would I pay for my own amazon prime account if they have one I can use, even though that means they can see all of my purchases. Why would I have my own Netflix account when I can use theirs, even though that means they can see what I watch. When ever I bring up that I pay for something they seem so offended and taken aback that I would do such a thing when they are willing to provide it for me. My mom can see my bank account and knows when I pay for these things and I feel like I am never able to escape their view. I‚Äôm getting to a turning point and I guess I need to know how hard of a stance I need to take. 

Making it more difficult, I have a brother [20] who is their perfect child. A copy of them and how they think who has no problem using the resources they are paying for. I don‚Äôt think that makes him selfish or non-independent in anyway it‚Äôs just something he is ok with and I‚Äôm not (getting back to those core life view differences).

It was tiring to type, move, and even blink. It happened again today, I was riding in the car, and I just didn't want to do anything except sit there and do nothing.

443,"This is a long post that requires some back story. After a long battle with breast cancer, my wife's sister - lets call her TAMMY died 3 years ago leaving a 3.5 year old daughter with her husband.  Let's call the little girl ANN and her father MIKE. 

In the aftermath of TAMMY's death, my wife - lets call her TRISHA - and I have been taking care of ANN at least 1 night a week, sometimes 2 nights a week in order to give MIKE a break but also because we have a daughter ourselves. ANN is now 6, our daughter is almost 4 so they are close like sisters.

In the 3 years since TAMMY' death, MIKE went off and got a woman in another state pregnant and they had a boy. The babymama and the little boy remain living in another state, MIKE pays child support and visits about once a month.

My wife and I have been enthusiastic about taking care of ANN - she's a wonderful damaged little girl who lost her mom and needs as much love s she can get. But ehre's wehre it gets problematic for us. 

ANN is in school Kindergarten; full time Monday to Friday. MIKE needs to work. We recognize that but he works 7 days a week, often from 10am to 10pm. As we take care of ANN, it is becoming increasingly evident that 5-6 days a week, she is being bounced frmo home to home. Monday she stays overnight at her grandmothers house. Tuesday night at a family friends house. Wednesday is usually spent at the house of MIKES new GF who is totally devoted and a great person. Thursday is a wild card and Friday and Saturday's are often spent with us. The only day that ANN seems to spend at home with her dad is Sunday.

Over the past few months, ANN's demeanor has started to become an issue. I pick her up from school Friday's and lately, she has started to cry and sulk on the way home saying that she misses her dad. As my wife and I talk with her, it has become obvious to us that ANN spends at least 5 nights a week at other's peoples homes, only seeing her dad when he picks her up in the morning to take her to school. This has really started to wear on her.

Her clothes are dirty. When we pick her up for a 2 night stay, her backpack usually does not have clothes to last for her time with us. We have bought her clothes so she has stash of underwear and socks at our house, but MIKE does not know that and we only have them because of the repeated weekends where MIKE has not packed enough clothes for us.

She is already exhibiting signs of an eating disorder - this girl is never full. She eats nonstop - trying to fill the emotional hole in her heart with food. 

Take this weekend for instance. MIKE called us on Thursday, asking us if we could take ANN for 2 nights - we had already agreed on 1.It was not a problem for us so we agreed. MIKE had an opportunity for a cheap flight to go visit his out of state son. So I pick up ANN and she is weepy all the way home. We get home and of course there are no clean clothes in her backpack. She stinks like a little 6 year old girl who has issues wiping her bum and has not had a shower or a bath in 3 days. As the weekend goes on, ANN is becoming more and more distraught. As my wife and i get deeper into the weekend, we come to understand that MIKE has arranged for ANN to spend Friday and Saturday with us, Sunday night with his new GF, Monday with ANN's grandmother, Tuesday night back with his new GF with him arriving home Wednesday morning. So my wife and I just decided to have her the whole time so she does not have to bounce from house to house.

I stop short of calling this abuse and even hesitate to call it neglect because ANN is always cared for, by someone who loves her, it is just rarely her Dad. ANN is a smart kid and understands her dad needs to work, but it is seeming to us that MIKE just does not have what it takes to be an emotionally involved dad. When we see them together, he never plays with her. I've never seen him just hold her and cuddle with her. He seems to fit the pattern of a dad who believes his role is to be the breadwinner and is emotionally unable to offer his daughter what she truly needs - and involved and loving father. If my SIL had not died, this would still be his pattern.

My wife and I have bright up ANN's distress to him and he seems to get it, but nothing ever changes. MIKE is continually unavailable and ANN is increasingly starting to consider my wife and I her mom and dad. It both fills my heart with joy  and breaks it every time she calls me ""Dad""

When it comes to family dynamics, my wife and I are the strong family in the family. TAMMY's parent are divorced  and while ANN's grandmother is around, she is old and a bit frail and unable to step up more. Grandfather is useless.

My wife and I are at an impasse. We are so frustrated with MIKE and this situation and are trying our best to do what we can for ANN but she needs a dad who cares for her, not an aunt and uncle, and a family friends, and a grandmother, and a temporary new GF to insufficiently care for her.

See, they had originally broke up because she cheated on him with a close friend of ours (which is fucked up) and then lied about it. These aren't from false accusations as I had witnessed it and told him. He had confronted her about it and they broke up. Soon after, she was spotted making out with another guy (not even minutes after breaking up) I once again told him and he confronted her about it. She stilled denied everything. They argued and it was done. We went back to my house and hung out. The day after, they got back together. It is now 5 months in and she is constantly (when I say constantly, I mean daily or even more often than that) accusing him of cheating on her an is also constantly hitting on other guys all while still denying present and past actions. She's changing him too. He won't hang out with us (his friends) and is overall controlling. She won't let him do certain things or talk to certain people (and I mean not a word to them).

449,"Alright, background. The Father of my girlfriend of 2 and a half years now passed away in a tragic car accident about a month and a half before posting this, We are in a long distance relationship with her living in Georgia and me living in Florida. We both are 18 and in our senior year of high school. its hard to see each other but on the day her father died I ditched school and bought a last minute ticket so that I could be there that night and I spent the week consoling her and her family and helping around the house. Ever since then, our sexual relationship has ground to a halt and we haven't spent nearly as much time with each other as we used to.

For the first month, I brushed it all off thinking that she just needed time and that she had a lot to think of on her own, plus school was becoming more and more stressful so I could understand why she had less time for me. I continued to give her more space for a month after the accident, and then I find out from her friend that she had cheated on me with another guy who she had told me was just a friend. I didn't talk to her for a few days, and then she called me back in tears asking me to stay and promising me it wouldn't happen again. It's hard for me to trust those words, seeing as how that was the last promise she hadn't broken in our relationship.

It has been about a week now since it happened and she hasn't seen him again, but the problems with us have persisted and we still haven't spent any more time together than we used to. I get the feeling that she already forgot it happened and is no longer apologetic in any way.

The reason I would like to hear some advice is because I am young, all I really want is just to make our relationship work but I'm at a point where I don't know if she feels the same way, and every time I bring it up it just upsets her.

So I'm a housekeeper and I've worked for this family for well over a year now. The family has an extremely long-haired cat that they do not brush. Consequently, the cat becomes very matted. I try to brush the cat whenever I have a second, but my actual work here keeps me very busy and the cat does not trust me much so it's a struggle to get her to stay still even when I do have time.

About 2x a year, after much deliberation, the family usually decides the cat needs to be shaved. When this happens, a cat groomer comes to the home and does it here. Last time the groomer came, I was here working and ended up having to help with the shaving process. The cat groomer does not sedate / tranquillize the cat and does not have anything to restrain the cat with. Thus, I end up holding the cat still whilst she shaves. 

As you can imagine, this is very traumatic for the cat (and for me). The cat howls and is scared and the groomer and I end up very bloody. 

Yesterday, my employers told me that they have scheduled the cat groomer to come to shave the cat this week and it will be while I'm here so that I can help. I have asked if they would consider taking the cat to the vet to be shaved so she can be tranquillized, but they refused. They also refuse to get any sedatives from the vet for the cat. 

For reasons I cannot discuss, I can't lose this job and I feel that I can't refuse to help with this. 

So here is my dilemma, the employers have a bottle of CBD oil. I have researched it and it seems that if I were to give the cat 0.1mg of the oil it would not be dangerous for the cat and could make the process easier. I really don't care if I end up scratched and bleeding, but I hate to see the cat suffer and be scared through this process. 

Is this a terrible idea? I know the cat has no known allergies, including to the oil because the family has accidentally exposed her to it once. I would be devastated if something happened to the cat though. Should I give the cat a bit of the oil?

I run, watch movies and tv with my friends, watch hockey, go bug hunting, and write about hockey. I read for fun during breaks. But I feel like I need an actual hobby during the school year.

477,"I [30/f] guess this is the right place to come for my questions.... sorry if it‚Äôs not, please point me in the right direction.

My mother has been a drug addict for at least 40 years. She used to do crack but the past couple years I believe it was pills like Percocet. 
Seemed like the more hardcore stuff left her quiet and paranoid sitting on the couch. The pills seemed to have her up and doing a million things at once (hyperactive). 

Recently, she started a methadone treatment program. It‚Äôs been about a week. I take her every morning.  But she still seems to be acting the same way. Like she‚Äôs high. 

She can‚Äôt sit still, not sleeping normally (I don‚Äôt know how many hours she gets), her eyes will be closing as she‚Äôs in the middle of doing something, and  she‚Äôs just not her sober self. I‚Äôve seen my mom clean for about a year. So this has me wondering what‚Äôs going on here??? Is it the methadone? Do people on methadone act this way??? She has no money to be getting drugs on top of the methadone so I‚Äôm just really frustrated. She‚Äôs constantly banging around and over compensating her movements, keeping busy, and talking to like try and stay awake or act normal. I don‚Äôt know how else to describe it. It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs exhausted and hyper active simultaneously.... 

I don‚Äôt want to sound mean or impatient but I‚Äôm just to a point where I‚Äôm tired of being a parent. I‚Äôm not. I don‚Äôt want to have to tell a grown woman to get rest because she‚Äôs to the point where she‚Äôs delusional. I feel like if she slept normally she wouldn‚Äôt be acting the way she is. Or does the methadone make you like this?  Because damn I just can‚Äôt deal with it.

Please help me understand what‚Äôs going on here... 
I just thought this program would help her and I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs helping if she‚Äôs still behaving like she‚Äôs on something that‚Äôs clearly effecting her sleep or mental state negatively. 

Any advice would be appreciated. ",27Jan2019,1

481,"My (f19) boyfriend (m27) is a recovering alcoholic. He slipped up last night and drank, and though he‚Äôs never been violent with me before, he choked me. We live together. I don‚Äôt have any friends or family here‚ÄîI just moved in with him from across the country and hope to start school in the spring here. It was about 4am. He used his forearm, not his hands. He wrapped his arm around my throat and used his forearm+bicep choke me.

I was so scared. He was behind me. Reached back and tried to hit him/pinch him in the groin. he just shifted away, but I managed to bite his forearm and he let go. 

It was scary. It went on‚ÄîI don‚Äôt know how long, but I couldn‚Äôt breathe at all. I remember thinking ‚Äòoh my god he isn‚Äôt LETTING GO HE ISNT GOING TO LET GO‚Äô. It felt like my throat was a tube he pressed until it closed. I can‚Äôt get over the feeling of both sides of my throat touching. I can‚Äôt.

We were in the kitchen, I was facing the stove. When he let go I pushed my back against his chest and he stumbled, and because he was so drunk he fell down. I went past him and locked myself in our bedroom. My phone was in the living room. I didn‚Äôt go out to get it. I just cried until I went to sleep. I could hear him crying. He tried to talk to me through the door but I just ignored him and cried. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. I can‚Äôt believe it. This wasn‚Äôt supposed to happen to ME?

Today my throat is sore, but there are no marks on it. Should it be bruised? He wasn‚Äôt gentle at all. Will anyone believe me? If I call the police will it matter since I waited? he‚Äôs passed out in the other bedroom. I can see he‚Äôs got a bite mark from me on his forearm. Should I call the police and tell them what happened on the nonemergency? Or go somewhere and then call them? Also, he has past DUIs, but zero history of violence or domestic abuse (my dad ran a background check on him when we started dating‚Äîthis guy is my first boyfriend, and though it‚Äôs kinda weird, my dad is overprotective and I guess it was a good thing now). 

I‚Äôm scared people won‚Äôt believe me because I waited or because there aren‚Äôt any marks, or because he has a bruise because of me.

484,"There's this 27 y.o. who has started coming out with some of my friends/acquaintances.

Basically he's a spokesperson for [Generation Snowflake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Snowflake), a huge narcissist, add vulgarity and shallowness to the mix.

He's a walking stereotype, is self-obsessed, talks about topics that I thought were only found on Cosmo (magazine), has no manners, and is a drama queen and deadly offended by opinions different from his own.

* ***Walking stereotype***: he's a gay fashion design student and is the least sober person I've ever seen. Bleached hair, furs, leopard print shirts. The vulgarity goes on.
* ***Superficial topics:***
   * ""How long should you wait a person on the first date if they're late"" (30 mins);
   * His fashion design portfolio;
   * Bodyshames people for being slightly overweight (not me luckily);
   * Upsets people he's just started dating by making out with random strangers right in front of them, then justifies saying ""I never said we were monogamous"". I think ""oops I did again"" was more original.
* ***Self-obsessed:*** A couple of people brought to my attention he has an instagram page full of:
   * naked selfies, his genitals covered by an Armani jockstrap;
   * A picture of him with the ""Leaning Tower of Pisa"" that reads ""sorry mum I'm a #sizequeen"". That's the most unoriginal rancid shit I've seen in my life.
* ***Has no manners***: whispers into people's ears right into the front of other people, and if (after the 100th time) you politely remind him it's sorta rude, he'll just accuse you of something completely random.
* ***Is deadly offended by opinions different from his own*****:** Me and a friend once complained a couple at a bar where we were having drinks was making out literally centimetres from our faces. He walked out on us without saying goodbye claiming we're negative and judgemental. My friend apologised, I refused.  
The following day he asked me if I would judge him as well if he were to make out with someone centimetres from my face, I said yes, and he walked again.

I probably sound like a teenager, going into such details, but I don't think I've ever found anyone so unbearable in my life. He tries to make me sound like I'm a douche to everyone else by playing the victim.

488,"Okay so a week or so I met this girl on Tinder. We hit it off really well and messaged each other a ton. We made plans for a date - dinner and Netflix. We met up and had dinner and I thought it went really well, there was literally no lull in the convo, like I thought we were a perfect match. So then, after we got the bill (I offered to pay and she was like okay cool thanks) she seemed to get sussed out and was like I gtg.

So I was like okay shit, guess this date didn't work out. HOWEVER, before she left she hugged me and was like what are you doing next weekend, so I was like okay shit, guess it did go well.

She messaged me after and was like I had a great time tonight, we def. gotta chill some other time.

Okay great, everything's perfect, so, what's the issue?

Well she had't really responded to my messages so after a day I msged her again and was like hey what's up, she's like oh sorry I've just been super busy and resumed the conversation we were having before. So then I was like oh same np, and resumed the conversation, but she never answered. This was a little less than a day ago.

So, I have a few questions. Keep in mind, this is my first real date ever, and she seemed like the perfect girl, like it was too good to be true.

1. On the one hand, why would she say what are you doing next weekend and say she had a great time if she wasn't interested?
2. Am I looking wayyyy too much into this, and I just gotta chill out, I'm sure everything is fine, people have lives you know outside of dating and I just gotta calm down.
3. Should I message her again if she doesn't message me?

491,"Hey guys,

So I've been having some issues with my best friend lately and I don't know if I'm being petty or over exaggerating, which is why I wanted to see what people's opinions were and if I'm being reasonable here by telling her. Sorry if it's long! 

My best friend and I were super close when we worked together, we clicked from the moment we met. I always made an effort with her and because she saw me every day, I felt like she always made the effort back. However recently, we've moved away from each other but still remained best friends.

Lately, she's just made me feel very unimportant. We've arranged Skype calls and catch ups at specific times on specific days, and the past three times she's either got drunk so didn't call, would rather talk to her boyfriend or forgotten. She'll come on Whatsapp often as I can see when she's online, but won't reply to my messages asking if she's still up for the call or not, she'll just ignore. I always make sure i'm ready for her and don't make any other plans, only to get let down. 

She'll be apologetic the next day so I forgive her. It was my birthday last week and she didn't even message me for weeks, she said she wasn't online and didn't see the notification. Again, she apologized. It's just a bit annoying because on her birthday I bought her loads of presents, cut my holiday short to go out with her and made a huge deal. 

I just feel really unimportant and I'm very patient with her, I've never even told her how I feel about this and I always say I don't mind because I don't want to argue. I always tell her I don't mind if she doesn't want to call etc too, but she even makes the plans sometimes but then just doesn't bother on the day. Obviously she can be lovely when I'm around her and is a good friend then, but everything added together just makes me feel always like a last option, and like I'm being squeezed into her schedule rather than her wanting to make time for me.

498,"About a month ago, my ex-boyfriend went on a hack forum to get help. His intentions were to see if I was cheating on him while we were dating, which I was not. A hacker reached out to him and said he can do the job and yes, he is supposed to get paid. And I wasn‚Äôt aware of this.

The hacker hacked into my current boyfriend‚Äôs snapchat and poses as him, trying to break up with me and of course without knowing it wasn‚Äôt him, I thought it was real. I later find out that my boyfriend was logged out of snap and his account was deleted.

I thought that it was my ex doing all this shady shit, so I texted him and he said that he had hired a hacker to get into my boyfriend‚Äôs account. I told him that what he did was fucked up and not cool. 

Several days later, the hacker made an instagram account and started messaging my boyfriend. Basically, he was saying that if he doesn‚Äôt break up with me, he‚Äôll leak my nudes to my coworkers, families, and friends. We ignored this threat for a bit. I mean who wouldn‚Äôt? He had a spongebob profile picture. He made several social media accounts and found my personal accounts. There, he tried to friend me. Snapchat, instagram, twitter, etc. We blocked and ignored him.

The hacker reached out to me and said he doesn‚Äôt like what I‚Äôve done to my ex. And that a whore like me needs to pay for what I‚Äôve done. So he hacked into my old snapchat account and got a hold of my nudes as well as my ex‚Äôs.

Until one night... He started making several instagram accounts and requested to follow both my boyfriend and I. And when i mean several, i mean SEVERAL. That same night, he got on my boyfriend‚Äôd discord server and @ everyone saying ‚ÄúIf anyone wants ____ nudes, I have them lolol‚Äù with a censored image of me. Half an hour later, I get calls after calls from my dad as well as my brother and my mom. My sister texts me and says that he had sent an email with a photo of me to my parents.
My parents were crying and confused. Lost and disappointed from what it seems like. My mom was in the bathroom floor crying for almost two hours wondering why I am like this. ‚ÄúWhat if she gets pregnant? What if she never comes home?‚Äù I‚Äôm a good daughter and I try to be. They thought I was a whore all because of the images I sent to my ex who I dated for a year. Whatever was sent between us should stay between us. It was a serious relationship. 

I got in deep trouble with my family when I got home... And just when you think the hacker was done, he decides to follow the people I followed on my old instagram account. I thought I had put everything on private. But I have a lot of accounts and my old main account was still public. 

I reached out to my local police department and they said since we have no specific information on this hacker and that since the explicit images was sent on snapchat, they have no valid reason to press charges on him. They told me to put all the evidence into flash drive and so I did, but the officer never got back to me. I called him several times and messaged. Still no reply.

Th hacker gathered a lot of my followers and was getting ready to leak my nudes. I tell my ex to tell him to stop, but he says that the hacker does not want to. He already had a bunch of people requesting to see my images that should have stayed between my ex and I.
He‚Äôs already sent nudes of him and I to someone else... Oh and by the way, my ex is a minor, but we dated when we were both minors. Anyway, he wasn‚Äôt done harassing me. So I told my ex to do somethin about it. He still loved me and he‚Äôs the one that brought the hacker into this. 

They made a deal and made a contract on the forum site. That if we do what we‚Äôre told, he‚Äôd stop harassing us and having any form of contact. These were the options.
A: We have to send him explicit images and videos that he wants and if he‚Äôs not satisfied, then he will make us redo it. If not then..
B: He will breach our bank accounts. Not just mine but also my family‚Äôs bank accounts.

Of course in this situation, I chose A. Dumb of me to. Now he just has more videos and images of me. He still hasn‚Äôt stopped harassing me. I deleted all of my social media accounts and the only way to reach me is my number. He texted me this morning saying he will put all 200+ images of me on a drive for my friends and family to see. He now demands more from me. I told him one more is the most I‚Äôll do but he said he‚Äôll stop asking for pictures when he wants to. That‚Äôs an unfair deal. He said it‚Äôs either that or for the whole world to see.

This can potentially ruin my life. My future education, careers and goals. I‚Äôm still young. I‚Äôm only 19... and I don‚Äôt want this to be the reason why my life in 10 years is going to feel so empty and unaccomplished.

I should be focusing on school and work, not this. Have you or anyone you know been through this?  I came to reddit to seek for help and advice.

502,"Details:

 ‚Ä¢ I changed to a new phone over the holidays last Christmas BUT i have still been using my old phone (simless) for miscellaneous tasks.

 ‚Ä¢ my patterns for screenlocks are notoriously difficult (really complicated cuz Im generally a paranoid person), many people have told me so and even though I repeat the pattern in front of them 3 times, no one has been able to replicate it perfectly. 

 ‚Ä¢ my new phone has a new pattern but I kept my old pattern on the old phone. Both are muscle memory for me, I can do both with my eyes closed.

Problem:

Just now (its 4.30am now so around 3.20am) i grabbed my old phone and after drawing the pattern as usual (I wasnt even looking at the screen bec the pattern just comes naturally for me) it buzzed and indicated that my drawn pattern is wrong. And as i tried to draw the pattern again, my mind just went blank. I tried a few of my old patterns and none were correct, I tried my new pattern and its wrong too.. But im drawing up a blank as to what my previous password is. Then I tried keying in the backup pin, and I got that wrong too despite me being an overly cautious person when it comes to my passwords.

Oh and I cant do the google backup login thing anymore bec my sim isnt in that device.. 

I feel very anxious now, I feel like I cant think straight and Im worried that I might be overthinking things. So I need advice on 2 things:

1) if possible is there a way i can get my phone open without factory resetting it? I have my notes recorded in there and theyre precious to me. (my phone is locked now for 30 mins bec I kept trying..)

2) am i overthinking things? because i dont understand how i can just lose that muscle memory that ive had for so long, and just trying to test out more patterns is making my head hurt.

More context: Im 16, no brain or mental issues and am not the forgetful type, especially when it comes to my passwords.

My course of action at the moment is to wait for responses and maybe sleep it off? Im hoping that tomorrow when I awake my muscle memory will randomly come back and ill be able to unlock my old phone again.

Thanks in advance!

IMPORTANT: the more i think about it the more I question whether or not the password i use on my old device is the old password and not the new one.. I never really noticed it because it just came naturally to me and now im so frustrated because my mind is actually blank..",27Jan2019,1
503,"I am 15 years old and have been living in the same apartment for my entire life. My parents have been smoking cigarettes in the house since they moved in without any issue. However, in December 2018, our landlord came down and told my parents that if they continue smoking in the house we will lose ""laundry privileges."" After that, my parents started going outside in the car to smoke. My landlord keeps saying that he smells smoke coming from downstairs, without considering the other people living here. Someone even lived across from us a few years earlier who smoked weed in the apartment on the daily and he never came down to tell them to stop. Anyways, they start to smoke outside. My landlord is still saying he smells smoke coming from downstairs. So one day when my mom goes to do the laundry, she saw a letter on the basement door saying that starting January 1st, the basement door will be locked and we will gave to give him a 24hr notice before we wanna go downstairs so he can unlock it. My dad goes up to talk to him, they get into an argument, and all goes quiet for a few weeks. We've been looking for a new house non-stop since December as we agreed to be out of here by June. However, a few days ago, we get a notice saying that in March, the rent will be raised to $1,000 a month, and will be raised by $500 a month until we leave. He also said that if he smells any smoke, we will be evicted immediately. My dad goes up to talk to him and they start arguing again. It's pretty obvious he's lying about the entire thing as: 1. We don't have any ashtrays in the house at all and 2. He said that he smelled smoke at 2-3am. I can confirm that my dad was asleep at that time, as he had work in the morning and I was still up at that time. When my dad comes down my mom tells my dad that he has been harassing her non-stop about the smoking: Every time she goes outside to do something, he tells her about the smoking. Every time he sees her, he complains about the smoking. We've tried to report him, but he doesn't want to negotiate. How it works is that you report the landlord to this agency and they call him and ask if they want to have a meeting with tenants. If they say yes, you go to the office and try to talk it out. If it doesn't work or they say no, you have to get a lawyer and take them to court, which we don't have the money for. So recently, we've been looking to move out of the city since there are literally no houses in the city that we can afford that we like, meaning I'll have to switch schools. For context, I worked myself into depression and near suicide, I thought about it multiple times and attempted it once, for a year and half straight to get into the school I go to. It paid off, as now I go to one of the top high schools in my city. Obviously, I don't want all of that work to go to waste. Not only that, in elementary and middle school I never had friends that truly cared about me. My old ""friends"" never asked me if I wanted to do something with them outside of school and they never talked to me unless they wanted something. They only wanted to be my friend because I was the ""smart kid."" For the first time in almost 15 years, I have friends that actually care about me and wanna do stuff with me and wanna have me involved. I'm just not willing to give that up. Now back to the houses. My parents talked to us and asked if I was willing to move out of the city and change schools. Obviously, I told them only if we really have to. For some reason, my dad didn't like that answer and got mad that I said that. Now, he won't talk to me and yells at me for stuff I'm not even doing. My anxiety has been going crazy since then and I've almost thrown up multiple times because of it. Keep in mind we talked about it about 2 days ago. Not only that, the depression and thoughts I had back when I was working to get into the school I go to seem to be coming back and it's freaking me the Hell out. It's shitty too because they don't seem to understand why I don't wanna transfer other than that ""I worked to get in there.""

When we were kids, everyone at school knewe that she and her brother smelled, but it got better as we got in to middle and high school. This last month or so she's started to smell gross, there have even been a few days where it's hard for me to sit by her in class. It isn't like she just has days where she doesn't smell great, it's constant. Her family is just the type of people where they're okay with going without showering for a long time. This past summer, they went on vacation to the East coast to pick her brother up from basic. On the way, she got one of those braided fabric anklet type things. She wore it ALL summer, in a ton of lakes, the ocean multiple times and didn't shower for nearly a month while they were on the vacation in their camper. And she still hasn't taken it off. The other week, she had paint on her hands and asked me to tie her shoe quick. I bent down to tie her laces and when I did, I could smell something strong and gross coming from here the foot with the anklet was. Her brother has told her that it's gross and she should take it off but she just rolls her eyes at him. I feel like I need to let her know and it would be better coming from me than from someone else at school. But she's just so sensitive, I know it would break her and make her feel even more insecure than she already is. I've tried hinting by saying things like ""do you smell that?"" but she always says no and blames it on 'middle school boys who need to learn to shower'. My mom suggeested buying a perfume for her and telling her I was getting rid of some and ask if she wants it, but the thing is she has perfumes. She just doesn't wear them. I'm really torn about this. The approach needs to be gentle so that she won't go and cry by herself in the bathrooms and never talk to me again. Thanks for any advice in advance.

I have a group of friends who are super toxic to me and I‚Äôve noticed it for a while (I‚Äôve had confrontations with 2 of them and the others just don‚Äôt seem to care about me, well only superficially they do care). They‚Äôve done some other stuff but it‚Äôs some basic toxic behaviour so I‚Äôll save the details. Now I‚Äôve had toxic friends before who‚Äôve even wanted to report me to the school and accuse me of bullying them in the end (which backfired for them), but it was all direct and super simple to deal with because they couldn‚Äôt hide it. To top it off I‚Äôve genuinely tried so hard to be a kind friend to them and opened up more than I have ever about my problems so it hurts a lot more.

510,"A few months back I started dating a girl I met at my university. Things have been going great, we mesh super well, share interests, and almost every issue that's come up has been solved quickly through good communication and compromise. I've known some of her friends for about as long as I've known her, but only recently did I find out she used to sleep with some of them and still maintain close friendships, seeing some of them almost weekly. One of them she used to work with, and will be working under him again in the coming summer.

She claims that all of these were just relationships that ended amicably, but some of them apparently started and ended over the course of weeks, making it seem to me like she just got bored and started sleeping with friends. Although I've been very open about wanting her to keep her friends, I've also told her how it makes me feel and she tells me to trust her and to move on. There have been some times where she hasn't been honest about personal things in the past, but they were all very minor compared to this. It's a very strange concept to me, as I and all the people I know distance ourselves from flings we've had once we start a more serious relationship.

I just feel uncomfortable knowing that she spends time with people she feels very close to that she also wanted to have sex with. Am I overreacting? Or is that maybe a sign that something else is going on?",27Jan2019,1

I come back and see this sometimes, and as a neat freak, I drop everything and take out the trash. I‚Äôve left the bag there and waited a few hours to see if she intends to take it out, but she never does. Ultimately, I think she waits for me to take it out.

525,"(I‚Äôm on mobile so sorry for formatting issues and also this is gonna be long)

Some background of the people in this story: Both my parents are Latin American immigrants and both went to college in the U.S. and I‚Äôm an 18 year old girl trying to figure out what school to go to.


So I applied to 3 schools and got into all 3, all for majoring in forensic science and one offered me a really good scholarship ($12,000 for all 4 years), but I don‚Äôt want to go there due to the reputation that school has. Truthfully, I‚Äôm not really sure why I applied there but anyways, my parents don‚Äôt seem to care that I got the scholarship and don‚Äôt want me to go there either because of the school‚Äôs rep.

The other two schools are equally as good and I like both campuses. The only issue I have is that one is 15 minutes away from my house (the one I would rather not go to), and the other is two hours away (the one I want to go to). My older brother goes to the school close to home and he has disclosed to me in private that he feels as if he missed the entire ‚Äúcollege experience‚Äù by living at home and having our parents constantly on his back. In front of my parents, however, he boasts about how much he loves the school and how I‚Äôm being dumb for not wanting to go there and wanting to ‚Äúspend money for no reason‚Äù on room and board at the other school.

Both of my parents are super against me going to the school further away, especially due to our hispanic culture. In Latin America, you usually stay with your parents until you‚Äôve gotten a professional job or you are getting married. I think this is kind of dumb just because I grew up in America so I don‚Äôt really see why I would have to live with my parents for so long even though I love them very much. I‚Äôm pretty close with my mom and I love spending time with her, but she can definitely be overbearing and tries too hard to force herself into my life. She worked at my preschool, elementary school, and now my high school. She‚Äôs always trying to be friends with my friends and it‚Äôs really annoying. I think she would mostly be upset at not having me at home anymore, but she‚Äôs also a hypocrite and always tells her friends that they need to let their kids be independent, yet she‚Äôs constantly trying to do stuff for me and never wants to be away from me for too long. I want to tell her that the more she forces me to be with her, the further I want to get, but that wouldn‚Äôt be very fair of me to say to her as she always calls me her built-in bestie. 

My dad grew up pretty poor, but he is very successful now. Yet, he still has the mentality that he must cling to every penny, which I understand and I am grateful for the life that I have due to his sacrifices. He doesn‚Äôt understand the appeal of me wanting to pay more to go to a school far away when we have a perfectly good one close to home. My dad and I have a rocky relationship but we have our moments and I love him a lot, however, we are always fighting about something. I always seem to be tense at home whenever he‚Äôs around because we‚Äôre always annoyed at each other about something. If I were to tell him that I would be more peaceful if I didn‚Äôt live with him, it would break his heart as I am his only daughter and even though we don‚Äôt get along all the time, I know he loves me. Being around him just gives me really bad anxiety because I know we always end up arguing about something. Recently, every week we have an argument about college.

My house in general is very loud. I have two brothers who game a lot so they‚Äôre always speaking loudly with their friends and I get along great with my brothers (19 &amp; 13 years old) and I love them more than anything but I‚Äôm a pretty quiet person and can‚Äôt focus unless it‚Äôs quiet, which my house never is.  I also have a golden retriever who I feel like is always barking, even though she‚Äôs not. I just never feel peaceful in my house unless everyone is asleep or out of the house. I just feel like it‚Äôs super hectic and it doesn‚Äôt help with my anxiety.

I really want to move out. Not because I dislike my family but I‚Äôm getting so annoyed by them and I feel like I‚Äôm gonna explode eventually and I will end up hating them. I‚Äôm already going to switch my major because my parents don‚Äôt want me to do forensic science, so I don‚Äôt even have a say in that. They tell me I‚Äôm free to do what I want but make it EXTREMELY obvious when they don‚Äôt like a decision I made without them. I‚Äôm switching to psychology, which is equally as interesting to me, but it wasn‚Äôt my first choice. I really feel like I need my space from them. I would still visit home all the time; even if I‚Äôm annoyed by my family, I still love them more than anything. I just desperately need the change of scenery and a change in my life that isn‚Äôt dictated by my family. My parents don‚Äôt understand why I want to move out. 

I‚Äôve broken down in tears to them about how I feel like I don‚Äôt have any control on my life, especially after I decided I would change my major to make them happy and they cooled down for a while but are on my back about it again. I know it would be way better financially for me to live at home but I just don‚Äôt think I can anymore. My relationship with my parents is going down the drain over this and I KNOW that if I go to the college close to home I will resent them for the rest of my life simply because I wanted to make them happy. This sounds so dramatic, I‚Äôm aware. I‚Äôm just very independent and my parents just want to make all my decisions for me.

My parents are paying for two years of my college, so I understand why they want me to go down the financially better route, but I have money saved up as I have been working since I turned 14 years old and even got a management position because of how hard I worked. I‚Äôve worked super hard through high school and I am heavily involved in extra curriculars so I feel like I should be able to reward myself with a school I would like to attend at least. I know I sound spoiled but I just feel like I need to get this out somehow. Also, I mentioned the scholarship school because if it was really about money to my parents.... wouldn‚Äôt it make more sense for me to go there, despite their reputation? 

How can I tell my parents that THEY are the reason I want to leave so badly without hurting them? I am also applying to extra scholarships as well, but they still want me to go to the close school, even thought they know I won‚Äôt be happy there. 

I know they just want the best for me, but I just really don‚Äôt want to keep living at home. Why would they let me apply to these other schools if they won‚Äôt even let me go there? Am I being selfish? I really want other people‚Äôs opinions on this as I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy. 

Thanks for reading all this and even if I am being irrational, please tell me. I don‚Äôt want to be unfair to my parents.

TL;DR - I want to move away for college because my parents drive me crazy but they keep finding reasons to not let me leave, mostly due to money. I also changed my major just to make them happy, but it‚Äôs not enough.

The date was amazing, we got on really well and he was a great guy - the talking before, during and after this was good too - however our schedules were so different, it would have been difficult to see each other, we only manage to meet for the date because (and I didn't know this) he took time off work at the weekend and had half day to meet me. 

Now I wanted to meet up again however was unsure as to when we could meet. I said we could meet half-way and try something that best for both of us however he was unsure as he knows that we have different schedules - for example, his day/s off were during the week when I work, my days off are the weekend when he works. 

I asked when we he was free next and he said tomorrow (on my late shift day) or I could go round his after work - I felt like I was put on the spot when he said this and uncomfortable that he suggested that I should go round his - I said sorry I wasn't able to do that as it would be unfair on both of us - and to basically go our separate ways, wished him the best etc. 

Now I am regretting it - I think I acted a bit selfish and could have stated I was uncomfortable and we could work something else out or met up after work during the week at some point. 

I feel like a total arse because he was nice, a gentleman and from what I gathered knew he wouldn't try anything - I should have said something. 

Anyway -  I want to apologise and perhaps suggest starting up talking/dating again - he did state before we went our own ways that he would like to date (me) and would like something long-term - and I said this to him so it wasn't like I suggested I wasn't interested because I was - still am - but feel like I'd be rejected. 

What should I do - should I text him and take a chance? what do I say? Or Should I just leave it and let it be? 

Thank you for reading!

TDLR; Told him we should go our separate ways because our schedules were too different and could hardly meet up - he suggested to meet the next day or go to his after he finish work at the weekend - felt uncomfortable. Now I feel I acted a bit harsh (he is very nice, polite, and made time for me), and would like to apologise and start talking/dating again- should I leave it be or take a chance?

534,"I am about to complete a B.A. with a double major in mathematics and English literature. I knew I wanted to major in mathematics since I started my B.A. I thought I would eventually end up getting a career in this field. After taking a first year literature course I fell in love with it and decided I wanted to do the double major (purely for my own self satisfaction). Now that I am almost finished this degree and have spent years thinking about what career I‚Äôd like to work towards I realized I really don‚Äôt want to continue in the mathematical route. I like math but I don‚Äôt think this is really my calling. On the other hand, English literature feels very natural to me. I have always been a very artistic person so it makes sense that something like literature would be more up my alley than math. Even a former English professor of mine encouraged me to pursue English because he thought I was very talented in this area, whereas I‚Äôve never received any kind of praise from a math professor. I‚Äôm a B average student in my math classes and an A average in my English classes. Recently I have been thinking that I would really like to apply for a Master‚Äôs program in English Literature. I would love to teach first year English at a university or a college. I know that English degrees are probably some of the worse for employment prospects and teaching positions are few and very competitive, hence the question in the title. 

I also recently realized that my desire to go after a mathematical career stemmed from parental pressure. My parents are very old school and lived a very different life than myself. They had their first child at the age of 23/24 and went through two separate immigrations in their lifetimes. They don‚Äôt really see the value of a university education if it doesn‚Äôt directly result in a high paying career, while I do. I‚Äôm not sure how to explain to them that even though pursuing a Master‚Äôs in English might be a poor decision for employability/job security it is what my heart is telling me to do. I really don‚Äôt care about making a below average salary. My happiness in life doesn‚Äôt depend on having ‚Äúnice things‚Äù, but I would like to make enough money to not be stressed out about rent/bills every month. For context, I live in Canada and yes, I still live with my parents.

535,"I'm not the best at words and this might be kind of long. I'll just put a tl;dr at the bottom. Also, I have a tendency to overreact due to being super sensitive. If anyone thinks I'm overreacting, please tell me.

My parents didn't marry each other because they were in love. It was an arranged marriage. They didn't choose each other, their parents did. After they got married, they moved to America and had me and my sister. Right now my dad is 49, my mother is 41, my sister is 10, and I am 13.

My parents argue about a lot of things. And they are very loud, at least to me. I don't know, I'm getting more and more sensitive to loud noises. I'm also sensitive when it comes to being yelled at. No matter who yells at me, I can't help but start crying. That's the way I've always been. I also think I may have anxiety, but I haven't been diagnosed so I'm not 100% sure. My sister is annoying. She doesn't like listening to our parents. And when she doesn't listen, sometimes they hit her. And sometimes they'll hit me too.

My parents seemed to be arguing more and more last year. I don't remember if they had argued when I was younger, my memory isn't the best. Anyways, they always seemed to argue about me and my sister. I had started talking back to my parents. I was also being secretive because I was making friends with people on the internet. I shouldn't even be on this website, my parents would lose it if they found out. Now about my sister. She wasn't doing too good in school. (Her grades were fine though, my parents are just perfectionists.)  She's also addicted to her tablet and she doesn't want to go to school in the morning. My mom has to drag her out of bed, and sometimes she'll even hit my sister.

Back to my parents, they don't know how to talk to each other. All they do is yell at each other. And sometimes they yell at each other in public. And the yelling has gotten worse ever since my sister and I got our blood test results back. We didn't eat healthily or exercise much so you can imagine how they were. This made my father start yelling at my mother about not making us good food.

 He ended up getting us a membership to the YMCA so we could exercise more. But my sister wasn't interested in that kind of thing. This caused more arguing. Today we were supposed to go to the gym. My dad went alone. A few hours later my mom, my sister, and I were supposed to go as well. My sister didn't want to go so my mom called my dad to watch her while we both went.

After an hour in the gym, my mom checked her phone and saw that my dad had sent an email. When she opened the email I read it. I don't have a copy of the email but here's a basic summary. It was titled ""A message from Nobody"". The opening paragraph went something like ""I have decided to write this formal message due to the fact that I am a flop at verbal communication."". Every paragraph after that went something like, ""I want our kids to eat healthier. But you don't have to listen to me, you obviously hate my face and my voice."". The last paragraph went, ""That's all I have to say. You might as well just ignore me and pretend I don't exist because I am a useless father."". 

It was so toxic. He tried to write it as an apology but it was not a valid apology. He was basically guilt-tripping my mother into accepting it, calling himself useless in every paragraph. A valid apology would have been something along the lines of, ""I'm sorry for yelling at you so much but I'm just worried about our children."". And the thing is, I've noticed that both my parents seem to do this guilt-tripping thing a lot. Every time I'd argue with either one of them, they say things like ""I buy you whatever you want and you still treat me like I'm trash."" or something like ""Maybe I'll just die, you won't care.""

I don't know what to do. Every time I try to talk to them about these things either they start yelling, I start crying, or both. I don't me or my sister to live the rest of my life like this. What should I do?

TL;DR My parents argue a lot. Sometimes they hit each other or me and my sister. They have become incredibly toxic and started guilt-tripping. My father even went as far to send my mother a formal email with a whole lot of guilt-tripping. I know they're going to argue even more and I don't know what to do.",27Jan2019,1

537,"So, my dad's best friend is coming to stay with us for a few weeks while we move. They've known each other for 40 years, and he's stayed in New York while my dad's moved to the Philadelphia area for work. The friend, who I will call X, is currently out of a job, so so my dad has offered to  teach him how to work for him and let him stay with us while we move. My father is divorced and has a serious girlfriend, who has 2 kids. I am the oldest of 5 children, and all of us are under 15.
 
Some background info on X- 
He's been divorced and has remarried once, and has 3 children with his 2 wives. We've known him since we were little kids. We used to go camping with him in the summer, but because, as I stated before, he lives in New York State, and we live close to Philadelphia, we could never stay for more than 2-3 days. As far as I know, he's never hurt any of is kids, but I'm getting a bad feeling.

My 2 sister and I are all between 10-14, and I'm worried about us. X tends to get drunk, according to his son (around 11), but he's never gotten drunk around us. I love my sisters, and I don't know what X will do if he gets drunk. 

I want to do everything to protect my sisters, but he is much taller and stronger than us. What can I do to make sure they don't get hurt? They have both expressed concern about X, and I will do anything to make sure they don't get physically or  sexually assaulted.

TLDR: My dad's friend is staying with us in a few days, and I'm concerned he will get drunk and hurt me or my sisters",27Jan2019,1

I have a couple other friends but he was the only one I could genuinely talk to and had the same interests as me. Although neither of us ever felt any romantic attraction in eachother.

Basically I miss him, a lot. I wanna know how to get over this and how I can form other friendships like the one I had with him.

541,"I'm getting so frustrated with dating lately. I do not want to date random people anymore. I want commitment so badly but the women I ask out do not want to touch it.  All they want to do is pump and dump. Hilarious right cause the gender roles are typically reversed, but that doesn't make me any less done with it.

I think it's partially do to my job. I'm an artist who's doing alright, but not great. So maybe women are off put by the lack of security in what I do? Sometimes I feel like the women in my life are just tourists. I had this girl come by my house a while ago because she wanted me to teach her how to do some printing. Fine. She gets here and we make a design and have a really nice conversation and I genuinely like her. We seem to get along really well. We flirt but it doesn't go further than that. Well we say we'll set aside the printing for another day and she leaves saying she had a great time and wanting to do something the next week. I legit never hear from her again, she doesn't respond to my (not even needy!) texts. She asked me to do this, not vice versa. We used my supplies. Just wasted my time.

Then another more recently. We have a lovely date and we hook up and have great sex for a couple hours. She leaves saying she wants to do that again. I send her a text a week later and she's gone completely cold on me. I have not a clue in my mind what could have caused this as we had good chemistry. 

These are two examples out of countless times this happens. I'm so tired. Most women who ghost after fucking me say they're sex positive people and are generally liberal.

I would happily date a conservative person who in my experience maintain relationships better but conservatives don't seem attracted to artists. 

So I feel like I'm at a crossroad. I could just let the romantic part of me that wants a relationship die, and I'd probably have no problem finding people to hook up with. Or I could keep up this dream of finding someone to love but always get let down. 

&amp;#x200B;

A bit of a rant. I know. Any input or advice would be so welcome. I'm just getting lonely and I'm tired of needing to find someone new to date every month.

542,"Posting this on a throwaway because she has reddit.

My girlfriend and I have had a rough couple of months, she's been having outbreaks of her depression and anxiety attacks weekly, and I made some pretty shit decisions. Usually we were super close, with all the trauma bringing us closer in a weird way. But lately, it kind of seems different.

We live in different states of the US, but she's been emotionally distant lately as well. She doesn't call me unless I express frustration at something to calm me down. She's been trying to push me away because she seems to think she is not good enough for me and is just weighing me down, but this isn't the case and she won't listen when I tell her so. I've tried calling her today and she didn't pick up when she had just messaged me on another platform.

It's possible she's just been busy lately, but she hasn't really told me about anything going on. All of this stuff combined with the distance between us has me worried like crazy that she might be spending time with somebody else.

549,"This isn't really a serious post, rather I want to find a way to communicate with her to prevent something like this from happening again. 

Due to my current living situation, I am currently living out of my grandmother's basement (insert neckbeard joke here) while working at a design firm nearby. My Grandmother speaks little to no English, but we worked a system where we can understand each other at simple terms.

Now, when I got up this morning, I found that both my workspace and bathroom were tidied up. At first, I was both confused and delighted, up until I discovered the large trash in the middle of my workspace. I looked through the trash bag, and found that she had not only thrown out trash, but also art supplies (guides, acrylics, etc.), important documents and medication (Thankfully, this medication was expired, so this wasn't bad), and photos of me and my siblings. After thoroughly looking through the trash and digging out my personal belongings, I asked my grandmother who cleaned out my basement. She then began to tell me (in broken English) that because I am a man, I don't know how to clean, and thus she went downstairs to clean out anything she deemed as trash. She then told me that next Saturday, she wanted me, my uncle and her to go through everything to throw out everything that was ""bad"".

I understand that my 90-year old Greek grandmother doesn't really know better, and I called up both my father and uncle to ask for advice on the matter. I want to tell my grandmother that while I appreciate the effort and care that went behind the cleaning spree, I would like to have been notified before hand. Plus, my grandmother can barely go down the stairs, so I think it would be better if I was to clean out the basement without the risk of her possibly falling down and becoming injured.

What would be a good way to prevent something like this from happening ever again?

How do I confront them about this? I‚Äôm deeply hurt and disappointed ",27Jan2019,1
554,"I‚Äôm sorry for the super long post. I‚Äôll put a tl:dr at the bottom. 

When I was 21, I was studying a film and television course at a community college. I began a relationship with my teacher who was 30 years older than me. The college immediately wanted to fire him but his head teacher battled for him and said they needed him so we continued to have a relationship and everyone involved in the class knew about it. The only rule was that he wasn‚Äôt allowed to make my assignments. 

The relationship went on for ten years. We bought a house together but because of his age and health issues (as a result of being a former drug addict, he needed a liver replacement and had developed cancer) we were less and less in a physical relationship. It basically became like we were room mates. Me being in my 20‚Äôs/early 30‚Äôs, this was very frustrating for me but because I‚Äôm not good at confrontation and the fact that I didn‚Äôt want people to think I was a terrible person for leaving a guy with cancer, I stuck with him. 

Flash forward to 2015. The tenth year that we were together, three months short of our anniversary. It had become normal for us to take separate holidays. I would go to the USA to visit my cousin and he had been to Thailand a couple of times. It was just after he had arrived home from one of these trips, I‚Äôd driven four hours to collect him (we lived in a country town a long way from the nearest international airport and I wanted to save him another plane ride). We were spending the night at his sister‚Äôs place before heading home the next day. While in his sister‚Äôs spare bedroom, surrounded by all the stuff he was unpacking, he pulled out a small bag and gave it to me. It had a massively gaudy blue ring in it. In about the least romantic proposal I could ever imagine, he said that it was an engagement ring and would I marry him? I was shocked and didn‚Äôt know what to say. Panicking I said yes but immediately left the room and rang my best friend and asked her what to do. She said to be straight up and say that I wasn‚Äôt interested in getting married. I did this and he accepted the answer and said that we should never talk about it with anyone. Ok. 

The next day we had lunch with another one of his sisters and her husband before hitting the road to head home. When we left and had just started the four-hour trip, he told me that he admired the sister and her husband‚Äôs relationship despite the fact that he‚Äôd been caught having affairs in the past. I was like umm ok. He then told me that on his previous visit to Thailand (not the one he‚Äôd just come back from, the one the previous year), he had gone to a massage parlour. He told me that whenever he went to get a massage he would explain that he had a girlfriend and wasn‚Äôt interested in anything except a massage. But on this occasion he ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù got a happy ending. I was shocked and asked how that ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù happens? He went on to make lame excuses and that the woman wouldn‚Äôt stop so he just went with it. 
I told him that I would accept a lot of things but to let that happen and then to hide the information for a year because he didn‚Äôt have the guts to tell me was unacceptable and I no longer wanted to be in a relationship. It felt like a godsend really. The excuse I needed to get out. 

Flash forward three years, the house has been sold, I‚Äôm with a new guy, we‚Äôre engaged to be married this April. 

To this day my ex is still doing anything he can to get my attention. Before the house we owned together was sold he would often just happen to walk past it several times a day in case he could see me because I was still living there. He would respond to every single post that contained me and my new boyfriend on Facebook. One day I called him out on it and said that it came across as creepy. He went off at this and got really angry saying how much he doesn‚Äôt like the new guy and how he doesn‚Äôt know anyone who does. That I was being unreasonable and that he was just trying to point out that he was happy for us. I pointed out his comments where he‚Äôd often say things like ‚Äúlook at you two, oh I am so happy‚Äù and how they were about him and not about me and my partner. I think that helped him realise because he said ‚Äúoh I did make it about me...‚Äù he then unfriended me but within a couple of weeks I started getting friend requests from him again. I always ignored them but he would occasionally revoke the request and then send it again to try to get me to notice it I guess. 

He regularly wants to see the dogs we had together. I‚Äôm usually ok with this although on the last occasion, our very old golden retriever with horrendous arthritis collapsed while we were out. Instead of helping me pick up the 32kg dog, get him to the car and then to the vet, he filmed the whole thing and then posted it on Facebook for attention. 

While I was trying to clean up the house to sell it, he never offered to do anything to help. One day he asked if he could see the dogs at the local farmers market. I arranged to meet him there at 9am and was then planning to go to the house to continue cleaning. He rang me at 9:15 while I was there waiting for him with the dogs, to say that he wasn‚Äôt going to get there on time. I took them over to the house with me and was on my hands and knees scrubbing the laundry when I could hear that he was next door visiting the neighbour. He rang me when he was leaving and said that he was going to the markets and didn‚Äôt think he was up to walking the dogs the whole way there. I told him to have fun then and just continued what I was doing. He rang 45 minutes later and said I must have misunderstood, he had wanted me to stop what I was doing and drive the dogs over to the markets so he could see them there. 

When he found out we were engaged he messaged and said how happy he was for us and that he hopes he gets invited to the wedding.  When the money came through for the house he offered to give me back some as a gift and suggested we could use it to pay for the wedding rings. When we meet up for him to see the dogs, he‚Äôll often have small gifts for me or my partner. 

Just this morning when I woke up and checked my notifications, He had liked or commented on everything. There were dozens of notifications. I could see that he‚Äôd gone right through my Facebook profile and had liked anything that I‚Äôd accidentally shared with the privacy set to public going back to posts from last year or anything that included mutual friends (we are not friends on Facebook).

I have let him continue to follow me on Instagram so he can see pictures of the dogs and at least I can feel like I can regulate what he has access to. 

I‚Äôve explained to my mother that this attention from him is unwanted and makes me feel incredibly uneasy, weird and just generally creeped out. She wants me to be sympathetic to him and understand that he‚Äôs lonely and misses me. I just want to be able to move on with my life without feeling like he‚Äôs constantly watching me. I‚Äôve tried to move on with my life and I really just want to get away from him. I just don‚Äôt know what to do to get him to stop. Any advice would be incredibly appreciated. 

TL;DR ex-boyfriend hasn‚Äôt moved on from relationship that ended three years ago. I‚Äôve been told to feel sorry for him even though he‚Äôs the one that‚Äôs making me feel like I‚Äôm being stalked. ",27Jan2019,1
555,"I live in a household that already has two elderly cats. They're both very overweight, and apparently have been since they were young. I'm concerned for their health but they're not my cats, so it's not my place to bring it up, though I have expressed this concern with my roommate. We recently brought in a young kitten, under a year old. She gets along with the eldlery cats just fine after we spent some time acclimating them.

The problem is that the other cats are free fed. Basically the owners of the other cats just dump an absurd amount of food in a big bowl in the morning and refill it every day, sometimes twice a day. The kitten has been eating from this bowl now that she's free in the house. She was a bit skinny when we first got her, but she's gained lots of weight and I think she's at a healthy point now. But, of course, there's no way to stop her from eating more and becoming overweight.

We live in a cold place, and while I could take her for walks in warmer seasons, it's out of the question right now. I do try to play with her often, up to an hour and a half every day spread out in a few sessions.

559,"So the other day I got the idea to basically tell a girl that I have had a huge crush on for at least 7 or 8 years that I think she's beautiful and has an amazing smile. (A little back story, it's  not like we have ever been super close, but we do know each other and if we're together we'll talk and get along really well, we've just never really spent any time along together and never got to be super close friends)

Now in my head I couldn't stop thinking about it and wondering how she would react. So after writing a short but well worded message to send her and then spending hours debating if I should actually send it or not, I finally got the balls and hit send, basically deciding what did I have to loose. 

Now her response to the message itself wasn't anything more than I really thought I'd get. She said she was speechless, and said thank you, and really glad to hear from me. And this was basically what I kind of expected. I didn't think it was going to make her confess some feelings she had for me or anything, so it went about as well as I could hope short of her doing just that. 

She did one other thing though that has me wondering. I sent the message over Facebook, and Facebook has an option to react to messages. Well awhile after she had read the message I sent her she also went back and liked an older message I had sent. That message was saying if she ever had some free time and wanted to hang out to let me know. Now I don't want to sound overly optimistic, but that sounds like a good sign to me, what are other people's thoughts? I feel weird asking her about it because I guess it could have been an accident, but to react to a message you have to hold down on it and select how you want to react, so I find that a little less likely. I just don't want to get my hopes up, and I also don't want to keep messaging her, and accidentally pushing too much and pushing her away, it's taking every ounce of my being to just play it cool, but I wanna know if I'm crazy for thinking its a good sign.

And yes I know it's lame to do this over Facebook, but I rarely get to see her in person so who knows if I'd ever have a chance to actually tell her this in person.",27Jan2019,1

All of this negative bullshit fills up in me and I want to explode but I keep it in and put my damn phone aside for a while...then there's texts 'IM sooooo sorry my phone got disabled/ I'm sorry for responding late babyyy my this friend my that friend blah blahh' it's like brainwashing the hell out of me and putting flowers in my wounds... seriously. Then I just go along and tell him its okay...(indirectly: it's okay that you ignored me when I needed you the most go fuck yourself)

4. Recently something really broke my trust and pissed me off. It's a small thing that doesn't matter at all as he comments on every girls pictures. Well my ex best friend who I'm not on good terms with posted a picture and I saw him damn comment right under it 'ooohh wow *crossbow and heart emoji*' like seriously after all the time hes been telling me hes toxic and I made the right decision to let her go he still cares about her!!!?. Wow

**Tl;dr** I don't know if I'm crazy or what. I feel like punching the wall until my hand bleeds. Despite the fact that I've already done that. I can't be mad at him because he's sooo nice on top of all that...planned to hang out with me twice, we hugged. He says he loves me all the time but it all may be a second face of him..I don't know how to solve this problem. Maybe some advice would help.

563,"Ever since I went through puberty, they have done this. Back then, they used to comment about the changes in my body. They used to stay stuff like ""You're getting boobs!"", ""Ew, your face is bumpy!"", or ""Ha, you've your period!"". I don't know what it was, but those words cut deep. I developed a dysmorphia over my body. I used to wear baggy clothes all the time to cover everything. Today I'm trying to get over it since I'm older, but they still do it. Now they love to say I'm PMSing when I'm even somewhat grumpy or mad. I know my body and it's not that. Sometimes I can just be mad and it doesn't have anything to do with my period. I want to fight back at them and tell them off, but they'll just claim it's PMS. It's so nerve wracking and I want them to stop. I've told them to stop before, but they won't. As a matter of fact, they will say stuff like that just to piss me off. 

Also my mom has always wanted me to be super feminine. For example, I wanted to buy a masculine shirt (just around the house, it didn't go well with anything) and she said no. She said I will look like a dyke and people will make fun of me. She does this with a lot of things. For example, when I cut my hair to my shoulders (lice outbreak), she said she was mad. I then asked her what she would do if I shaved my head. She said, ""I would be disappointed because it would make you look like a dyke"". I would never want to cut my hair, but that hurt me. She claims she is accepting of gay people, but when I do anything remotely masculine, she flips out. She would love if I became super feminine, but I'm just not that. I love my mom, I just hate when she does this. ",27Jan2019,1
564,"TL;DR: my brother‚Äôs wife is controlling him and was keeping him and my niece away from my mom, my dad and me. It‚Äôs gotten worse since my dad died, and now my mom and I can‚Äôt see him or my niece at all.


My brother has been married to his wife for 5.5 years (dated for 5 years) and they have one child together (21 months). Prior to meeting my SIL, my brother was always close with our parents and me.

Once my brother got married, we started seeing him less and less. Nine times out of ten when my brother would invite us to visit, my SIL would have some reason at the last minute as to why we can‚Äôt go- she needs to study for an exam, she has a play date, she wants time to herself etc. When my niece was born, we didn‚Äôt get to meet her until 2 months later, and when we went (we live in Canada and they‚Äôre in the US), my SIL took the baby to her parents for extended periods of time and just had us sitting around waiting- one time for 9 hours.

My mom (64F) and dad (74M, recently deceased) tried talking to my SIL last year about how we feel like she doesn‚Äôt want us there and that we don‚Äôt feel welcome. When my dad told her he feels depressed over not seeing his son and granddaughter, my SIL told him that he can‚Äôt just come whenever he wants and that he has to negotiate if he wants to visit.

In August of last year, my dad was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. My mom asked my brother and his wife to come with the baby for the September long weekend, since we knew pancreatic cancer is essentially a death sentence (side note: my brother and SIL are both doctors so they didn‚Äôt need us to tell them this). Only my brother came because my SIL said she didn‚Äôt have enough vacation time.

A few weeks later, my dad ended up in hospital unable to walk or eat and his cancer was getting worse. I contacted my brother to let him know, thinking he‚Äôd be on the next plane, but he instead just told me he‚Äôd talk to me the next day. I told my mom about the odd conversation and I said ‚ÄúI bet you he‚Äôs hiding something. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs at home.‚Äù My mom called him and got no answer, so she called my SIL‚Äôs mom to look for my brother. As it turns out, his wife really wanted to visit her friend in another state, so she and my brother took a mini vacation to visit her friend instead of coming to see my dad.

Two weeks later, my brother finally came on the day that my dad was getting disconnected from everything and was going to die. My brother cried and cried and told my dad how sorry he was that he didn‚Äôt make it in time (my dad couldn‚Äôt talk but he could still hear).

A couple months after my dad passed away, my brother told my mom that she could stay with him and his wife while I took some time to myself (I was my dad‚Äôs caregiver, POA, Executrix, and I now live with my mom to be a support to her). Two days before my mom was supposed to go, my brother called to say that my SIL didn‚Äôt want my mom there. My mom, figuring enough is enough and she‚Äôs got nothing left to lose, decided to go anyway. She rented her own car and got a hotel. She showed up with the intention of sitting my SIL down once and for all to tell her that something needs to change. Well, my brother invited my mom in, and my mom got her chance to say what she wanted to say. However, my SIL took off to her mom‚Äôs mid-conversation and came back 3 hours later with *three* cops to escort my mom out. My mom left willingly, as my brother stood by and did nothing to help our mom.

That was a month ago and now my brother and my mom are talking again, but my brother is saying that he can only have a relationship with us over the phone when his wife isn‚Äôt around and that he‚Äôll *try* to visit us on his own. I‚Äôve mentally checked out (grieving the loss of my dad, and taking care of myself and my mom are my top priority) but my mom is devastated and still hanging on.

What have you done in a similar situation? What would you do if this was your brother/son?",27Jan2019,1

567,"So, I have a friend who has recently been diagnosed with psychosis and has just come out of a psychiatric ward, (we think she has been slowly getting ill for a while).

 about a week prior to all this happening she had met a guy in a bar and she feels like she is in love with him, she felt a similar way about her last boyfriend, met him and quickly got emotionally attached to him, her family thinks that that could be a sign of the psychosis as this is abnormal behaviour for her.

After getting out the hospital the guy is still trying 
to peruse the relationship even after being told exactly what has happend and what kind of mental state she is in. She has been on dates with him whilst having people there (basically escorted and had an eye kept on her), he apparently has also been asking her to go round to his alone so they can hang out but for obvious reasons she hasn't been allowed.

she lituerly has lost touch with reality and is talking nonsense most of the time (things like being in a wolf pack and thinking she has pet dragons) she has to be escorted everywhere she goes.

I really can't help seeing this whole thing as a massive red flag and need advise on how to handle this, I know nobody has the right in dictating who she can and can't see I'm just extremely concerned that he is trying to take advantage of her and me and her family are really stuck about how to move forward with this.

If anybody has had a similar thing happen could someone advise on what to do, this is an extremely sensitive situation and the last thing we want to do is make her agitated and potentially put her in a worse mental state or make her feel like she can't trust her family any more.",27Jan2019,1

I was tasked with training this individual and they sort of attached themselves to me. I invited them for lunch a few times at the beginning of their employment to get to know the other staff and to help them feel comfortable in our office. After getting to know this coworker a little bit I realized I did not like their personality and felt that they were deceitful and spiteful and did not want to get to know them further. There were a number of red flags for me. 

This coworker has become somewhat obsessed with me. They text and email me constantly trying to start a conversation. They spend lots of time hanging out at my cubicle talking about personal issues and they have found my social media and followed me. I removed them as a follower and they noticed immediately and asked me about it. I deflected the question and stopped being as friendly. This coworker continued to ask me every day, multiple times a day, about my social media and sent repeated follow requests. I told them that they were making me feel uncomfortable and I did not want to have them on social media. I explained that I was a private person and wanted to keep my work and personal lives separate. My coworker told me they would never ever disrespect me and they just admired me so much and wanted to me just like me, and hoped that I would let them follow me in the near future. I thought that was weird, stopped being friendly to this person and continued with my work. I also blocked their social media.

This coworker has continued to send me text messages and emails, through work, about how much they admire me and want to be like me and don't understand why I won't be their friend. This coworker sent a final text on Friday asking me why I hated them when they just wanted to be a part of my life and again, admired me so much and wanted to be just like me. I responded with ""Thank you."" and blocked their number. 

On Friday night I received a social media request from a person I have in common with this coworker. Coworker has told me how close of friends she is with this person, and has sent me photos of the two of them. The person I have in common is someone I worked with 9 years ago. I have not had them on my social media for almost a year. We have not interacted or spoken since we worked together 9 years ago. It was obvious to me that this was my coworker trying to spy on me through a friends account.

I feel very uncomfortable, harassed and almost stalked. I felt I have made my feelings clear before but this person won't take no for an answer. Should I confront them?

569,"Hi Reddit,

So first, a bit of a backstory:
I just started my first education (architecture) and am now in 3rd period of the first year.

I've been telling my parents that all was going great at school, except it didn't really. I messed up 2 tests in the first period, had a resit and messed up those as well. I haven't told them this yet. The thing is if I mess up the tests again I will fail. I want to tell them but I can't seem to build up the courage to tell them. I'm afraid off their judgement. They will probably be dissappointed, but supportive with me. I can't stand myself for not telling them this earlier. Besides that everytime I got a bad grade, I went into a weird spiral of thinking: 'what if this isnt the right education?'. I'm quite used of doing things easily in school, which doesn't seem to help this situation. This has been bugging my mind for a few days now.

577,"Sorry for spelling mistakes. This just happened so I‚Äôm emotional and I‚Äôm on my phone.

A week ago I (m18) decided to finally cut ties with an annoying friend (f18). I did this because she has had a pattern of causing troubles in my friend group and never understanding how her actions could make people sad. To give you a picture of her: One time at a good bye party I threw for a friend she tried talking to someone that used to have a crush on her (but they had there own massive fight so now that is over) she presumably wanted to talk about the crush but he didn‚Äôt want to (and he was drunk so not in a good mind space). The person for who the goodbye party was for stepped in to make sure things didn‚Äôt get ugly between them. The bad friend then started yelling and screaming that she was happy the leaving friend was moving away from us.

At a certain moment (a month after the goodbye party) I got to a tipping point and decided to message her that I didn‚Äôt want to be her friend anymore. So I messaged her in a polite way and it obviously ended in somewhat of a fight. But I thought whatever because I was finally done with her. I threw a party later that week and didn‚Äôt invite her which was also part of the reason why I had cut ties with her so I didn‚Äôt have to invite her and let drama happen.

Now move forward a week and some of my very closest and best friends or giving me flack for how I treat her (ignore her, comment on how bad she is, don‚Äôt invite her to parties). Now I‚Äôve also had a long fight with my best friend (f18) on it who kept putting words in my mouth and essentially saying I was horrible for closing her off.

I don‚Äôt know what to do now. I feel in my gut that I did nothing wrong but I have a very very bad habit of needing everyone to like me. Ever since I cut ties with her I felt like a bad person. I am usually a very  kind person that doesn‚Äôt hate anyone. I also have a long history with mental illness and depression and suicidal thoughts (up to today) which means that you betcha my mind just made me feel ten times worse than ever before. I feel extremely bad right now to the point that I want to throw up. Part of me wants to apologize to the bad friend just so that all of this ends but another part thinks I shouldn‚Äôt.

My mental health problems are putting me in a real down spiral at the moment and I can‚Äôt call my therapist at 12 am. Usually I would talk to my best friends but... obviously I can‚Äôt right now.

587,"I have had the same group of friends since elementary school. We have always been that group of friends that would just go home and play video games all night. We were a group of 6 and most of us have been playing together consistently since we started.¬† 

Throughout High school many people have came into the group from one of my friends but very quickly after they joined someone from the group didn't like them and they fade them out. Recently we added another group of 4 friends. It brought our friend group up to 10 which is the first time they have ever brought more than one in at a time. 

Over the months we have been playing online I noticed my old group doesn't have anything in common with them and are making the moves to fade out the other group. Stuff like making new calls and just going offline and still playing with each other. This should seem normal to me and I should of expected it but I don't feel the same way about this group. Two people from the new group are super enjoyable to talk/play with and I feel closer with them then I did with some in the original group. The worst part is right before I even noticed they wanted to fade them out I was talking to one of kids from the new group and found out they basically joined our group because their old group of 8 had a huge argument and split but joining our group helped them a ton. 

At this point I don't know if I should say anything to the new group about what's happening. I also don't know if I should stay with my old group and join the new group. I feel like I'm the middle ground between the two groups and I'm just being tugged on by both sides.",27Jan2019,1

2. How do I socialize with my coworkers (especially during breaks)? 
3. How do I prepare for my first day?

593,"Hello everyone

I've been leaving for one year in a tiny apartment with my father and it's become a bit unbearable.

The flat is 20 m2(s) and composed of two rooms and one bathroom. The two rooms are right next to each other, with few isolation.. Basically, there's one room for my father and one room for me. The size of the apartment is not what bothers me the most. Actually, to get to the bathroom/toilets, one has to go through my room. Which means nearly no intimacy. I was against taking this apartement one year ago, bu my father was like ""This is the one. I don't want to wait"". He doesn't seem to realize that this space organization can cause some trouble, especially for a 19 F. Whenever I close my door (the only thing which can give me some space), he becomes angry. I also have a boyfriend who leaves in a dorm. So, most of the time, when we want to stay at someone's place, we have to stay at mine.

I asked subtly my father if there's was a way we could move to a different flat, and he didn't understand. He could ask the State for social housing but he told me that he won't do it before november at least, since we moved out less than a year ago.

My mother kicked me out when I was 17 since she didn't agree with my college options, so coming back to my mother's place is out of the question. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe this situation has no solution, but do any of you know any housing solutions which could help me move out of this flat ?

Sorry for the long message

Have a nice evening

Recently I found myself homeless due to some extremely stupid circumstances. I'm not very close with any family or have friends I could roommate in so I turned to the only family member I speak to for a temporary place to stay. She lives in government housing, pays no rent, very little towards utilities, and does not work. I told her that in return I would pay for her to get and keep wifi and pay the $30 utility bill in return, and whatever little household supplies and she agreed. Now here is the problem. I had previous knowlege that she was a messy person. When I walked into her house for the first time (I helped her move in origonally and hadnt been there in the past 6 months) it was a complete horder situation. Not even just a bunch of things, TRASH PILED EVERYWHERE. I was full on gagging amd having a mental breakdown but just sucked it up and spent 3 entire days clearing it all out and making it a livable space for me. I stay with my boyfriend 2-4 days out of the week when he isn't in school but he lives w his parents and he isn't in a position to move out plus we haven't been together long enough for me to even bring that up. EVERY. TIME. I leave and come back from his house her house is in the same condition as when I first moved in. I sleep and have my personal items in the living room(I don't have many material items I care deeply about but the few I do own [personal journals, books, crystals, and my tarot cards] HAVE ALL BEEN SCATTERED ON THE FLOOR UNDER THE TRASH AND I'M READY TO KILL MYSELF. I'm stuck in this cycle of cleaning, working, escaping, and cleaning. Today she has the nerve to ask me for a rent payment!!!!

607,"So, I'm pretty sure I'm in love with my friend. I say ""pretty sure"" because there are moments where I question myself and my feelings and I can't quite settle on how I feel. Part of that is due in part to the fact that I know there is a 90% chance it'll never happen. Let me give you a backstory:

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 24 year old woman. I've always considered myself straight, until now, and I still am not sure how to label myself. My friend is also a woman and she's 38 years old. As if the 14 year age gap isn't complicated enough, she is married and has two kids, ages 11 and 13. She's pretty happily married but has some issues with her husband, as any married couple might. They have a beautiful house together that they moved into \~2 years ago and are still renovating it slowly. The point here is to emphasize that they're solidly together. As far as I know she is also 100% straight. But, there have been moments where she will say or do things and how she says or does them comes across as a bit flirty. She has never mentioned being into women at all nor hinted at any sort of homosexual encounter.

&amp;#x200B;

I met her four years ago when we worked for the same company. I no longer work there so I don't see her as often. I've been denying the feelings I have for her for a long time. I don't typically believe in ""love at first sight,"" but the moment I met her and we made eye contact my world stopped for a brief blip in time and I thought she was the most beautiful person I had ever seen. It was a fleeting moment but I truly believe I fell in love with her right then and there. Or at least ""in lust."" As I've reexamined our friendship I have noticed times when I would basically go out of my way to hang out with her while we were at work. If we made plans to hang out and she canceled I'd feel devastated. At work parties or while hanging out I always want to be near her. I consider her a dear friend but the things I feel about her, and things I do when I'm around her, I never do for my other dear, female friends. Simple things like never checking my phone, intently focusing on everything she says, unable to be distracted by anything else. Oh, and constantly being in awe of how goddamn gorgeous she is. I finally stopped denying I even had these feelings about a year ago, but I've just been trying to force myself to get over them, without success. Just when I think I've started to move on I'll see her again and the feelings come rushing back.   


So, do I tell her I feel this way? 

My biggest fear about telling her is that I lose her as a friend. That would devastate me because all I truly, wholeheartedly want, is to not feel the way I do and be her friend, nothing more. But try as I might, I haven't been able to excavate these feelings. I also fear she'll be angry because I've waited so long to tell her. One thing she cannot stand, which she has expressed as being the #1 way to end up on her Shit List, is to lie to her. I fear she'll see our entire friendship as a lie and hate me for it, and then again, I'll lose her friendship. I also like being an honest person so I hate that I'm withholding this. I've tried thinking of how I'd tell her and what information I'd disclose. I truly haven't been honest with myself about these feelings until the past year at most, but I still feel as though I'm misrepresenting myself.

Additionally, I don't want to mess up her marriage and her family. I really don't think she'd leave her husband for me, but an affair is not something I want to partake in. Even that I doubt will happen. Although there is a part of me that thinks she is into me in some slight way, I doubt my feelings are reciprocated. I also don't want to make her feel uncomfortable. So do I even bother telling her?

There is the possibility, because she's a good friend, that she'll kindly let me down easy. I fear the only way for me to get over this is to have my heart utterly broken so that I can then move on. Until then, I'm afraid I'll be stuck in this weird limbo. I can't even feel any sort of interest in anyone else because I'm loyal with my feelings, to a fault.

609,hello every one i have a friend who has a rocky history with using his smarts he is 20 years old and just recently he has done some questionable things he called me freaking out and needless to say i saved him from trouble and i told him never to talk to any one about it again. as the problem started with him bragging to people and he told even more people this time. after about 2 hours on the phone i saved him again. and i even helped him get a job he didnt know it but i knew people at the place he was applying for and they were going to accept his application. he turned down a 40k starting off job with a 5$ raise after the first 6 months. he told them never mind and i had to explain quite a lot now he went for a sure thing school that was 2 days for a certification the school had employers and every thing he assured me. well needless to say he paid for the course and he passed still no job. and he refuses to work at macdonalds or anything because his standards must not be lowered at anytime. he cant even afford to drive a hour away he wont sell his car that takes premium gas and only premium. he has 17 bucks in the bank and he wants to move. well he told me about his interest in music and i just happened to have alot of friends in the music industry nothing major just a few underground producers and 2 or 3 artist that are decently popular. he never contacted any of them and i keep trying to talk sense into him but he just wont stop with these ideas that when he moves its all going to get better. every time i talk to him about getting a job he says he applied to every open spot except anything related to food or the food industry and thats pretty much everything in his area is fast food. he wont even talk to a military recruiter because he says hes too big for the army. and just the other day he tried to tell me that he was ready for kids and a wife. tbh im not even ready for kids or a wife and my job is pretty much secured for the next 4 years. but any ways i need some help talking to him. he insists that im not understanding that he dosent want to get a job in the food industry and that every where he has applied has pretty much said no to him except McDonalds. he has not borrowed money or asked me for anything other than just to help him out with the trouble. but yeah if any one has ideas as to how i can talk sense into him that would be great thanks guys. ,27Jan2019,1

I usually come to visit once every two or three months. We've had lots of fun during this visit, and I am looking forward to visiting him again in the future.

I am still very sad that I will be leaving. It's not just him. It's this wonderful city and I've made so many friends here over the years. I do have plans to move in at some point once I've gotten my life together.

Everytime I leave to the airport, I always get super sad and frustrated that I'm leaving, because I'm not financially prepared to live here just yet. It is soothing to see him now and again, but after I get back home I just shut down due to the realization that I won't be seeing him for a while.

Has anyone had to cope with this? Is there any advice that anyone can give me regarding these circumstances? While I am super happy that it happened, I still can't help but feel that the next time I see him will be a long time, and it hurts me a lot. We both love each other very much.
