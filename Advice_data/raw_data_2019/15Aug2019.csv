0,I have been staying with a family for 2 weeks and want to know what is a fair payment for their hospitality. Does anyone have any advice on how much I should give? Thanks!,15Aug2019,1
1,"So I was at school and me and this girl started talking. When we first started talking I got this hint that she kinda liked me as she went to talk to me. Me being the awkward kid denied a handshake because my hands were sweaty. I could tell she was shocked, and then later on she asked me if wanted a piece of gum and I kindly declined because I don't like chewing gum. Again she looked at me in disbelief. Her friend was saying that I didn't like her but I actually did and just couldn't say it. The next day she didn't talk to me and tried to ignore me. Then today my friend went to her table because they had called him. I was sitting across the room with my group. I could see they were talking when my friend waved at me to come. When I sat down they were making fun of her and my friend was saying “I'll hook you up with him” and that just made things worse. She was saying that she wanted to switch the subject but when they said no she got up to leave. I need advice to see what I could do so she wouldn't be so mad at me.",15Aug2019,3
2,I have some but I have no idea what it is,15Aug2019,1
3,So there should be only 2 posts in my history that I didn’t delete. Apparently people can still see the rest. Could someone possibly look and tell me what’s on there that people can see? I’m not ashamed of anything there I’m just curious. Thanks!,15Aug2019,1

5,My mom and I bought asparagus from PriceRite yesterday and when we brought it home it was all gross. She has the receipt and keeps telling me to go and return it but I am too awkward to do that. I don’t want to pull a Karen and complain to the manager. Help.,15Aug2019,3
6,"I’m most likely moving to another school in another country(not one of those international, more of like a normal one) where everyone knows each other since they were 3 years old. I’m going to be the only foreigner in there and it is going to suck, my life is going to become a shithole and probably have no friends and be depressed the whole school year, I need some advice on what to do to survive the school year and not feel like I want to kill myself.",15Aug2019,1
7,"Let me start this off by saying, this summer has truly been the worst. My insecurities have gone up so high, been really sad all the time, but keep a smile on all the time. Really been feeling a new type of lonely and feel like everyone shows fake love. 


So I’ve known this girl for around 3 years and we are good friends. I’ve always had a thing for her, its just something that will never go away no matter how hard i tried. I got really attached to her last summer, when i thought she liked me but then found out she lead me on. Thats when i cut her off and didn’t talk to her till December of 2018. Then we became friends again and started to become closer and closer. 

I absolutely love talking to her, she makes my days so much better. But sometimes there are nights were i start over thinking and begin to think of all the reasons she is toxic for me. She tells me that she cares about me, but never ever shows it. She never checks up on me or ever ask about how i am doing. When i told her about this and how i felt she said she was sorry and all but really she wasn’t because she still acts the same and hasn’t changed. 

She tells me thats she loves me too, but never shows it. I feel like someone who does love you will actually try and make time for you, and talk to you like all the time. This isn’t what she does. She recently has begun leaving me on read like A LOT. I always try to make conversation with her and try to show her all the time how much i care for her, but i guess non of that has mattered recently. 

Now this is where i truly began to re think my friendship with her. A few nights ago i told her how shitty this summer is for me(told her everything in the intro but in so much detail) told her how lonely i have felt this summer and she sent me paragraphs telling me shows loves me, she cares for me and all that, and told me to surround my self with positive people. At that time i was like “okay damn maybe she does actually care about me”. But even days after that she continued to be really dry talking to me, never asking how I’m doing and she continues to talk to me less. I don’t think i am overthinking this, because I personally think its fucked up even after i told her how lonely I’ve felt she still continues to not talk to me as much and continue to not show that she actually cares about me. 

I love her so much, with all my heart i care about her deeply but now i am really starting to wonder if she is toxic for me and if its time i begin cutting her off. Or just distancing my self from me. But that would be hard because like the great barney Stinson once said *this girls got a hold on my heart that I cant break even if i wanted too, and there have been times i wanted too* So thank you to anyone with any advice, and please don’t call me a pussy or some shit, i just really need help on this one.",15Aug2019,1
8,"So I'm really conflicted on whether I want to aupair (It’s like being an international nanny but not really with the pay, like the host family that picks you will give you a room and food and some pocket-money and you like just watch their kids maybe like 3-6 days a week and the weekend you get to explore the country and city you’re in, I was lined up to go to Rome right before I met my current boyfriend but once I met him I choose to stay home ) but I don’t want to go alone or like leave my boyfriend for like a few months to a year because I feel like it would kill our relationship and I don’t want to lose him.

I've been in a few long distance relationships before but with time they got bored with me and left.I love my boyfriend so much and we have talked about getting married, I can see myself having a really happy life with him and I want that. but I also feel like if I don't do this at least once ill regret it my whole life",15Aug2019,1
9,"I can’t explain my life to anyone who would understand and when I try I get told a lot of the things I’ve experienced are imagination. Basically 4 years ago I had a terrible breakup and had to see my ex with her new boyfriends in class every day my last year of high school. That hurt more than it sounds and many other things were bringing me down at the same time such as physical pain and ailment. So yeah things went to shit and bad thing after bad thing was happening to me, none of which no one believes or understands such as the TV and radio speaking to me and sending me messages.

I took meds to combat it but they wouldn’t work even after long duration of taking them but whatever it was trying to talk to me slowly died down on its own. 

Over the period of time leading up to that I had my right eye became heavy and slowly becoming more closed, my pupil drooping. My body would crack in all different places 24/7 and still does until now. I felt as if my soul left my body as a movie characters signature formed in the air. I was only able to eat exactly half of my food and felt I would die if I ate more. 

Everyone writes those off as normal or delusions, that’s fine. I don’t think I can solve these mysteries but things happened to just made me feel cursed.

I’m here because I’m frustrated from trying to feel happy again and having absolutely no energy or motivation to do anything. I’ve done things that should have been really healthy for me to move forward but I’m still stuck. 

I don’t know what I expect from telling people this but I just wonder if anyone really does have a solution or has gone through something similar. Maybe I just want some support because I feel alone and useless

Tldr: life went downhill, felt cursed, took meds and tried becoming healthy, still stuck in crippling depression since 4 years ago, need some support",15Aug2019,2
10,I’m a senior in high school. Me and this girl have been good friends since freshman year. Recently we’ve been texting a lot and talk about how we are both single and stuff like that. While texting she’s described the type of guy she’d want to date and I fit the description PERFECT. I figured it would be okay to tell her how I felt. I did and got hit with the “I think we should just stay friends.” We’re still friends and I still like her. We hang out as friends sometimes and I just wanna show her that I’d be good for her. What should I do? I don’t want to stay friends and just keep my feelings for her.,15Aug2019,2

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‘mines 21st’ and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays...are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

12,"So, a bit of backstory. My mom quit her job a while ago, went through a grueling period of job-hunting, found another job, and then only a couple of months later the company’s she’s working for sees a huge drop in income, and boss downsizes it to only three or so people. She was already super stressed from the job itself since it was basically a field she was inexperienced in and there was a ton of bookkeeping errors she needed to fix. 
So, she’s been super down. We do jiujitsu together-she loves exercising- and usually I’m the one to want to leave after one class. But today, she’s super out of it, and only wanted to stay for one class, PLUS is super apathetic towards the huge anniversary belt promotion/seminar event coming up in a couple of days, mainly because the seminar is 50$ each, and she doesn’t want to pay that. She even suggested that just I go, and she only shows up for the picture, which I know is gonna cause a bit of a commotion because they’ll all ask her why and I don’t want her to have to deal with that. 

How can I cheer her up? PLEASE don’t suggest anything that would require money, that’s the reason she’s stressed out rn.",15Aug2019,5
13,"I (F18) have been applying to multiple jobs a day. The one problem is I have no idea as to what I'm doing. I've been using a website known as snagajob (snag a job) and putting in applications through that way, but I keep receiving emails asking of the application is completed yet. But when I go to finish it, to say, it takes me back to the beginning of the application and seemingly can't find the rest of my application, so it's as though I have to restart but I really don't want to do that. 

Should I use another website? If you know of another website that's possibly easier I'd really like to know. I feel like me applying to so many jobs is a waste of my time if I'm getting emails of them not being finished, even though on the website itself (snagajob) it says the applications are. 

I'm just at a loss and would like another suggestion, if possible. Thank you for consideration!",15Aug2019,1
14,"Basically, I’m coming back to college in about a week. The good news is that I probably made the best (and, by far, the largest amount of) friends I’ve ever had last year, I’m rooming with three of them, and a pretty big portion are going to be living in the same dorm building. The bad news is I’ve haven’t talked to any of them in three months.

We have a discord server, and plus we have each other’s school emails and twitters, but I really haven’t talked to them since June. I’ve only been focusing on my job and taking care of my sick dog, and now just playing video games to get me out of my funk since he died. I know that while my friends know I’m still alive, they’ve still been really worried about me. 

Logically, I know that at most they’ll just roast me when I get back. They’re really cool people and have supported me when I’ve dropped off the face of the earth for much shorter timespans. (And also probably get permabanned from the running dnd campaign bc our DM is harsh but fair, and I’ve totally broken the missing session rule by now lol.) 

But do you have any advice on how to get back into the group without making it awkward, or like I don’t care that they we’re worried about me, or using ‘waa waa my dog died’ as an excuse? I just really care about these guys, really regret not even saying ‘hey btw im going to vanish for a month’, and want to word it in a way that lets them know that.

TL;DR How to say sorry to/reconnect with friend group after ghosting over the summer?",15Aug2019,3
15,"I feel so selfish and stupid for even posting with this throwaway but my anxiety has never been this bad and I seriously need some opinions.

A little over 2 years ago, I had sex with this aforementioned person. I wasn’t planning on it, it just kind of happened. I’d also like to mention I didn’t even really want to have sex but they asked me if I’d like to go all the way. I was so desperate to lose my virginity I just did it in the spur of the moment. (I was 18 at the time and all of my friends had already lost their virginity.) I took them home after and was shocked by what I had just done but I trusted this person not to go around telling people about the experience. They didn’t and I appreciate that more than they could imagine. That was that and I tried extremely hard to erase the experience from my memory to no avail.

Fast forward two and a half-ish years and I’ve never been so worried. It’s an extremely long story so I won’t say it all here but I will say a certain series of events has led me to believe the truth could come out at any time now. I’m a nice person that’s liked and respected at my school and if the truth was to come out, it would absolutely ruin my reputation and I don’t think I have any friends close enough to see through the whole mess. If the truth did come out, I would have to start online schooling just to prevent bullying and I’d have to get rid of all of my social media to prevent cyber bullying, as well as losing every friend I’ve made in the past 5 years. If this comes out it’s going to make my life a living hell.

I’d appreciate any advice anyone has to give.

19,"This is nothing serious, just curious if anyone else does this or has experienced this. :) A guy I’m seeing is in another country for a few months and we decided to not have a long distance thing and no serious communication. We usually just send each other memes, recommend videos, movies, show random things etc. Silly stuff to stay in contact a little. I’ve noticed that recently (a few weeks maybe) he goes online on instagram everytime I send him something or like something he has sent, even if I didnt type anything. But, he doesnt enter the chat at once. Sometimes it’s probably just a coincidence but it happens pretty much everytime now so it would be a pretty incredible coincidence. Does anyone else do this with someone? Entering the app but not reading the chat? What could be the reason?

Hes been away since April and is supposed to be away for 6 months, so he should be back around October if he doesn’t change his mind.",15Aug2019,1

 I cant go anywhere without a bathroom which sucks because im a huge nature buff. In a month i will finish a bottle of immodium. I used to smoke marijuana to help with anxiety which worked very well till i moved to a place that didnt have a reliable supply. I used to go to therapy and take pills till it got too expensive and now i cant afford that. 

How can i manage my anxiety without spending huge amounts of money and not relying on anyone but myself?",15Aug2019,1
21,"Hey guys, so I called the cops and they came but they said that i didn’t have enough evidence to arrest him, so they told me what you guys told me, to place the cameras. So I placed the cameras and Jake (not real name) saw one in my sisters room so he came into my room and asked me wtf it was... I told him idk so he started punching and choked me until I passed out. Thankfully, I had a camera in the room, so I got a video of it all. I called the cops after he had gone to sleep and gave them the camera. They arrested him and he is detained until we get further notice. I’m so glad that this sack of shit is finally out of my life. Thank you guys so much, now going to comfort my sister.

My older sister has a friend I thought was really cute and just an amazing person, shes 18 and has a boyfriend. One night when I was hanging out with her and my sister watching a movie in the dark we were all packed pretty close together, she was touching me innocently enough, but things escalated, that night I ended up fingering and making out with her, flash forward to now we've had sex twice we say I love you and I at least mean it, but i feel like shit whenever i think about her boyfriend, she never has nice things to say about him and its common knowledge to every one she knows that he's pretty controlling, I haven't had a chance to really process the position I'm in until I took a trip back to my home town and kind of thought about who I was for a while.

30,"I was never very good socially, in fact I tend to spend months upon months alone and in a deep depression, ignoring whatever few people trying to reach out to me.   


I've been making considerable efforts in changing that lately, I've been hanging out more...at least trying to but now I can feel this familiar dread coming back. It's been a few weeks now and I feel absolutely empty. I've been trying more and more to reach out to some friends because I really don't want to go back into isolation and none of them are available. In fact I feel like I'm annoying them most of the time when I try texting them. I'm always met with short-ish answers and conversations die if I don't get flaked.   


I know that people are busy, and it may also be a consequence of me in the past not being responsive because of what I described above. However I don't know where to go now; every day feels worse than the one before. Hell, I even slept with a girl just recently and I felt absolutely nothing. I just left the next morning to go to work.   


FYI, yes I go to the gym regularly, it's been the one thing sort of keeping me afloat because my mind feels rested for an hour or two after exercising.  


Even small things I now fail to pay attention to. Things like forgetting to close the windows when I leave, or turn off the lights, or even the stove after I used it. Shit I even left my keys in my apartment's door for an entire night. I feel like crying at times but I can't even bring myself to do so. Social media has been torturing me to the point that I might just delete everything; seeing people being happy, even though they're just highlights, is really hard. I really am falling back into my old patterns and it's not a place where I want to be. I want to be happy with myself and I want to make my friends proud that we're part of each others' lives. My internship is ending this week and then my last year in college will begin...yet the prospect of graduation and an actual career does nothing to me, I even dread it.  


How do I prevent myself from crumbling yet again?

She would be really abusive towards me (F20) emotionally and recently i've learned that if I just do whatever she wants me to do, then she'll be happy and won't be mean to me anymore.

She's especially mean to my younger sister (13) and recently towards my brother (18) who she says reminds her of my dad. She doesn't allow my younger sisters (13 and 10) to go outside and play with the other kids because she's convinced that the other kids are plotting against my sisters.

She instead follows my sisters around and yells at the other kids whenever she feels like the other kids are ""harming"" them even when they're not.

35,"so I just started my senior year today and I may have came to a conclusion that I want to enlist in the Air Force after high school. I’ll talk about that later but some reasons I don’t want to go to a university is 1. I don’t like school. at all. the work the stress. especially how teachers have rubbed it in our faces that college is a whole other level (which I agree with) 2. One huge reason is I don’t want to be in debt and 3. I simply don’t have an interest in some careers that require a bachelors/masters/etc. I did have an interest in being a pilot but you have to take physics and trigonometry and I’m just simply not good with those, especially physics. anyways the career I want to pursue in his truck driving or being an auto mechanic. I’ve always had a huge passion for trucks and cars. I’ve done my research on both careers and I love them. it’s like everything I’ve ever wanted. I want to go in the Air Force because I’ve always had an interest in this branch and it’s something that would make me proud of myself for once. plus the benefits during and after are great and I can be a trucker there which would be helpful for after since lots of companies will definitely prefer years of experience. now for the auto mechanic I’m totally fine with going to a community college and getting my aa in automotive technology (something that I’m actually interested in) or go to a trade school and get a certificate there. now onto the deal with my parents. I’ve told my mom that I’m kinda not interested in a university and leaning towards cc or the usaf and she seemed fine with it and the one thing she cares is that I get a job/career that will pay me enough that I can have a living and fulfill my goals. I told her truckers (specifically if you own your own truck) make almost 200k. now the one person I’m nervous with is my dad. he really wants me to get an education and into the medical field or becoming a cop. now I’m not interested in any of those, I know the pay is out of this world but I rather make decent money while doing something I actually look forward to instead of making hundreds of thousands and not having much interest in my job. my dad never went to college and struggled a lot when he first started working at his job, he climbed the later to get where he’s at right now and I truly idolize him for all the hard work he’s done. I know he wants what’s best for me like all parents do and something he never had the opportunity to do (he was in a poor family and had to work after high school). now I feel like I’m a failure to them since I don’t want to get an education and I have truly let them (specifically my dad) down. it’s like I don’t know what to do at this point since college nowadays is the “key to success.” I just really need advice on what to do or how to tell them. a huge thank you in advance!

38,Hey guys so I am going to be living on campus at a new college In a few weeks and it is my first time being on a college campus alone and as the time gets closer I get extremely anxious and stressed.  I had an episode of psychosis and bipolar mania last year at this time and don’t want it to happen again while I’m in school.  I have two therapists and they help somewhat.  What do I do?  Should I ask for Xanax?,15Aug2019,1
39,"so basically, I love my boyfriend he’s great he’s so amazing right but sometimes he’s a little too much for me. he gets too overbearing and I just want some time away from him. Before I made a reddit I made a spam acc on ig bc he didn’t like what I would post and I felt so like suffocated and I didn’t know how to tell him that he was being too much so I decided to just make the spam and just have it for my friend and I. But the use of that account stopped bc ig was being annoying so I hadn’t used it. Well my mistake was to post a picture bc my senior year just started and I felt really excited well my boyfriend just found it and he called me mad and stuff and when he asked me if I had one I told him no bc I got like nervous and shaky so like I just said no and he said ‘don’t lie to me bc I have screenshots.’ I don’t know how he got them since my acc is private and I only accept my close friends and some art pages well he’s very mad and I know that if I answer him he’s gunna talk about trust and about me cheating on him and I don’t know how to confront him about it since I lied to him. So I came on here bc i don’t really like talking much to my friends bc they have their own problems so I wanted to see if anyone can help me out and like see what I can do bc I don’t know. I know I made a mistake but I don’t know what to do to fix it. I just wanted other opinions.",15Aug2019,2
40,"There's this girl I have a crush on; were really good friends. A couple of years ago, in 6th grade, I asked her out (in retrospect, 6th grade was way too early for that), and got rejected. 

That ended up ruining our relationship, for a while, until last spring when she started a band, that through a complicated set of circumstances I ended up being part of. We ended up working well together as band mates and eventually became friends once again. I still have pretty strong feelings for her, but I don't know if it's worth the risk to ask her. I've caught her looking at me and blushing out of the corner of my eye, and she's generally really sweet towards me (she even baked cookies for me once), but I don't know if that's enough info to base asking her out on alone.

42,"I have this friend who isn't popular- which is okay because that's basically my whole friend group. But the problem's that she's constantly talking about ""trauma"" that she's had to deal with. When I first got to know her in Freshman year, I thought that it was a lot of info to dump on someone she barely knew, but it was fine- But now I realize that it takes up every part of the conversation. (Not EVERY part- but a good 80%.) It's not just when we're talking to her either- she'll constantly interrupt conversations, both the friend group we're all in and complete stranger's conversation, just to talk about ""trauma."" It'll have nothing to do with the conversation either. Someone could be talking about basketball- or history homework, and she'll interrupt and start talking about how she was traumatized and has she has all these panic disorders. Like, I've heard some of the things she goes through, and yes! I agree, some of them are awful. But others.... sound like misunderstandings between she and other people. She'll cling onto the not-so-awful things and continually remind everyone about how in Kindergarten she was singled out by teachers who favored other kids- (But after hearing the full story- it sounds like she wasn't following directions and completely mistook the situation.) I do believe she has a disorder of some sort- (I've had to stop her from tearing up her skin with scissors before.) But she's constantly changing what it is? I'm so confused. She also talks trash about people who are genuinely nice people? (As well as other people in our friend group.) I have a hard time pointing this stuff out to her cause whenever someone says something negative towards her- she freaks out and starts calling them a ""fake friend"". We're neighbors and I've known her since Freshman highschool- I feel really bad for her since no one really talks to her outside of our friend-group. (And I've had to convince some of my friends to ignore some issues.) Sometimes she has interesting things to talk about, but it's mostly just stories of ""trauma"" that I honestly think are mostly misunderstandings. I don't know how to help the situation.

Unfortunately, this happens frequently, and especially friends give me rides to my house which has multiple vehicles out front.

However, I don't like to tell people I live with my mother, especially people I'm not closed to because they don't understand my situation. I am nearly 21 years old, and a 
college student.

For one, I can't afford it financially, and for two: there's certain skills it will take me a few extra years to develop so that I can live on my own (I have a disability called Dyspraxia, and I tell very few people about it).

50,"So basically, my employer is my patient. They’re under direct funding which means that they hire and fire their attendants as they choose. I have no higher authority to report to; as far as I know (someone correct me if I am wrong). 

Long story short, as I was doing some chores for my patient/“employer” is saw them writing a racist email saying; “ I don’t like the Indian attendants there is a way that they provoke me and their too calculated, selfish and emotional” later in the email she says me and another attendant have no class. 

I have faced a lot of problems with this patient (I made another post before this one) and so have the other attendants. There was a time were she called me a bullshitter and ungrateful because I didn’t add up the total hours on my time sheet; even after I explained that it’s my first time using a written time sheet and I didn’t know. I never felt so embarrassed and upset in my whole life. My patients gotten mad at me because I didn’t want to mop they’re other family member living area although I offered to just sweep instead and mop if it’s visibly dirty. This patient/employer doesn’t have any cognitive disabilities and they are fully capable of thinking for their own hence they have been granted the right to hire and fire their own attendants. Which makes it harder for me to let her actions slide.

Basically, I’m at a loss for what I should do. I have voiced my opinion about they way they treat me and the others a whole bunch of times. I’m basically stuck quitting my job and not being able to get a reference letter.  I don’t mean to sound like a complainer, and I know as a psw I should suck it up because we all get difficult patients, but my jobs already really hard and it’s harder having to face criticism on every shift. I’m trying really hard not to quit because it’s harder on the spouse and the spouse doesn’t deserve to have to struggle. Any ideas about how to go with this situation?

51,"I’m a newly licensed driver (17 years old) who parked my car to take a walk while the sun was setting. After about a half an hour, I make my way back to the car and begin pulling out, not making any observations of my surroundings and the car suddenly jolts. I absolutely panic and my first instinct is to drive, at first thinking it was a pole or slab or concrete, but soon realizing it was the front end of a CRV. I circle around the parking lot and realize there is another car idling at the opposite end of the lot with their windows rolled down, who couldn’t have possibly not heard the sound of my car colliding with theirs. I didn’t check for any damage done to the car, but my trailer hitch is missing now. I can’t believe I did this, it’s my father’s car and I feel terribly guilt. Under any other circumstance I would own up to my mistake but I was just too terrified of the co sequences and simply don’t have the money to pay for any damages. 

I’ve never been in a situation like this before. In hindsight I realize I’ll probably be facing more charges than if I initially would’ve just waiting for the guy to return. I hate inconveniencing others. I fear I’ll have to go to court or make my family pay for charges that I can’t afford. I take full responsibility for my actions and I feel absolutely terrible for the owner of the car as well as my dad. I can only hope that there was no damage done to his vehicle and he’ll be happy having found a free trailer hitch.

I am Asian and the girl is white (not basic, but she is a cheerleader, though I don’t like her for this reason). I am also in all honors classes, the math and debate team. I’m not exactly popular/weird or anything, but people know me for being funny. I’m not really sure if I’m ugly or handsome or anything, but I like to say that I’m average. I’m 5”11. She is smart, funny, kind, and pretty. I’m not sure if this will really affect the advice I am going to get, so I just put it out there.

55,"Ok so to start this off I don’t personally think I have a problem, but the first things addicts tell themselves is that they don’t have a problem and can quit whenever they want and the whole thing. So I’m coming here for perspective because obviously I can’t trust myself with that. 

A little stage setting here, I’m a huge whiskey person. I love Scotch, Bourbon, Irish even some blended Canadian is alright depending on the bottle. I don’t drink it to get drunk (although it’s a fun side effect obviously) nor do I think I’m drinking to numb any sort of pain. I also don’t think I often drink in excess (barring the occasional tear it up night with friends) except there have been times where I’ve poured too heavily or enjoyed the first glass so much I went back for a second. Simply, I just like the taste. I like to pride myself on being able to pick the subtle flavors and complex notes out of a good bottle. I also recently got married and with that came a shit load of whiskey so my consumption of distilled and barrel aged corn/rye/wheat spirit has skyrocketed in the last three months. This is mostly just due to the fact that I have a much higher level of access to it now. 

So here’s where I think others could potentially say I may be inching in on a drinking problem. In the last month and a half I think there may have been two days where I didn’t have a glass. Again, I don’t think I’m drinking too much (those 45 days I would have very confidently said I wasn’t drunk), I just came home from work and had a drink. I finished off three different bottles all of which were already opened if not half empty. I also often find myself craving a glass of scotch or bourbon during work. Again I don’t think it’s a substance abuse issue here as much as I think of it like somebody else craving a steak or an ice cream cone. It just sounds REALLY good. 

So I’m coming to reddit for some outside perspective on my drinking habits. Do I sound like somebody who should cutback on the sauce or are my habits at within the realm of acceptable?",15Aug2019,1

So I contact him and he tells me he's only given thought to string lights and also he thinks we shouldn't bring a mini-fridge and microwave.

I understand that not everyone can afford to contribute to a dorm room, but I can't really either. I'm not sure how I should bring it up with him that I really need him to contribute to our room, and that I need to know what he's bringing soon so I can order my things in time. It's difficult because he doesn't seem to understand the urgency of the situation. I would also like him to purchase either the fridge or microwave so that way both of the bills don't rest on my shoulders, but I don't see how I could convince him to do that politely.

57,"Well, its not that simple.   
I am 28yo M, i moved from Europe 4 years ago, lived out of min. wage, travel states, try to visit as many places i could and i end up living in SM, LA.  
Its been blast and i don't like to consider myself immigrate. I've got here by choice and legally. What happened with my visa is another story but i didn't have much influence on that to say the truth.  


Long story, short I just got home from Santa Monica college,   
I've got accepted last week. I've already finish master in security management 4 years ago in Europe. My 1st visit of states was part of inter-exchange program. Those 3 month spent here convinced me to come back and try to live here.  
So anyway, problem is i cant afford it. I hoped i possibly could but I live in LA 7 months and that doesn't qualify as California resident. That has to be more than year. And rates for ,,international"" students are waaaay beyond my limit.   


I know it is a community college and its not that expensive, but i just paid back bunch of borrowed money. I still have some credit cards to pay and i work 2 jobs in restaurants so manage it. Its going ok, ill get there, slow and steady.  


And with that said, I simply dont see myself paying this money on college. I wanted to study film and art.   
I know its cheezy but ive been in engineering field, ive been around human resources... its just not for me. I've never encounter true art and freedom of expressing myself until i didn't get to USA. And i love to do that. I found something i never saw or feel before and now i feel like i really awnt to do it.   
My friend told my if im not going to do it soon enough ill go mentally bankrupt. ITs been a long ride without family and support in completely different environment. Great ride, dont take me wrong, please.  


But as they say, no money no funny honey.   
I tried financial AID department and guy said that i don't qualify for California residency and with my current documents im no eligible for basically anything. Honestly, that broke my heart. I really, really hoped that he may help me. Im first one in my family to study, first one speak English, 1st to actually leave country and try to be better person, which is cool but question is: How long before it breaks?  


And i think i am on right track, but i feel that without solid backround nobody will trust me in art with my character. Nobody will take me serious until i dont have some background to support my decision going towards art. That is why i did want to study, to be part of something, being just part of group, meet people who are not ashamed to imagine, dream, create, to work on something together. I dont care that im 28y/o old fucker, still better now that never.  


But i will be able to apply with California rates till next year. And the thing is. I'm not sure if i can do one more year in that isolation. So i need help, i dont know what to do, i cant afford to add any dept on my account, i dont want to do it. I lived months and months on cans and protein powders to pay back what i owned. I don't want it anymore. And for film studies i need 21 units for film study and 60 for film production. Than some businesses classes, history, philosophy, english, maybe Spanish... There is no chance i can cover it with. Not cost around 300 per unit.  


So i dont know now, just want to know what to do, since that was my plan ,,Z"". Back plan if back plan fails, just go to college. So i went a that's what happened. What now? What to do if i want to work around movies or creative people? Im sick of ,,instructions follow"" type of jobs and  want to get into creative types of roles. But i cant. In LA that's impossible unless you dont know somebody. There is no money to go out, no school, bumble and be and assohole gold-digger that under my level even if i could.

I recently moved into a new house and have a bedroom on the third floor facing the backyard. Our backyard shares a border with another person's backyard, separated by a fence. That person's house has all the windows and even the back door wide open at all hours of the day or night, and they have a television or radio on 24/7. The television is turned up so loud that the sound is wafting across both of our backyards into my bedroom window...

It is making me absolutely insane. All this person has on the TV or radio is some kind of talk show or news, so I can constantly hear droning voices. I can't imagine how this person is sitting right in the house with it on this loud. If I go on the second floor I can make out the words!

64,"My mom and my step-dad have been married for about 15 years, since I was 8. And while there have been times where I’ve been okay around him, for the most part I’m always uncomfortable and I can’t figure out why. We have never had a close relationship and honestly sometimes we really just don’t get along. Sometimes he’s super nice to me but most of the time he kind of ignores me or doesn’t acknowledge me. But it’s more than that, it’s a physical and patterned level of constantly being uncomfortable in my house when he’s around. I’m 23 and moved home after college and this has always been the norm, but now I guess I’m trying to put my finger on why I’ve been so uncomfortable all these years. Like I said, we have not had the best relationship and there have been some not-nice, pretty cruel things said in the past and some incidents. When I was 16 we got into a fight and he got physical and grabbed me by the shirt, pulled me down the hall and pushed me onto a sofa. I got upset and tried to go to a friends house to get some space but my mom called me, basically made me feel I was at fault and forced me to come home. I don’t think we ever even talked about what happened or anyone ever apologized. A few years ago, when I started struggling with anxiety and was put on medication, he said some cruel things. When I said I wasn’t feeling well after starting my meds he told me I was “using my medication as a crutch”. When he noticed I would talk to my aunt a lot about my anxiety, he told me I should “give her a break” because he knows I “like to dump on people”. And there have been a few more comments here and there in the past that have been cruel, many of them disguised as a “joke” so if I got upset I was always told I was dramatic or overreacting. He never has a single nice thing to say to me most of the time. Him and my mother had my brother about 12 years ago and obviously he’s favored by him and his family. I learned last year he cheated on my mom; they seemed to have worked it out and I’m never one to judge someone else’s relationship and he’s never been abusive toward her that I know of but I’m not sure if that has something to do with it. Sometimes I figured it was just me being an over-dramatic kid and it would be something I would grow out of but I’ve never grown out of this. I will go out of my way to avoid him and if he’s around, I’ll get anxious and tense up. For example, last night I was cooking myself dinner, he was in the kitchen at the same time just quietly doing dishes and it felt like my skin was on fire, my body tensed, I just stood in one place and I noticed after I’d started sweating all over. And once I’d sat down 10 feet away at the table, I had this weird feeling of being safe now that I wasn’t as close to him. I’m really not sure why after all this time I react like this to him. I’ve never breathed a word about the depth of my feelings until now; people have known some of our conflicts but never how deep this anxiety goes. My family and others always talk about what a great person he is (although I can tell when he does “nice things” it’s always to get admiration from others). The uncomfort is to the point where, for as long as I can remember, I will go out of my way to not be around him, especially alone. I have stayed in my bedroom, morning to evening without eating, if he’s home and downstairs. And if he leaves briefly, I will race down and rush to get food just to go back upstairs. And the whole time I’ll be looking out the window to see if he’s come back. And when he’s actually nice to me, I get a strange sense of happiness and validation from it? I get that with my mom too but I’m never uncomfortable being around her. I’m not sure if this is all me and there’s nothing wrong I just am really wondering why this happens. I think my lack of decent relationship with him even led to me trying to get a relationship with my biological father 2 years ago, which ended horribly because he’s a drug addict, he went back to jail and his current wife also uses and we don’t have a great relationship either. I just never talk about this and I’m wondering where it comes from. Lately I’ve been wondering if I’m scared he would sexually assault me, which the other night in the kitchen I began thinking of that was true and suddenly I felt very unsafe and just wanted to get away from him. I’m not sure where that comes from. And there have been times when I was younger if I’d gone somewhere alone with him I’d be worried something bad would happen to me. Like I said, I struggle with anxiety and intrusive thoughts so I’m not sure if it’s just me. I’m just really trying to figure out where this constant fear and discomfort is coming from. An outside view would be appreciated. Thanks.",15Aug2019,1

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‘mines 21st’ and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays...are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

67,"So I (27M) am getting a divorce from my wife (24F). I also want it to be known I am not blaming or shaming my soon to be ex, I have done wrong things, as has she. But we are both to blame for this failed marriage. 

This will be long and have a TLDR at bottom

I’ve been dwelling in my thoughts these last few weeks in acceptance, anger, sadness, don’t give a fuck-ness and anything in between. My ex and I have had a rocky past but in the end we always found each other and made it work. We made it through a miscarriage, made it through 2 major moves, my child’s mother (we are a blended family) who is insane (I also have custody of my son) and a lot of the typical ups and downs of any relationship. 

Back in May we had a major falling out. She found out that last year I had an emotional affair with an old friend. I know I was wrong and I did cut ties to said person long before she found out and I was an idiot for thinking that. I pleaded and begged to try and make it work and so we tried counseling. For the second time actually. And out of nowhere after what I felt was major progress she said she was completely done with me. She then verbally attacked me as she always have (big history of demeaning and insulting me while we fight...) saying that I never tried, I didn’t care and that I was completely absent from the relationship. 

We were together for 4 years. In these four years we saw two marriage counselors (my idea), I changed my entire habits and pleasures to better accommodate her comfort, I cut friends out of my life that she didn’t like, I changed parts of my personality that she felt was immature or too childish. I mean I really feel like I changed to better met her needs and it always fell short... 

I still see the marriage counselor but is now one on one. She’s been helping me see things from a different perspective and basically said something that struck a nerve. She said something along the lines of “a willing mind can accomplish anything in life/relationships/career, but there comes a point where the willingness to try ends up making you drown”. And basically translated to me that sometimes trying so hard to make something work that just won’t will cause you to go mad. And I feel like I’m at that point. 

I’ve now gotten to the self reflection part and I am reevaluating the years we spent together and I honestly don’t think I can do this anymore... 

In other light, we did do a lot of good together. Remodeled our house, traveled some and had some good party nights but I feel that’s not enough to outweigh the bad... 

I know it’s selfish asking for strangers to validate my thoughts but I just feel so convinced that maybe she was right. Maybe I didn’t try hard enough. Idk obviously this is all subjective from one point of view but I guess would anyone stay given the information above? I do/did love this woman but the exchange of hurtful words and shit she’s said to me just stings so much... 

Haha now I feel like this is turning into a vent post. 

TLDR: a rocky relationship finally hit its breaking point and seems that too much bad blood has been spilt to repair. Is it worth to invest to repair and see if the toxic relationship can recover or continue on with the divorce for my sanity and my sons sanity?",15Aug2019,2

So here it goes, I'm a visual arts student with a especialization in audiovisual media, last semester I took pre-production we had to writte an script, but we had to do it in couples, I decided to do it with my friend since we had some similar interests, I knew he was bad at timing himself, but we always seemed to manage to do good stuff, but as the semester went on he became worst and worst, he woudn't answer my text and when he did he told me he was sleeping, he sometimes told me to not go to class since we didn't do any work for that week, and when I confronted him he either put the blame on me or on his messy life, we still maneged to writte a pretty good script, but only after we had a bad fight, he finally apologized when he saw the error in his ways, I tend to believe people can change so this semester I belived him when he told me he had changed so we decided to take this project in to our production class, aka film it, we had to do some changes to the script, and send it on saturday, that day he told me he had completly forgot about it and that he only had time to quickly writte some bulletpoint of things he wanted to change, so I ended up wirtting the script by myself and sending it, tomorrow we have to pitch our project to 3 faculty professors, we have to do a presentation and everything, I texted him, I called him, but It seems like he banished the face of the earth, I'm really tired of this and I can't take this anymore. So what should I do? Should I talk things trough? Or should I drop him off the project even though we techniclly wrotte it together?",15Aug2019,1
71," In school I have two friends, Friend 1 who is the same age as me and Friend 2 (who is a year younger).

We were all fandom geeks in our own way. Friend 1 likes Mystic Messenger and Shadow Hunters, Friend 2 likes anime and I like Pokémon.

Friend 1 and I have had a strained relationship with Friend 2 in 2018. We used to have a routine in which we'd meet up at break and lunch.

However, Friend 2 was controlling of what we'd do for lunch. It was always get food, sit in our favourite spot and Friend 2 would get us to read the fan fiction she had written. She'd keep us late until after the bell rang and couldn't understand why we'd want to get to class on time. It was the exact same thing for months. If was also hard to tell her no or convince her to do anything.

Friend 1 was getting sick of it. She didn't care about Friend 2's fanfiction and I wanted to do something different at lunch for a change. We'd both vent out frustrations to each other. Friend 1 broke off from Friend 2, leaving me to deal with her. I wanted to break off too but guilt kept me in because I was Friend 2's only friend at this point. I still liked Friend 2 though. She is a nice person, she was just hard to deal with at the time. Friend 2 tried to befriend Friend 1 again unsuccessfully which led Friend 2 to realise that she was a horrible person and that dashed her self esteem and she got really depressed.

In Summer of 2018, it all ended in tears. Friend 2 was really desperate not to be alone again, so she tried to get Friend 1 back one last time, but Friend 1 exploded at her to leave her alone and that left both of them in tears and they both stopped talking to each other. Friend 2 was absolutely devastated.

September 2018. I decided to split my time between Friend 1 and 2. I'd have lunch with Friend 2 and talk to Friend 1 during class because I was in the same class as her.

The situation with Friend 2 improved dramatically! We met Friend 3 and Friend 4! Both were younger than us but both were big anime fans (mainly My Hero Academia) Friend 4 is officially the school's weird kid and I was worried that she'd be bullied, but her classmates and everyone else are super kind to her and it's very wholesome.

Now that Friend 2 has more friends that have a common interest with her, she's mellowed out a whole lot. She's my best friend and I'm glad that I stuck with her even though it was difficult. We went to Comic Con together with Friend 4! (Friend 3 couldn't come)

However, I feel as though Friend 1 has grown apart from me. I talked with her and tried to invite her to the cinema a couple of times, but she could never come because her parents were always working. We'd talk to each other in class and then we'd part ways at lunch to meet with our respective groups (she has other friends that she eats lunch with) I thought that we were still friends, but towards the end of the year, she's stopped talking to me.

About 2 weeks ago, I tried to invite her to my birthday, but when my mum contacted her mum to arrange things, Friend 1's mum was confused because she thought that Friend 1 and I weren't friends anymore.

My mum says that maybe Friend 1 though that I chose Friend 2. I tried to apologise to Friend 1 over WhatsApp saying that I tried my best to say friends with both her and Friend 2 and that I was sorry if I ever made her feel uncomfortable, but she hasn't even read the text.

I'm really worried about Friend 1 when I see her in September. We're moving onto Year 13 (I might have to repeat Year 12, depending on my GCSE results) so we're not going to be in the same class anymore, so I'll lose the chance to talk to her unless I specifically look for her.

What should I do? I don't want to leave it, because I'm afraid that Friend 1 will think that I've stopped caring about her (which isn't true). My mum says that I've sent an apology, so I should just leave it at that and us go our separate ways and that it's better to grow apart than to fall apart in some argument.

I don't know what to do...",15Aug2019,1

All good and stuff until tonight when the payphone started ringing randomly for no reason.

It's a creepy looking kind of old payphone thst nobody uses it's 2019.

I did not answer i thought maybe there was an issue within the hardware of the phone that made it rang but then it stopped and started ringing repetitively over and over again until i answered

I said ""hello hello hello"" nothing it was that weird noise when nobody is talking or as if they're trying to talk but the signal is weak and i got freaked out and closed the phone

When i heard it ring i got goosebumps because i was like ""wtf this only happens in movies""

Then again it started ringing and with such an annoyance i couldn't calm down..

Fortunately it stopped forever after those continuous dials i hope it won't ring again.

I mean.. how on earth could someone ring a payphone?

75,"I work in recruitment; it's a job that when I went in I had a lot of reservations on it. I grew up extremely introverted, I often get anxious around people in general (it took me 1 and a half years of being exposed to my current friends for me to even stick to a conversation with them and not just nod and leave, another half before I felt comfortable considering them my friends). The only reason my anxiety has not been as bad as before was because I had to go through my country's mandatory military service so talking to job seekers and employers daily didn't feel as anxiety inducing as army drama.  

But I needed the job and it was very difficult for me after my ability to look for jobs the prior two years due to medical reasons has given me a hit in my confidence about finding anything else.

Past few months my anxiety has been consistently at a high level, used to be it dies out after a few minutes at most but now it follows me home. I've been feeling faint more often, my heart starts beating fast, I'm sweating badly despite being situated directly under the air-conditioner.

80,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I am a 16 year old guy.

We have always had a good, humorous relationship. Recently, we have had this silly competition where we basically sneak up on each other when the other least expects it. We will do things like yell, throw a fake spider at the person, ect. I know it’s childish but it’s our thing and we both get a massive kick out of it. 

A few days ago, I was preparing my latest scare where I would blow an air horn in his room. He had no idea anybody was home, therefore his door was wide open. As I sneakily crept towards his room, I caught a glimpse of him making some weird sounds. It wasn’t until I saw he was butt naked that I realized he was masturbating.

I fought back laughter and felt I was about to give my cover away and embarrass him for life. Then, I glanced up at the computer screen and was instantly horrified when I realized what he was pleasuring himself to. He was scrolling through pictures of an extremely young girl in a bathing suit. I watched as he scrolled from one photo to another not believing what I was seeing.

I eventually was able to sneak back upstairs. I thought about it the rest of the evening and began trying to convince myself that he was pranking me. However, after some logical thinking, I could no longer deny what was happening.

I have seen my brother few times in the days since the incident. I have honestly been avoiding him because I’m so disgusted and disturbed by what I saw. I can’t look at him the same way ever again quite honestly. That being said, I can’t even fathom telling my parents. I fear that they would kick him out onto the streets. They are no tolerance kind of people and they hold some super religious beliefs, so there is a 0% chance that would end well. As sickened as I am, I would never want my brother to be homeless or disowned by our own parents.

Today, he made a quick run to the store for our mother. Usually, he locks his computer, but since this was a quick, unexpected trip, he didn’t bother logging out. In the 20 minutes he was gone, I was able to find the photos he was looking at. It took some digging but I know all the ‘secret album’ tricks that this generation uses. 

These are the photos found (no nudity)...
https://imgur.com/a/jgZ0d6S

I have no idea who this girl is, it could be a family friend, maybe one of his co workers kids, ect. I do wish I could find out but I suppose that doesn’t change anything here. He’s clearly obsessed with her in a sick way. 

I have so many questions and not enough wisdom. Is my brother definitely a pedophile? Could he go to jail for this? How old would you estimate the girl in the photos is?

My biggest concern though is where to go from here. Telling my parents is out of the question. I fear talking to him would piss him off and accuse me of violating his privacy.

87,"We didn't really date, we just hooked up a few times, but oddly enough, and I still don't know why, he once felt confident enough to tell me this. Approx 2 years ago he told me there was something he felt like a piece of shit about. So, he met this rich girl in Tinder, they went out a couple times and they apparently got along pretty good but more like in ""friendship"" terms. According to him he kind of became her wingman and designated driver as she's a heavy drinker and both would like to go to clubs. If she found someone to hook up with he'd go back himself and if not he'd get her back home, she'd always pay for everything. One of this times, she got extremely drunk and he took her back home, where she stumbled at the entrance and passed out. Then he sexually assaulted her. He obviously didn't use these words, he simply said ""I fucked her"". By this point in the conversation I was feeling pretty disturbed and I am sure he noticed it, because after an awkward silence he said something like ""oh, but that's all right, we had hooked up before, and I know her, she'd be completely ok with that, what I actually feel shitty about is that while she was unconscious I took money and jewelry out of her"" (Ok, I'm recreating the conversation and I obviously don't remember each of his words but it was something to that effect). He tried to diminish the sexual assault and focus on the stealing, but I don't buy it. Honestly, I got kind of scared, but pretended to be cool. After that we texted a few more times but never saw each other again. I always played it cool, never told him that was the reason I never wanted to see him again, and it conveniently happen a week before I went back to my boyfriend (a long term on off relationship that he was aware of) and I just tried to forget about it. I didn't want any confrontation with him, in the little time I met him I noticed he could get pretty aggressive and I don't know, I just wanted to stay away of him. Now, a few weeks ago a picture he was tagged in popped in my feed. He looked younger and the caption said something like ""missing the old times"" it was a picture in what seemed to be a club with two girls, another guy and him. The girl who shared this has the same name of the girl he told me about before and it is not a common name at all, not at least in the country we're from, and peeking in her profile it definitely looks like her, I don't want to get into details of why it is obvious it's her but it's her. So here I am, wondering if I should say something or ignore the whole thing again. This might be stupid but I also wonder, what if it's actually true and she wouldn't care at all and I just expose myself to him knowing I went snitching, but in the other hand I can't feel just in peace knowing he had sex with her unconscious body without her knowing let alone agreeing.

88,"This is going to require a lot of context so I apologize for how long it will be. Tldr at the bottom. I have a younger sibling (one year younger than me) that has always seemed to be treated better than me by my parents. Growing up more money would be spent on their birthday, they were told yes when I was told no, and they got to hangout with friends when I was not allowed to etc. But it got a lot worse when I was in highschool. My sophomore year of high school I really wanted a smartphone. I was told I wasnt allowed to have one unless I paid for it so I got a job as soon as I turned 16. I worked a minimum wage job during the summer and school year and bought a smartphone. I also adopted a cat and paid for all of his expenses (about 400 dollars). My siblings birthday rolls around and they give them a smartphone. I was angry but told my sibling was sad that I had one and they didnt. They paid for everything for it from accessories to cases etc. A few months later they got her a cat because she was sad I had one and she didnt. They paid for all of the expenses because she didnt have a job. At this time she was 16 and could have worked. I switched jobs and worked all through highschool and because I worked my parents always said I needed to pay for my things while they paid for my siblings. I took us both to highschool in my car and I had to pay for all of the gas, even if I was driving her to practices or picking her up. It was bad, and my mother even borrowed money from me (over 1 grand) that I still havent been paid back for. Once I went to college I was diagnosed with anxiety and after speaking to my parents about it they didnt think I needed therapy. I thought i did so I've been paying for that myself while they pay for all of my siblings acne treatments. A few other examples are: 
Giving me 500 a month for rent (I bought most of my groceries and paid the utilities, and books for school) while they gave my siblings 600 a month and paid for all of their stuff because they didnt have a job. At this time I was not working because I was focusing on school and my mental health. I ended up taking a job so I could afford my apartment and school materials. 
My parents paid for my sibling to go on a study abroad to a European country. This cost at least 2 grand and they also purchased new clothes, accessories, suitcases, etc for them. When I asked if I could go on a study abroad (that was cheaper) I was told no. When I mentioned they paid for my siblings my parents said ""how did we know you were going to bring that up?"". 
Lately, my sibling is moving into a new apartment. My parents are paying for everything, even putting utilities in their name so my sibling doesn't have to pay for it. The response is the same ""they dont have a job"". Currently I am trying to find work because all of my savings have gone to living expenses my sibling didnt have to pay since my parents paid for it. I feel like I'm being punished for working and I dont understand why. My sibling is able to work but is very picky about jobs and doesn't try to get one. I have brought this up to a past therapist who basically said I shouldn't be angry because I dont know the circumstances. I do know, I've lived with them all my life. I feel like i have a right to be angry and upset about it. I'm grateful for any help I get but I just want it to be equal. If they gave me nothing it wouldn't upset me as long as they didnt give my sibling things to reward them for not working. Im about to move into a new apartment and so are they, and their rent is 735 which they are paying along with all other expenses. After adding it up they will be paying over a grand each month for my sibling just in rent and recurring expenses. I was told I am still getting 500 a month. All of my rent and expenses would come out to about 700 a month. Is it right for me to be upset? If not why? I want to bring it up to them and really try to get them to understand that it's unfair because they dont see it but I dont want to be in the wrong. I have asked if I would be getting more money because they are taking care of everything for my sibling and my parent kind of shrugged it off. If anyone has any advice or a similar experience I would love to hear it, I'm just really upset by the whole thing and if I'm wrong I'd like to know before I act on anything. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this!

Tldr: my parents spend more on my younger sibling than me in nearly all circumstances. They are only a year younger and my parents say they do this because they have never had a job while I've been working since I was 16. They have money, it's not like the couldnt afford to give us the same amount, but I feel like I'm being punished for actually trying to work, save money, and pay off my student loans. Should I be angry? Should i try to bring it to their attention again? Should I ask for the same amount of money they are spending on them each month for rent or even just enough to cover my rent which is much cheaper?",15Aug2019,2
89,"I am 18, generally ""Attractive"" besides my weight, have little to no social contact (Due to me having pretty bad anxiety with people.), live with parents, and am really, really lonely.

I have been thinking about it and I am wanting to give hiring an escort a go... It wouldn't exactly even be for sex, not right away at least, I am a virgin as well so I had a few reasons to come to mind like ""Not wanting to look like a fool in my first time."" and a mental image of ""Throw off my shackles of virginity!"".... Sad I know, but I want to at least know what the feeling is like to be with someone, even if it is fake. I thought about Tinder and all that but honestly I trust random people online less than a brothel of some kind. I have thought of protection and all that stuff but I honestly don't know.

91,"I play an MMORPG game with a friend of mine. I was going to create a new character and i thought it’d be funny to name my new character “a poop splatter” so that when i kill people in the game, it will say “you have been killed by a poop splatter!”

It is disgusting, of course. No denying that. But i think its hilarious. Poop jokes, poop incidents, fart jokes, potty humor. Always funny to me, until the day i die.

I told my friend and i started cracking up about i and he said “its not even funny... it will just make people uncomfortable because of how gross it is.”

Again, i think that would also add to why this would be a funny character name.

Am i in the wrong? Is it truly just overboard gross, and shouldn’t even be funny?

92,"Ok so I play water polo with one of my best friends (water polo is a team sport that’s not really that popular besides where i live so if you don’t know it that’s fine) and he’s pretty good at it, but he’s not like a superstar or anything. I’m decent but he thinks i’m horrible. At school, he’s one of my best friends and I really like him, but at water polo he’s completely different. 

Any time I talk to him there, he’s either talking about how good he is (not that upfront, but really arrogantly or cockily) or about how absolutely awful i am (yes, that upfront).  It’s gotten to the point where anything I say he’ll somehow turn it into how bad i am, or just say something like shut up you’re trash. 

A little background information, his humor is slightly like that, where he just insults you, but that’s all he does to me at water polo. 

For example, I scored a goal at the end of practice today which is not very hard or uncommon, and as soon as we get in the locker room he starts yelling about how i scored my first goal and everyone needs to congratulate me. 

Another thing that happened today was we were arguing about how last year, i got in loads of trouble from my parents for something he did and i wasn’t a part of. He was kind of bullying a kid and that kid told the coach who told my friend that he had to sit out one game. His parents were furious and ON HIS SIDE about the whole thing. 

I, however, got in a lot more trouble. My parents heard about it and they just wanted to see what was said in our team group chat, which is a chat full of 16 year old boys saying horrible stuff. Well you can imagine how that went and long story short i was grounded for a month and my parents screamed at me for like a week straight. 

Well we were arguing about this because he was acting like he got a much worse punishment because he had to sit out one game and he’s so good at water polo that that really made him upset and stuff like that. I told him I’d rather sit out a game than be grounded for a month and have your parents completely lose respect for you and he just said well yeah that’s because you’re shit at water polo, if you were good like me then you’d actually care about this. 



Long story short, he’s a dick to me at water polo which is every single day after school. I’m really supportive of him and I help him through things at school and help him stay on track with things, and it’s kind of frustrating that he does the complete opposite

I really want to talk to him about it, but if i told him in person he’d just tell me i’m wrong and not let me talk. I need your guys advice on whether or not i should text him this:

Hey bro can you stop being such a dick to me during water polo? You’re one of my best friends but when we’re at water polo you’re one of my least favorite people to be around because all you do is talk about how good you are or how shit i am and it’s getting really annoying.  You are a lot better than me, but you don’t need to act so cocky and rub it in every single time i talk to you

99,"I was born without my dad present at my birth. My birth certificate had lines where the dad's name should be, but I have pictures of what he looked like and some letters he wrote to my mom.

All my life I kept asking her to tell me. She finally said that when I was 18, she would tell me everything there was to know. I recently turned 18, but since then I've been stuck in this loop of trying to understand who my father was.

He had a bar, where my mom worked as a bartender. They had a really messed up relationship, he was her boss, and they always messed around. My mom was 20 when he was 24.

Apparently that bar was a front for his drug campaign. He was the lead distributor of cocaine in Massachusettes, and has ties to the mob, government officials and dealers around the state. He would funnel money through the bar, and he didn't get caught for a while.

After he left one day for work, my mom took my half brother to my grandmother's, and myself with her to run from him. He eventually was arrested for drug possession, dealing and other crimes.

At this point I'm scared shitless to meet this man. What will the family's reaction be to meeting me? Are they just as fucked up? All my life I've been curious and pushing to meet this man, but now that I have the chance to, I'm hesitant. I'm scared, and I have no idea what to do.",15Aug2019,1

So I need to find a place to live, the only problem is that I was forced to quit my job literally the day before he told me this. 

Usually that wouldn't be a problem, jobs generally aren't hard to find here- someone's always hiring. The problem is that I have a heart condition that prevents me from doing any work where I stand/walk for long periods of time. I'm pretty much limited only to office and reception jobs. Those are much harder to find, especially entry position with no office experience. Not impossible, but there's no way I'm going to be able to find anything in a month. 

There's nobody who can take me in. My parents and extended family are long out of the picture. The only people I really have in my life are my two brothers, and neither of them can really help me.

105,"irst post here, I hope it doesn't get deleted. I'm 22 and living in the central valley of California.  I work for a company I cannot name or I will lose my job and get sued. I'll give you a hint tho, they're extremely anti-union. I work 12 hours and commute for 6 hours 4-5 days a week. I make 2000 every 2 weeks, which sounds like a lot until you realise a studio apartment without bedbugs is gonna cost about 1000 a month. I rent a room on the outskirts of my city in the ghetto cus it's what I can realistically afford. It used to be rented out by tweakers so I had to clean literal shit piss and blood from strangers I've never met. I have to hang dry my clothes and the kitchen is so filthy I dont bother cooking as I've gotten food poisoning before from it. I honestly want to just die as I work my ass off just to get taxed 20% to come home to filth. I dont even feel clean after showering. I've been with my company almost 2 years and everyone who started around the same time as me are all making a SIGNIFICANT amount more than me. Everyone agrees I'm a hard worker yet I haven't gotten any promotions, raises, not even a high five. They're just using me until I'm fed up and im honestly there because everyone i work with is able to support themselves fine between the bonuses and raises. 

I could go on all day but my main question is should I move out of state? Housing is simply unaffordable, taxes take an absurd amount from me (nearly 500 dollars every check!!) And my job is clearly going nowhere. I'm tired of living and being treated like trash but I'm not sure if moving will really solve anything. I've been looking into florida, Texas, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, and Washington. I've narrowed these down by cost of living, taxes, and just the fact these are all places I've fantasized of moving to or visiting. Realistically I could transfer my current job to Nevada, and my girlfriend has some family connections there, but I'm worried about if I'll be treated worse as the labor and safety laws are far more lax. Also many other Californians are moving there and being that it is a really fast growing economy right now, I'm worried cost of living will skyrocket in the near future. Same for arizona. Utah is a little further out and cost of living is so god dam low, on top of the fact that it's so beautiful there I think id do really great there... but in worried about finding work that will afford me housing. I feel the same way about Florida, although I think it is honestly my preferred choice. I've always wanted to see and experience swimming in a warm ocean instead of these freezing California waters that are useless for anything other than looks. The culture is also extremely similar to where I'm from. My last choice is Texas, although its only because I know so little about it, it's such a huge place I dont know where I would really like to be and to be honest I dont even know what most of Texas looks like, I've always assumed it was prairies, plains, hills, and desert, seems kinda boring. I really wanna see something special. I love the scenery of Utah, Arizona and Florida. I hope someone bears through reading this to chime in cus I'm really by myself here. All I have is 2 friends and my girlfriend, no family or nothing. I live by my own means and I need to make things better for myself.",15Aug2019,2
106,"(WARNING, it’s going to be a very long story)

Hi, my name is BlueBerryBlues(sad berry lol), and I have been dealing with a lot of stuff lately, especially with crushes. Here are some small things about me; I’m about to graduate this year(thank you early college), and I’m wanna become a veterinarian, I originally wanted to become an animator but lost interest, I enjoy reading(surprisingly) and I’m such a weeb when it comes to anime 😅.

So, I’m asking for advice/help to get over a middle school crush. So, here’s the story. It’s pretty long.I meant this Hispanic guy(likes just call him Juan) and he was an 8th grader and I was a 7th grader. I didn’t like him at all because I thought he was creepy and I thought he was a dick. He had a girlfriend at the time(I think she was in high school?) and he would always flirt with other girls. He was such a weirdo back then. He then started moving his flirts to me and I felt awkward. I would try to brush it off but I guess I wasn’t good at it. But fast forward a year later. Juan and I became good friends. Apparently, we had a lot in common. We both liked anime, video games, wanted to make animations and etc.

We had a small group of friends that we would hang out with sometimes and we had a pretty good time. Till one day, around summertime, Juan and his girlfriend broke up. According to him, he said his girlfriend had no emotion to their relationship. And it wasn’t going great. He started to text me and tell me about it and he was heartbroken. So I told, he will find love someday. And he started having a genuine conversation with me and I guess something clicked between us. He legit said, “I love you. You’re the best girl I ever had feelings for. I don’t deserve anyone like you..”He was the first guy that said “I love you”, to me. You don’t know how much that meant to me when I was in middle school. So, we continued talking. About life, our goals and if we were ever married(I know, it’s a fairy tale.). I was such in a rush to date him. I just wanted him to be mine. And mine alone. I wanted to treat him like he was my prince and he would treat me as his princess. As much it sounds, it was just a fairytale that would never come true.

Because our text messages became distant. He just texted me less and less. It was to the point where I asked: “did I do something wrong?” “How was your day?” “Hey, you wanna chat?”It would be some responds or none. So.. I just, tried to ignore it. I did my best to forget about it and it was hard for me to do so. After I left middle school I went to high school(lol duh) and let’s just say, Juan and I go to the same one. Juan was still nice and wanted to be my friend and talk more. My dumbass was like. “Yeah, I missed you a lot”

But Hey, we hanged out, chilled with friends and that was it for my freshmen year. During my sophomore year, he dated a girl. She was really pretty, smart, had a car and has a job that pays well. I was jealous of her. But I ignored their relationship and tried to focus more on school work. I did remember that they broke up around November of 2018, and they stopped talking. But all of a sudden, they became friends and fell in love. I basically didn’t care and moved on with my life.

So, here comes something interesting. There was this cute boy in my history class(We’ll call him Tyrone). He was really funny, outgoing, and enjoyed MK(mortal kombat). We became friends for a while and I guess you can say we ended up liking each other. He was incredibly sweet and kind and such a gentleman. Tyrone really liked me and asked me out. I was so nervous because I’ve never been on a date before. We watched a movie and had ice cream afterward. It was really fun.  So nothing drastically happened..... UNTIL JUNE COMES AROUND AND SAID FUCK YOU!

So what happened was, Juan goes to his hometown of Puerto Rico to visit some family. He occasionally texts me and asks me how was I doing. And we would have a normal conversation. But then, he ended up telling me that he and his girlfriend broke up(this is the cute smarty-pants girl) and what he told me, she was similar to the first girl but she hated going out. I’m not sure why... and I never asked.Juan then asked me, “I know your birthday is coming up, why don’t I get you a present?” And I said sure and he asked, what would you like. I JOKINGLY said “Give me a kiss on the cheek lol and give me candy,” He said deal and I said “You don’t have too” he replied saying “I know”.

SO LET'S FAST FORWARD TO TODAY!

Today in the afternoon, I took the bus to go to my old apartment complex to get picked up by my mom. Juan and I talked for a bit and he teased me about sex and kinks... I didn’t wanna hear all of that so I changed the subject and we both just walked to the playground. He said bye and I said bye and we both walked our separate ways. I went to the swing set and started swinging while listening to music.Till I see, this motherfucker, walking towards the playground. I was like, “what the hell? Did he need something??” So I got off the swing and asked what’s up. HE PULLED ME CLOSE AND KISSED MY CHEEK... I was SOOO Starstruck. I didn’t know how to respond to that. All of my emotions from middle school started coming back to me. I felt like I wanted more of him. So... I kissed him on his cheek. He was surprised and was confused. He smiled though and patted my head. “So, you got what you wanted..” he told me.

I wanted to cry and run away but. He wanted to be with me. We walked and talked and stuff... I feel like I love him again.So I’ll cut to the chase. How do I get rid of my feelings? I know he doesn’t want a relationship with me... And... I just want to get over this guy! I have feelings towards another guy(Tyrone). And I want to be with him... So is there any advice you guys can give me? On how to get over him??

Also, I’m sooo sorry that this is long. The kissing literally happened today and I just want to lose these feelings towards this guy...(Sorry for any errors, I did this on my phone lol)",15Aug2019,1

The only reason I'm scared of dropping out is because after talking to admissions I'd lose my major and there's no guarantee I can be readmitted because I'd have one 144 units.

My parents would never let me drop out. (I called and they said I'd be a useless bum while every one of my other family members would go on to graduate and do something with their life.)

114,"So theres this new girl at my school(around 3 weeks in now) who I have a crush on. So I decided to speak to her during the only two periods we have together, and in those moments I make her laugh so much. The lamest joke (word play with kidnap and dognap) ended up making her laugh for like half a minute, and it seemed pretty genuine to me.

 I found out she had a boyfriend in her old school and they this toxic relationship (where he was receiving nudes from other girls), but I figured it would be over soon enough. I really doubt it is, though, but I give it a month or less. 

However, I'm trying to know her as a friend first, before diving straight down. It's hard for me to talk to her in person, so I text her. Nonetheless, she limits herself to a couple of words per answer, and shows no interest whatsoever in advancing the conversation. I've tried like 3 times to text her already, same result, so I haven't been able to know her. Not a clue what she likes, how many siblings she has, her favourite color. I literally don't know anything about her. She's closed I guess.

Something worth mentioning is that many (+/-5) guys have tried hitting on her, all getting rejected.

So what I'm getting at is, how can I get her to feel more open (and comfortable?) with me, enough for me to get to know her but not too much so that she friendzones me. Should I stop what I've been doing and wait for her and her boyfriend to break up?

My boss said that once we are done she is going to test me with income taxes. I passed all the exams but because she let me use my notes. I really tried learning everything but I don't get it. I don't know if whether to tell her that I don't get it or what do I do. I am probably going to have to study more for this but I have school in August and i planned on quitting but idk what should I do. What if she tests me and I don't do good and she says then what have I been doing with the clases and instead she fires me. I am so stressed. Is there any other excuse other than school that I can use to quit on good terms but where I can still have her recommendation if I ever want to go to another job,15Aug2019,1

I know the title kinda doesn't make sense but I'll try to explain better.
So I'm (21 M) and I'm planning to hang out with one of my friends this Sunday, but my parents always want to know who it is even though they know who they are. Whenever I go out I always let them know where I am and who I'm with as well but sometimes I just want some peace and quiet.

120,"I didn’t pickup my paycheck for a couple days after payday because I wasn’t scheduled to work and I figured I’d just get it on the next day I worked... but they didn’t have it. They were just like “You didn’t pick it up? Well, oh yah it’s gone, someone must have lost it WHOOPS” and they had a little chat about checking in on the office on Monday to see if they could find it. It’s now Wednesday and after texting my boss these past few days they still don’t have it, and it seems like she hasn’t even checked until recently (she hit me with the “I’ll check tomorrow” these past few days). I’m scheduled to work tomorrow but frankly I plan on quitting. I was sort of looking for an excuse anyway.

What I need help with is the best way to acquire my paycheck without too much conflict. I don’t want to be upfront about the fact I’m leaving because frankly I’m afraid of how my manager will react. I’m just kind of autistic and don’t like dealing with conflict especially from my excitable ESL boss. Now, I know this is not the most mature way to handle the situation, but I don’t care all that much, especially because of how they’ve treated me and stuff. I just want to get my money I’ve earned and get out. 

The thing is she said she’d call me once she had the paycard, but I told her I don’t feel comfortable working anymore until I have it (it’s 9 days after payday at this point). And she said, that “I’d be OK” and that I’d get it tomorrow (again, not apologetic at all about losing my money and not getting back to me on it, and seemingly annoyed that I’m asking her about it), but I don’t want to go in for work and idk when she’ll get it. 

At the end of the day this comes down to me not wanting to be “that guy” and walk into work having everyone gossiping or wondering why I quit or giving me dirty looks or whatever. I just want to get my money, and then quit remotely so I don’t have to deal with the fallout. Petty and emotionally immature? Probably yes. Absolutely my intention to do? Also yes. 


Now legally, I know I’m fine to just quit and everything, but I feel like after being so flippant with my money they are going to stall out even longer at this point if I tell them I’m quitting, and I don’t want to get screwed out of what I’ve earned while working there. Keep in mind I have this paycheck and another entire week of work after that to get paid for. Is there anyway I can just quit and then go through McDonald’s corporation directly so I don’t have to deal with these people anymore?

My backup strategy is to just say I can’t work tomorrow for unrelated reasons, and then pickup the card that night and never come back.",15Aug2019,2
121,"Id like to mention that I dont want to come off as spoiled, I am extremely thankful for the first car they got me for my 16th birthday (which was a gift), I've had it for the last year. 

and for about 4 months I've looked into getting a manual transmission car (I live in the US if that matters) and in the last 2 months I've seriously considered and done research about it and gone to look at cars,

Now I have a job,  and in the last 4 months, the only money I've spent that wasn't on food or gas was for my sisters birthday. I have never gone out shopping or bought anything for myself in the 4 months I've been working,

My parents actually encourage me to go shopping so I can ""make my working worth it"", but I find it hard to spend money.

An opportunity came for a car which was my dream car which is in a good price range for me, but my parents (specifically my dad) absolutely wont even consider it. The following are the reasons he gave why:

•you're 16, you dont need another car

I have asked for better reasons, but everytime I mention it he gets pissed, I made it clear that all of the car would be bought by me. But he absolutely wont let me. 

My car is worth more than the one I'm buying, so i would actually make money. 

Why does my dad disallow me to spend the money that I make on things that make me happy?

124,"Sorry for typos, not native English speaker. It's my second attempt at posting this, for some reason bots hate it, that's why I censored everything.

I'm 32, both p*rn and IRL s*x no longer gets me hard at all (I'm not impotent, manual manipulation still gets me hard, it's a lack of s*xual desire). I've already lost my girlfriend of 2 years over this (2 months ago), she was not understanding at all and she was pretty mean about it throughout (and she is not the first). I've been losing interest in s*x for many years now, about 10 or so, gradually. I had trouble maintaining an e-re-ction because of barely any interest in s-x for the last 4 years. It's not my girlfriend, she was a solid 7, even p-rn with 9/10, 10/10 women also don't turn me on AT ALL. And no I'm not turning g--a-y, I watched g--a-y p*rn as well to test it, NOTHING. (I even watched other even weirder p*rn, but nothing, no movement down there and no s*xual desire).

I already talked to two doctors about it. One of them told me there is nothing that he can do (he was a GP, general practitioner) and directed my to a psychiatrist. Psychiatrist set up consulting for me I went 4-5 times, even though I knew it wouldn't help and it was really expensive. It was how I imagined it ""open up about your s*xuality, don't be ashamed of your body, explore your feelings and your body, must be stress etc.."" NO! I Never had issues with this and I don't have more stress than average. In fact I have less stress now than I had 6 years ago, a lot less. It felt like liberal, leftist, femi*nin-t propaganda (in fact it made me not want to have s*x more than I already did..., the psychiatrist was a woman, probably fe*i/ist, leftist probably) 

I've also taken 20-30 different supplements over 10 years they also don't help. 

I'm open to anything! I just really don't want to end up forever alone at 32, I'm not even fa---t, I'm pretty good looking with an above average sized p**nis, uncut, which seems to be more in demand nowadays than cut (according to my girlfriends) (I'm probably a 7/10) . BUT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO TOLERANCE, UNDERSTANDING or ACCEPTANCE FOR MEN WHO ARE NO LONGER INTERESTED IN S*X! Women avoid me on dating sites if I'm honest about it! And there is no hiding this IRL. :( I'M DESPERATE!  :(",15Aug2019,2

128,"I been friends with this guy since 6th grade, despite me moving to a nearby state for 7th grade and on, our friendship remained strong. My first time smoking weed and doing LSD was with him, in 9-10th grade respectively. 

But even after a few years of smoking and tripping together, I still am wary. He lives in the same bad neighborhood I used to live in, he has robbed people in the past, fought many people and has sold many drugs.  

I went the route of solely recreational drug use and never sold. I am more passive and friendly while he is more confrontational and closed off. I haven’t seen him in a year although have kept in contact with him through social media. He has held my expensive headphones and my Playstation for me for weeks at a time and I have even held his wallet for a week during an emergency. 

He has these new shady ass friends that take him to rob dealers and fight people. I’m going to visit him in a week and he talks about how much he misses me and when I’m coming.  I know I’m just being paranoid because it’s HIM and OF COURSE he would not try anything. But those new friends of his just tip me off the wrong way. Am I being paranoid here? 

He has always had a soft spot for me and has treated me very well, but me not seeing him and being able to be the “angel” on his shoulder and those friends he has worry me. He won’t want to do anything but I feel like I could be smoking with him and those gang member friends and all of a sudden my wallet is gone and I’m in the hospital. I am acquainted with one of those guys pretty well, but another one that went to my elementary school cracked my skull on a rock in 4th grade.

130,"So I was an intern for a large corporation this past summer. But my team was very small, about 20 people. I was a great intern and got a great performance review and got a full time offer the day before my last day of work. Well the day before that, I found out my team lead is my best friend’s dad’s best friend. I told him (let’s call him Charlie), and he thought that was so cool, that he asked to take a selfie with me which he then sent to my best friend (he’s like 55 and has my 22 year friend’s number, that’s how close he is to her family). So at the team outing when everyone left, people asked how I knew Charlie and I ended up showing them a picture of him with my friend’s dad from like 30 years ago and one guy said “Oh send us that tomorrow!”

So on my last day, my fellow intern and I wrote good bye and thank you emails and sent them at the same time right before we left and I signed mine with a pic of Charlie from 30 years ago and I said “Cheers!” We turned in our laptops and when I came back down, the team was saying “Oh I love that picture of Charlie! He responded to the group look what he said!” And he said “I wanted to let you all know she has been fired.” And he emailed me a blank email with just the subject that said “You’re fired!!”

Well it was my last day. And he’s not actually in charge of my offer, my recruiter is. And my recruiter has not reached out about it. Sooooo I’m wondering if I am actually “fired” aka had my full time offer revoked. It doesn’t start until like a year from now since I’m still in school. I think Charlie was kidding, but I honestly don’t know. The team seemed so close and always joked around all summer so I thought the picture would be okay. But now I’m not sure. I asked my friend’s mom and she just said “Yeah I’m not sure how that went over, you’d have to ask my husband or Charlie.” So now I’m freaking out because I never responded because I assumed he was kidding if he sent that to the whole team. Should I reply? Should I ask if he is serious? Should I apologize?",15Aug2019,0

132,"I have found myself to be in a unique situation, and after a full year of trying various ways to overcome the situation, I still find myself at square one.

For about 10 years now, I’ve had one girl ( and I’m a guy) who I call my best friend. Around a year ago, we became super close. We both had crappy things happen to us recently and one night, her and I slept together. A week went by, and she didn’t say much to me (I know I should’ve seen the signs, but I was blinded by what I thought could be). I decided to tell her that I have feelings for her and I have for years. To no surprise, she was aware. She then told me she was sleeping with another guy. A guy I resented and still do if I’m being honest. 

Receiving the news that my dad had passed away was easier to hear than that. It felt like a Mac Truck had ran into me going 100 mph. I knew telling her how I felt risked the friendship, but with the way things were going before we slept together, I was extremely confident she said she would feel the same. I let myself play out a life where she said yes. I should not have done that.

At first I put on a show for her, trying to show I was happy for her. She wanted him and I to be friends, so I tried. She wanted to be able to act the same way around me as she had before everything happened. So I tried to act the same as well. But after I poured my heart out to her, I didn’t know how to act. It was inevitable that that charade was going to end, trying to help improve her mental health by giving her the life she wanted was destroying mine, because I didn’t want to only be her friend anymore. It’s been impossible for me to go back to that mindset of ‘just friends’, and I have tried so hard to get back there, but it just seems like I’m beating a dead horse at this point. 

After that I decided keeping my distance from her would be the smart thing to do. It was the last thing I wanted to try, but I was out of ideas. I chose to try and focus on her flaws and force myself to dislike certain things about her, but I quickly found out, I already knew her flaws way before I told her how I felt, so if I loved her with her flaws then, it was going to be the same here and now. 

Before I continue I want to make one thing clear. I don’t want her to leave the guys she’s with. I don’t ever expect her and I to be together.

I went months without seeing or talking to her, but she never once faded from my thoughts. In fact, not knowing that her day-to-day life was going well, I was being driven insane. I had to block her on all forms of social media in order to not see her name. I eventually unblocked her after finding out that this was making me think of her more rather than less. 

Now is where this gets hard for me to write because I have to be completely honest with myself. I hate the guys she’s with because I want to be him. It sounds so petty and stupid, I know. I’ve already spent months beating myself up for hating him even though she’s improved tremendously with him. 

This whole situation has also completely ruined the possibility of anything with anyone in the future. I’ve gone on several dates and slept with several women since, so it’s not a matter of not being able to, it’s a matter of not wanting to and because it’s not fair to the other girl. Every time I’ve hung out or slept with someone else, I always catch myself thinking “I wish it was ____ instead” and it’s just not fair to the others. I would hate it if all a girl could think about was someone else while they were with me. I also don’t want to be in any relationship because I don’t want to (or think I can handle) going through this shit again. My mental health got to the lowest point it’s even been during this, and I’m worried about what I will do if it gets that low again. 

Please don’t tell me to go to therapy, I tried a dozen therapists and just as many anti depressants (I’ve actually found that taking antidepressants just makes me feel more depressed, I’ve been happier since I stopped). Therapy was always a one way conversation, I have a hard time talking to even my mom about personal stuff, so some stranger who may say they care, but really only care about the paycheck isn’t the way to go for me.

To be honest I’m not sure why I’m posting this. I guess I want to know what you’d guys would do if you were in my shoes. Or maybe some of you have been and could help me out. She’ll always be my best friend and I’ll always love and care for her, it’s just not going to be in the way I want it to be.",15Aug2019,1

136,"So these past few months, I've really been questioning my personality and my decisions, and I wonder if this is good for me. 

I kept all my problems in, all of my thoughts. Growing up, I never really had anyone in my family to talk to about my problems. They took care of me, but I never had any meaningful conversations or moments, they just feel like acquaintances. I spend my days gaming in my room thinking, listening to music thinking, talking to friends while thinking, and walking outside for hours thinking. I do a lot of thinking and stay in my own head, my own bubble, and I'd prefer to keep everything in but I understand that it hurts to close myself up. 

I feel like this plays a factor in my independence from my family, I love them a lot but I feel drifted away, I was left to learn everything I've learned, deal with everything, and make nearly every choice by myself. I am proud of how I shaped myself as a person, but I can also be very negative towards myself. I refuse to believe I'm a good person by any means, and always think strongly of my mistakes. This means I can be very inconsistent, sometimes I'm confident and strong, other days I just break down in frustration of myself.  

I get frustrated easily over myself and the mistakes I make, and my confidence drops. I also tend to downplay myself a lot, when I head into a problem or task I try to go in with confidence and high expectations, and that standard of expectations gets into my head. Often I believe I'm not good enough, and I have to work 10x harder to improve. 

Growing up without much attention or help from my family about my problems or choices wasn't too ideal. I feel alone, and I feel fine growing up by myself, but I just wonder sometimes what it would've been like if I just had another perspective on me. I don't want my friends to go through the same thing, so I do my best to help, take care of and love my friends.  

The past school year, I've made a lot of really good friends. A lot of these friends however questioned my mentality and personality, and they care about me a lot. I'm not really used to it. I'm used to being independent, with no one questioning my actions and motives. To have people question me for the first time, and have people show genuine care and desire to help me, I felt confused.  

Is it wrong for me to be this way? I am critical and toxic to myself because I feel that's the best way for me to improve but my friends praise me. I hold my problems in because I don't want to bother anyone and I think I can handle them but my friends get scared and worry for me. I go out of my way to help my friends even at my own cost, and they constantly remind me how I'm a great person because they know I have this insecurity, but I can't convince myself. What can I change?",15Aug2019,4

143,"okay throwaway because my twitch username is the same as my reddit one and im not a risk taker

alright i know this sounds like a weird question with an obvious answer, but first a little backstory. around a month ago, i was on Twitter just looking at some people’s profiles from my school and seeing what they were up to and all that dumb stuff. i ended up stumbling on this one guys account that had a link to his twitch account. ive never been particularly close with this guy (if anything we’re decently acquainted), but i was curious nonetheless. from what i saw, he seemed pretty passionate about streaming, but literally nobody was in his chat. like i was literally the only viewer. and i know this obviously isn’t uncommon for small streamers, but he wanted people in his chat very badly, so i y’know, interacted with him a little bit. long story short, i started frequenting his streams and saying a small thing here and there to liven up the chat a bit when nobody else was there (he actually ended up moding me). but, the thing is, im not really sure if i should continue doing this. if he ever did find out it was me, i wouldn’t want to make him uncomfortable or be deemed as “creepy” since, as i said, im not really friends with this guy at all. besides that, i have social anxiety problems and it makes it hard for me to really say much outside of the occasional little sentence, so im not sure if my efforts are really even worth it in the end. 

so my question is, should i stop this behavior? if not, is there a way i could be more nice in chat or help him out despite my anxiety problems?",15Aug2019,1

Back years ago I used to be in a community of artists of a book that I personally enjoyed and eventually grew out of it. I stopped participating in the community long ago but I still have friends that I still talk to from those times. I admit I was cringy, but don’t we all think that of our younger selves? And I tried to remove myself from the person I was back then. All because I’m now afraid of judgement from my friends. A couple of my friends from the old days have become furries and they are genuinely friendly people that I like, but now in instagram comments and such they still interact with my posts and stuff like a normal person except their profiles are dedicated to cringey furry stuff, nothing crazy but just like characters and art. I’m getting anxiety about my friends looking through comments and seeing one or two furries, then spreading stuff about me being a furry which sounds trivial but highschool is a bitch with seemingly trivial things that actually matter a lot.

145,"About 4 days ago, KISS was coming to a suburb of a city that's a 3 hour drive from where I live. This is going to be their farewell tour and they're both retiring when their tour is over. I've never seen KISS before, and I thought that I should go because I thought it'll be cool to get to see a once in a lifetime experience to see KISS before they retire. I saw that there were some tickets that very available, and I thought that I could go by myself to see them and just take a shuttle of a taxi to and from the hotel that I'm could stay at.

My parents however suggested that I should go on very small trips instead and that maybe I could see some other bands in larger cities in the near future when I can. I've done that while in tech school in Iowa by going to small towns nearby, but that was just about it. I had never driven in a big city by myself before, and while even though I see myself driving in cities like that in the near future.

I think my parents are saying that I should go with either one of them, or with a friend who might be going to the concert too. I've been to concerts before but they were all in county fairs and all of the artist that go there are usually just country singers and groups. I did liked some of them, but the others that come to those fairs each year are artist that I hadn't even heard of or recognize at all. Some of the hotels nearby the arena where the concert was taking place do offer free shuttle services to concerts, but others don't and guest who are going to them will be required to either call a taxi. 

My parents told me that it takes months to plan a trip like this, especially if it's in a big city, and because of the fact that the KISS concert will be performed on Labor Day weekend, traffic will be a a hustle. I live in a small city of about 17,000 people, but the town's airport does serve non-stop fights to the city where KISS will perform everyday.

146,"I've felt down for 2 years now, but it got worse when I got out of high school. I can't really find the motivation to do anything. I want to do stuff, but I just don't for some reason. Plus, in college (I'm in a Community college, and I've only taken an online course) I'd get really stressed out. Sometimes, I'd scream in frustration, other times I'd just shut down completely. I've done some things over the past few months, and it helped a bit, but not much:

* NoFap ( I don't really believe in the pseudoscience, but I wanted something to get my hormones balanced (I'm a 20-year-old male). I've done it for about 80 days now, and I've seen some results (I have a bit more motivation, I'm more creative).
* I'm exercising more (ab and chest workouts). That's given me a bit more energy I guess
* Duolingo. I'm learning Chinese, and it's making me think more clearly

I just kind of shut down. I go to sleep at 5 or 6 am and wake up at 2 or 3 pm, I barely do anything (I decided to take a break for the summer). I don't get it. I like to draw and make videos. Why aren't I drawing until my hands get sore? Why am I not recording any videos? I've done nothing this summer, and I can't take it anymore. I have 2 weeks to actually do something.",15Aug2019,2

I play games online with a group of awesome people I've known for several years now and even though we aren't close physically we are pretty connected and close. The two I'm closest to started dating but now they are on break due to some mutual feelings of not being compatible and all the usual struggles of a long distance relationship. Now they are leaning towards an actual break up because of how long it will be before meeting in person could happen and the above reasons. It is upsetting to them both and they still have feelings for each other and I'm unsure of how to go about being there for both of them. How should I space my time, what do I say? Should I say anything?  I've said the usual, ""I'm sorry"", ""it'll work out"", ""life goes on"",etc. but I feel as if I'm not helping in the slightest. I've never helped anyone though a mutual break up where I'm friends with both parties involved. What do Reddit, what do?

TL/DR: My two friends are going through a mutual break up and I'm unsure of how to help.

To do so I would have to reach out to my ex's mother and get him signed up. I want my brother to experience this, but at the same time I don't want to make things weird.

154,"I don’t typically post on here, but I feel like I have no other options right now. 

On Monday night (August 12th), I went out with a few friends, all female, to go thrift shopping. I’m 18, going to be 19 soon, and I identify as a homosexual male. I’m not really out to most people but recently I’ve tried exploring more of my “feminine” interests that were kinda “forbidden” for me for most of my life. I’m super obsessed with cosmetology and fashion, resulting in a similar obsession with the art of drag and gender-bending. At the thrift store, my one friend joked about how all of us should try on dresses and take a picture together. My dumb ass saw this as an opportunity to try something I’ve been wanting to for a long time. Put on the dress, fell in love with the idea of being a drag performer, etc etc. I decided to put a picture of it on my Instagram page with a caption implying the fact that I’m gay out of impulsivity. Here would be a perfect time to note that I have borderline personality disorder, and a history with suicide attempts, as well as extreme anxiety and depression. 

Tuesday was pretty uneventful, with exception of me working most of the day. 

Wednesday (Today), I wake up and immediately go to my Instagram. Someone had posted an anti-gay catholic post in response to my personal post. I have a bad history with the church and homosexuality so this is where things went downhill. I facetimed my friend basically in tears and explained the whole thing. She and my other friend thought they were being helpful, and basically tried to solve homophobia in an Instagram post and totally outted me and my whole situation. At this point everything is out of hand, pills are back in my hand, I’m losing my shit. Then I get a Snapchat message from this racist, homophobic guy that has sexually assaulted like 3 girls, two of them I know personally. I used to be “friends” with this guy and I’m honestly too scared to block him so I never have. He starts getting really sketchy with me. He’s best friends with the guy that sent the anti-gay post. He also messaged my friend, her being one of the girls he fucking harassed. She blocks him immediately but I end up getting into a conversation with him out of fear. He kept trying to get me to hang out with him, asking when I’m going away for school, saying he’ll teach me how to drive a tractor (on his farm in the middle of fucking nowhere). I finally just said like “maybe someday” and he stopped for now

I’m just not sure what to do next. I get extremely paranoid (I have bpd lol) so I have no clue of the severity of things. There’s a part of me that wants to just get closure on it and agree to going to his house/farm but I also don’t want to be the end result of a hate crime.",15Aug2019,0
155,"I (18M) grew up as the second to my sibling. (This is going to sound somewhat immature but I’m emotional right now so give me a break). I was the computer nerd and he was the sports one, so he was favored. I never really did anything in terms of birthdays, while he’d get big parties every year. I was fine because I didn’t like being the center of attention much. Fast forward to March 2019, and I turned 18. And where was my family? Two states over at a baseball tournament. I only heard from my grandparents and my best friend that day, as expected. I’ve been secretly bitter about that for a long time.

Recently we moved closer to family, which had us moving across the USA. I lost literally everything that I loved. My friends, my grandparents, all because they guilt tripped me into moving here. So now I’m stuck here where I’m the bitch boy of the family. My parents decided to say that we were going to spend the weekend 5 hours away and stay overnight for my (fucking 5 year old) cousin’s birthday party. I said that I would rather not go, and they said that it was a family’s birthday, and I had to go. I’m about 10 goddamn seconds from blowing up at them right now for their bullshit, but I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to get kicked out, especially up here where I have no one. How could I confront them on their hypocrisy?

157,"Context: I met this guy when I was a personal trainer working at a local gym. I was in very good shape, 5’6’, 15% (which isn’t perfect, but good) body fat, very muscular thighs, back and stomach. I mean, I could do pull-ups. The man in question is also a personal trainer and he makes a very good living off his clients. And he is still chiseled af.

I’ve always wanted to work in the medical field. I have a big dream of traveling the world, sort of doing mission work overseas in different hospitals..:except not under the guise of a religion. So, I took to college to become a nurse. To support myself, I accepted 2 sedentary jobs (just so happens they pay well, I would prefer something active), and everyone knows sitting down during lecture and sitting down to study and do homework doesn’t make for a hard body.

I have stuck to a decent diet. But my whole life was fitness before, and now that’s a fraction. I’m focused on other things. I wouldn’t say I’m fat, but I’m certainly what trainers in the fitness world call “skinny fat”. I maybe have time to get 3 decent workouts in per week...which, again, isn’t bad, but I definitely don’t look like a personal trainer anymore. 

This guy has been asking to see me and really trying to go on dates with me. Only thing is, he hadn’t seen me in person in about a year. I kind of kept making excuses why we couldn’t hang out. But finally I told him the reason why was because I didn’t look fit anymore and I felt insecure about what he would think of me. 

I was expecting some kind of response but He just fucking blocked me after that. On everything...and I gotta say it’s a huge knife to my self-esteem. This doesn’t seem like it’s in his character. He’s always been so nice before...he seems like the type who would at least be like, “nah, don’t worry about it. Let’s hang out and if it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work.”

Did I piss him off? Or is he really just a fucking asshole who doesn’t want to talk to me because I’m not fit enough for him? Why wouldn’t he at least have some response? 

Also: he’s 32 and has a child. I’m 25 with no kids. Don’t know if that makes a difference.",15Aug2019,4

160,"Job 1- I have been working as a maid/housekeeper at a motel for about 1.5 years. The work is easy and I honestly don't hate it. I get Around 30+hours a week and its minimum wage. I obviously don't want to work here forever but I get enough hours (except in winter it gets very slow and hours are cut). 

Job 2- I started last month as an ambulance driver (not an emt) in a very rural area. We have a low call volume, maybe 2-3 calls per day. I am still in training. I completed emt training in May, but don't have national certification (it has to be obtained within a year of hire). I do training one day a week (24 hr shift, on call and respond from home after going home for the day). I have a few more training shifts, after which I will be on call, but not have a guaranteed schedule. I will be assigned to a second unit which gets called in the rare event our first unit is out on another call, or when a patient needs to be transported to another facility (our closest neighboring hospitals are about 3 hours away). To be honest, I kind of hate it but I am staying on to see if things improve. After getting a feel for the job, I don't really have interest in becoming an emt. I will primarily be doing ift (transports) rather than 911 calls it seems.

At job 1, I work pretty much everyday, except for the one day I do my training on the ambulance. However, job 2 wants me to come in on a specific day and job 1 doesn't want to grant me the day off. I left a message for my supervisor of job 2 but he never got back to me. Basically, I can't show up for training tomorrow. I plan to get in touch with the guy training me tomorrow and let him know just to notify them. I feel like they are going to be upset. They also know I work everyday at my other job.

I have been having way more anxiety than usual since starting the new job but I feel like I need to give it a chance. I just don't know how to make my schedule work at both jobs at the moment. I want to move on and ultimately get into substitute teaching since I have a degree, and plan to teach. But I don't know what to do.

162,"So basically I’m switching from homeschool with high honors and going to a public middle school, one that only has standard and GT classes. Problem is they can’t put me in high honors immediately, the teachers of each of my classes have to recommend me for GT, meaning I gotta earn it.

Doesn’t sound like much of a big deal probably to most of you, but I don’t think I’m smart enough to get to GT.

My boyfriend and I just got our first apartment together. After about 1 month, and everything was settled down, we moved my cat in with us. Ralph is a 4 year old Maine Coon. He’s extremely loving. 

So Ralph is with us for a week and we have one particularly nice day over the weekend. So we opened all the windows and our sliding door (they all have screens). 

Then Sunday night I hear him chirping and sliding around everywhere in our bedroom. I turn on the light and he has a dead mouse! I was shocked cause 1. I am a very clean person so I was so surprised there was a mouse in the apartment.  And 2. I don’t know how it even got in here. 

We mustard it up to bad ventilation and maybe having our windows / doors open all day wasn’t the best idea. So then Monday night comes and Ralph is laying on our bedroom floor just staring under the dresser. 

So I’m thinking “ok that’s where the mouse was so he thinks there is more” 
 
Everyone goes to sleep and that’s it. 
Tuesday night he’s back in the same spot. So I ignore it and go to bed. Then at 2:30AM, he has another dead mouse?! 

So now I’m like “I need to call my landlord in the morning” 

This morning we think we found how the mice were getting in so my boyfriend blocked it off with steel wool and insulation. So we figured we didn’t need to get in touch with our landlord.

Now I am laying in bed and Ralph was in bed with us- as soon as I turned off the light he jumped off and resumed his spot in front of the dresser.

Does he know if there are more mice? Obviously cats have great senses and are so much more alert. 

I’ve never had mice though so I’m trying to understand his behavior to asses the problem. 

I should mention he’s been an indoor cat since he was a kitten.

When I moved in he promised to pay for a gardener, cover the utilities, install sprinklers, and install air conditioning. None of this happened of course. Well, he did pay for a gardener for a little while and then fired him without letting me know. He has gradually raised my rent every year and I haven't complained, but this year, he wants me to pay $360 more a month because he plans to install air conditioning.  It's a HUGE raise in rent, even with air conditioning. Trust me, I would LOVE AC considering our summers average 100 degrees (today it was 105). The thing is, he justifies the huge increase because a two bedroom/one bath with AC in my neighborhood would come close to what he is asking for (he is asking for $200 more than the average).

I got up and moved the chair and looked at a girl who was standing within arms reach and said ""woah how did that chair even fall over! There's no one there!"" I was genuinely confused. I was fine btw.

Later my boyfriend picked me up from the club and I told him a chair randomly tipped over as I passed it and knocked my down. He was like ""uh chairs don't just tip over like that."" He said it sounded like someone might have tipped it over on me on purpose after I told him the area was completely empty except for one other girl. 

So now I'm like that should have been an obvious thought. How could it have not even crossed my mind? Now that I think about it the look on her face wasn't concern or surprise at all. But not exactly amusement either. Just a neutral expression.",15Aug2019,1
179,Ok so my boyfriend of 8 years had a job that was horrible (coworkers and boss took advantage of him and passed him up on promotions and raises so many times). He was unhappy so I supported him in his decision to quit. He talked about taking a break for a month or 2 which I was totally fine with. Fast forward to 7 months later he still has no job. Gets high EVERYDAY and just plays video games all day (and he’s been getting fatter 😓) I’ve made comments to him about how I’m financially struggling but he just disregards it.

182,"Sorry for typos, not native English speaker. It's my second attempt at posting this, for some reason bots hate it, that's why I censored everything.

I'm 32, both p*rn and IRL s*x no longer gets me hard at all (I'm not impotent, manual manipulation still gets me hard, it's a lack of s*xual desire). I've already lost my girlfriend of 2 years over this (2 months ago), she was not understanding at all and she was pretty mean about it throughout (and she is not the first). I've been losing interest in s*x for many years now, about 10 or so, gradually. I had trouble maintaining an e-re-ction because of barely any interest in s-x for the last 4 years. It's not my girlfriend, she was a solid 7, even p-rn with 9/10, 10/10 women also don't turn me on AT ALL. And no I'm not turning g--a-y, I watched g--a-y p*rn as well to test it, NOTHING. (I even watched other even weirder p*rn, but nothing, no movement down there and no s*xual desire).

I already talked to two doctors about it. One of them told me there is nothing that he can do (he was a GP, general practitioner) and directed my to a psychiatrist. Psychiatrist set up consulting for me I went 4-5 times, even though I knew it wouldn't help and it was really expensive. It was how I imagined it ""open up about your s*xuality, don't be ashamed of your body, explore your feelings and your body, must be stress etc.."" NO! I Never had issues with this and I don't have more stress than average. In fact I have less stress now than I had 6 years ago, a lot less. It felt like liberal, leftist, femi*nin-t propaganda (in fact it made me not want to have s*x more than I already did..., the psychiatrist was a woman, probably fe*i/ist, leftist probably) 

I've also taken 20-30 different supplements over 10 years they also don't help. 

I'm open to anything! I just really don't want to end up forever alone at 32, I'm not even fa---t, I'm pretty good looking with an above average sized p**nis, uncut, which seems to be more in demand nowadays than cut (according to my girlfriends) (I'm probably a 7/10) . BUT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO TOLERANCE, UNDERSTANDING or ACCEPTANCE FOR MEN WHO ARE NO LONGER INTERESTED IN S*X! Women avoid me on dating sites if I'm honest about it! And there is no hiding this IRL. :( I'M DESPERATE!  :(",15Aug2019,1

184,"Hi. This might be super long so I apologize in advance.

For starters, I love my company. It’s been my dream to work here for years. 

Now the story.

Previously my (f) coworker dated my (f) boss and broke it off when they (my boss) got the job. This lead to my boss becoming wildly inappropriate with them and trying to control them at work and interfering with their personal relationships. My boss would have frequent outbursts towards my coworker in front of volunteers and important people, would touch them inappropriately, etc.  My coworker didn’t want to report in fear that they would get fired. This went on for months until we were on a work trip. My boss got super drunk and started being touchy in front of other staff and that raised questions. My coworker finally told HR a few weeks ago, but it didn’t seem to make it stop. 

While all of this was happening i was dealing with some shit on my own. I went inpatient for my mental illness and our boss told HR I lied about my mental health and spread shit about me in the office. I personally don’t care because I know my truth. However, the lack of professionalism is seeping into me. They make me carry the team and even left me in their house for an event while they went out to the bars. I could go on for days about how fucked they’ve been. But now we escalated it to the CEO and I’m a little freaked. Any advice would do.",15Aug2019,1

186,"My bestfriend (idk if I can really call him that) demands all kinds of things. We are very good friends for a long time and just recently became bestfriends. I don't know anymore if it was the right decision to call him my bestfriend since we only talk about deep topics. He said he doesn't want to be alone and needed someone like a bestfriend. That's why I said that I can be his bestfriend since I thought we understand each other well. But recently, he he's been having anxieties and blames me for it because he always feel like he's unimportant around me. He said I was the only one benefiting our friendship and I was really insensitive. So I thought it was the case and thought I was wrong and apologized to him for taking him for granted. However it wasn't really the case after all. I evaluated and thought over and over when did I go wrong and when was the time that I didn't reciprocate but all I could think of was I did nothing wrong and treated him well. When he had a problem I was there to listen to him, when he needed advices, I gave him a lot. It's not only one time when he had meltdowns and everytime he has one he always blame me for it. He always say that I didn't appreciate him and really felt unimportant but it's ironic that he was the one not appreciating me. I tried explaining my side to him and things relating his insecurities and how to overcome it but he never listens to me and always think he was right and making me feel that I'm the bad person. He always said how shitty and bad person I am and I did nothing to defend myself since I don't know if I'm really bad afterall. Whenever I'm around him in those times always makes me feel like I'm really a bad person. I can't even talk to others on how I felt because he said not to talk about it to anyone and I feel like I'm not allowed to talk about my side. He always believed I'm the selfish one for not reciprocating and always apologized for it because I thought it was true. But I felt like he was the selfish one afterall. He always demand that I treat him fairly (I didn't know what that means because I've always treated him fairly) but I just found out that what he means by that is I should always give him all my attention. He always gets jealous when I talk to others and demands that I talk to him too. I always talk to him but whenever I talk to him it's like he's not interested in what I'm talking and doesn't contribute to the conversation and whenever I talk to other people and had fun with them, he said that he feels like I don't  like him. He always want me to start to talk to him a topic that would interest him but he himself doesn't open a conversation. I know he has insecurities and anxiety but it's just tiring to be someone who is so needy and doesn't contribute to the friendship. Right now I feel like I'm just some tool and feel responsible for him always. I always feel like he just call me his bestfriend because he always fear of being alone and needed someone to understand him.

187,"My (M,18) girlfriend (16) and I have been dating for 3 months now and she’s terrified to kiss me let alone do anything further. I just am missing being able to kiss, make-out, and well you know everything in between. I love this girl and we’ve known one another for more than a year, but holy hell is it hard to stay with someone when they just seem to have no interest in doing anything sexually. I am pretty sexual and I’ve come on too fast in prior relationships, but this is almost unbearable waiting for her to want something or to act on her desires. She claims that she has sexual desires and does touch herself and that sort of thing but is against me doing anything to her not because she doesn’t want to, but because she’s nervous/scared of it.

I love this girl but I don’t know if I can keep this up, I’ve told her I have needs and really need to be able to at least kiss her. She doesn’t understand why that’s important and constantly turns her head or will stay away from me completely to avoid kissing. I am just lost in my emotions and I’ve been hanging around friends, drinking, and smoking more than I should to make up for it. I don’t know if I’m the one who’s wrong for wanting her but it’s so confusing for me because I’ve never encountered this in my life before. I’ve almost always had girls who feel the same way. Any advice on how to address or fix this issue would be must appreciated because I am so lost on what I can do or say to get her in the mood for something anymore. Months of effort and seemingly not even a step closer. Thank you.

188,"I’m gonna be totally candid, I’m trying to get laid. I’ve been talking and hanging out with this one girl for a bit now and things have been escalating.

Well my mom works from home and her boyfriend is out of town so she has no reason to leave more than an hour to go grocery shopping or something.

It’s come to the point where I just wanna ask her to be gone for a couple hours so I can be alone with a “friend” but the more I think about it the more absurd it sounds telling her this soooo...
So how can I get my mom out of the house? Or do you guys have any better ideas on where to have sex? 
If the house thing doesn’t pan out we can most likely do it in the car but I ain’t got a clue where to initiate that. If you have any advice about that I would greatly appreciate it.

191,"This is gonna be a very lengthy post, first off, a bit of information for context – 

My dad died when I was 3 months old (my brother was 3 years old) in a car accident.

My mom died when I was 13 years old (my brother was 16 years old) from an infection. She had MS and was bedridden since I was 6.  
 

I am 21 years old, have Multiple Sclerosis, but I have 0 symptoms, as I got treated very early,  I was offered to be in a world-wide survey/experiment on MS drug safety and effectiveness on teens/young adults. Currently I am on unemployment until October, just taking a break after quitting my shitty job of 2 years at a supermarket.  
 

My brother is 24 years old, has Multiple Sclerosis (MS) which, due to late diagnosis and no treatment for a year has left my brother with impaired vision and makes him physically weaker than the average person. He is on disability, but he could hold any job that isn’t too physically demanding or requires accuracy of sight, e.g. he worked as a cashier for \~8months until this summer and has worked a few other jobs.

My grandma (moms’ side) is 70 years old, and is pretty much as healthy as she could be at that age. She grew up as an orphan, as her parents died very early in her life, she was in the adoption system all her life. She’s been retired for over a decade.  
   
Quick thing – my dad’s side of the family always disliked my mother, they never approved of their relationship. We were a decently rich family, my father owned a car dealership business and my mom helped him with it as much as she could. So anyway, when my dad died, my mom suddenly was left with 2 little boys, an apartment and his business to take care of. She turned to my grandma for help. My grandma visited us pretty much daily after work and took care of us, helped my mom anyway she could, but it wasn’t enough, and my dad’s side didn’t care THAT much to help. So, my mom asked an old friend to move in with us so he can help take care of us, I’ll call him my step dad. My step-dad came in with 1 bag of clothes and that’s it, he had nothing to his name. Over the years he drank at our expense, my mom drank with him, partied. We were mostly taken care of by my grandma. I remember being so scared, all the drinking, the music, the yelling, the fighting, the bad decisions when people were drinking and partying around me. That was life until I was 6, I don’t remember much of it. During this time my dad's side of the family offered help with the business for my mom, as they knew more about car dealership than her, they offered to just take it over and have her still be a part of it, like a co-owner/founder, but after she signed the company over they just took her name off of it.

When I was around 6 we moved, I started school, my brother was in school as well. At this point my mom was bedridden, her MS progressed significantly and she just laid in bed and watched TV all day. My grandma had a full time job at this point, but would come to us as much as possible to help my mom, and clean, cook for us I’d help her. As years passed I'd be able to help  her more and more with cooking, cleaning, changing my mom's diaper etc. My brother never really did any of that, he’d go to school on weekdays, after school he’d go outside and play with friends, and by the time he got home our step dad would be home, so he’d help our mom with everything. He was an awful person, he didn’t care about us at all, he would yell at us, beat us sometimes. On weekends I’d stay home while he went away to my dads’ side grandparents. They loved him. He was a prince. They’d buy him the newest tech, he had a beast of a gaming PC there, and would just spend his weekends and summers at their house gaming, all while the grandparents ran around him doing and buying anything he’d want, they’d cook anything he’d want etc. They didn’t care about me at all, because I am more like my mom, while my brother was an exact copy of my dad from what I’ve been told by them and my grandmother. Because of this we are very different, he is very spoiled and acts as if the world revolves around him. He has very little empathy to other people, and is just overall a dick. I’m the exact opposite, I am a very friendly, caring and loving person, I mostly raised myself, but I learned a lot from my grandma too.

Anyway, our mom died, we kicked out our “stepdad” and my grandma moved in with us. Legally my mom was the owner of the apartment we live in, and she left it for me and my brother 50/50.

This was 6 years ago, and now we can jump to the main issue. My brother has a problem. He’s on disability being paid the equivalent of minimum wage, so he doesn’t need to work. All he does is stay locked in his room day after day, until one of his “friends” calls him up, then he goes drinking until 6am, or a for a few days to the point where he can barely get home. Rinse and repeat. That’s all he does. He doesn’t take his MS medication (which is VERY bad, my grandmas afraid if the doctors knew they'd take the meds away, so she disposes of the meds he doesn't take), he’s very pissy if you try to talk to him, he has mood swings a lot, if you tell him one thing he doesn’t want to hear he slams his door and locks it and stays in his room for days like a child. He does nothing, he doesn’t clean his plates, he doesn’t make his bed, he’s used a vacuum maybe twice in his life, he has no clue how to pay bills if he needed to. This has been going on for pretty much the last 6 years.  
 

Now my grandma keeps insisting that she loves us both equally and she is suffering because of him. She’s 70 and is running around cleaning up after a 24 year old man – washing his dishes 3+ times a day, cleaning his room whenever he goes out drinking, because otherwise the whole apartment stinks, she’s even paid a very expensive psychologist she found dealt with people similar to my brother and asked him to go to, because she and I both realize he has some sort of mental issue that he needs professional help with, but he just doesn’t care. She spends nights unable to sleep, because he’s out god knows where drinking, and barely getting home. All she does is worry about him and try to take care of him. And when he comes back home drunk he yells at her, calls her all sorts of names – idiot, bitch, useless and usually proceeds to go cook as he’s pissed drunk which results in making a mess in the kitchen for her to clean up.  


He doesn't even talk to my dad's side much anymore, only calls them or answers their calls when he needs something, like money.  
 

For this reason I’ve come to absolutely despise my brother. He is a dickhead who has no empathy and either he doesn’t realize how his actions affect others or he doesn’t care. He means nothing to me, and I just want to get rid of this environment. But I am staying here against my will just for my grandma. She’s been through so much with being an orphan, having a daughter become disabled, lose her husband, herself being divorced, having both her grandchildren diagnosed with MS. She raised us and was always there for us, she could’ve just left us to be with our drunk stepdad, or go into the adoption system after our mom died, but she didn't. She deserves better than the life she currently has.  
 

I’ve come to the conclusion, that there’s nothing I, my grandma, or anyone can do to help him. We offered him help numerous times, but he doesn’t want to change.  
 

Current advice - Is there anything I can do now to help him, which in turn would make my grandma happier and healthier as she wouldn’t have to stress so much and do so much physical work?  
 

Advice for the future - after my grandma does pass, I want to sever all ties with my brother. I want nothing to do with him, at all. My grandma is the only person I can call family left, apart from a cousin I know. How do I do this? I doubt he will want to sell this apartment, as he likes it, but I’d rather just sell it, split the money 50/50 and go our own ways. Is this possible to do if he insists he doesn’t want to? What do I do then?",15Aug2019,2
192,"I feel like there is something genuinely wrong with me. Since I was little, I've always had a hard time connecting with people and have a small circle because of it. Having picked things up again with old friends around the start of 2019, I started bonding greatly with them like I used to, but now I feel like I'm starting to lose that connection. All I've ever wanted was my own people, and whenever I feel like I find them, the friendships just go stale so soon.

Right now, I feel like taking a break from talking to them because it hurts that this continues to be a cycle I face each time in my life, but I don't know how to proceed when I speak to them again. Whenever I join party chats with them, they mostly speak to each other because they have more things in common, but with me the conversations are a little more difficult to pick up. I make attempts at conversation but it feels like they're there to just hear it and not really speak out on it. They tell me I'm being paranoid and that it's normal for conversations to go stale when the friendships are close, but my friends have known each other for much longer and they seem to have no problem talking to each other each day. I'm starting to see that maybe I would be better off living life as an introvert if only I didn't feel this need to seek out a person. It hurts and it's making fall back once more into depression. It hasn't even been a year.

How do I go about this? What am I doing wrong?

* I'm exercising more (ab and chest workouts). That's given me a bit more energy I guess
* Duolingo. I'm learning Chinese, and it's making me think more clearly
* I meditate from time to time (about everyday).

197,"hey community,

not sure if anyone will read this, but i just wanted to get this out there, and maybe get a different perspective. this summer I met a group of pretty nice people, and we bonded over a few weeks - they definitely aren't as good friends as other ones that I have, but they're really nice. i still am in contact with them, and we pretty much all talk in some way or another everyday with each other. In those weeks, i smoked weed for the first time with some of them. even though i didn't know all of them that well. it was a really new experience for me, but not something that i regret doing. i smoked a few more times after that, but not too much. after those weeks, i haven't done anything.

we were all talking, and were planning on hanging out at the end of this week. smoking is definitely one of the things they plan on doing, as well as some other things. personally, i really want to just go and have fun one more time, but i'm really conflicted. one of my closest friends told me that in the end it's up to me, but that it's not a path i should go down. also, we're probably hanging out for like 2-3 hours, so if we get high, would my parents notice afterwards? i don't really know what to do honestly, but another perspective would be nice. thanks for reading!",15Aug2019,1
198,"At times I wonder if I'm spreading myself too thin. Where I live the Fall semester for college will be starting in 2 weeks and I'm going to be doing school full time, albeit both on campus and online. I currently work 2 jobs and between both of them I usually work 44 hours a week but at times it can be as low as 32 hours a week. And I have a dog that I take care of as well with the aid of my family.

 So I'm going to school for business and I hope to one day have my own non-profit organization that helps save animals, specifically dogs and cats. So I figured that volunteering at my local humane society would probably be a valuable experience in that regard. But I'm worried that with everything else going on I won't have enough time to volunteer.

I struggle with bipolar depression and keeping busy, even to this degree, is actually therapeutic. I remember last year around this time I was only working like 15 hours a week and barely attending schools; all I would do day after day was just play video games in order to numb the pain I was feeling inside. So I'm happy that I've managed to turn my life around so much in just a year.

Does anyone know if the humane society will let me volunteer even if all I can give is just 1 - 5 hours a week? Does anyone have any experience with volunteer work? The organization says they don't have a minimum requirement of hours but I'm afraid that I may still be turned away if all I can offer is just 2 hours a week on a single day.",15Aug2019,1

I'm 32, both p*rn and IRL s*x no longer gets me hard at all (I'm not impotent, manual manipulation still gets me hard, it's a lack of s*xual desire). I've already lost my girlfriend of 2 years over this (2 months ago), she was not understanding at all and she was pretty mean about it throughout (and she is not the first). I've been losing interest in s*x for many years now, about 10 or so, gradually. I had trouble maintaining an e-re-ction because of barely any interest in s-x for the last 4 years. It's not my girlfriend, she was a solid 7, even p-rn with 9/10, 10/10 women also don't turn me on AT ALL. And no I'm not turning g--a-y, I watched g--a-y p*rn as well to test it, NOTHING. (I even watched other even weirder p*rn, but nothing, no movement down there and no s*xual desire).

I already talked to two doctors about it. One of them told me there is nothing that he can do (he was a GP, general practitioner) and directed my to a psychiatrist. Psychiatrist set up consulting for me I went 4-5 times, even though I knew it wouldn't help and it was really expensive. It was how I imagined it ""open up about your s*xuality, don't be ashamed of your body, explore your feelings and your body, must be stress etc.."" NO! I Never had issues with this and I don't have more stress than average. In fact I have less stress now than I had 6 years ago, a lot less. It felt like liberal, leftist, femi*nin-t propaganda (in fact it made me not want to have s*x more than I already did..., the psychiatrist was a woman, probably fe*i/ist, leftist probably) 

I've also taken 20-30 different supplements over 10 years they also don't help. 

I'm open to anything! I just really don't want to end up forever alone at 32, I'm not even fa---t, I'm pretty good looking with an above average sized p**nis, uncut, which seems to be more in demand nowadays than cut (according to my girlfriends) (I'm probably a 7/10) . BUT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO TOLERANCE, UNDERSTANDING or ACCEPTANCE FOR MEN WHO ARE NO LONGER INTERESTED IN S*X! Women avoid me on dating sites if I'm honest about it!

215,"This is long.. but please read..

(We’ve been together for 4 years and married for 1)

My husband(24m) was just arrested two months ago from choking me(23f). He was really drunk that night and I wasn’t. He had called me names and was shoving me all for trying to help him to bed. So I told him that I was going to stay with my mom because this had upset me so much. When I tried to leave that’s when he had choked me. I ended up getting away from him and had to call the police because at times he wouldn’t let go of my neck and I thought I was going to die. He also had left bruises all around my neck. He ended up going to jail but was bailed out from his parents. I told him that I needed space from him because this was not the first time he has been aggressive towards me when he was drunk. He had hit me, blacked my eyes, shoved me to the ground, and choked me. And it’s always over him getting aggressive, causing arguments, then he will hurt me when I try to leave the room or say he’s going to kill himself. He’s promised to stay sober but always starts drinking again. He’s promised to go to counseling but hasn’t went at all. He also promised me space while he was staying with his parents. All I wanted was for him to not live with me until he got help and went to therapy for 1 month. Right now he’s in his “not drinking phase”. He ended up wiggling his way back in here by staying the “one night a week” we agreed to. And then would guilt trip me when I said he had to go back to his parents. For example “I hope you still love me. It’s so hard to sleep without you I miss you so much. I feel like hurting myself for the things I’ve done to you.” So I would let him stay. I know stupid of me. But now I feel trapped. I can’t sleep at all because honestly I’m so uncomfortable with him. I’m really cold to him as well but I don’t want to be I love him. I’m just hurt and he hasn’t showed any effort beside him”not drinking”. Which I don’t think will last!!! 

He also wants me to recant my statement to the police. I’m at a loss of what to do...

Hi,

I'm a 30 year old male and I work in the software industry. I am the sole bread winner of my family. We have two kids. We recently found out that I have Retinitis Pigmentosa and will slowly be losing my vision. Right now, my peripheral vision is weak and I can drive well enough. If I take a stroll down memory lane I can see how my vision has been declining. The irony in the story is this disorder is a painless disorder and robs your sight silently. Battling depression around how bleak my future looks, here's what I am looking for to help.

\- I know that my income is going to stop at some point in the near future (i.e. without getting to retirement age). How can I ensure I am not financially broke or rely on anybody else for finance ?

\- Are there any jobs/training that I can take now to prepare myself so that I can continue to earn an income (I know it's not easy to match an income from the computers, but something to keep the inflow) ?

\- How do I brace myself for this future psychologically ?

227,"Hello,

I’m a gay Filipino (dark skinned) immigrant who moved to the US back in 2017 to be together with the love of my life and start a life here.

I’ve been pretty strong in climbing up the immigration ladder. Came here legally and will start on a prestigious job next week after passing an exam to get licensed for it. I haven’t committed any crime and I pay my bills and file my taxes.

But I can’t shake this feeling of just being scared that everyday I get out of my house, i’m going to get shot by someone who’s angry with the world. Angry at people who are not of a certain race, who have different sexuality, and just plainly different than what they are.

It really scares me. I want to have a good life in this country with the person I love, but it’s hard to just shake off the fear and live happily.

I always have to look over my shoulder. Always have to be careful with crowds, always have to be ready to get down as soon as I hear something that resembles a gunshot.

Will I, and most people in this country, just have to live like that for the rest of our lives? Not knowing if we’re gonna get shot randomly?",15Aug2019,2
228,"I am 18 years old and just broke up with my 23 year old gf. We both live in a rural town of Nebraska. Wondering if anyone can dissect this. 

I was wrong on some things. So basically last year she had this ex bf. Who once in a fight she left him and slept with her fwb then came back to that ex bf. Without telling him about the fwb. I was her friend then and knew about it all

When we dated I always bought it up. Cause her ex was trying to contact her and she was close with his family. 

Then she was still talking to that fwb after saying she doesn’t really talk to anyone. But we weren’t official yet only talked about our feelings. And I always bought that up After we dated. 

She used to sleep with her cousin’s cousin and godbrother and I always made comments about it.  Cause they were around sometimes. 

I had her social media passwords and even didn’t like her dealing with exes. She wanted me to take my calls in front of her, block this old female friend of mine cause she likes me, and had dreams of me cheating. 

I was also insecure about her past so I made up a past. Like saying I had an ex. I told her I was a virgin cause I am. 

Also my parents are in the oil business so they do well. When they found out they told me to break it off. So I told her that we should step back. 

During that time she told me about this guy who people say she flirts with and that he is no one. That’s who she ended up with couple days after our final fight. 

In the final fight I lost it and like told her I was having a panic attack when I was t and called her some mean names and even made fun of her bed skills. Then I tried to apologize and beg her back. 

Ultimately to have her rub her new sex life in my face. Going into details.

230,"About four months ago I met this guy through a mutual friend and let me tell you, we hit it off right away. He was going and living at a University three hours away from my small college (where I live) which was hard at first but we both made the effort to visit each other as much as we could. 
    Everything he ever wanted in life; his goals, the amount of children he wanted, his future, was perfectly aligned with mine. We both struggle with our family life, him coming from a family that had multiple divorces from both parents and mine from a single mother. We both always talk about the future, and sometimes our future together and how all we want is a stable family (like we never had).  
     The last time he visited me, it was probably the best four days of my life. It was absolutely perfect in every single way, we travelled around the state together, I introduced him to my friends (even some of my family) and he told me how much he enjoyed every second he had with me. 
 But of course, all things come to an end? Well sort of. Last Saturday, three days after he left I went to a party. Which is pretty much unlike me because I don’t like to drink, but it was one of my best friends party’s and everyone is leaving back to college soon so I thought why not. It was a fun party, and I messaged him through out the night. I Told him it was nice to see some old friends I haven’t seen since high school, including my friend nick (whom I literally haven’t seen since junior year of high school) (I’m a sophomore in college). Nothing happened  that night at all, it was just an extremely fun get together where I did get drunk, but fell asleep in my best friend sisters bed with absolutely no one but myself. That night was harmless. 
  Ever since that night, he hasn’t been the same with me. We used to call each other every night and talk on the phone for hours. I told him he could call me anytime and he just says “I’m not feeling it.” Another time he told me he had a crappy day at work and when I asked why he had a bad day  he wouldn’t tell me. Then, as a joke I told him I would suck his dick and he replied no. Which is completely understandable- but he knew I was joking. 
  So yesterday, I went on a trip across the state to a bigger city with some of my friends. Two of my girl friends and two of my guy friends who I have no interest in at all. We had such a fun day, and all I wanted to do was tell him all about it. How we got lost on a hike and ended up super sweaty and dehydrated and how my friend Tyler faked a proposal to my friend Delaney downtown and how everybody started clapping and it was just hilarious. But- I think he got drunk with some of his buddies and he was being really short with me. 

The conversation goes: 
  

“I had such a fun day today and I want to tell you all about it” -me 

“Cool”- him 

“Why are you being so short with me lately”- me 

“No reason”- him (sends me pic of a girl on the couch across from him) 

“What’s your problem today”-me *starting to get angry* 

“You” -him 

“What’s thats supposed to mean”- me 

“Nothing”- him 

Then, sometimes when I’m angry I write out stuff I don’t mean to send. Like I write it out on my phone, realize it’s too mean, erase it, and then write something nicer. But my dumb ass accidentally sent him- “I introduced you to my own mother, and now I feel like you’re just wasting my time”- me. WHICH AGAIN, I DIDN’T MEAN TO SEND. 

Then he replied: How? How am I wasting your time.  But this is in the morning. Then we kinda had an argument which it made me feel like he didn’t care about me anymore. He left me on read, it’s almost been a full day. We were never dating, but we basically were. I knew his family, I knew his past, and I would do anything for him. 

For a while, I believed he would do the same. He told me he hasn’t felt this way about a girl in a really long time and how he wants a future with me, even if it’s just for a short time. 

He hasn’t talked to me in 24 hours, but according to his snapchat story he took a trip to Canada and is at a bar at this very moment??? (We live in Michigan so Canada is about a 5-7 hour drive away) I know we’re not dating, but wouldn’t you tell someone you were going to Canada? And I know he has service because he’s in Toronto and is posting all this stuff on his snap story. My heart hurts, and my friends think I should just wait for him to snap me back or else I’ll look needy but things ended so Abruptly and without explanation. We weren’t dating, but we were something special. My heart kind of hurts because I’m scared he’ll never message me or call me ever again- for such a simple fight. What should I do? Am I just overreacting? But he’s been distant since I went to that party with guys he didn’t know. Is he jealous? Or just sick of me?

231,Ok so here's the very basic backstory. I dated this girl for a bit in high school and after we broke up she would always flirt we me to keep me interested enough to where I give her attention until she found someone else/got back with this goblin looking dude who honestly a rat looks more attractive then (and I'm not saying I'm a Male model but seriously imagine a goblin that looks like a 6 ft tall dude and there you go) and I've been trying to drop her but she always pulls me back in. This past time she got me by saying she actually wanted to date this time but needed time to move one from her ex and I believed her like an idiot and got dropped immediately after new years when she decided to talk to him again. I have blocked her on everything but I still have the points where I want to unblock her and if anyone else has dealt with this I just want to know some ways that may help to move past and forget about her so I can stop feeling depressed over this,15Aug2019,1
232,"Forgive me for not telling the entire story again, but I was the driver of a car (and the only person in it) that rolled twice and was totaled. Nobody else was hurt. The air bags didn't go off but I was able to walk away from the crash with just a little bruising from the seat belt. Didn't even get a concussion or anything. 

I know I'm extremely lucky and I'm not at fault for the accident. But it won't stop replaying in my head and when that happens all the fear comes flooding back and it feels like I'm going through it all over again. I've noticed that I'm really irritable all the time and my emotions are all over the place - it's like my emotional maturity has been reduced since the accident happened. I've been really angry a lot of the time, which is very unusual for me. I hate admitting this but a lot of the anger ends up going in the direction of my partner and I know that's not fair to him at all. I really need him right now but my actions are probably sending him the message to leave me alone, which is the opposite of what I actually need.

I see a psychiatrist normally anyway so I made an appointment for as soon as they could get me in. So that's a step in the right direction at least. 

My main question is how can I get a handle on all the anger I'm feeling? Will it get better and how long will that take? Any other general advice is appreciated too. I don't know how to handle this.

234,"Hey, it’s ya gorl. I just need blunt advice that my friends don’t Want to give so they don’t hurt me lol.

So I have this guy I’m so in love with. I have been for a long time, before we started dating even, and he loved me too.

But as of recently, about a week and a half, he’s been...really weird.

He leaves me on open 3/4 of the time, and if he replies it’s one word responses. When I say “I love you”, he usually replies “lit”, or leaves me on open. He did this a bit earlier in the relationship, but now it’s all he says.

He bluntly turned down an invite to a concert because he doesn’t like the music, without any kindness at all. I would’ve hoped he would’ve said yes, because I would’ve gone to a concert he liked even if I didn’t really like the music, to make him happy.

It seems a lot of the time I make sacrifices in the relationship, like he’ll criticize small things I do but I won’t to him because I know there’s no point, if that makes sense.

Before this started happening, I was so happy with him. He was so kind to me and he was so amazing to me.  The only negative thing mainly was that I was worried he only texted me when he was horny, which I’m still worried about.

I still love him so much, which is why I don’t know what to do. I’m to scared to confront him about it because I don’t want him to get mad and break up with me. But I also don’t want to carry on like this.

I know part of the reason he leaves me on open so much is could be he’s on vacation at the moment, but last time he was, literally two weeks before, he texted me like normal.

238,so for starters i am a 17M in high school and there is this girl i’ve been obsessed with since like 8th grade. i’ve known her since like 2nd grade and i was talking to her for about a month and we hung out a couple times and it was pretty cool. this was all in freshman year. long story short i fucked the whole thing up just like how i predicted and i didn’t talk to her for a while and now i’m a junior and i have 2 classes with her and i sit next to her in both which is crazy because it was just by chance. now i feel like i should make a move again because it doesn’t look like she’s talking to anyone at the moment and i’m wondering how i should go about this.,15Aug2019,1
239,"She never stays in a relationship for long and is already dating someone new within days sometimes of breaking up with people. She starts dating people, dates them for a week, breaks up with them, then wonders why all her ex’s are hurt and won’t talk to her, or they block her on social media. I wanna tell her that this isn’t good for her, that it really isn’t healthy to be dating and breaking up with people every two days. And that it’s hurting a lot of people. but I feel like she would just get annoyed at me and hate me and stop talking to me. I just want the best for her and don’t want to lose her.",15Aug2019,2

241,"My friend has 2 sisters, the 2 sisters dont get along, idk why, but it's not over anything serious, aoarently. But they haven't spoken in months. The younger sister(scheming one), apparently put oil in her older sisters acne cream, she also tampered with her drink one time(think she spat in it, or added something unclean, not sure, but it was something that was considered foul). I told her that her sister is wrong, but she wants to play neutral, and brings up the fact that they both go back and forth. But two sibilings going back in forth is NOT the same  as tampering with her hygiene...that's wrong.

Her sister is also the type to start drama, then play innocent afterwards. And it's lowkey making it hard to be around my friend, because she stays around that sister who is a wolf in sheeps clothing. If she can do that to her older sister, why can't she do it to you?",15Aug2019,1
242,"Hey, im just going to start of with this is my first time ever posting something like this in a public setting where anyone can see this. I don't have much friends and that isn't me being ""oh I'm such a loner!"" I genuinely don't have much friends, I only have two close ones, but I feel the need to get more opinions on this.
We have had a puppy for a few days now, he doesn't have a name yet (I wanted to avoid getting attatched, failed miserably as i already got attatched) and he freaks out when being left alone for a few minutes. My mom HATES this as he always cries whenever he is left alone. As I am 16 (turning seventeen in Oct), I have started school recently. I share this puppy with my younger sister (who is 11) and have told her to take the puppy outside to use the bathroom (she. starts school next week) , but she stayed asleep all day so my mom put the puppy im the bathroom and left him in there. Well, the puppy ended up destroying the bathroom, he peed on tbe lil carpet thing in there and knocked over the trashcan and even spilled all his food onto the ground and pooped in there as well. He has only had FOUR accidents in the house, two in my room and two in the bathroom (the first time he was left alone, we didn't know he'd react tbst bad to being left alone as we tried to get him to be used to being left alone).
Because of this, she began blaming the dirty blankets on the puppy and claiming he had peed on it when I KNOW he didn't because today was the FIRST DAY of school for me. This all happened in the afternoon.
At night, my cousin picked me up and we both went to the store to buy a kennel for him, when we came back I found out she had locked the puppy in the backyard, leaving him to cry loudly. I KNOW she was planning on making tbe puppy to run away because when I tried taking him back inside, she told me he doesn't need to be inside and to just leave him outside. I brought him inside again, mom got upset at me, blah blah normal teenager and adult things. 
Now here are a few things I'd like to add:
• My mom is Deaf (She can hear high pitches/frequencies??)
• My sister (11) is Hard of Hearing &amp; I have a brother (10) who is Fully Deaf.
• My mom HATES how the dog whines loudly and is inside the house AND how he has had 4 accidents ( at different days, not in a row)
• However, I hate how my siblings yell as if their life is on the line (they can't exactly hear themselves yell, I ask my mom to tell them to lower their voices and she uses the excuse ""they don't know they're being loud, they're Deaf"" when literally they have been quiet before, but it was their dad who made sure they didn't get out of hand, he's out of the picture and has been for years.) 
• I'd also like to add (to be a bit petty) that my siblings make a HUGE mess, messes more than the dog has even made which isn't much.
• Oh, my mom was the one who said my sister and I could get a dog, we didn't force it on her to say yes, but it's mainly my dog since I take care of him the most.
• I have been taken him outside early in the morning, in the afternoon, and at night to use the bathroom. He only had two accidents in my bedroom because I slept in, I definitely learned my lesson after the second time. I was even the one who cleaned after him, not my mom.

I just need to know, am I being unreasonable for getting upset at my mom? If so, what would be the best choice to do? If not, how do I talk to my mom who refused to listen? If unsure, (again) what would be the best choice (even if it's bad for me)?

If you have any questions, I'll answer them.",15Aug2019,1
244,"Hey everyone, 

I am currently in school for nursing and I got an email for an interview for a clinical placement.

247,"Hey all,
I need some advice regarding my new apartment with 2 friends from college. Here’s a little backstory.. when we first toured the apartment we were looking at the 3 bedrooms and at first I was told I could have the master (I’m a huge PC nerd who streams) need the room for my set up. Once summer came around I was told by one of my other roommates that whoever takes the master has to pay an extra 50$ per month. I was like damn okay, that’s fair since it’s a much bigger room. I decided to opt out of that since it’s too expensive for me. So a couple weeks later after deciding who will be taking the master room, I decided to say I would be willing to pay extra money for the second biggest room. There was no issue at first with this and nobody even responded other than stating that there isn’t much of a difference between the 2 other rooms. So that was that. Then, a couple weeks later, my other roommate told me that he was taking the room because he set everything up to get the apartment. He completely ignored the fact that I said I would pay extra for it. So here we are, in the process of moving in, and I’m stuck with the smallest room. I can’t fit all of my stuff in there including my desk. I have been arguing with him saying it’s not fair because I said I would pay extra for it 3 weeks ago, but he’s too stubborn to budge. I feel as if his reasoning isn’t fair and I feel screwed over. I have been arguing with him non stop the past 2 days trying to get the room. What should I do?",15Aug2019,1

250,"My boyfriend of nearly 11 months broke up with me a few days ago as we were struggling with school and would bicker a fair bit. We have always been best friends and are really connected and comfortable with eachother so we remained friends. We were sitting in English together and I was talking to his male friend and I think he got jealous and texted me saying we are on a break instead. I agreed as I still love him and want to be with him and we still plan on moving out together next year. Although I feel like we are drifting, he doesn’t really act the same and we weren’t telling anyone we were apart and he recently deleted the photos he had posted of me. Would it be best to break things off with him completely ? I get so much anxiety about it because I don’t want to lose him but I’m trying to think what’s best for me.  I honestly thought we would have a future together and we have so many dreams together and we want to see eachother succeed.

252,"So, my friend grew up in a very emotionally abusive household. Basically, she's very insecure about herself and needs to find constant ways to reassure herself. The issue is that to compensate for having a low self-esteem, she acts like she's better than others. In reality, I know she has good intentions and that she is a very caring person. However, she is constantly trying to prove that she is a strong individual who doesn't need others, and sometimes that doesn't come off well. She doesn't seem to quite have the right idea about what it means to be strong, and the ways she tries to show strength can be rude.

For example, she can be bossy or overly assertive a lot of the time, she inserts her opinion into everything whether or not someone asked for it (even over small things), and gives unwarranted advice. The other day she told me that she was trying to help out a coworker who was new at the place she works at. My friend said that she took it upon herself to go up to the coworker and give her advice on how to do her job, because she has my friend's old position and my friend said no one helped her when she first started and she just had to figure things out on her own. However my friend is not in a position of authority over this coworker, according to her, and they are equals. Apparently her coworker didn't respond that well to what my friend was trying to do, but I don't blame her. 

The coworker probably wondered why someone who was equal to her was telling her what to do, and was probably offended because she thought my friend didn't think she could do her job or figure things out for herself. Also, when my friend is giving advice she can be condescending so that didn't help. Personally I wouldn't want a coworker coming up to me when I was new and explaining how I should do my job either. I tried to explain this to my friend, but she insisted that the coworker was acting snobby towards her. Maybe she is snobby, I don't know, but my friend was offended that her efforts weren't appreciated. Apparently her coworker acted like she didn't want to talk to her, and my friend go the vibe her coworker thought she was better than her. I was hoping that my friend would do some reflecting and recognize that sometimes she acts the same way, but she's not really the type of person to look acknowledge her flaws and try to improve on some of them, probably due to her insecurity about herself. 

The thing is, I know that she's a good person with good intentions, but lately it's been more difficult to deal with. When you feel like someone is being condescending towards you, judging you, or acting like they're better than you, it's really frustrating, even if you know that they're doing it to compensate for their insecurity. How would you go about telling them that their intentions don't always come through in their behavior, and that maybe there's better ways they could express their desire to be helpful? Or maybe just tell her to stop, but nicely? She's a sensitive person even if she doesn't like to admit it, and I don't want her to think I'm attacking her or get offended or anything because I'm pretty sure that would make things worse.",15Aug2019,1
253,"I’m a 22 year old man that had been struggling with very low self confidence and depression since I was 18.

254,"He and I have been friends for a few years. He's helped me through some rough spots and in return I've done some pretty unfair things to him (that he's been very forgiving for). Which makes this even harder because I dont feel like I have any right to be doing what I'm about to do. 

But the problem is, I dont trust him. I don't really know why. I can point to a couple things, but those things circle back to my own bad choices. Yet, I feel so uncomfortable in this friendship and it keeps me up at night.

255,"The treatment from my old manager and current manager has been really poor.

259,"I'm a 32 year old female. I'm 5ft2 and weigh 145kg.
I don't want to die but I'll be lucky if I make it to my 33rd birthday.
3 years ago I was a full time butcher/fishmonger, I left an abusive relationship and things were going well for me. Within 48 hours that all changed. I got laryngitis, labinithritus and pneumonia all at the same time. I was constantly feeling like I had the flu and had pain everywhere. I lost my job, had lots of tests done and was eventually diagnosed with M.E and fibro. For the first year I could barely get out of bed, I was crippled with fatigue. I had no friends or family. Iv been completely alone for 3 years.
My depression hit an all time low and I tried to kill myself with a huge overdose. Just getting in the shower was like running a marathon. My weight ballooned and with it more health problems. My anxiety is so bad I don't leave the house unless it's an emergency. On 3 separate occasions I started feeling extremely odd so forced myself to go to the doctors. They gave me blood tests and I was found to be diabetic, I was on the verge of a hypotension crisis and had to see a cardiologist straight away. My O2 levels were really low and I had a sleep study. I was found to have severe obstructive sleep apnea aswell as Obesity hypo ventilation syndrome.
I fall regularly due to fatigue and have 6 retained roots in my mouth as well as a serious abscess. I'm to embarrassed /ashamed to see a dentist. 
I have been in a mist of depression and I honestly don't no how I have managed to get myself in this mess. I had to see a doctor this week and it was put straight to me. If I don't lose weight I will die. That's been the light bulb moment for me. I no that things can get better, I just don't no where to start. I can't go out. I really want a treadmill but can't afford one since losing my job. I really want to lose the weight on my own. I don't want to be in the ground in a year. I'm terrified that in an emergency paramedics wouldn't be able to move me. I don't want to be a burden on the health service. I'm not fat and proud. Been like this is awful.",15Aug2019,1
260,"Sooo where do i begin... I am a 30ish year old male husband and father (son is 5ish) i travel for work and am gone alot of the time. I have court tomorrow over a felony Domestic violence case in which was brought about in early July. I am not a man who believes it is right to hit women and have not hit her. She says i am narcicisstic and emotionally abusive and have been over the last 8 years of our relationship. Now i dont personally think i am either of those (although i may be frugal) i have never tried to strip her of her money or tell her that she can and cant spend her money on what she wants. I pay about 75% of the bills and have for the last 5 years weve been living together. We have separate accounts, i guess we just never got joint accounts and i do not have access to her main checking account (i would think i financial tyrant would ?). In the last 3 years we have bought a house and have been okay in terms of finances, never been rich or wealthy but we do okay and have the things we like and nice clothes and the fridge stays stocked) I came from a poor upbringing and guess i have always just wanted to have a cushion and i think thats where my frugality comes from. I have worked 12 hr+ days for the majority of my adult life and in recent years have let it get to me a little more than normal. I guess what im saying is in reflection i think i was an asshole sometimes and maybe a little impatient with my family (This is something i remember from my dad when i was young, he was a good father but i was always scared to ask things of him and we werent particularly close as he was always tired after work and wanted to relax). I do know that he cared about and loved me and tried his hardest (he was a young father 15 years old when i was born). She has always said that it shouldnt matter if im tired and that i still have responsibilities at home. I do agree with that as it is true and logical.... i guess i just wanted her to cut me a little break sometimes. As far as i view relationships and how i treated ours... it is 2019 no longer should there be gender roles i.e if i get home first i cook, clean and vice versa. If you cant view a partner as equal than thats not much of a partner right? In 2012 (the year she became pregnant with my son ) i developed a bad habit while i was away working and she was alone at home most of the time. I started doing methamphetamines and it spiraled out of control pretty quickly to the point we lost our apartment and she had to go through the later part of her pregnancy and the early part of our sons life at her fathers house. During this time i was not myself, i went through being homeless, and alot of other horrible stuff that hurts to think about. She was there for me and stayed with me through alot of horrible shit (i cheated, i lied, and was an overall piece of shit until one day my dad finally tracked me down and somehow convinced me to go to treatment for my addiction) My dad saved my life and i went to a program in my hometown where i lived in a dormitory and paid rent and relearned alot of important skills that are vital for a normal day to day life. I attented regular meetings and was made to take regular drug tests and kept accountable. I was released from the program after about 4 months and went to live with family in the same town. At the end of the same year i had gotten a really good job and we were able to move out to a condo and we have lived together since. I had a very good job throughout this whole time until about 4 months ago when i left to get back in an old industry where i am currently and where i travel alot but make a pretty good annual salary. over the years we have done well and been overall pretty happy (i think?) and achieved a lot of things like i said (buying a house et.) that we wanted to. Well around last october my mom was released from prison and the drug slowly crept its way back into my life.... on halloween i used meth before we went to one of my wifes friends parties... she found evidence and called me out on it in a very concerned manner... normally she wouldve flipped her shit , left and made a big deal out of it but this time she was truly concerned. She loved me alot this i know. I told her the truth and said i was just curious and it wouldnt last. It is now august and since then she has found meth hidden in my truck or other places multiple times.... she has been upset about it but for the most part was able to look past it because i am still successful and have made sure the bills were paid and kept working consistently . A few times she had found pretty substantial amounts and said that she flushed it or had poured water on it and gotten rid of it. A little embarassing but the main reason i tried it again was to use it as sort of a viagra if you will. Our sex life became a little boring over the last year and i could sense that she wiould pull away and was not very interested most of the time (i.e tired, not tonight and just overall not very excited to bone) in october when i tried it again this did change and things between us in the bedroom have been totally different) In may i left my job i was at for about 5 years and went back to the job i was at when i started using (got a nice offer and figured i would get away and do the right thing and quit using alltogether. I was working a rotational schedule where i would work about 30 days and then come home for a week or so. In july when i came home right before the 4th of july i was out very late one night on a sunday i believe and she had work the next day i got a text from a friend who had gotten a dui and went to pick him up and take him home... i got home about 6am as she was getting ready for work i could tell that she was pissed. She said she wasnt mad but something did seem weird. She went to work and i started cleaning up the house and working on a vehicle thats been sitting for a while at the house. I fell asleep in our bed and ended up leaving my paraphernalia on the dining room table... turns out she came home and found this as i was sleeping so she called my dad to have an intervention. I woke up after working 31days straight 15hourish days... and then driving 12hrs straight from work on the last... to an intervention i was not ready for. My dad and wife were in the living room asking me what i was doing and telling me i should come home from where i was working (if i could i would change what i did next a million times over, it haunts me to this day) i initially denied the drug use and said i had just been working alot and then my wife started to pack her stuff and said she was leaving with our son. At this time i freaked out, asked my dad to leave and when he wouldnt i hit him and made him leave (this i am absolutely ashamed of) he left and my wife called the police. I shoved her on the way out (not very hard but still shouldnt have) i got in my vehicle and left. About a block away i realized that i had no wallet or phone so turned around to grab them i figured i would go eat and clear my head. As i get back she is on the phone with 911 and in a rage i guess i hit her vehicle (side swiped it pretty good and then got out and proceeded to kick the door which i also messed up pretty good) i was looking at her hurt and shocked asking her why she was doing this. She said you did this... you did. I left the house again without getting my keys or wallet and then eventually stupidly decided to come back. This time i was pulled over about a block away from my house... the police took a look at her car and said they were similar to the size of my feet and i went to jail that day. Fast forward I have not been able to go home since that day and only been able to see my son one time (that was nice ;)). Since then my wife has made it clear that she is scared of me and has been very adament about enforcing the protection order issued by the state in any DV case. She has made it clear that she wants a separation and ultimately to hire a mediator to split assets and figure out a parenting schedule. This killed me .... i love my family and want nothing more than to try and fix things. I have been willing to acknowledge that i do have issues with anger at times and addiction and have made it clear that i am willing to go to therapy, counseling and to the things it will take to figure things out. She has said that she cannot forgive me and doesnt believe we will ever be back together. Over the last couple months i have been a shell of myself still having to travel to a place i hate, work long hours and pay all of our mutual bills with no help from her. Havent been able to speak with my son much and she is using the protection order to enforce that. I dont want to accept the divorce i honestly cant believe this is real... it all happened so fast and i am very sad and lonely at this point. Now i must add that there were a few times since about april i had noticed my wife acting strange (trembling while putting on makeup, the way she was having sex was much more intense than normal, and one time when we were arguing she said without realizing ""maybe youre the one thats on meth!!! she realized what she said and then got really quiet. i ignored this and filed it away. One of the last times i was home with her we sat and i mentioned in a roundabout way that i know what was going on and i know what this shit is and does... that i blamed myself for bringing it around and that she was not me she was better than me and that she shouldnt do this shit. She did not deny she hung her head and stayed quiet. One of the times i was home last (after the incedent ) she allowed me to grab some clothes of mine and in one of my clothes baskets was her hair brush... a brush id seen her use everyday for the last 3 years. I took samples of her hair off of this brush and sent it in to a government grade forensics lab. This lab does toxicology, postmortem, dna, rape kit testing... the whole shabang. The reason i sent this in is because i had to know for myself what was happening. She is at our house with my son and she has not been willing to talk to me not even once. I have told her that i will file for a joint divorce (she asked and was being very pushy about me doing it fast) i asked her if i could call and speak to her about the mediation and what to expect she said she wasnt ready to talk to me. She has said this everytime i ask and it has been a very painful thing for me emotionally. There was a time about a month ago i spoke with my son on skype and he was acting like he had come into contact with meth... so i saved the videos. Fast forward a little bit 2 days ago i got the results in for the hair follicle test i submitted of my wifes hair... the levels of thc were pretty high (i expected this as we both smoked marijauna together for a long time). The levels of Methamphetamine that came back were through the roof... 2000pg/mg and the cutoff for testing is 200. This whole time i am beating myself up .... thinking of what a piece of shit i am and how ive let down and ruined my family (which i did afterall) and she is doing exactly what she is accusing and crucifying me over. My son when we hung out told me he missed me... i said i miss you too buddy well be hanging out alot more here soon. He then said... i miss my momma too.....? i said what are you talking about you guys are together all the time. He siad she always takes me to papas house or she stays in her room with the door locked and wont let me in. She has been acting different and now i know why.... i am worried about her as she is completely pulling away from me and fighting me on every level possible. Last week i was taken to jail on the day i got back form working another hitch and was getting ready to pick up my son from school... i was parked in the driveway of my house when the local pd pulled up and took me to jail for violation of a protection order. I bonded out the next day and then sunday before i left back to work i was dropping off money, a couple of other things for my family. The next day about 30 min after i got the results on the hair follicle test i got a call from my attorney informing me my wife called the DA said she saw me at the house last night and they were filing a motion to revoke my bond. i have been working through all of this and paying all of our mutual bills.... killing myself inside just scared of the future without my wife. Come to find out she is flying high as fuck on meth.... I have court tomorrow and may go to jail for awhile because of the whole bond thing... the only reason i was close to the house was to drop off money for her and my son at a place where she asked me to drop it off...? I am scared and if i go to jail i may lose my job.... ultimately i am scared of losing my family but it seems that may already be the case. There is more to the story i am not sure and unable to prove but think she may be pregnant.... and i also think it is another mans baby. (this i am unsure of but have a suspicion that is why she wanted me to file for divorce so fast). She has been solid for 8 years and stood by my side through alot.... with this evidence i have of my son looking high over video chat and her hair follicle results i have a good chance at discrediting anything she says tomorrow at court but this would ultimately ruin her life (especially if shes pregnant and ultimately that affects my son) i would like to get ahead of this and somehow get ahold of her (i thought about calling her brother or mom maybe) to let her know that i love here and have this info and i can prove shes been getting high and that she shouldnt try to lie tomorrow at court to get me put in jail because i will have to use the info i have against her to save myself. Ultimately that would most likely put my son in foster care... I cant contact her because of the restraining order and it is showing that she is not playing nice... she isnt thinking straight. What should i do ????? should i call her brother tell him what i know and that im worried and ask him to talk to her ? Does she still love me and just not thinking straight or is it over ? I feel like if she is pregnant from somebody else i could at least try and look past it and truly forgive her and move on... doing things differently and sober and be happy. what do i do ? how can i save my wife and kid. Should i call her bro or just worry about myself and save this evidence as a tactical nuclear bomb for the court room ? i also know that if she had this info her narrative in the court room tomorrow may change, which would be good for both of us.",15Aug2019,1

262,"She has been battling cancer since 2015. In November of last year, she underwent a stem cell transplant after 2 rounds of chemo. The chemo has left her with cognitive impairments (“chemo brain”) and severe depression. After a stem cell transplant, you’re extremely susceptible to life threatening complications and diseases for a year or so. Today her blood pressure got so low, she couldn’t walk, see, or talk. We immediately took her to the hospital, and she is currently in the ICU. I can’t get the image of her lifeless self slumped in the wheelchair out of my head.
The worst part is, she has no will to live. When she was home, she would lay in bed ALL day watching Netflix and sleeping. She had no motivation to do anything at all. We had to beg her to allow the doctors to put her on a form of life support. She can hardly even process what is happening. A few years ago, she was so full of life that her boisterous nature annoyed me. I had to watch her deteriorate into a zombie, unable to do anything.
I have severe death anxiety and OCD, which has been completely wrecking me all day. I can’t go 30 minutes without breaking down crying over the thought of me or a loved one unpredictably dying, be it from a terminal illness or a car crash. I keep thinking about how fragile life is and how out of control we are, and it’s terrifying me.

263,"I have a friend group that is constantly teasing me. I’ve been with this friend group for almost 5 years now and some people within the friend group I know more than that long. 

Some background: In the past maybe two years or less, they’ve been teasing me non-stop (it really wasn’t like this before). I recently went through an abusive relationship in which, I’ve distanced myself quite a bit from them, but these past 2-3 years I’ve been more involved since I’ve been out of it. 

Now there’s a difference between teasing someone (3 people at once against me) and being nice to them on occasion and just not at all. They never compliment me, and I am not exaggerating. Not once have they ever. It’s gotten pretty bad to the point where during prom, I cried in the bathroom and they were there looking for me and one of them asked if I was okay and that I looked good. That’s the only time I ever got a compliment, and I will remember it to this day because it meant a whole lot to me. 

The teasing includes insults of my looks compared to theirs, my voice being annoying (I’m a girl but it’s quite higher than theirs and I’m an adult lol) and just overall always shutting me down. I’ll attempt an example, “God, (name), can you please shut up. Nobody wants to hear your voice, it’s so annoying sometimes.” And that’ll go on for a bit while everyone chimes in or laughs. Sometimes they get randomly annoyed at me, and I cant never forget that. 

I understand, I tease quite a bit too but I also give my friends compliments. When I do give them compliments, they always fire something at me too. 

I guess they don’t like my personality, my voice, my attitude, I don’t exactly know anymore. I see them all the time so it’s quite hard to distance myself especially when I consider them family. I can NEVER open up to them anymore like I used to, they always give me a cold shoulder. I mentioned how I’m having some family issues and I might be moving, nobody cared to touch on it or even acknowledge it. That kind of stuff happens often. 

Is there any way I can prove to them that I’m not annoying? Like I’m starting to believe I am but I don’t exactly know. Could it be my voice? It’s quite girly and high, is there a way I could make it acceptable? Is there any way I could be more like-able to people? Whenever we hangout with someone new, they pick on me a lot so it’ll be nice if I had some new ways to be like-able.",15Aug2019,2
265,"So... I'm in college, living in the dorms. My health this summer has been pretty poor and I'm scheduled to have a major surgery the week before school starts. My mom has booked a flight out to where I go school to help me for the first week of school since I'm missing the official move-in date for returning students. The plan was to move my stuff into my dorm room the weekend after school starts so that I'll be set up by the time she needs to leave. However, I have a mandatory training retreat that weekend for being an officer in a club. One of the other members tried to bail because and everyone freaked out (the consequences for not going are things like having to pay extra money). 

I'm super conflicted on what to do. On the one hand, I committed to the retreat during last school year, but it was before I had all these health issues; also I really don't want to miss out since it's partially a fun event! That being said, the retreat is pretty far from school and I don't want to sit through a long car ride when I'm recovering from surgery. I also think it would be a pretty awful move to make my mom move my stuff into the dorms for me without me being there to help with what little I can.

270,"I've written a rather dark and disturbing horror poem. (For background, horror poetry is a niche, but somewhat popular genre, much like horror novels or horror cinema - probably the most famous example is Edgar Allan Poe's *The Raven*). The problem is, I *think* it turned out pretty good - it's the first poem of mine that I actually like - but it also freaks me out a bit, and I have no idea what messed-up corner of my brain it came from. At the moment it's called ""Ghost Story"" (working title), and the gist is as follows:


- Narrator's kid is looking at them funny 

-They seem more upset by this than you might expect, if it were just a regular kid. 

- Kid looks pale and grey, clearly dead. A ghost, in other words.

-Last line reveals that it's the anniversary of the day he/she was aborted


So... the last line is the crux of the whole issue, obviously. I believe it's an effective little horror story in poem form, but is it *too* effective? Should I try to get it published (in one of the various horror magazines/websites that accepts poems?) Could it be offensive/upsetting to women, parents who've gone through abortion, religious people, etc? Would there be negative consequences to having my name attached to it, if it *did* get published, and should I use a pseudonym? I dont know if I want to be known as ""that person who wrote the abortion-ghost poem"", but then many of my favorite writers have written disturbing and transgressive stuff (Neil Gaiman's early piece ""Babycakes"" springs to mind), and seemingly ""got away with it"" without damage to their life/career... idk, I'm in a bit of a mess right now.

When I walked in he saw me and smiled and said “hey! How are you?” I told him “good yourself?” And he said “great” his computers went down so he told me “I’ll be right back stay there” and got help from the IT guy. Then he saw the schedule. 

He told me that their is an opening in about 30 mins if I would like to come back.

I feel like life and the people in it are suffocating me, but at the same time are not really there at all. The people who feel the most genuine and the most committed are the ones that make me feel the most guilty, and cause me to despise myself even more. I can't bring myself to really allow emotion on my end, I don't think I'm really capable of feeling anything at all half of the time. The only thing I really feel, stronger than anything else, is guilt. I feel so guilty about who I am and how I feel, because I know it isn't right, I know I'm supposed to be feeling more than I am. I haven't even been able to respond when confessed to, it doesn't spark anything in me. Everyone says the same things, that you're a fine person, you shouldn't feel selfish, you're very kind at heart, etc. I cannot bring myself to even begin to understand how they feel that way, I try to look at things from the most logical and reasonable standpoints and none of it makes sense. I don't even really know how reddit works, or what kind of answers I'd be looking for here, but I needed to put these things out. All I'm capable of feeling is stress, guilt, and extreme self-doubt. I'm not here for validation, or to be fed the same nonsense about how I'm wrong and what I'm feeling isn't correct. I know there must be a way to fix this.

290,"Here’s the story. Some time ago, I had thrown a party at my place and everyone got pretty wasted. I think almost everyone was drunk. Anyway, my friend John (hypothetical name) began comforting my other friend Jane (hypothetical name). From what I know, somewhere between the comforting stage, John began touching Jane’s thighs and kissing her. According to Jane, this was not consensual at all. She was not in agreement to this and did not approve. Time passed after this with Jane not confronting John about it for a while. Months later, Jane, who still was traumatized from the event, decided to confront John about this situation. John completely apologized and claimed to feel terrible for his actions. He claims that it wasn’t his intention to make her feel terrible. Jane listened to him but wasn’t very convinced. She still believed that his apology was not enough and blocked him everywhere. 

Here is where I am stuck in the middle. I’ve known John for years and have never known him to do something like this. I do believe his apology and feel that he truly feels terrible. Despite this, Jane does not agree. I usually throw a lot of hang outs at my house and to help aid Jane, I basically stopped inviting John to any sort of drinking hang outs at my place. I still message him and stuff, but never for drinking hang outs. I feel for Jane and want her to feel safe when she comes around to drink. 

This is how it’s been for a couple months up until recently. The other day Jane saw that a couple of my other friends and I liked one of John’s pictures on Instagram. She sent out a massive group message to all of our friends stating that she can’t be friends with anyone who associates themselves with John. She said she gets crying episodes at the sight of his picture, and she can’t handle it. She basically said that we should all unfollow him and block him and if we did not she could not associate herself with us.

I am at a loss here because I do value John’s friendship, and I feel like Jane is being a little controlling and manipulative. I understand that she feels horrible after that situation with John, but I don’t think I should be forced to block him. I completely stopped inviting him to all and any events where Jane was going to be present. I don’t think a  “like” on one of his Instagram posts makes me a terrible person. John is my friend, and I don’t think I should abandon him and block him. Basically, all of my other friends blocked him, but I still haven’t. I don’t think they really minded bc they didn’t know him very much at all. If anything, they began following John after one meet up at my party. What should I do? Should I not at least be a good friend to John and help educate him on what he did wrong, or am I just being a jerk to Jane?

Hey, 

**Be warned, this is a pretty long post, I will leave a TL;DR at the bottom.**

I really do not know where to begin; this has all been distilling itself away in my mind for years now and it is a confusing, complicated and multi-faceted situation to explain. I should preface what I am going to say with some small explanation of why I am sharing this with you all. With many of the things I am about to talk about, there are several reasons as to why I cannot talk to my family or people I know. This is why, ironically, I feel the ambiguity of the internet may serve as, if not necessarily the safest place to share, at the very least an anonymous space to talk.  

&amp;#x200B;

So,   
 I am 21 years old, I am a university student currently studying two bachelor’s degrees, I work 2 part time jobs on a casual basis and tutor on the side as well. I have an auto-immune disease that I was diagnosed with 5 years ago when I was 17 that has certainly impacted my life in many ways, I am reasonably out of shape and ultimately, very, very unhappy in life.

One of the biggest problems I face, and indeed one I was only able to put my finger on recently, is that I currently do, and always have, lived my life solely based upon what I can do for other people, or how I can make other people happy or proud. I like to think I am a reasonably logical person, but I live with this irrational fear of failure or disappointing people -reading this back I feel like it is a really fucking stupid problem to have, yet I struggle with it all the same. 

My auto-immune disease has ruined portions of my life thus far, and I kind of feel like I live in this vacuum where I am fully aware of other people my age living their best life, having fun, being young, blissfully impulsive and living in the moment, and yet, due to this condition I am almost just an observer to this; I want more than anything to enjoy an experience my youth, yet I feel like I live on auto-pilot as a form of self-preservation. To clarify on this; I am not specifically precluded from doing too many things at the moment, but my eyesight is reasonably bad (it averages out with glasses on, but without it is very bad) due to this condition, and ironically the treatments I have been given caused glaucoma and cataracts, something I am getting sorted out at the moment. I am not allowed to drink at all, as I am on a chemo drug called Methotrexate that is hard on your liver, it also leaves me feeling really bad for 2-3 days of the week. 

Last year I had a really bad breakup, my ex whom I cared very deeply for tried to end her life a day after and ended up in hospital (She is okay now, though we have, probably for the best, had no contact since). Not a week later my Dad whom I love very much, had two heart attacks and a triple bypass; he seems to be okay now thankfully but the stress in that period, as well as eye surgeries, financial struggles and the two degrees and work almost feel like they have had a lingering effect on me. So many psychologically damaging things happened in such a short period that I don’t think I could really process it all as it happened, so the past months have been a slow burning mixture of a dreadful apathy, general malaise and overarching sense of disassociation for me. 

My studies have suffered from this; I want to do well, but between what I have mentioned above and the constant struggle to find work to support myself, there has been a decline in my motivation and capacity to think clearly on what are late-stage topics that require critical thought and hard work. In spite of myself, I have been finding there are times where I go to study and it is as if a fog comes over my mind – I couldn’t write anything academically acceptable or worth reading if I tried in these moments and the knowledge of this, and my seeming inability to act against it, fuck with my head to no end and ultimately exacerbate the issue itself further. It is an insidious cycle. 

As far as work goes, where I come from in Australia there is a massive influx of people my age and an incredibly stagnant job market; people fight tooth and nail for any work and at best are put on as casual employees that could have 25 hours of work one week, then 3 hours the next week, then no hours the following week, etc. I once even went for an interview for a part time position at a hardware store that offered just $20.00 AUD an hour, and a maximum of 13 hours a week, and had grown men in their 40’s and 50’s in full suits competing with me for the position. A big problem we face here is called ‘underemployment’ -it is not unemployment per se, but take me for example, I am technically employed by 5 different businesses at the moment, I sometimes get hours from two of them, and average about 15 hours of work a month, despite my best efforts to find more. Often, I am called in for 3 hours here and there, and nothing more. This in itself is stressful, as there are a lot of costs to being a student here. I am lucky, and qualified for a HECS Debt, which means my study fees are largely deferred, but on campus fees keep jacking up as time goes by. The parking on campus is privatised and costs an arm and a leg, all the food on campus is also privatised and run by individual businesses. I went to buy a burrito a couple of weeks ago, it was about $14, a friend bought a fruit smoothie, it was $8.90. These are menial examples that certainly detract from what I am trying to get at, but they contribute in their own way.  The bottom line is it is really difficult to keep my head above water and I feel constantly behind the eight ball with finances, even whilst budgeting every cent.

In term of my health; well, I am disappointed in where I am with that. In high school I was involved in sports, extracurricular activities and events. I have always been very tall and a solid guy, but whereas I was reasonably fit then, I am certainly not now. After high school, as I am sure always happens, all my friends moved away / drifted apart. I am overweight; not insanely so, but enough to notice. I have been finding time to do a little cardio lately, but it seems so much more difficult than it used to be, and I find that I feel like I am dying by the end of it. I also had a motorcycle accident a couple of years ago that gave me a pinched nerve in my hip, and that acts up sometimes – it isn’t a huge deal, but certainly annoying. My diet it okay but could be better, I intermittently fast and meal prep most of the time, but sometimes I am so busy trying to keep everything happening that I get caught out and must eat takeout foods which don’t help. I also, admittedly rarely, smoke marijuana. I used to smoke it a lot in high school, but I am very busy now and can’t afford to waste much time on it. It is both beneficial and detrimental as my auto-immune problems often leave me with migraines that are caused by eye pressure/glaucoma and MJ helps alleviate these headaches, but subsequently saps away all my motivation and capacity to concentrate and study, replacing it with overthinking my problems and self-criticism on a loop. 

Socially, I have no idea what the fuck I am doing. I have the people skills of a bread roll. As I said earlier, all my friends moved away or have taken different paths in life; I now live in a tiny studio on my own and whilst it is nice to have some solitude, I feel terribly alone. Especially after being in a loving relationship, I am keenly aware of what I am missing. That said, I do not feel I need to be in a relationship, but it certainly is lonely with no friends and living far from family. Sometimes something will happen that I feel like telling someone about, but no ones is left to share it with. I think this in itself has made me more withdrawn and quiet, (and I feel I was quiet to begin with) and I am also afraid that in the back of my mind, I am slowly developing a cynicism towards people, as I have been used by people in the past. That is one of the worst parts; I have had two friends that I was very close with in the past; the kind that you think of as family. Both, when presented with a situation where they stood to gain something (both times were where they stood to make money) out of throwing me under the bus, did so unreservedly. I can’t blame them I guess, life is tough, and I suppose you have to take what you can get. I just felt really blindsided in both instances and can’t believe I was stupid enough to let it happen a second time, I am disappointed in myself for being used as a friend, and I am disappointed in them for using me. 

I have worked really hard to be where I am, against some pretty damning odds, and yet I am totally unsure if what I am studying is what I want to be. I am in my fourth year now of five years, at the end of which I will have two bachelor’s degrees, so I will of course see it out. This has been a source of frustration, anxiety and confusion for me. I was diagnosed with my autoimmune condition at 17, in my final year of high school; I initially fought super hard to get to university as I had a couple of teachers comment that I wouldn’t make it, and more than anything I wanted an impactful way to say ‘go fuck yourself’ to them. It worked well, I felt a fleeting moment of vindication, and then I immediately had to start working very hard on studies and haven’t looked back. I am still proud of this, but given the choice again, I would have taken a little time to really think about what I wanted in life first; the insecurity of it is something I feel I could have avoided if I did this. 

This final issue that I have never, ever spoken of has been gnawing away at me for so long and I hate myself for it. After a lot of time alone to think and be sure, I feel like I like guys as well as girls. I don’t want to be like this, I want to make my parents proud, have a family one day and kids and the white picket fence and all that. My family would be supportive, I know that, but there would be sidelong glances and hushed comments forever if they found out. This has fed into my social isolation as I guess I have felt it easier to simply not partake in any of it than to add the stress and surety that people in my family were judging me and having opinions about me due to it. This is wholly a problem with me, but I overthink and scenarioize to no end about everything so whether they did or didn’t almost doesn’t matter. I would feel equally bad about it if they knew all the same.

Overall, I just feel tired, broken, lost and angry at myself. I am so worn down and burnt out feeling and I am finding life less and less appealing as time goes by. Before anyone comments on hurting myself or anything, I have no plans on that; the one ironic benefit of living my life in fear of disappointing the people I love is that I am quite sure anything like that or ending my life would absolutely destroy them, and I love them far too much to risk being the cause of that kind of anguish. I miss the me I remember; younger me questioned everything, explored things without hesitation, created things, loved life and had some semblance of a plan. Now I just feel listless, alone and in every sense of the word ­– grey. I really don’t know what I aim to achieve by putting this out there, but I am 21 and I don’t know who I am anymore. If anyone thinks they have any advice I would like to hear it. 

**I don’t want to be like this**.

**I want to be happy**.

296,"Long story short, I had my new sunglasses, iPhone, and wallet stolen at a club Saturday night. I’m mostly upset about my iPhone as it hadn’t been backed up in a year and there are irreplaceable photos and memories on it. Secondly, my wallet with all my cards and social secure card (needed it for my new job that day) got jacked. That night they used my credit cards at 4 different gas stations (spent hundreds!), a Mexican food drive-thru, and Starbucks.

Filed an online police report the next day. I’ve frozen my credit, put out fraud alert, got reimbursed, etc. BUT recently I went to the Mexican restaurant and they were able to show me footage of the culprits using my card and also their license plate. 

Would the police be able to do anything if I were to make an in-person report with this new evidence? Or would it get brushed under the rug just because it’s not a violent crime?",15Aug2019,2
297,"Okay so I (f 17) was going to pick up my older brother(20) and his gf(21) at this couple they had just met's air B&amp;B. (They were about 19/20) I get there and my brother comes out and convinces me to go chill there for a little, so I do. I meet the couple (pretty cool people) and we end up doing a bunch of coke and finally, we're about to leave. My brother says to go wait in my car for a second and they'll be right out. I waited for like 10 minutes and they get in my car and we head home. The car ride home, my brothers gf goes ""tell her what's happening"" and my brother proceeds ask if I thought the girl in the air B&amp;B was cute. I told him I did and he tells me about how they were planning a 4some while I was in the car and that his gf and the other girl wanted a 3some with me. Not in the same room as my brother of course but I still found it super weird that they would just flat out ask me at that moment. My immidiate reaction was ""What the fuck??"". His gf starts saying she thinks i'm cute and that it's my choice and I don't  have to but to think about it etc... Basically I said that I would think about it and left it at that. I tried thinking of this as an oppertunity to fuck my brother's girlfriend but I really just can't convince myself to want to have a 3some (I can be extremely akward). Also My brother and his gf recently moved into our house and I just wont be able to look at them the same.

First would be getting into Blender/After Effects(pretty much video editing)

Second would be getting into Web Development

Third is getting into C++ and after that in other programming languages.

300,"Hey everyone!

I(21F) have been with my bf(28M) for just a little over an year. I've never met any of his friends ever since we got together.I asked him and he said it's because we don't hangout too frequently(about once a week since we're dating secretly until I graduate from college next year).I'd like to get to know more people in his life,which is why I wanted to visit him at work during lunch.

I recently posted about him being uncomfortably close with a female coworker(32F) of his whom he claimed to have a sibling type relationship with.She made a racist comment about me and we both agreed to cut off all nonwork related contact with her.I was scared I might see her at work.

My parents don't approve of this relationship due to religious issues.They told me he might very well be cheating on me,but I think it's primarily because they don't want me to marry someone of a different religion/culture.This is why he was worried about it not being safe if I visited him at work,and we decided to keep this relationship a secret until I graduate next year.

So I asked him if I could visit him at work.He seemed a little hesitant telling me it might not be safe since my mom might find out,but I insisted and he agreed and said he's looking forward to it.

So I visited him at work today. Idk if it's just me but he seemed a bit nervous.He met me outside the parking lot of his office then he sat with me in my car(I drove to his office) and showed me where to parkas soon as we got out of the car,he told me ""we're going to the promenade right?""(promenade is a tourist spot near his office)I told him yeah,and that I'd like him to show me his office too!He was like yes yes,let's go to the promenade after that!He took me to his office,there weren't alot of people,around 20 I'd say(most were on lunch break)He took me to the place where he plays ping pong and eats icecream,showed me around a little bit and then we headed back-had lunch and icecream together and went to the promenadeWe had a really nice day,he was very affectionate and thanked me for visiting him but I wasn't introduced to anyone,and I'm so very stressed out right now.Is this a bad sign or am I overthinking this ?

People on here are telling me I might be a side chick or he might be dating/flirting with someone at work.I don't know what to do and how to think.

tl:dr should my boyfriend introduce me to his coworkers?",15Aug2019,1
302,"I've had no idea where to post this. Or who to talk to. Sorry if it's long. But just in case something happens, I felt I had to explain it somewhere before anything bad potentially happens.

But we got a roommate about 9 months ago. Her story is she was about to go to a womens shelter because of the abusive person she was living with. So since my mom knew her from work already, she offered our place. It was perfect timing too because my step dad just suddenly left, and we wouldn't be able to afford the house without so much income. So my mom was openly looking for a roommate. Asking coworkers if they knew anyone. Etc.. but anyway. Having her felt like a win-win helpful situation.

Well.. when she first arrived, she seemed friendly and kind. But she also mentioned how she had a degree in criminology and knew a lot about the law. And said she'd like to pull off the perfect crime one day. She mentioned it twice actually within the first week of living here.
Odd first impression. 
She's also more recently said ""I wish I could get badly injured so I could sue someone"".


She's also here and there mentioned how she can easily get out of responsibility by say.. purposely badly washing the dishes, so people will not like her doing them, and then tell her to not worry about the dishes, they'll handle it. 
Something she has done not long after living here. She even still puts dishes in all the wrong places when putting them away. Even after living here for about 9 months now. And a few times my mom just politely let her know a certain dish went in a certain cupboard. Her response was an emotional ""I can never do anything right"". A reaction.. as if she had been yelled at or looked down upon.. but it was a simple first time miatake. No reason for us to say it as tho she should know or something... :/ not normal.

One time she fed our cats full cans of wet cat food. I politely asked if she did (I wasn't sure if I forgot I already fed them each half, and she gave them the other half), she said yes and then reacted as tho she was in deep trouble?  I politely just explained I feed them half a can. And it was no big deal because she didn't know.
So why would I be angry at her? 
Next day she said ""I would have fed the cats, but last time I got in trouble"".
She didn't even have to feed them in the first place. It wasn't expected of her. But it was the same tactic I think to get out of that responsibility? Even tho it never was going to be in the first place.
There's many other cases of this too.
She uses these helpless, innocent, and clueless tactics at work too. So now coworkers bring her food every single day. Even a coffee in the morning. People even buy her bags, clothes, etc..
She also uses the same thing to avoid using bus fair every morning for work and back.

So that's one thing.

Another is pathological lying, and making up stories. We never know what to believe. Because say for example she tends to stare and observe my mom and me frequently when we're doing something. My mom can feel and see her staring from the corner of her eye. So she looks back and asks her why she's staring. She looks away and says it's ""this excuse"", next time it's a different excuse, and so on. Until she eventually admits she likes to observe people. But she still does it. My mom explains how it makes her feel uncomfortable. And she gets an emotional response saying ""fine, I'll never look at you again."" 

Another made up story I caught myself, was I was up all night watching netflix. The power went out for a couple seconds at 5am. So I decided while the wifi took its time to come back on, I'd go for some fresh air. She was up getting ready for work. She sid the power went out. I said how I noticed that too. But it came back on shortly after. Then she said ""yeah. It was weird. Then it went off and on and off and on again.""
I kinda froze wondering what she was talking about. And I said it only went off once for me. So she said it must have been because she was up earlier than me. I just stayed quiet, confused, because I was up all night. And I know it only went off once.
She also one morning said she had bought a tim hortons sandwich for me the other day, but couldn't give it to me because I wasn't home that day. I was confused and asked which day, she said ""yesterday"". But I haven't left for 3 days. And I said that. She froze, then just said she bought it for me and handed it to me. I could tell it was older than a couple days. It was hard. And I know she often forgot these same sandwiches in her bag for days that people from work bought her. I did say thank you and took it and put it in the fridge. But I definitely couldn't bring myself to eat it.

More stories like this too.. but moving on.

When she first moved in, she'd help pay for some meals every now and then, and even cook sometimes (a few times she said it was done, but for example the chicken was still raw). But eventually that slowed down. Then she'd ask me to pick up food with her money for a single meal for us. But would get one of us to cook instead. And then she stopped pitching in to groceries all together. She would buy take out (usually chicken, sometimes chinese or pizza). But that also slowly got less and less. 
My mom and I were both using our money to pay from bare necessary groceries each month. Which has been difficult lately. With the odd times of enough to make a meal for all of us. Sometimes she'd eat, but not always. She'd say her stomach was bugging her and just go to bed. Then she'd later eat 2 week old meals forgotten in the fridge and tell us what she ate later. And we'd both be concerned that she'd eat old food. That it could be dangerous. She just shrugged her shoulders.
Eventually with her not bringing any food into the house, my mom told her food wasn't included in rent. Meaning if she wanted to buy herself meals, she could. But we weren't her supply for food.
Later she tells me my mom told her she ""wasn't allowed to eat here anymore"". That was her twisted wording on what my mom said. Even when I offer something she likes that I bought. She'll gain bring up she's not allowed to eat here. And I told her I was offering it, so it didn't matter. But she still has not touched anything I offered. She still does get meals handed to her at work everyday anyway tho. So she says.

She drinks alcohol every single day. From right when she wakes up till before work. Then right when she gets home until bed. Sometimes she'll evwn wake up in the middle of the night to have another drink. She goes through maybe $20 or more worth of alcohol every day or two. 
Some mornings you can see her barely keeping her balance as she pours another drink. When my mom mentioned it out of concern, she right away denied alcohol had anything to do with it, that it was vertigo. And the many times she feels sick, nauseous, or even throws up, she'll also deny that has anything to do with the alcohol. She just is sick for a day or so. Etc.. you can feel the strong defense of her alcohol use anytime you mention it. I only mentioned it once while in a conversation about health and I was concerned about how much she drank. And how I said it makes me fel after I binge and feel sick or hungover the next day. And that's when I felt the strong defense of denial that alcohol could be causing any bad health signs in her whatsoever.

She's often offered us beer or alcohol too. She didn't want to be the only one drinking. So we have been drinking a bit more. Sometimes when me or my mom buys, we share a bit too. But I'm trying to quit. Especially because I've been feeling unsafe lately and don't want to be oblivious and intoxicated. Just everything she's said and done up until this point all feels off to me.

She just told me yesterday that she's planning to move out at the end of the month because she feels $550 a month for rent is way too high. But she hasn't told my mom yet. And she's assuming with my moms new job, we'll be able to manage fine on our own. 

And today she said she once sat with murderers and didn't mind. They were ""the cool people"" at rehab. She felt their reasons for killing was a good reason. 

And another thing. She believes ""people should be able to do whatever they want"". Her views on substance use for example. She thinks it'd be a great thing if there were places where you were supplied them for free and could do it as much as you want. Basically in her mind, she's wishing she could just find a place where she could drink all day and have no responsibilities. Which I think is what she was trying to create that type of environment for herself in our home. And she only works so ahe can afford her alcohol and shelter. But now she's looking for a cheaper place because she wants more of her money for alcohol. And she needs to find another place where the roommates will also cater to her tactics. Because here my mom is trying to work hard to move forward, and can't have enough energy to also take care of someone who wants everyone to to everything for her. I'm also trying my best to cope and work through anxiety, depression, how to build a life for myself despite struggling to be functional with autism, ptsd, and add. I've been making slow progress. 
And we both want to help her, but any genuine advice that requires work or responsibility, she ignores (zones out) and pushes aside. The best I'm able to do is listsen to her vent. Despite being unsure how much she says or what she says is true. Or has another purpose behind it.

Recently she found out a family member of hers has cancer. And it came back again worse. She's been extremely emotional about it. Assuming the worst and constantly wishing it were her instead. I do my best to listen because as much as I wish I could, I can't take cancer away. She says she's thankful I listen and understand her. But at times when she gets really emotional over these updates. I'm worried she might snap if the day comes the family member dies. And she'll kill us or something. Because she already seems to act as if we're against her.
Like one time we were laughing and talking about stuff with a friend that stopped by. And out of nowhere she just says ""I know! I look miserable!"". It was random and not even closely related to any topics mentioned.
She often assumes we think negatively about her.
She also has said she's heard voices before. And she believes spirits are waking her up at 3am lately.
Nothing really wrong with believing in spiritual things imo. I do myself. But with everything else combined, it worries me for some reason.


I could keep going.
But really.. I'm just unsure what to do. In case she somehow in her mind justifies doing something harmful to us whether it be herself or through people she knows. I have no idea what stories she tells others about how we are. How many are lies or truth. What she's planning. Etc.. 
She wants to keep in contact with me when she moves out she says. She says she likes me and compliments me often. But I'm always skeptical when people say they like me and are overly kind. It sets off a red flag in my mind. Sometimes I worry it may just be me being paranoid because of ptsd related things.
But the mix of someone saying they want to commit the perfect crime, wish they got injured badly so they could sue someone, consciously plays innocent, clueless, and helpless to be catered to, plays victim when they're not even in trouble, and tells frequent lies and stories, etc.. feels unsafe to me. 
Oh. And she also explained how ahe can be really intimidating if needed, when she first moved in. 

I'm sure she has a whole made up story on her own end to play to others. 

Any ideas on how to play this safely or anything?",15Aug2019,2

307,"Alright, so I’ve been applying for a few jobs recently. Good starter jobs at fast food joints, or auto parts stores, etc. and I just scheduled a face to face interview at Arby’s taking place in 14.5 hours.

To be frank, I’m really not sure what to wear to an interview at a fast food place, much less Arby’s, which serves as more of a runner-up restaurant on peoples lists for where to eat.

Should I keep it standard and go for a professional look? With a dress shirt, pants, and a nice belt? or should I go for a casual outfit consisting of jeans, my best band t-shirt tucked in, and some nice sneakers?

309,"I need advised really bad or maybe other peoples point of view. I received a Facebook message from a woman stating that my husband of 8 years is the father of her child. (7-13 years old, not sure about the age). This woman would not give her name, the name of the child, or any other info and her Facebook is so private that I cannot get anything out of it. She showed me the picture of her child which looks like a xerox copy of my husband. I feel so betrayed, sad, disgusted, hurt and pained. I don't know what to do. First I thought she was scamming me but she provided personal information that only either a family member or my husband would know from his past. She states that she does not need anything and she just wanted to prove to me and my husband that she had raised her son? I am so confuse as why she is reaching out to me and not on my husband? She states that she had contacted my husbands brother but he did not pay attention and did not say anything to her, she added that she was looking for my husband for a long time but could not find him but she knows the place where he is from? She states that her son has a father now, who is the father of her 2 children and has a solid family. After she had contacted me she deactivated her Facebook. I called her couple of times but she would not answer, she is willing to meet me but would not give an address?

My husband is planning to find this woman to prove to me that is not his child, is it even worth it to find this woman as she is clear as the sky that she does not want paternity test done- states she is so sure its his? or should we move on with our lives, deactivate my Facebook and heal from here?

310,"I attend a social group here in my home town. I’ve been attending this for maybe 1/2. 

There is usually 8-10 people in attendance at each meeting. At this meeting there are three people who in a sort of clique, in the sense that they only ever hang out and talk with each other.

Last year, they started talking to me. They actually invited me out twice. That went fine, then all of a sudden they started blanking and ignoring me.

I sent a text asking what went wrong and apologised if I had done something to offend them, but my texts where ignored. I then asked one of them to their face and the response “no, no everything’s fine”. About a week later they deleted me off Facebook so I don’t think “everything” was fine.

The blanking and ignoring continued. Now a year later and they’re still blanking me.

One of the friends will sometimes smile or say hello but the other two plain out ignore me. I’ve tried to get involved in their conversations but they’re either snigger at each other or pretend not to have heard me.

This is all quite uncomfortable. On occasion it’ll only be them in the group and they’ll just  sit there chatting whilst I am isolated. We’ve went out on occasion as a group and they leave me to my own devices, don’t ask me to come with them or anything.

I have never experienced anything like this in my life. Anyone who I have been blanked by in this way, I usually have a fair idea as to why they ignore me. Here, I have no idea, in fact I don’t feel that i’ve done anything. I literally see them hating me for no reason whatsoever.

It’s hurtful and painful to be in the room with them and to be continually blanked and not acknowledged. I wreck my brain every time I go and I cannot come up with a reason as to why they ignore me.

313,"Hi all, I'm in an odd situation at the moment, and I was hoping that the wise folks in this community might be able to lend me some advice!

Basically, I'm trying to choose between a degree-apprenticeship and a degree at a really good school.

For just under a year, I've been studying a degree-apprenticeship program with one of the world's largest  broadcasters. We're given a salary and have our tuition fees paid, and spend three years split between studying at university and learning on placements in the company, with various departments of engineering. Sounds great, right?

Unfortunately , the full-on nature of the course has taken its toll on me and I haven't been enjoying it! The two internships I've had so far weren't very rewarding and didn't feel relevant to my interests, offering little to do for interns. 

The terms at university have been really challenging due to the condensed nature, with little/no free time to socialise, exercise or practice other stuff. We stay in a hotel with no belongings and don't get much opportunity to socialise. We get little time off each year, so I haven't been able to see friends as often as I'd like or go on holidays.

The alternative option I'm considering is to transfer to university to study Acoustic Engineering (possibly with music). It's a really strong degree at a great school with good links to industry. I'd get much more time to improve at hobbies and sports, and could pursue internships more specific to my interests (in audio engineering). I'd also get more free time etc, but I would have the debt associated with going to college or university.

At my early stage, it's hard to know exactly which path would land me best for my career, whilst factoring short term enjoyment in. I really want to study abroad but I can't doing my current course. I feel like I'm missing out on uni doing this course, but maybe it's for the best in the long term?

Which path do you think would be best? Have you ever faced a decision like this, and how did you decide? I'd hate to make the wrong choice due to inexperience or poor judgement!

Thanks for reading, I'd love to hear your thoughts! Feel free to ask questions if I've been vague etc at all.",15Aug2019,1
314,"Hello everyone. So I am going on a student exchange programme to Japan for a week and like the title says, I am worried that I won't be able to adjust to the food. My family doesn't est a lot of Japanese food if any so I haven't had much exposure to Japanese food. The only Japanese food I have eaten is chicken curry rice and chicken teriyaki rice. I have never had sushi or ramen. Considering that I will have to eat home cooked food and I can't exactly choose what to eat I am worried that I may not be able to stomach the food.(I have a very strong gag reflex)
Any advice on how to deal with this or is Japanese food something that everyone likes and I am just overreacting.

Thank you!",15Aug2019,1

We verified the number and the one they had is correct. We did not call 911, there is no chance, we were dead asleep, and it’s only us. I asked if it could be a prank and they said no and that it was probably our phone service. We called our phone service and they said it wasn’t them and was unlikely a prank and “are you sure you don’t have any kids??” Uh yes we’re sure!

320,"My employer in the United States fumigates agricultural food products before shipment to consumers.

The product is Evergreen Pyrethrum Concentrate (Product Code 7469, EPA Rep NO. 1021-2560). The OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit is 5mg/m3.  They are using 4.7 ounces for a 23,606 cubic foot vault.  By my math, that's 133,243 mg for a 668.4 cubic meter room or 199mg/m3.  Converting that back to imperial, they should be using .118 fluid ounces (not 4.7 ounces) for a 23,606 cubic foot vault.

There is no PPE except for nitrile gloves if the employee chooses to use them and no one wears the required long sleeve shirts.  There are no fumigation warning signs posted of any kind, let alone any with a skull and crossbones, when they are fumigating.  They only assign one person to set up and start the fumigation machine and to shut off and remove the machine from the vault.  No one is aware of and nowhere is posted, the 12 hour restricted entry time.

Is my math correct? Are they using 40x the OSHA PEL? Is it ever acceptable to exceed the OSHA PEL? If so, when and by how much and how does that change the PPE requirements?

They also store the 5-gallon water fountain bottles for the employees' consumption in the same vault at all times.  This includes both the sealed full bottles and the open empty bottles to be returned. This seems to me to be a terrible practice but I am unaware if it violates any law or regulation.",15Aug2019,0

322,"I’m typing this because it’s 4am and right now my best friend is asleep beside me but every time I close my eyes, I see what happened in a million horrific, morbid, terrifying ways. I hear the other car laying on his horn, and worst of all I hear my best friend screaming. She got into a car wreck a few months ago and is still having extreme pain from it, not to mention the trauma. I don’t know how to get consolation. I’m not gonna lie or try to bend or twist this- almost accident was my fault. If anyone got hurt, if my best friend got hurt, god forbid if someone died, it would’ve 100%, undoubtedly been my complete fault. And I can’t move past that fact. I’ll provide some backstory here if you’re interested but ultimately, I just need some advice that’s not like “Oh, accidents happen!” I could’ve killed my best friend and I need to know how to fall asleep with that on my conscience. 

Let me start by prefacing how cautious of a driver I’ve always been, from the day I got my learners permit. My own MOM called me a grandma driver. If I need to check/send a text, I use Siri to read me my messages and send them out without taking my eyes off the road. Always make sure I come to the most top-tier, DMV-grade complete stop at every stop sign, always use my blinker, the works. I guess I’ve gotten a little more lax lately, trying to get myself to be more comfortable with driving, which only adds to the guilt.

To set the stage, it’s me and my best friend in my car, following behind two of my other friends in another car, all going to the same place. We’re stopped at a small but always busy 4-way intersection, waiting for the light to turn green. We’ve got the music up relatively loud, but not like breaking speakers kind of loud because we were also talking. I’ve driven through this intersection countless times with no issue, it’s down the road from my moms house and on the way to work, my dads house, everything. To go anywhere, I use this intersection.

Fun fact: I’ve recently discovered that this intersection has been rated the number one worst intersection in my state, which is unsettling. The reason being, the lights have no arrows, which can be tricky for some drivers (i.e. me, apparently) who are turning left and such, and the big reason: one of the ways coming up to the light goes up hill and curves right, so you can’t see ANYTHING at the intersection until you’re maybe 10 feet away from the stop line. Like **maybe** if it’s dark and the wind decides to move some leaves out of the way you’ll be able to see what color the lights gonna be before you’re right in front of it, but that’s about it. Because this is relevant later in the story, we’ll name this Bitchlane.

So anyways, light turns green, friend goes straight. Weird, I thought. I usually go left. Either way will get us to where we want to go, so I’ll just go my way. Again, the stoplights didn’t have arrows, it was just green so it wasn’t like I had a protected left turn or anything, just had to make sure no cars were coming. I’m not but 5 feet out into the intersection when I stop looking at them and wondering why they’re going that way, and bam. I don’t know how I became aware of the car coming from— you guessed it— Bitchlane. Neither of us could see each other until we were right there. But by the time I looked back from my friends car, my best friends head and part of the pillar were blocking a lot of my vision and it only came into view as it was coming towards me. 

Brief pause to explain what was going through my head at this time. What people say about time going in slow motion? No clue what they’re talking about. It happened in a split second. There were absolutely no active thoughts in my head, but a million thoughts all popping up as background noise that I was much too terrified to attempt to register. Those tiny subconscious thoughts were too fast for me to process, but just told my brain what to do without having to think about it. Maybe a coherent thought or two might’ve been helpful in a situation like that, maybe that kind of thing is just something instinct needs to work out, but this plane was on auto-pilot. I was not thinking. Completely blank mind. My first thought, upon seeing the car, was “Oh shit, a car.” Second thought was “my best friend is going to have to go through this again.” Third thought, “This is happening.” and auto-pilot took control. The tiny subconscious thoughts still went on, and I remember bits and pieces of it. I remember one of them being “I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry.”

This all happened within 4 seconds but I’m gonna drag it out to better explain it. I honestly am not quite sure what happened but here goes:
So they were turning right, and I was turning left, adjacent from each other, both trying to go into the same lane (at the time I thought they were going straight). They’re coming at me, I don’t have time to process this, my mind is blank, I just gotta get the fuck out of the way. Side note— people who say “Uh you’re supposed to brake in a situation like this!” please no. It’s really situation specific. It’s not like this guy slammed on his brake or anything, he was still going, and from where I was, he would’ve t-boned right where my best friend was. The tiny subconscious thoughts were telling my fucking tabula rasa brain that I had no way of knowing if he would brake or keep going, if he expected me to brake or keep going, what am I supposed to do when I’m 3 feet away from one of us getting hit, roll down my window and say “No, I insist, after you sir :)”? Keep in mind this whole time my best friend is saying something, I have no idea what, and the other car is laying on the horn so I’m freaking out. If I had a camera on my face I’m sure I would laugh at myself. My eyes were giant, I was stiff as a board, my jaw was clenched shut. So I change my trajectory from left turn to as far away from this as possible, and in the process I sort of swerve around his front bumper (at this point I believe he was stopped) and in doing so, I find myself face to face with this poor car waiting his turn at the light going the opposite direction on the same way the dude and I were trying to turn into, and right about now is when everything in my head goes quiet. No tiny subconscious thoughts, nothing. If I had to chalk it up to one sentence, it would just be an exclamation point. I know my best friend screamed, and I remember hearing it, but I don’t remember it happening. I have no idea what it is that I did, but I swerved enough that I could get in front of the car I almost hit, and safely onto a dirt patch on the side of the road. I sat for a second when the tears started welling up in my eyes, punched the off button on the radio when I realized it was still playing. And I just sat there. Our friends came back around because they heard the honking and one of my friends from the other car drove my car back.

I remember looking at my hands while they were shaking harder than I’ve ever shaken before, and it just sunk in how much power I had just a few seconds ago. Not good power, just power. If I were to have done one thing differently, I don’t even want to imagine what would’ve happened. It’s like those scene in movies where a guy stabs someone and he looks down at his bloody hands as the reality sets in and he’s all like “What have I done...” It was literally that. I looked down at my hands and all I could do was just cry and try to understand what the fuck just happened. It was so unreal yet at the same time the most intense thing I have ever felt. Part of it felt like fiction, like a TV show, the other part of me has never been more aware and present in a moment than those few seconds. I wish there was a way for me to put adequate emphasis on aware and present because they’re just the perfect words but it doesn’t do justice to the situation. Rarely do you ever come across a moment in your day where you just become so aware about everything around you, every thought in your head.
I talked about it more in depth with my best friend earlier tonight and just basically doing a play by play of what happened. She told me my reaction time was really good and I did a great job avoiding the situation (which I obviously cried tears of relief when I heard) and I told her I remember thinking “I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry.” but couldn’t remember if I had said it. She said she thinks I did, and said something along the lines of “but you did everything you could to avoid them,” and I was like “No, was saying it to you.” She paused. I realized, “oh my god that sounded sad.” and we laughed about it but I quickly realized that those might’ve my last words to her. There could’ve been kids in those cars. My best friends parents might not have a daughter anymore. If I had done the slightest thing differently, everyone could be dead. Or not. I hate knowing that I will never know how bad that could’ve been. I probably don’t want to know. This has turned into a tangent yeah so I guess I just needed to get this off my chest but if anyone has any advice for me I’d love to hear it.",15Aug2019,1
323,"Hello, I am 26F and I have only one brother who turned 20 yo 2 days ago. 

as young siblings, we always went through fights and arguments which is in my opinion totally normal, and no matter what happens my brother is always the most important person in my life,  

The past years have been tough for us, he doesn't respect anyone at home, especially my mother and I (since my dad is in the US and we live in another continent).

He's given up on his education, he graduated from HS in 2018 after so much effort from our side to push him through and encourage him. We are still very supportive and we do our best to guide him and let him do what he feels like doing, he wanted to be a barber so we were 100% supportive and helped him get a course and buy the equipment he needed.

I admit I've made lot of mistakes when I was younger (mostly getting into fights and yelling at each other), and apologized for what I did many times, however he never apologizes even when he's wrong, he never admits he's wrong.

It has been tough for me too, since I always struggled through life, I hadn't always the privilege to have everything I wanted and didn't get the chance to choose or take my time at anything, I had to study hard and work hard, luckily I was able to get a decent job back in 2016, when my dad got sick and couldn't work.

I always wanted to make it easier for my brother, I gave up my room and sleep in a couch,  I tried to make sure that my parents wont make the same mistakes they did with me, even though I don't mention that to them.

However my brother is ungrateful for everything, whenever he went through an argument or a fight with mom, he always put my name in the middle and make it like I've wronged him in any way even though when I am just sitting there watching them and not saying a word (I tried to control myself in the last couple years and not get any argument whatsoever).

My brother makes it impossible for us to discuss anything with him, he always shuts us down before even trying to speak, he always says that we women are drama queens and stuff, in his opinion we are always wrong and he knows everything, he made this wall between us and he blames us for what he's now, however we always made sure to be there, to be supportive and to help him out. The worst is now whenever we get into an argument he starts to threw things and break mirrors and everything in front of him and start sobbing and saying that he always tell us to not bother / anger him. 

he talks down to us, always disrespectful, He makes a big deal when my mom does not cook anything, however there's always food in the fridge.

he refuses anything from me, always says hurtful things, whenever I get him a gift, he looks at it with disgust and turn it down, never went out with me, from time to time I try to give him money to buy what he wanted since nothing I buy pleases him but always refuses them, always talks down to me, a couple months ago he asked me if i had any friends and I told him yes, then he looked at me and told me May God help them. it hurts since he knows almost nothing about me and he never tried to. at this point I'm just lost. I forgave him without any apology from his side.  

Last Saturday,  he woke up late as always, there was some dishes in the kitchen counter (They were his dishes from last night), while making his juice, he said that the kitchen is dirty, normally it's me or mom who do the dishes and never complain about it. anyway I heard him and said in a normal tone, ""then clean it out"", and he went on women are supposed to this stuff and so on (I've always been an independent girl, and in our family there's nothing that called a men or women job, we all should help out). anyway there was a huge fight and all afterwards, I went out the whole day and remained silent for the next days, I decided to get a place for myself and get out of his sight but I admit it's a bit difficult since rent is a little bit expensive, and In September I'm pursuing my masters degree in another city (on weekends) and work during the week in my hometown.

I am lost, i don't know what to do, I don't wanna lose my brother but there's noway this gonna work out, since the effort is only one sided, I act like i don't exist at home anymore, I slept over my uncle's last night just to get out of sight.

It hurts. 

I am sorry if the story is a shattered pieces from everywhere but I couldn't keep up with all these thoughts.

This is normal behavior to her, but this was the final straw to me. I normally stay away from her but since I am stuck with her for 9 hours I need some advice. Short amd long-term.

327,"I'm gonna do my best to keep this brief, but I feel as if it's important for you to have a picture of the man I'm dealing with.

My father, in a very short form, is a person that shouldn't be a parent. He's aggressive to the point of bringing his fist mere centimetres from my face as well punching holes in walls. He's a pathological liar and makes things up for no reason, usually just to get me into shit or to make up some wild story that didn't happen. He's lazy and uses an old heart condition to get out of everything even though doctors say he's fine. He's stubborn, and will act like the sweetest person ever as soon as someone who isn't me or my mother is nearby. And to top it off? He is INCREDIBLY explosive.

I moved out earlier than expected because of him, my mom left him shortly after, and he lives 200 metres away.

He dog sits for me sometimes, and it's often that he offers me dinner. Probably because he wants company. That would be fine and maybe even enjoyable if we had nice conversations, but he is... Very passionate about political views that I do not see eye to eye with. I won't mention what these views are, but let's just leave it at it being sensitive topics. Discussing politics is fun though, right? Not with him.

Most of the time, I shut off, look at my phone and try to change subjects because I know it won't be a pleasant talk. But, stubborn as he is, sometimes he gets his way and the arguments we have are less than nice. I won't lie, I'm also pretty good at being nasty in those. It gets heated, it's problematic, and in the end, I'm exhausted, pissed off, insulted and he's threatening to punch me again while the dog whimpers from a distance.

What I want is to try and ask him to not discuss these topics with me. I want to try and convey to this man that I'm not interested in them, I'm not willing to discuss them because of the arguments it leads to but I don't know how I would do that. Now that you have some background on him, some light understanding of how he is, do you have any tips on how I can handle this without chaos?

334,"A couple days ago during a break in a training session at work, a coworker (25F) and I (29M) were chatting, and she asked “Can I ask you a weird question?” I gave her my usual response “Can I give you a weird answer?” (I know, really clever..) She proceeds to ask me if urinals have toilet paper. In my head I’m thinking that yes, that IS a weird question to ask. I responded by telling her that no, they do not because they’re for standing only. She then gets this puzzled look on her face and follows up with “Then how do you guys take care of, you know, ‘residue’?” (This question came complete with strange hand motions like dipping a chip in salsa) Now I’m really taken aback, but I told her that if she really wants to know that she should ask her fiancé. I didn’t really want to explain the concept of shaking it off to her.
For background, this coworker and I chat a lot, and there’s some good banter amongst a small group of us that work in the same department. It’s not like we’ve never interacted before or barely talked before.

My questions to you all are: Did I respond appropriately? Was it prudish of me to be stunned by her questions? Should I have just gone ahead and explained the process?",15Aug2019,1
336,"Okay long story short me and this guy used to have a thing 3 years ago, after we moved on we have been trying to be friends but it has its ups and downs, he never seems to be available to hang out in person, I am always making time and putting effort for that to happen but usually situation will go like this: i'll text him and we'll have a normal conversation but when i mention i'll be free till thursday we could do something, he stops replying and only answers friday saying he couldnt make it, was too busy, blah blah. It's okay to be busy but I'd rather he would answer me right away saying he probably cant make it and not leaving me hanging on for days (thankfully i have learned not to leave my schedule open for him). And during this time he keeps checking my insta stories, so doesnt have time to reply a simple cant make it but does to be on instagram? And everytime I bring this up he keeps gaslighting me saying how i am the one being rude, makes up non sense completely bullshit excuses.

337,"I am a 22 year old female who recently got dumped. I spend most of my time at work and then home (I live alone with my dog &amp; cat) or running errands by myself. Everyone is always saying to live your life to the fullest especially while you’re young.

But I don’t understand how. The first thing that comes to mind is to go out and party all the time and “have fun”. But I don’t necessarily enjoy going out + can’t afford to go out drinking all the time. Most of my friends are in relationships as well.. so when I do have a day off they are either working or already have plans with their partners.

338,"So a few months ago I started my first job at a pizzaria which is owned by my cousin, which makes her my boss. We have a lot of problems with people not being able to work on the days they're supposed to, especially since it summer vacation. About a week ago (tuesday) I came back from a 10 day holiday, after that I worked wednesday, friday, saturday and sunday which absolutly destroyed me. It was even worse because I would normally work 3 hours but on 3 of those days I had worked 8 hours. My normal shedule is: wednesday, friday and saturday, but today (thursday) my cousins asked me if I can come work today which I really don't want to do but I don't if I can even say that, like I really want to have my day off but I she asks me to come work do I have to say yes or do I actually have a choice?

340,"When I was 16 my then g/f and I had sex like teenage kids.. we were stupid like teenage kids and I ""Pulled out"" (yeah, right).  Well after my Ex and I broke up she reached out to me saying she believed she was pregnant.  I went and purchased a preg. test and took it to her. She took it (She says). It was negative (She says).  I cannot say for certain. She refused to let me see the stick.  

I left feeling lucky I was not about to be a dad. (Had I ever been told, I would have been every bit the dad that I could/should have been.)  About a week to a week and a half later, she calls me again saying ""I think that was a bad test. I still think I'm pregnant. Please bring me another test."" I told her no way. She wouldn't let me see the last one. I took her word for what she said. I also told her that in the past week I had heard from numerous people she was also sleeping with X other guy before we even broke up.  To which she never denied that rumor.  So I told her it could just as wel be his kid. 

I did not hear anything from her again after that until what must have been about 10 years later.  She shows up with a child in arm at my parents house. She tels my mom that she would like to speak to me and could she please give her my #. My mother refused but offered the reverse.  That happened. So I Get the number for my ex and I call her up.  We are talking and she says things like ""I want you to meet my oldest son. I think you'd really get along with him."" So we were setting up plans to meet when her husband (X from high school days) comes walking in.  ""WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?!?"" I heard her say ""Matt"" his response ""I TOLD YOU YOU COULD NEVER CALL HIM"" then the pone got thrown (But did not disconnect). I hear him screaming, I hear her crying and the children crying... I hear her sayig ""NOT IN FRONT OF THE CHILDREN"" and then I didn't know what to do so I hung up the phone.  I never contacted her back and we never met up.

At the time I thought.. ""If my presence is going to cause this sort of an issue, it's better for me to stay away."".  So I did.  I never heard from her again. This past week I met someone with access to a database of people and he located her.  I now know exactly where my Ex lives.  

I have an opportunity to find out if I have a 23 year old son.  I know that this is something I want to know before I die.  I do not want this wonder over my head forever. I also don't want to disrupt the life of a kid who may know about me, may not. He may resent me or he might as soon as he is aware of my existence.  I might cause an entire world of turmoil about how I came close to finding out I had a son. I could have fought for custody. I could have removed from an abusive home. I at the very least could have called CPS or 911.   I didn't do a damn thing.  I was still as irresponsible at 26 as I was at 16. 

Should I open this can of worms? Find out once and for all what happened 23.. and then 13 years ago.  Should I find out if I am a biological father? Perhaps I should stay as far away as I have and just never surface. Never break open the wounds for, presumably everybody including the, now 23 year old child.",15Aug2019,0

343,"So I had edibles two months ago, for the first time. It was pretty fucked up. I completely lost my mind and I would never try it again. That time, my body felt numb, my whole body. I couldn’t feel anything I touched. I think it was going on for 7 days, I had to touch everything overand over again.

345,"So im in a bit of a rut. I took A-level maths, product design and physics.

First though, a little backstory. I passed most of my GCSEs with pretty good grades with A's in graphic design, resistant materials, english, citizenship, geography and physics but barely scraped past D's and C's with chemistry, biology and maths. I've never been great at maths and almost failed my GCSE maths if it wasnt for my mum's tutoring. However, I had my heart set on engineering because I have a passion and a nack for it so I ended up taking Maths, Product design and Physics at A-level despite my dad wanting me to take English and geograpy which I didnt have much passion for and would never lead me to an engineering job and nievely thinking that with enough work, I could pass A-level maths with at least a decent grade. 

Now at this point, things start to get worse. Half way through my A-level maths course after at lease 4 different teacher changes, my class wasnt doing well at all but I seemed to be doing the worse. I was put in for a AS maths exam in order to judge whether I should continue with the course or not and quite frankly, I failed despite countless hours of tutoring from my mum. At this point, Its too late to switch to an english A-level and I cant see it being beneficial to my dreams of being an engineer. I also cant stay at my school while only doing 2 A-levels despite both going reasonably well with a predicted A\* for product design and a minimum B predicted for physics. This now leaves me with 3 options. 

Option 1: I can beg and beg the school to let me stay on for A-level Maths so I have the best change of going on to do engineering but risking my maths grade and tainting my other grades if I fail or end up forced out of the school due to bad performance. 

Option 2: I can try and get onto an english course at my school and catch up 1 whole year of work at the same time as trying to complete the second year and risk getting lower grades in my other courses as a result. On the other hand, it will allow me to persue different career options such as journalism or something like that despite my real passion being in engineering. 

Option 3: I can drop out of highschool completely, abandoning my product design and physics grades in favour of trying to get myself into an apprenticeship a year late for the previous round and a year early for the next round on only my GCSE grades and hope for the absolute best. This means I do have a chance to start earning money way earlier than the rest of my peers in 6th form but means I will only have my GCSEs to support me which sounds risky to me since my GCSE grades arent outstanding and most employers look for skilled workers meaning that my career options are limited to entry level jobs unless I spend years of my life struggling through the ranks of a company and likely never reaching any significant level without significant time and investment later on in life that Im not sure ill be able to afford. 

  
So here I am at the crossroads. I have no idea where im going and it looks like nothing but thorns and hellfire in every direction. 

So what do you think? Im honestly looking for any advice here.",15Aug2019,1
346,"My fiancé’s family is from a different state than where I, my family, and my fiancé live. Planning this wedding has been more than stressful, beginning with telling all of his side of the family that the wedding is taking place here and they will need to travel. This was uncomfortable, but I feel justified since it’s not just some destination wedding, it’s where we live. Anyway, there have been a lot of passive aggressions going on between families during the whole process and it has been stressful as hell.

My mom started looking for her dress for the wedding MONTHS ago. She was really excited, and that’s just how my family does things. Also, my mom is a little bigger and was really nervous about losing weight and finding something she looked good in. She found a dress she loved and lost a pretty good amount of weight! 

My future mother in law texted her asking about what she was going to wear, so my mom said the color of the dress she found and described it. Future MIL then texted asking for a picture of the dress. Mom reluctantly sent the picture of it from the website feeling odd about it, but figuring at least it would keep them from showing up in the same dress (based on how the rest of the planning is going this would have been typical).

Soon after, MIL texts my mom asking if their dresses should match! Saying someone there where she lives said sometimes that is a thing... Mom texts her saying no, she never heard of that, and that MIL should wear what she likes and not have to match my mom.

A couple weeks ago, MIL sends me a few pics of dresses she tried on, looking upset in all of them. She then sends one in a VERY similar color to the dress my mom bought and showed her months ago. She said she loves it but it only comes in that color...

Feeling preemptively sad for my mom who labored over finding the perfect dress, I said that the dress was lovely but almost the same color as the one my mom bought. I also said though that of course if she loved it that I wasn’t going to tell her not to get it or anything, hoping she would get the hint.

She says okay and that she will keep looking, but I feel she is pissed. And granted I feel bad, but I also feel like of all the choices why pick the same one as my mom? Especially when pics were sent?

Then she texted me a photo of a similar dress but many shades off, and said, is this too similar to your mom’s dress? I could feel it was passive aggressive and I felt weird as though I now was having to approve or give permission for this dress! And I’m not that kind of bride, or person, at all.

Well last night, exactly one month away from the wedding, she texts me saying I think I found my dress! And it is almost EXACTLY like my mom’s dress, and maybe HALF A SHADE off! And in this pic she was smiling smugly. I was so shocked and upset I didn’t know what to do. 

I told my mom because I felt like she deserved to know, and she cried. She has been doing so much for my fiancé and I and for this wedding, and she has been working so hard on her confidence and her body, and I think this broke her with all the stress and pressure she is under.

I was so angry hearing my mom cry after she finally felt good about herself and her dress. All I could do was text MIL and say, well I guess you guys will be twins that day lol. It’s all I could muster after KNOWING she has seen pics of my mom’s dress. I feel as though she spitefully chose something similar because maybe she felt as though I was dictating what she could and couldn’t have based on what my mom got. But honestly, if my mom non-maliciously bought her dress first, then MIL should not get something similar! Had it been the other way around I know my mom would say okay well I shouldn’t get this color or style.

It just infuriates me and feels so on purpose. After I said that MIL texted me back pointing out the slight differences on the dresses in an attempted “oh no!” Type of way, as if she didn’t know and have pics of my mom’s dress saved to her phone.

My mom begged me not to say anything because she didn’t want to start a thing, and if MIL did do this on purpose she did not want to give her the satisfaction of knowing that it upset her. I personally disagree and all I want to do is say something to my fiancé about it, but I know it would get back to MIL and be a mess anyway. Maybe she would say fine and get an even more elaborate dress for spite, and it would work out in the opposite way anyway.

I don’t know, I’m so stressed over this and I need to hear what other people think. This is definitely a first world problem but it’s real to me and I really can’t stop thinking about it.",15Aug2019,1
347,"


I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‘mines 21st’ and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays...are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty.

356,"If I had to describe it, I could not do my feelings justice with the words that I'd pick, but I'll try anyway. For me, writing fantasy is a work of unbridled love. When the mood is right, I could write for days. Unfortunately, I have a strange complex, or fever, or aspiration. 

I used to believe that I could write anything, and for the most part, I still think that's true, however, these past few years I have been plagued with this obsessiom to write a story of legendary proportions. I have been inspired by who I now believe to be the best fantasy author of all time, Stephen R. Donaldson, to rival and exceed the bar he has set. I don't know what to do about this fascination, and it is certainly unhealthy. I *need* to do this, but am absolutely floored by the difference in our writing experience, so much so that I have begun to believe I will not reach that level in a lifetime. 

Its depressing, really. I have grand stories in my head, and some on paper, but I don't believe that any of them will ever come out as good as I envision, especially since i've never published. I feel as though I am wasting my great idea by making it the first book I write, and I cannot find the motivation to write about anything else. 

Furthermore, being so deeply moved by the Thomas Covenant books, I cannot help but draw upon them for some of my inspiration. I don't know if our ideas are so closely intertwined, or if i'm just a hopeless, albeit unknowing, plagiarizer. Yes, I've read other fantasy. I've certainly been inspired by other works, but my personal peak that i must surpass is still something to rival Donaldson. 

To cut this post down before it grows into a book itself, my plight is this: I fear that I will never accomplish my goal, certainly not in a single lifetime, because I lack confidence in my abilities as a writer and because I have far less experience in writing. Also, I cannot motivate myself to write about anything else, as it turns into a chore, and the quality of my writing suffers as a result. I've been content with short stories and poetry, but the cycle must break. I must publish something. 

I have ideas, characters, scenes, and plots as vivid as a painting coursing through my mind day and night. Some of it makes it on paper. I'm paranoid and secretive by nature, so its very difficult for me to share my writing even with my friends. Whats worse is that my friends are also entirely uninterested in writing and reading, so I can't get any meaningful advice from them.",15Aug2019,1

365,"Hi there! I am a 20 year old male who desperately needs some outside opinions. In May I met this girl at a party. She initiated the conversation and we hit it off! She asked for my social media info so we started texting and it was great! We texted each other for almost 3 weeks straight, while seeing each other at parties during the weekends. At each party we’d flirt with each other. We’d hold hands,  make each other laugh all night, find so many common interests,  Etcetera. It even got the point of her telling me that “She likes spending time with me” and “I make her feel safe” when were out on the town wandering while intoxicated ;).  Her roommate even told me that if I hurt her, then she’d beat me up and that she talked about our conversations all the time. 

At this point all my friends thought it was a for sure thing. I invited her out a couple times outside of just seeing her during the parties. But it was finals season and when she said she was busy with school, I though it was a little suspicious but I believed her. The next week I was at the parties I would normally see her at, but she wasn’t there. At some point during the night her roommate approached me again and said that “she just wants to be friends”. (I forgot to mention that she was going to school out of state and was going back home for the summer). So I stopped texting her and a week or so later she went back home.

 I thought nothing of it and went back to life as normal, until she hit me up out the blue and congratulated me being accepted into a college. Conversation started back up for a little while, but I didn’t think anything of it and let the conversation die. About a month later she hit me up again. This time she told me about the concert she was at and how I looked exactly like one of the guys in the band. Again conversation was good she asked me questions and we had some banter, but again I didn’t push or force it and let it die. I’ve never heard of anyone in my general age group saying that “they just want to be friends with someone” and then actually keeping in contact with them.

I’m super confused I don’t know if because she was so close to moving back in May that she didin’t want to start anything, or that she was being genuine and actually wants to still be friends. I’m confused, I feel like an idiot for letting this give me anxiety. I just don’t know, and it bugs me. I am clearly overthinking things, but do y’all think there is anything there? Should I just forget about this entire situation?",15Aug2019,2

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‘mines 21st’ and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays...are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

370,So have recently and looking into getting my adoption records. I do this whole process I've had my wife by my side helping me when I needed her to help. I started this process just to find out genetic information about myself since we have a three-year-old kid I want to know if I had a genetic genes that we passed on to him. I have never expressed to my wife about wanting to know about my biological parents and have asked her several times to not look into it because she really wanted to. After several times tell her not to and her promise and not too as well. Find out that she has been searching my biological mother and the way I found out what's her say me a picture of a website possibly showing that my biological mother has been looking for me. I feel completely betrayed by her and very overwhelmed at the same time as I was not ready for this information nor was I actually looking for it. I am unable to talk to my family about it because my adoptive parents are very sensitive about the subject. And I am feeling very overwhelmed with nowhere to turn to. If anyone has any advice I very much appreciate it.,15Aug2019,1
372,"Ok so I just started a new job making decent money and its going pretty well. It's a factory making food products, it's fairly hard work but nothing too mentally daunting. This is my second week on the job, being an idiot I had locked my keys in my car on break today. The locksmith who came to unlock it ended up having a bit of a conversation with me then dropped that he was the owner of the company and that he thinks i would be a good fit. 

The thing is that it's an on call job (24/7) and purely commission(50%). I make roughly 160 a day at my job and 2 to 3 calls would cover that. I wouldn't have benefits and I would be paying for my own gas though it's all tax deductible.

He showed me pay records of one of the employees and it varies week to week. The highest being 2k and the lowest being 900 (avg 1600 weekly) That person is in a different area of Canada. 

The owner said that there should be a lot of demand in the area I live in and that itll be almost impossible to make less than 3k a month (current) and that it would likely be between 4 to 7k a month as a locksmith. 

I'm terrified of several things and could really use any and all help I can get. First, I'm terrified that it's not guaranteed work (he said I'd have to leave my job for this one). Second, there wont be any contributions to employment insurance and taxes wont be deducted (so I'll have to pay it all at the end of the year). Third, if I did try it out and it didnt work then I would be throwing my current job that comes with benefits and normal pay deductions out the window.

I just want to do the best thing I can for myself and for my girlfriend because she deserves the world bit I'm extremely torn at this. I havent spoken with her about it yet as shes at her cottage with her family (I had to work).",15Aug2019,1

377,"I broke up with my SO about a month ago, but things weren't going well for a few months before already. Since a few years back, I have always had the tendency to occasionally fantasize about situations where I am hurt emotionally or I ""die"" and basically that bad things happen to me. I don't know why but I just do it and it's pretty subconscious, I only realized it recently because after the break, I find myself keep imagining scenarios where my ex tells me she hates me or that she shouts at me/screams at me to leave. I feel sad and emotionless at the same time, sometimes I want to cry but I can't so I'm very confused. The thing is I feel like I have a subconscious want to think about these situations where my SO leaves me in a dramatic fashion or that she says hurtful things to me. She was never abusive to me nor was I, and we had a good run

I dont know why I'm doing this but is this normal? I don't know what's wrong with me or what I should do. Should I see a professional? I try and occupy my time with exercise and by meeting friends but I can get these thoughts anywhere, I haven't told any of my friends about this yet though. 

&amp;#x200B;

For context, the break was mutual and non-violent/dramatic and I got out of what I felt was an emotionally draining relationship which made me feel unwanted. It's complicated but we were together for about 7 months this year, and about 7 months last year as well, both separate periods.

380,"One of my friends committed suicide when I was young. I have never coped very well with the situation because I, myself, was dealing with behavioural and emotional development issues. I didn't have very strong relationships with anyone because I put up defensive walls and saw expression, other than anger and humour, as a sign of weakness and vulnerability. 

Super long story, short, in the midst of my own journey, I had a childhood friend pass away. I had no social media and I was very limited with my social outings at the time of her passing. This girl was someone I had contact with, but admittingly, she probably had closer sources. I knew her since we were 4. We were never best friends but we spent time together and I was very conscious of her struggle. She would reach out to me, exchange stories, and was also aware of my struggle.

When she passed I got a phone call, or a text message. I can't remember. Regardless, it tore me. It's been some years now and it has never been something I got closure for. I can't really talk about it, I have done a lot of therapy for personal reasons but this is something that occasionally surfaces and it just crumbles me. I don't really know why, I can't seem to process it.

Last night I was drinking and someone significantly older than me, made a comment that she wasn't THAT significant in my life. In all honestly, I bought up the fact I had lost a friend. I was shocked anyone could say something like that but it also raised super conflicting feelings about my own self validation. I insisted that I didn't like the comment and it would make me cry. They persisted, telling me I wasn't that significant. I cried. The tears just rolled down my face and I completely shut down. ""This is just a teenage reaction"", they said.

I need advice because I do feel super conflicted. I'm aware I wasn't that important, I wasn't a best friend or a relative but I have memories, fond ones. Am I wrong for being upset over this comment? It's true to some extent. Does anyone have a similar experience? Does anyone else struggle with the feeling of overreaction about a death? I need advice and validation.",15Aug2019,0

387,"I love my family, but I am so sick of these vacations and the thought of going on this one literally makes me want to cry. 

Saturday morning we’re going to leave on an EIGHT day trip to fucking Utah and Arizona lol. All I know is that we’re going to see the Grand Canyon and go to Las Vegas. It’s going to be a plane ride over but the rest of it we’ll be in a rental car driving for god knows how long from place to place.

I hate our vacations because it’s never relaxing. It’s exhausting. We’re always doing something and by the end of each day I’m drained. Also I am absolutely DREADING being stuck in a car with my family for hours. Like I love them but I am so sick of them and over the years it feels like I can only handle for short bursts of time now. Definitely not for an 8 day trip.

What’s worse is that I’ve finally started a routine of eating well and working out, and this trip is going to fuck up the habit before it has a chance to really form. And we get back on Sunday, so college starts the next day. I won’t even have a chance to truly relax before school starts because I’ve taken 3 summer classes over the course of the summer and the final for the class I’m taking now is today.

I’m 18 by the way. I want to move out so bad but I won’t be able to until I go to university next year. Again, I love my parents, but they still treat me like and child and it’s making me resent them. I would probably be so much more open to this trip if I didn’t live with them.

I really, really don’t want to go, but I know my Dad would be so upset if I even brought up not going. I hate that I never got a choice or a say in all of this, that it was already decided I was going like I’m still 12 or some shit.

393,"One to two years ago I posted a lot of embarassing (intimate details about myself that I shouldn't have shared but was too socially inept at the time to think was a big deal) and oftentimes very morally questionable (doxing, advocating violence, and signalling sympathy for truly fucked up people. I regret all of this very deeply) things on several Discord servers belonging to my rather niche community of friends and our followers. I dread every day that some of this is going to come back and bite me in the ass to the point where I've lost a lot of sleep trying to figure out what to do if I were confronted with any of this. This past year, I have also started to get to know some great people outside of this community and I know that they are eventually going to find out about these servers, but I do not want them to get the idea that I ever was ever like what you'd expect from a person who posted the kind of things I posted back then. 

&amp;#x200B;

It feels like the only way I can move forward is if I have every single one of my thousands of posts deleted, and I have come up with a plan to do this. I have written up an email that I am planning to send to the Discord staff, telling them basically the same things I have said here, and also show any rule-breaking posts I can dig up to convince them to delete everything I have ever posted, and most importantly, to also get myself verifiably banned to make my friends think that I was not behind this.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem with this is that my friends absolutely detest any kind of loss of information and, knowing them, they would become very pissed off about the fact that I just broke the context of years of conversations if they found out I was behind it. They already know that I am extremely insecure about my past (although I never tell them why or I just give them some bullshit reason) so I don't doubt that the idea would cross their minds. Since I am owner of the ""main"" server in this community, it would be left without an owner and no doubt just kept around as an archive as we start fresh on a new server. At the same time, I feel like removing all this shit would remove a lot of mental blockages that prevent me from talking to them more and thus bring me closer to them again, and also enabling us to further build our community because I wouldn't care about people I know outside of it joining anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I am thus faced with a dilemma that is just absolutely exhausting to think about. If I try to go through with my plan, I risk only hurting myself in the process if I am somehow found out, but I am also letting go of a major source of anxiety and opening the doors on many possibilities. If I choose to leave everything as it is I will keep being anxious about the posts, future plans we have would almost certainly go awry because I'd be too insecure to let in new blood, and could potentially just fall out with them anyway as a result of either because I'd distance myself from them or the posts resurfacing. On virtually all levels it feels like going through with the plan is my best course of action.

&amp;#x200B;

Barely any of the stuff I wrote has ever been brought up again, I suspect because most of it either went over people's heads, was presumed as just a joke, or they don't care enough about some of it and the ones that would have objected never saw it. The one time it actually was brought up, it was for no reason that I can determine and in a rather mocking fashion by a guy who I'm fairly sure respects me for the most part. If I did go through with the plan, the risk that someone is gonna bring any of it up again out of memory is obviously still there, but carries a lot less impact if they can't back it up.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're wondering why I don't just take the time and delete only the offending posts, it is because:

1. I almost always feel too much anxiety to look them up

2. A lot of it is out of my reach because I am either banned from some of the servers or don't have the user priviliges to remove my own posts

3. It would be very easily noticeable because only the contexts of the relevant conversations would be broken.

4. I probably wouldn't find them all, and I want all of it removed

&amp;#x200B;

397,"(Sorry for formatting, I'm on mobile)


This happened yesterday and I don't know what to do. When I got home yesterday I hung out with my sister and her baby. I painted her nails, when the baby started crying. She needed a bottle and my sister asked her boyfriend to do it. 

He said no so she did it. I left to go to my room because I was tired. Now my bedroom doesn't have a bathroom so I went into my moms room to use the bathroom, and when I came out, I heard screaming and banging. My sister rushes into the room with her baby and we lock the door.
 She's crying and the babies crying and she's checking the baby for any marks. 

Then the boyfriend starts knocking on the door, I tell her to not let him in. My sister and him argue and I can tell he's pissed. I didn't see what happened and only heard what happened before she entered the room, but it seems like they got into a fight about how he doesn't help her out and he choked her while she was holding the baby. Then she ran into the room.
 He kept telling her to open the door and he was banging loudly on the door. It was scary, I was terrified he was going to succeed in breaking down the door so I barricaded it with furniture. My sister told him that he's scaring me and to stop and he didn't believe I was in there. He was talking about how I would've thrown a tantrum already (I have asd and have had meltdowns because of it, but I've been working on getting better) He was saying that it's not a big deal that he's doing this because I've had meltdowns before, my sister said that that was a long time ago and that I didn't put anyone in danger, but he's banging on the door and is scaring everyone.

 My sister kept telling him to leave and he kept saying he just wanted to talk about it. He didn't seem to get that when he banged on the doors, threw in these guilt trips, and said stuff like how he wanted kill himself, that we couldn't believe he ""just wanted to talk"" He kept talking about how priveleged my sister is and how his parents were shitty and he was making it seem like it wasn't that big of a deal that my stepdad (and my sisters biological dad) recently died because he had it soo much worse. This especially hurt because yesterday was the first birthday since he passed. He kept saying he had ptsd and that *we* were triggering *him* by locking ourselves in my moms room and that since we can't leave he's going to make us listen to him and how badly he has it. 
While all this was happening I was trying to get in contact with my mom and get her home asap. I was going to call the police but my sister told me not to. (I feel like I made the wrong choice and should've called the police) He said that he was going to leave and that my sister was ""breaking his heart"" and that she was going to wish for him to come back but he'd be gone.
 He went back into my sisters room (he lives in the house rent free and shares a room with my sister) The baby needed a bottle and was crying a lot and so my sister risked it and left the room. I went towards my grandmas room and she was terrified too. I locked all of her doors just in case and then I hear them arguing again. Fortunately my mom comes rushing in and is asking what happened. She goes into their room and sort of mediates the conversation. 

She tells him that what he did wasn't okay, that she didn't know if she should be calling the police and at this point I feel safe enough to leave grandmas room.  I go to my room and fall asleep because of tiredness. I wake up at 11:00 pm (I fell asleep at around 2:00 pm) and I go into my sisters room and she tells me that her boyfriend left and I felt relieved because I thought he was gone for good.  
but later at 2:00 am I go into the kitchen for some water and hear him on the phone with someone. I panic and go back into my room until 6:00 am. At that point I go into my moms room to tell her that he's back and I ask her to do something about it because I'm scared of him. She yells at me asking ""what am I supposed to do??"" and I didn't have an answer. 

I don't feel safe in the house and I'm especially concerned for my neice. She's not even a year old yet. My sister definitely doesn't want me to call the police even after what he's done.

I went home immediately updated my CV and sent it the following morning. I know it's been only two days but I haven't heard anything since yesterday morning. I totally get that she's busy but what is the etiquette on my half here. Do I wait a week to follow up if I don't hear anything? Suggestions?",15Aug2019,2
401,"Hello, 

First of all, I sincerely apologise if this isn't the right subreddit to post this. I tried posting it on r/Turkey but I don't have enough Karma and I need to make a choice soon.

I recently graduated from high school and I'd like to study abroad in Turkey. The major I'm going for Medicine in English. The two universities I narrowed it down to are Bahçeşehir University and Yeditepe University. 

Both these universities are situated in the city or very close to it so the location isn't an issue for either. However, Bahçeşehir University doesn't have their own dorms so I'll have to look for someplace to live close to the university but that isn't too much of a problem.

Yeditepe edges out Bahçeşehir in rankings but the gap isn't that huge.
Bahçeşehir University Ranking: https://www.4icu.org/reviews/4539.htm
Yeditepe University Ranking: https://www.4icu.org/reviews/4602.htm

I do plan on learning Turkish but I'd like to study my major in English. There were other options such as Medipol University that teach in English but I missed the application deadline. If you know any other universities that teach Medicine in English, please let me know.

I have applied to Koç but I most likely to get rejected based on me not hitting the minimum grade requirement in certain external exams.

TL;DR - Bahçeşehir University or Yeditepe University for Medicine in English?",15Aug2019,1

My results haven't been that splendid either and I kinda sucked in the final exams back in May. I'm actually an award-winning public speaker, but my depression and anxiety have also worsened in the past six months. Currently, I really don't feel like going for it at all.

Problem is, I've paid about $300 for the conference, and it's non-refundable. My dad would be upset and start lecturing me about wasting money if I 'wasted it'. Should I still pull out of the conference? I'm honestly swamped and would definitely appreciate advice. Thank you in advance.",15Aug2019,2
405,"Hey Reddit, 

Little background for you.

I’m M 23, we have a lesbian couple who are family friends (29/30). 

They have been looking at having a child together and around 6 months ago whilst out drinking they asked if I would do it. 

Today they have messaged seriously asking if this is something I would do. They do have other options but I am their preference. 

Being only 23 and not wanting to make any rash decisions. Anyone with experience or knowledge in this would be really helpful. 

The knowledge being either what I need to be careful of? What do I need to consider etc. I really don’t know what to think as whilst I am flattered I also have no knowledge on the subject.

Not sure if this is relevant info but personally I have no plan to ever have kids of my own. Really not a fan off them haha. 

Anyway any help would be much appreciated.",15Aug2019,2
407,"For the last two years I haven’t felt quite right. When high school ended I lost contact with everyone I knew apart from my best friend who I hang out with maybe once a month. When I graduated I felt nothing; no relief, no pride, no joy. My 18th birthday (last September) was a forgettable mess. And ever since then it’s felt like I’ve been reliving the same day over and over again. The days keep slipping by and all of a sudden I’m in a 4 year relationship with my high-school girlfriend. I recently started a job and it’s been decent enough, but generally I have no motivation to do anything at all. My girlfriend tries to be supportive and I know for a fact that she loves me, which is comforting. But nobody knows just how empty I feel inside. I can’t keep my head straight on a day to day basis about whether or not I’m even ready to be in a long term relationship, I keep thinking about how in 8 years I’ll be expected to be married and starting a family and based on how my adulthood has been thus far I’ll have experienced nothing. My relationship is ideal but I feel like I’m missing out on life. I miss waking up with a feeling of optimism. I miss ending the day feeling good about a conversation I had. At the same time my girlfriend is the only person I’ve ever been able to talk to about anything. After the initial deep talks however, it feels like it just goes past her head and my feelings get bottled up again.  Speaking about my feelings makes me feel uncomfortable and even with my best friends I can’t force myself to do it.  Im my own worst enemy. I’m incredibly introverted and over the past few years that aspect of myself has only grown. I can’t help but worry If I were on my own I’d only fall deeper into this bottomless pit. I genuinely don’t want to hurt my girlfriend because I know she’s going through the same things as I am. Maybe one day I’ll climb out of this rut. But I worry that if I keep holding onto her for dear life I’ll be regretting it. My parents are no help with my sadness, they don’t understand. My dad observes my quietness and says “what are you depressed? Try being 50 with cancer”. My mom thinks you can just “get over it”. And it feels like I’m going nowhere.",15Aug2019,6

411,"This is my 2nd account for some privacy.

So my girlfriend and I (both in our late teens) passed our 2 year anniversary several months back and I had gotten her a lot of gifts related to any inside-jokes we have. I may have gotten carried away with the gifts and I regret getting a couple of them, but that’s besides the point. 
We couldn’t go on a date since we had exams, and we had to postpone the date till later on.
Long story short, we haven’t gone on that date yet. And I have a huge pile of gifts waiting in my room.
I talked to her about this about a week ago and she said that she can’t go on dates anymore. Her parents don’t know about us, so she doesn’t wanna lie to them, which I totally understand.
I can manage to give her a gift or two when school starts, but I can’t give her the rest unless it’s a date. Again, I got carried away with the gifts and many of them seem childish i.e. children books, stuffed animals or cartoon movie characters, etc. I regret those ones cuz I got them being all excited that I found so many things related to our relationship, but now I realize that they’re probably bad gifts.
My parents have been asking me often when I’ll give her the gifts, and the room is pretty unorganized because of the huge pile of gifts. 
I’ve been thinking about anonymously and accidentally “forgetting” the gifts at a cool coffee shop I know of around Christmas maybe, with a note saying “Give these away on Christmas, or take what you want from them”.
Is this a good idea? What else could I do?

Note: 
•I don’t really wanna tell my parents that I won’t be giving her the gifts so they don’t tell me that I wasted my money.
•I can’t drive anywhere yet, if that may help clear things up.",15Aug2019,1

I am afraid that these boomers will start more wars.

I am scared that civilization will collapse and all that I worked for will vanish.

I am scared of the environment getting destroyed heavily and get repaired minimally. For every tree planted, a thousand die from logging.

I fear that everything will get congested, and that there will be little space enough for everybody.

I can't handle the day that the world will run out of food.

I'm losing hope in the future. I no longer believe in a future.

413,"Hello, I cannot complete simple day-to-day tasks anymore without crying, feeling upset/depressed or simply wanting to end my life. I have felt like my life has been controlling me more than I have been controlling my life for the past few years and everything that has led up to this moment is from me not trying hard enough for myself, having little/no motivation or simply not caring about it. In my brain, I do not know how to fix this and become a healthy person - I have lost everything I had and was striving towards and I cannot stop thinking how much I have fucked up and how scared it makes me for my own future.  


I failed my degree, I lost my girlfriend, I am in debt to my girlfriend and bank, I am living back at my broken family home which is filthy and messy to the point of disbelief, I have no money, I have developed anxiety, and honestly nobody close to me ever really listens to what I have to say or can help me. I was actually healthy years ago, now I barely eat, I barely shower and I just straight up hate myself. My girlfriend truly went beyond for me, and for us, but I just was not strong enough.  


I failed my degree: I spent a lot of time in my final year of university working for money and smoking weed, so much so that I didn't hit my deadlines.  


I lost my girlfriend: Over the course of our relationship she helped me out finanacially, we moved into a flat together and after 1-2 months she successfully found a suitable job. I was also looking for a 'suitable' job but it took as long as 9 months to get the role I was looking for - by this time my girlfriend had covered thousands in rent for me. I lost the job just after a month - I had stomach issues on a date they wanted to train me, I had to miss this and my position became 'untenable' after that. After thinking we had got the ball rolling for me to lose my job after a month, we broke up shortly after this  


I am in debt: I am in thousands of debt to my ex-girlfriend, and I have a graduate account which is stuck in a maxed-out overdraft (becomes interest free in a fortnight, wew)  


I am back in my broken family home: throughout my life the state of my family home has just slowly declined. I am 24 now, my Father died when I was 5 and my Brother was jailed for 4 years in 2011, which caused my Mother's side of the family to fall out(?) which I believe has caused issues for my Mum. We have two cats who have been trained, but that training has fallen off over the years and now they just climb and shit everywhere, it is very depressing to be around and I haven't ever felt confident bringing anybody to my family house due to this factor alone.  


I have my own PC which I spend a lot of time on, I spend a lot of time on this as its 'home' to me. I can go on my PC and get away from anything that is happening in the real world - I have always used my PC as a getaway and as for comfort. Whenever anything personally gets rough for me I have always just gone back to my PC and played games and I'm at a stage where I hate it and I hate what I have become because of it all. When my Brother went to jail I tried to hide it as well as I could and just stayed indoors and played RuneScape. I think back to it now and it really upsetting, but it is something I feel I need to really give up. I don't know, I'm so lost.  


I have no money: I am at a very difficult point in my life, as I am so broke that I cannot do simple things. Worse yet, I cannot enjoy simpler things. I currently have dental issues which need addressing - I am permenantly stressed over money.  


I have developed anxiety: I get heart attack-like pains in my chest, loads of movement in my stomach, and the left side of my stomach sometimes feels very tight or like it is being pusdhed hard by something else internally. The chest issue had gotten really bad before where I haven't been able to breathe or sleep properly for weeks/months. I have been checked up at a hospital with multiple scans and the state of my organs are perfect for somebody my age.   


So, I had a huge crush on my now-ex girlfriend, I had imagined and spoke with her about all that we could do together, I got with her and I was just financially and mentally struggling through the entire thing. Now I've completely lost her. It's honestly fucking laughable how I managed to fuck so much up in the space of 3 years. I have tried writing a post like this about 4-5 times in the past, even when I was with my now-ex girlfriend, but I never posted. I always find myself in a situation where I have tears streaming down my face and I just naturally start writing a post on this sub-Reddit, but this time I think I really need to post about it. I'm just finally at a point where I truly do not know how I recover from this and I do not know how to move on from this.  


Any comforting words or advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you.",15Aug2019,1
414,"So my niece and her brothers has been spending their summer at my house. This summer has been a struggle since we have to keep tract of them and let's just say that these kids are really troubled. From getting into fights at school to destroying others (sometimes their own) possessions.
But kids are kids as they say...until this happened. 
So I am the only person in the house that has their own room. And one day my niece says she wants to sleep in my room because everywhere else in the house is loud. So I let her come on my bed. She was at first just lying next to me watching me play my phone game until I noticed that she kissed my cheek. I ignored that action because it was on the cheek and family members kiss each other on the cheek all the time. So I continued to ignore her until she put her hands on my face to make me look at her. That when she tried to kiss me on the lips and I instinctively covered my mouth with my hand preventing her lips from connecting. 
She then says ""Why did you do that?"" 
I responded with, ""Family does not kiss each other on the lips.""
She then wrapped her arms and legs around me trying to kiss me again while do a motion with her hips... (you can guess what I am insinuating) 
I pushed her off and yelled this at her:""You better stop before I tell your mom what you were just doing."" I was going to report it anyways but I mainly said it to see her reaction. Once I said it she instantly stopped, which means she knows what she did was wrong. She then said, ""Fine...Don't tell..."" and ran out my room. I left my room to see where she went and I saw her hanging on her mother. My mother was coming into my room to discuss something with me but I kind of cut her off because I felt what I had to say was more important. I told her the situation then my mom told her mother. Her mother started to question her and she started to cry trying to avoid answering her questions which resulted in her getting hit on her butt.
Nothing happened since then until yesterday when she came into my room and onto my bed. At the time I was packing for college so I didn't pay her any attention. It has been at least two weeks since the first incident so I kind of let my guard down but not that much. So I was playing with her by tossing my ball of socks back and forth with her. I played with her a little bit more then told that's enough and packed the socks in my luggage. I then yawned and said that I was tired. She then laid in the center of my bed and said, ""I want you to lay on top of me. I want to feel good."" 
I immediately told her to get out my room and she ran out. I haven't reported this incident yet and obviously telling her what she was doing was bad isn't working either. I have been closely monitoring her since the first incident around her brothers (my nephews) and she does not exhibit signs of sexual behavior towards them. She doesn't even do it with any of the other teens/adults in the house. Which probably means that someone in my SIL's (her mom is my SIL) family may be the cause of her behavior and I hardly know anyone on her side of the family. I need advice how to teach to a 3yr old girl that what she is doing is wrong and that she shouldn't do it anymore. I feel like even if that person whoever caused this behavior is out of the picture (which I feel like is another child), my niece's sexual behavior is not going to stop. Any advice how to make her stop for good? 
P.s. - I am not sure why she targeted me other than having my own room, allowing her to be more secretive with her actions. 
(I am hoping that there won't be anyone who says stuff like, ""she's just 3 what would she know?"" My niece acts too smart and independent for her own age and only acts like baby if the situation suits her - such as throwing a tantrum when toward to clean up her toys when she is in trouble one minute or her quietly cleaning up while singing the clean up song.) I really need advice....",15Aug2019,2
415,"So, I have a new-ish job and the manager offered everyone up the opportunity to choose their 3-week work cycle ""dream schedule."" Meaning, ""in an ideal world, I work Sunday Monday Wednesday, then next week these days, etc."" Non-office job, so we have 1 weekend to work that's already decided for us. Well, we get an email yesterday from our manager like ""well guys, I couldn't make it work, figure out a way for 4 people to be on each day, I keep seniority in mind."" Within 2 days she wants this figured out, but we won't all see each other and we are only scheduling ourselves as individuals. 

I handed mine back in under the manager's door and said ""whatever works, I like my current schedule though, can I just be this 1 Sunday different."" Well, I get a text in the middle of the night from a coworker like ""did you hand yours in?"" I said yes. The coworker then proceeds to suggest how I change my work cycle. (Just her in a text to me, not like a group chat). I told her I handed mine in. I honestly didn't like her suggestion, and I feel like it's not her personal job to try scheduling me. She then tries to tell me again a different way I could make my schedule. I went away from my phone for a bit and now I don't know how to reply to her and I'm off for a few days. The manager is sort of putting her work on us, so I understand this coworker wanting to ""figure stuff out,"" but she is notorious for loving having many days off in a row. And I don't want to be a pushover to another coworker, I'd be more comfortable with the manager having my suggestion and doing with it what she will. Worthy of note, I like this job and want to be amicable, but not a pushover to suggestions that I dislike. I also don't like her deciding about me, it's not like a group discussion or open discussion. I don't want to just not reply then see her in person and be awkward?

417,"Hi, OK so some background/context: my sister has always had issues with communication with other people, she is incredibly rude and short, almost always wakes up in a bad mood and thinks that anything anyone says to her or around her is a comment aimed at criticizing her in some way. Both of us go to the same university and we've just moved into an apartment together because of our family circumstances (at the end of 2018 my father was diagnosed with a terminal cancer that he will die from in the coming months/years. We are living together as its what my father wants/it also saves money). The way my sister behaves towards me and our family hasn't changed since then, shes always acted this way. But now that we are living alone together I find her behaviour almost impossible to deal with as its only the two of us every single day. She locks herself in her room all day, doesn't come out, doesn't ask basic questions of socialising e.g. how was your class/morning/sleep blah blah blah. She has no interest in my life or I believe anyone else's life and as far as I can see cannot empathise or see past anything that doesn't immediately affect her. She doesn't care about being clean or cleaning but will get angry at me if I leave her plates out of the dishwasher (that I will invariably stack and unstack by myself every day). She believes that her doing one 'chore' such as stacking the dishwasher with her own plates and leaving out anything a cup/ spoon or whatever that I use is enough to get her out of doing anything else. She is incredibly rude to me in public and in private including in front of my friends which I find really embarrassing as I know they are all shocked at the way she speaks to me. 

My problem is that I am a very empathetic person and as much as I try not to care about her I can't help it. I worry about her and the anger she holds inside. She is so full of anger and discontent and I don't want her to hold that inside her whole life. I've suggested therapy (which she knows I go to myself) but she sees this suggestion as another attack on her that she isn't good enough. I've talked to her more times than I can count about her behaviour and tried to help her but nothing changes it. I've come to the conclusion that she is just a miserable person who will always be mad at the world (despite the fact she has been handed everything). I want to stress that this behaviour is not a result of my father's diagnosis, she was like this long before however, the diagnosis is what makes it difficult as I cannot talk to them about it anymore. My father finds any hint of a 'fight' between us incredibly distressing and its honestly just another thing that my parents don't need to be worrying about right now. Additionally, in a sort of weird self-fulfilling prophesy where she thinks everything I've ever said is a criticism she has made me start to hate her to the point where I actually *don't* have anything but negative thoughts and critiques about her.

I don't even know what I'm asking for here really? Some outside perspective perhaps... just some advice on how to get through the days living with someone who appears to actively hate me until I have an excuse to live elsewhere without it upsetting the applecart...",15Aug2019,7

420,"TLDR: Title sums it up. 

His love was unconditional &amp; I essentially put the weight of my world on his shoulders. He was happy to take it on to lighten my load, but after an especially hard time in both our lives it ended up breaking him. As a result we reluctantly went our separate ways. Since February my life has been void of his being yet the fire of our love is still burning inside me and nothing has been able to put it out. I long for him in ways I can't even put into words. For months my world has felt different and unfamiliar. I still feel happy sometimes, but nothing gives me that euphoric feeling like he did. Not even drugs. I think what makes it so hard is that we really are meant for each other, but it just can't work in the circustances we are in. I guess the silver lining in all of this is that I got to expirence a love like never before with a one of a kind human being.

But the way he acts toward me is so much different and everyone sees that.  He says all these sweet things and treats me good. So here is the problem. I started to develop feelings for this “fuck boy” like really bad but my “best friend” doesn’t like him at all and vice versa. She tells me that she thinks he is a using me, playing with my emotions and only wants me for sex. And he says about her that she is fake, evil and selfish. And here i am stuck in the middle. I hear both of them and lowkey believe both of them. my “ best friend” is selfish and fake. and the “fuck boy” is playing with my emotions.  
But there’s more! 

so apparently my “best friend” and “fuck boy” had a small thing before I came. And everyone including him thinks that she is just jealous and salty that I get more of his attention. That he takes me on dates and didn’t really do any of that with her. So like.....? i dunno. I’m kind of stepping back from both of them!

423,"I work in an office and my work involves a decent amount of collaboration with others. I started a new project so I work with this one coworker who although he's not technically a manager/boss, he can come off demanding or bossy, I think he likes the feeling of authority and that's fine. He's good at what he does so I don't mind taking direction from him since I'm new to the project and I'm still learning. 

The issue is when he gets angry, he starts cursing (not necessarily AT someone) or just generally being combative and creates an atmosphere of tension. For example, we were in a meeting that was 2 hours long, and about halfway through he says to the host of the meeting ""We don't have time for this. Do you even know what you're doing? there's no reason for us to discuss in detail because we're only on the second point and we only have an hour left."" Although he did bring up a good point, my issue was how he attacked the person. I would have said ""guys we are halfway through the meeting and haven't covered half of what we were supposed to, so lets think high level and we can work out the details later."" it gets he point across without attacking anyone. Recently, we were working together on something with 2 other people and the thing we were working on wasn't working and he says ""Why is nothing working? Do I give a shit about this \*points to item on the desk\* no. Move it somewhere else"" I do feel a tad disrespected because from then on everybody including myself were just silently taking commands. I know I'm not being overly sensitive because there is a definite change in the atmosphere, people become quiet like we're walking on egg shells trying not to blow him up. Which I hate. How hard is it to say ""The table is too cluttered. Lets move the things we're not using out of the way.""

I want to know how I myself can can to him without attacking him when he gets like this so that he knows to at least maintain a certain level of decency towards others.

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‘mines 21st’ and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays...are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

427,"A week ago, my close friend broke up with his girlfriend, and i end up going to his house for 2 days to comfort him. I patted his back, give him hugs, hold his hands, basically things that would let him know that I'm here for him. It might sound normal and all but I'm a girl and was raised in a traditional family (dont go to guys room, dont do physical contact) and all that. I've never even had a boyfriend, and i had a history of sexual harassment that there was a time that im scared of guys. But still i know that he needs me so i got over my anxiety and went to his house to comfort him (nothing bad happened). The first day i stayed for around 6hrs (left at around 9.30pm) and the second day is another 5 hours (left around 7pm). It's not that long but it still felt as a big deal for me because that's like the first time i went over to a guy's house, so i would be lying if i werent scared.

After that i spent another 2 days to go out with him again to comfort him, the first day going bowling, something he liked to do and the second i invited him for lunch and movies. I've been going out with him to take pictures (we're both in the photography club) since last spring and have grown closer and all that. There's still some distance prob since we're of different sexes, but i was the first one to know when he confessed to his ex, when she said yes, and about their relationships. So i feel like I'm his closest friend.

I know that he's been pretty addicted with his phone, like he's always on it. But since we mostly go out to take pictures, he doesn't 100% open his phones. But last weekend when we went out to see a movie, he literally always on his phone. And i would be okay if he were texting someone or reading an article, but he was just... Refreshing instagram.

I felt like I'm not seen, like he doesnt want to go out with me when the reason why i invited him to go out is because he told me that he's lonely since he broke up with his gf. I'm someone who only open my phone like occasionally, mostly to check if i have a notification and all that, but when I'm having a meal with someone i dont open my phone because i was taught that its rude and meal times are kinda like the time to talk with the person. But then we were having lunch and i put my phone away and he just... Refreshes his instagram.

It felt upsetting to me. And i keep feeling like he doesnt want to be go out with me and all that. I told him that he opens Instagram too much but he just said ""instagram is my drug"" like... Wtf? I invited you because you said that you're lonely.

I'm so upset and angry that i vented on my second ig account and my friends told me to stop hanging out with someone like them...
Last night someone confessed to me and i texted him but he was asleep so he replied in the morning, and i told him that ""he said he knows that i dont like him but just want me to know"" and all he said in reply was
""Oh ok""
It makes me feel like he's not listening to me.

I feel like a terrible friend for wanting him to care for me like the way i cared for him. Right now i feel like he doesnt even want to be friends with me anymore. And idek if this is because im a girl and he's a guy.

I dont know what to do, right now i just am not inviting him to things because I've been doing the inviting (with the exception of when it was his birthday) and so i feel like he doesn't even want to hang out with me. Besides i dont mind hanging out alone. 

Should i stop being friends with him? I dont have any other friends though... Am i a terrible friend to want him to care or respond in a way that makes me feel like I'm being listened? What should i do?",15Aug2019,2

I'm not really sure how to address it since I'm so sure he'll deflect with ""I'm married"" and I'd rather shut him down in a way that doesn't seem like there's any foul play/create a toxic situation for myself because he feels like I'm trying to undermine him...",15Aug2019,1
432,"Hi everyone, hope you are having a good day! I would love your advice on the following matter:

I have a friend whom I’ve known for quite a while now, but I’m beginning to question our friendship. We’re both rising seniors in high school, and have been friends for a good amount of time. However, I feel distant from him and am not sure if it’s my fault. These are some observations I made:

\-Whenever he does something stupid or acts dumb, I take it in good humor. But when do something similar, he tells me to stfu or something (he is bigger than me physically so I’m not sure if it’s some weird complex he has)

\-I send him a bunch of homework, and he doesn’t really reciprocate. Like when I ask him for something he’ll say no lol and just not do it.

\-His interests aren’t really the same as mine. He’s into girls and all that jazz, but I’m not. This often leads to a gap in our conversations.

I know it seems like our friendship is bad, but at certain times our friendship does shine through. We’ve had moments where we’ve talked about stuff that we haven’t told other ppl, and I walk away knowing I have a friend. Other times though I feel like a piece of shit cause of what I described above, and am not sure if I’m doing something wrong. Would appreciate any help, and thanks!",15Aug2019,1
433,"Me and my bf met online in a chat service and have been long distance dating. Recently he visited for the first time, and the second he saw me he wouldnt get off of me and would repeatedly undermine my attempts to get him to slow down with the touching. As a girl Im a lot less strong. When I asked him to slow down he used some post hypnotic triggers and conditioning (part of the kinkplay we do) to get me to calm down and stop resisting his efforts. 

I constantly asked him to slow down, I tensed up, and I even resisted him a few times but I didnt say no until after I had gone to the bathroom and he had gone way to far and even then he asked for more and I freaked out. We tried to get though the weekend normally after that and seeing him being himself gave me hope that we could move on. We had a healtheir sexual experience before he left and I felt like he understood what he did wrong and that we could move past it.

Then, on the day after hes left he texts me and says he didnt feel comfortable with how I acted around him when he was ""sad."" The way he expresses sad is a blank cold stare and a single utterance of ""I feel sad."" I know what moment hes ttalking about and because I was still trying to figure out if we could move past what had happened or not it was difficult to look at him, esspecially with what I read as potentially anger because of how neutral his expression was. 

He has said in the past that he was sexually abused as a child, so I assumed he understood why I was still uncomfortable around him, but it feels like he still doesnt understand why what he did was wrong. While this is the first time physically he has made me uncomfortable without my consent this is not by far the first time, and I feel like after this lack of understandingg regardless of how many times I try to explain it to him hes going to do it again.

This was the first time I had met him in person and this experience left me afraid and uncomfortable and ashamed, and even though I thought we could move past what he said afterward made me feel like theres nothing I can do. Should I break up with him?",15Aug2019,1
434,"So at my retail store there is always so much gossip and backstabbing. Nothing gets resolved or figured out because nobody has the balls to confront each other with questions or issues.

435,"Now I'm no expert but I'm pretty sure she is only doing the cutting because she wants attention and not because she's depressed. But I'm no expert so I could be wrong. I am not here to poke at people who have depression and go through the problems. 

So some backstory, my family is an asian family, my sister is a typical teenage girl who has to attend school, she does not have a job so my parents pay for my sister's phone subscription as they do for me and my other sibling. At least until we all get a job and support ourselves. Because she is the youngest her subscription is the lowest with 6 gb of data that resets each month. Using more than that per month would include a $10 fee for each gb. My sister does not have the greatest of self control and has constantly gone over this limit. One month reaching an additional 14gb of usage. Usually when that happens, my parents would confiscate her phone and ground her. But I decided to help her out. She claims she does not have friends in school and that the only source of friends she has is on an app called Amino which I am familiar with but my parents are not. She does have friends in school albeit younger than her by a year. The people in her class aren't her friends because my sister took to heart the lesson of being yourself and told people to shove off because she was different before even really introducing herself. All of these are another problem but I honestly still don't know all the details since she does not want to open up about it to me so I have to leave that situation there for now. But this situation would end up with her cutting herself on the top of her arm where everyone can see and my mum would get a notification about this from her teacher in school. 

I talked to a friend who used to cut herself for advice. My friend suggested that I support her and be patient with her. I knew that she would want her friends so I persuaded my parents to let me put some restrictions on her phone so that she could still use the amino and whatever she wanted but only during a set time during the day. But the immediate hour after my sister deleted all the restrictions and went back to using her phone. Initially my mum wanted to use those apps that tracked what she does and to stalk her. But I knew they would freak out if they knew what Amino was. My parents are Asian boomers generation. Which meant that they still think the internet is full of pedophiles and creepy dudes. (of course they still believe in the facebook rubbish articles they see everyday so of course they do) Which of course there still probably are but they are a minority. Every time I tried to put a new restriction or notifications for her they were either deleted or promptly ignored. It got so bad that the only way I could save her phone from being confiscated was that I let my mum delete Amino. My sister has not been taking it well. I did tell her that she can use the browser one but for some reason she does not believe me when I told her that so I just left her to it. The main reason I had to let that happen was that most of the data was being used on this app. The others that were just under included instagram and some fanfiction app. We thought that was it.

Last month my mother could no longer take it after deleting amino and used a tracking data app which was not as bad as the other options. We all thought my sister would learn now that my mum could watch her data usage. But just yesterday, she managed to go over the limit. She had been given a warning the day before that she was about to hit the limit. So yesterday her phone was confiscated yet again. This time there was nothing I could do to help. So when I heard my mum screaming into the phone telling my sister off before she came home, I took every blade that I owned and hid them. But today about an hour after my dad dropped her off ( I was in that car ride as well), her teacher contacted my mum with fresh cuts she had done to the top of her arm. Where does she find those blades.

I can only be 50% sure someone is telling her that this was a good way to get attention. And I am sad to say that my patience for my own sister is starting to run really thin. No matter what I try she does not care. No matter what I do she thinks im not trust worthy enough to tell me her problem.  Tonight I want to check for blades and hide them before I go to bed. But this is all I can do to keep myself from screaming at her. I know its wrong to want to scream some sense into her but I doubt that will even work. After all of this the only thing I can say for certain is that my own sister does not think any of this is her fault. I don't know how to make her understand that she went over the line. That she broke the rules. My parents may be strict but I don't think they want her to hurt herself either. She barely listens to me. And right now Im at a lost for what i can do for her anymore.

436,"Hi im not sure if this is the write place to ask this, and I would like to specify that if the topic of sexual assault does make you uncomfortable please don't read this.

Long story short, my friend was dating a girl for about a month, who was completely taking advantage of him through his depression, using him to get her things she wanted and it was overall a really toxic relationship for him. She quickly dumped him after he stopped wanting to fund everything she wanted and is now making false rape allegations against him, with him recently turning 18 i'm really scared that something bad could happen and Im looking for advice to give to him incase things do go haywire.

I apologize if updates aren't allowed, I messaged the mods and got no response so I'm just going to ask for forgiveness instead of permission.

Some helpful people suggested I contact my local version of the Big Brother program, and they were happy to help me out getting everything official and less sketchy, although they needed her guardian's permission first. On my part I needed to get a background check from the police.

I sat down with her and explained what I was planning, and she seemed excited. I was a bit worried about what would happen when I asked to contact her parents as previous attempts had not been successful, but she gave me their phone number, and we got to chatting about the fun things we could do outside of just playing tennis.

I gave her mother a call the next day and explained who I was, how I knew her daughter and why I thought it would be a good idea for me to become her Big Brother. Her mother seemed very weirded out, understandably, but over all pretty nice. We agreed that I would drive her home the next time we played tennis so we could meet in person.

The day came and after kicking her ass (my forehand is mint boi), we hopped in the car and headed to her place. Her mother was just as I imagined from speaking on the phone, a completely normal human being. Her father however was a different story. If I say he was creepy it implies something sexual, but I don't mean creepy in that way. He had almost no emotions, he smiled when he first saw me, but it was not a normal smile. If I said something funny and he would laugh, but it was like a robot might laugh. Very fucking bizarre dude, just something off about him. Overall though I thought our meeting went well, they just asked that I wait until I got my background check before I did anything other than play tennis with her which is super reasonable and I'm actually glad they weren't willing to sign their kid up to some strange dude without it.

I went home and was super happy with how everything went. I was a tad worried her house was going to be some shit-hole and her parents were going to be druggies, but my fears were thankfully unfounded. A few days went past, and I was chillin', when I got a knock on the door. I open it and 3 cops are standing there looking too happy to see me. They ask me to come down to the station for an interview about the girl, although they tell me I'm not being arrested and it is voluntary. I may come across as naive in my last post, but even I can see that I need a fucking lawyer, so I tell them I'll meet with them when the time suits me.

After frantically Googling around for a lawyer, I find one who seems to be competent. He rings the police station and asks what they want to interview me about, but they are tight-lipped and only let on that it's about me hanging out with the kid. I speak to my lawyer for a bit and despite his hesitation, I agree to meet with the police and try and explain whats going on. I bring with me as much evidence as I can, my call logs to child services (surprisingly difficult to request that where I live annoyingly), my correspondences with the Big Brother people, I even printed off my Reddit post. Anything to make me look like the upstanding person I am.

The interview was nice, when I started laying out evidence of my good-intent they were surprisingly accepting of it. The fact that I had made multiple calls to child services went a long way to convincing them I meant no harm. There were a couple of things that irked me though, and I don't know if they will ever stop irking me. I overheard the police multiple times say ""he's not the guy"". The way they said it implied they were still looking for someone after me. The next thing that irked me was one of the officers told me that the reason he didn't think it was me was because ""when she texted you and said her boobs were sore, you didn't engage."" I've read through our text messages 3 times now looking for anything vaguely similar to that sentiment and I'm coming up with zip. I mean, I know nothing would turn up because I have never talked to a kid about their boobs in my life, but still I've triple checked.

I've thought it over and over in my mind, and the only conclusion I can make is that I was not the only man she was interacting with. I can't think of anything else. Why else would the police imply they'll keep looking for someone after clearing me? And then to bring up a conversation that never happened? He must've confused my convos with someone else's. At least if she has been interacting with other people in inappropriate ways the police are involved and they can catch the guy, but sure as shit I'm not speaking to her ever again.

Thank you to everyone for their advice, it definitely was inappropriate of me to be hanging out with her alone and I'm glad you guys told me so. My background check came in the mail today and so I think I will still go ahead with signing up with the Big Brother program, but it will be with a random kid and more importantly with their parents permission.",15Aug2019,1848
439,"Its sad that this is my second post ever on reddit but it is what it is. Im a very honest and direct guy which means that i always get myself into sticky situations by saying stuff i didnt think through properly. Im currently on vacation with my parents and from Day 1 my dad has been complaining about how he doesnt like anything about this place. Meaning that every 5-10 minutes or so my parents start arguing. They always play it of as only discussing stuff but its really annoying. Yesterday at dinner i was annoyed by how even at the dinner table they were still arguing about some stupid stuff. Im a complete idiot for my next move and i regret saying anything at all. My father can be an asshole at times. So when i heard him starting an argument and their conversation and what they were arguing about, i just bursted out: ""Fuck you guys with your stupid arguing"" which thinking back to it is making me cringe.

440,"Obligatory, I’m on mobile, sorry for crappy spelling

So for a bit of context, I’ve known my Friend, K since I was very young, around 10+, I soon after met X, and T. As soon as I went to Secondary school, we were all separated into  different classes,me and X being in NA ,K bring in express,after being in the same class for 3 years. Just for a little context, the way it works where I’m from is basically we have 3 “streams” Express, Normal academic, Normal technical, “best” being first and worst being last. It’s kind of a touchy subject where I’m from so to keep it simple,  when you’re 12 you do a major national exam to decide which stream you go to in secondary school, once you’re in secondary school,if you score poorly in express you go to NA, if you score badly in NA you go NT.  Me and X through out our secondary one were in NA, while my K was in Express, we all looked up to him as he was the only one in our group of friends who we saw wasn’t as dumb as us. 

Over the course of Sec 1, he failed miserably and went to NA Sec 2, bummer, but it’s ok. So he got put in the same class as X, while I was still in another class. Cut to the present, finally we are all in the same class. He has changed a lot since I last saw him, apparently now smokes, is now best friends with X’s EX, which makes it awkward for all of us. He got so drunk at a party I hosted that he took about a hundred photos of the ceiling fan and was genuinely dying of laughter. Keep in mind we were all underage. He frequently just runs out of his house to go and meet with X’s ex, who we’ll call E, and has driven his divorced mother to call him an embarrassment, and also said that she hates him, promptly kicking him out of the house, to which he doesn’t seem to care all that much, usually returning home after a few days. Immediately afterwards, he just proceeded to go get a drink, and a pack of smokes, and of course meet with E. He milks his Father for money when all he does his yearn for his affection and love. It kills me to see what he’s doing, X insists that I just let it go and let him do whatever he wants, it’s his life after all, but I feel like something has to be done. I’ve known him for a good part of my life and can’t see him suffer with shitty results, living in a shitty house just waiting for his parents to die eventually to get their cash. He wastes his life moping around Void Decks and loitering around smoking in public. He has several police cases and a 6month probation has been turned into a 13 month because of his shitty attitude, and mostly just smoking and barely hiding it. 

What should I do? I’ve tried telling him nicely before but that’s before he got kicked out, and never has he ever shown this little care or concern for his life. He’s my Friend and I want what’s best for him. What should I do to help?",15Aug2019,7
441,"So I might have a job! Yay! This is with a fairly large company in my area. They cover a wiiiiide range of job positions.

I’ve never done a phone interview and I believe it’ll be HR conducting the interview.... it’s only for a server position which I find a bit odd, but okay.

For the past month, I’ve been only eating a meal a day or less. So around 500-800 calories a day. For the past 2 weeks, everyday I’ve been weighing myself to check if I’ve lost weight.

446,"Hey guys,

I need a little advice. The short of it is that I'm an early 20's dude looking to move out of my parents house. I found a place that ticks all the boxes, plus a few that I didn't really expect to be ticked in my price range. The timing was awful though; I'd just paid the registration on all of my cars, paid off my credit card bill and spent a large amount of money on furniature. So basically I looked like I had barely enough to cover the bond. Pay day was only a few days away. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I inspected this place and the agent told me that since I have no prior rental history I'd need to submit a proof of balance, and that the rental agency needed to be able to tell the landlord that I could afford rent. Anyway, I submitted my application that day, with a note saying that I would submit proof of balance in 2 days, due to my pay being fortnightly and having paid several large bills. 2 days later I sent the proof of balance. I never hear back from them, and it's been almost 2 weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd really like to follow up. How do you guys think I should go about it? I don't want to seem desperate, but I really like this place. Should I contact the agent, or the agency's email addresswhere the application is sent? Should I call or email?

450,"I am currently studying Biology in pre-university, a subject in which I am passionate in, however my lecturer's attitude is really messing me up (skip to last paragraph if ya don't wanna sit through a full-on rant)

It has become apparent a few months into our course that she has labelled students as either ""smart"" or ""stupid"" ones. I say this in inverted commas as the ""smart"" ones are those who are already naturally gifted, needing little to no guidance in order to obtain good grades. On the other hand, the ""stupid"" ones, which is the majority of the class, including myself, aren't inherently idiots, just not gifted by the gods with super-rare Einstein level intelligence. So basically, we're normal students, passionate nevertheless, that will obviously have more difficulty in the course than the totally awesome students. This group of students becomes the target of her behavior below.

She gives a very obvious look of disdain and superiority when a student  isn't able to answer her ""easy"" questions (her subjective opinion) correctly or when someone can't get the hang of the lesson. She gives embarrassing, degrading, completely unnecessary, snide remarks to students, in front of the ENTIRE class.
Examples are : 
-""Have you not been studying?"" Said sarcastically, when one student gave an answer, slightly inaccurate, to a question she had asked
-""You'd better start studying."" Said in a degrading fashion, same context as above
-""This is why you got a C in the last exam."" This statement was particularly hurtful as it had been said to an older student that had redone the course twice, was ultimately very hardworking, but couldn't understand the topic as he had approached it from a wrong angle (mind you this was said to him in front of an entire class of students that were at least 2 years younger). 

Directly calling her students dumb. Once when retelling a story on how she was quizzed by her superiors, as her students' grades over the past few years seemed to be slipping, she responded with ""I can teach them, but I can't control the type of genes they inherit"". It sounds to be a cynical joke, but paired with her attitude and treatment towards her students thus far, it was just downright derogatory.

She has been confronted by former students regarding her attitude (she told us this herself but does not believe what they say), then seeks opinions regarding the matter of her attitude from the ""smart"" students, who are not targeted by her behaviour, and they reassure her that there is nothing wrong with her and she is a wonderful teacher. It sickens me.

 I despise her as I find her behaviour to be unreasonable and unwelcoming as a teacher, and I try not to let it phase me, but it still does. To others it might seem like a small issue, but the effects has really started to add up as time progressed. It has started to affect my emotional wellbeing, as I feel that I am unworthy of being in the class as the standard of those ""smart"" students feels more and more unattainable. Makes matters worse that I have to see her every day. My feelings towards her has tarnished my passion in the subject, as when I study, I am reminded of her. When I do not understand a lesson, I have to meet her to seek help. The cycle of events just keeps on associating her with my studies.

452,"Hi! First post here. I live in an apartment building with many units (formerly a factory). I have lived here with no conflicts with neighbors for 4 years and live with quite a few people. Four of us smoke cigarettes, but none of us have ever smoked inside and it's unanimous among us that it is just better to avoid problems of odor by smoking outside. Recently, we have been getting notes taped to our door, every day and with poor spelling and grammar, harassing us to stop smoking inside our apartment. The note-leaver is making an effort to remain anonymous and it is clear by the notes that they frequent our door to SMELL IT before accusing us wrongfully. We have left responses strongly denying the accusation, but only get other notes explaining that we are gross and lying about not smoking in our apartment. The ironic part is, the building ALLOWS SMOKING INSIDE, but we CHOOSE NOT TO. How can i shut this person up, when they are not willing to identify themselves and are 100% CERTAIN that it is specifically us, ""causing their apartment to smell bad""??? I wish I knew a way to get them to accidentally identify who they are and to embarass them enough to leave us alone. Thanks in advance for any help; I very much appreciate it.",15Aug2019,10

454,"I am not sure where I should post this. This is my first post as well. 
Here’s a little back story. 
I have always been a girl with some extra meat on her bones. There was never too much of a time when I was all that small. 
My boyfriend and I have been together for almost five years. At the start of our relationship I told to him that if we can sit down and have a serious talk about marriage, in my eyes, that mean you aren’t committed to me and I need to move on because I don’t want to waste my time on someone who can’t talk about marriage or commitment. We have expressed in the past “our types” to each other. Mine being someone with a great personality and some looks. His being someone that isn’t too small or too big. 
Recently I have been gaining weight, despite my efforts to lose weight. I’m having a hard time staying focused and motivated but I am still trying. I take walks, go to the gym every now and then, and try to watch what I eat. 
He has not been shy about expressing how he wishes I was smaller. And lately, I feel like he has been holding it over my head. When I would mention the fact that it’s about to be five years and we should seriously talk about marriage he says things like “Well, you know how I feel, just don’t turn into a whale”. When he says things like that it hurts my feelings and I shut down for the rest of the day and don’t want to talk. My feelings get hurt.
Am I being too sensitive, even though I know his type, and I am starting to step outside the lines of that? I just need a little advice on how I should approach him and tell him how I feel? Or should I tell him?",15Aug2019,4

459,"HELP. I lived in Florida for the majority of my life but at the beginning of the summer, my sister helped me to move closer to her up north. At the time I was in need of a change due to a breakup so this worked out well. In Florida, I worked for a great company (target) for 4 years and became very close with the management. When I moved up north I was able to transfer to the store here. I have been here about 4 months now and I am loving the city I have been staying in. 

A few days ago my old boss texted me asking if I’d like to move back and work towards a promotion. I was very excited, I feel I really deserve this and was excited at the thought of growing in the company. (Not much chance of a promotion at the northern branch, it’s much MUCH smaller) I have one more semester left until I graduate from university and it is my main priority to do well and focus on it (online so I am able to move anywhere and do class). Because of this, my old boss said it would be alright to work hard through the semester to prove I’d like the promotion and then jump into it after I graduate. 

There are a few downsides to moving home as well as positives. If I move back to Florida, I will be living with my parents which will save me A LOT A LOT A LOT A LOT A LOT of money. This summer, I have been putting all my money towards rent every month to be up north. The downside to this is my parents are not the best to live with, they are both supportive and loving but they do not get along and there is a lot of negativity in that house. It is also a small Florida retirement town, there is not much to do for someone my age (23) compared to the city I have been living in over the summer. Also, my sister lives up north and she’s my best friend I love her very much, it’s been amazing being close with/to her again. 

I have worked out 2 plans in my head but I really don’t know what to do. 

1) Accept that I’ve had an amazing summer experience up north, move back to Florida, work hard at my old company, work harder in my classes, save alllll my money, graduate university, get the promotion, gain manager experience to look good on resume, and then move either back up north or somewhere else to find other work. As much as I love working for target and feel I deserve the promotion, I don’t want to work here forever and I do not want to live in Florida forever. 

2) stay up north, transfer stores because I really don’t like the one I am working at, continue doing my school work, and then find other work when I graduate. 

I’m probably missing a lot of details but I am very stressed about this and I’m having trouble. I have to make a decision within the next few days. I told my old boss I’d let her know at the end of the week and my current landlord needs to know if I’ll be signing a lease. 

Any input helps.",15Aug2019,5

These past 2 weeks I've been getting trained and doing online tax courses that are supposedly suppose to get me ready for income tax season. I do not understand anything at all. My boss told after I finish them, she will be testing me. I feel like I will probably not do good. I realized that this job is only going to get me stressed and i will have to study for it as well as my school work. I didn't think work was going to be like this. I feel like I will get stressed and I think I might quit when I start school so that it won't look that bad.

465,"     My sister, who is 13, keeps wearing my clothes. (I am 16) I am fatter than her so she fits in to all my clothes with plenty of room but her clothes are tight and uncomfortable on me. We share a room so I try to organize the clothes putting hers in one side of the closet and mine in the other. Every time I do this it eventually gets messy and the clothes sort of just combine in one. She should be able to tell the difference between her and my clothes, though... 
     After asking her multiple times to stop wearing my clothes and her contiung, I tried wearing one of her favorite shirts to show her how it feels. She acknowledged it and said something like ""I guess that's fair."" I asked her to stop wearing my clothes again but she has continued anyway. I have even had a dream about her stealing my clothes and me complaining to my mom. 
     Recently, I have been telling my mom and she asks my sister not to wear my clothes, too. 
      She has also began to wear my shoes. These shoes do not look very nice. They are the shoes I wear to work and because of my job, they get get sandy and wet. They are wearing though on the heel and I have insoles in them because they started wearing though on the bottom, too. There is barely any difference between her and my shoes other than that hers are gray and mine are black. They are the same brand and though the style is a bit different, you wouldn't be able to tell by looking from far off.

I went to a pretty good high school that actually gave you an associates degree once you graduated. Embarrassingly, I feel like I ""peaked"" in high school. I had a lot of potential. But I totally dropped the ball once I went to college.

I spent 8 years getting a bachelors because I had struggles with depression and constantly switched majors.

Now it's been one year since I graduated. My degree was Japanese and creative writing. Yea...not the best choices for finding a career. I was planning doing a teach abroad program in Japan, but I was in my first ever relationship at that time and made some poor decisions. I chose not to apply the program and I more or less forgot all my Japanese skills. But to tell the truth, I was already getting sick of Japanese near the end.

The past year I've pretty much been a hermit and teaching myself web development, I feel I've gotten relatively decent and I've been working on a portfolio. But - I already feel so sick of it.

I have this constant pattern of going after something and then I end up hating it. I don't know what to do about it. I'm considering going back to school, but as time has shown, I'll probably get sick of whatever I study.

I just feel so lost and lonely.

Right now I'm 26 and living at home with my mom.

I would like to start a good career, so I can move into my own place. I'd like to actually try having a social life again and maybe even try dating.

474," I am nineteen years old and the youngest in my family. I’ve always looked at my feelings towards my family as ‘teen angst’ and dismissed them. 

However, as I’m slowly leaving teenage years, I can’t help but wonder if my feelings towards my family are actually real. I’ve matured a lot in my first year of college when I was away from my family, but the moment I return, I feel like I am thrown back into my mid-teen years. They treat me like a child and because of that, I feel like I can’t stand up to them because they won’t take me seriously. For example, they’ve been berating me for spending too much time on my own, for spending too much money and for not going for a swim. I have a reason for each argument, but I can’t voice them because I don’t want to be ridiculed. Do these sound reasonable? 

\- I spend too much time on my own because all of my friends are spread across the country and I’m currently in no position to visit them. I will be in a few weeks. I spent time with my co-workers for a bit to see if I liked them, but after a while, I decided they weren’t my cup of tea and that I preferred spending time with myself. I explained this to them. But they insist I hang out with them.

\- I spend too much money, YES, but it’s my own money that I earned by myself. I make videos for both YouTube and a different app. I thought about keeping this a secret from them, but I decided to tell them because I didn’t want them to worry about money when it came to me. I regret that now. All they do is ask me about the goddamn videos and the amount of money I have. 

\- I don’t swim because I don’t like it. That’s it. I don’t like sunbathing, I don’t like swimming. I like looking at the sea and I like sitting near it, but anything beyond that does not interest me. To them, I am crazy.

This might all seem so complicated but please bear with me I've gone absolutely mental and I need any sort of help. Especially when My closest ones aren't even willing to help me on this. I keep referring to it as this because I simply can't explain what it actually is. If I do it will never end well and I'll receive endless hate for it, and that would genuinely make me go mental again, which I don't want to.  I feel so surrounded with no peaceful way out of this. I know it's not my fault. And the decision I take next to act upon this awful situation I am in, Will be crucial in my health and mental being for the rest of my life. Please, I need someone to explain this to in detail. In condition they put themselves in my Perspective and understand how limited my options are and how this will never end well. Anyone, I'm really about to go mental again. Just anyone understanding to explain my situation to, please.",15Aug2019,3
488,"Hi reddit, new here. I'm on mobile and English is not my first launguage. 

So my parents are forcing me to go out because I stay alot on the computer. Most of my friend are on vacation, but I was stuck home here all summer. I have 2 friends I like going out with and one only comes once every 1 or 2 weeks. The other one goes out with one of his ""girl friends"" with their skateboard while I  just try to keep up with them while we talk. Football is the next option but I'm pretty bad at it bcs I cant even hit the ball. My city is pretty boring for me when there is no school and my PC (currently taken away) is my only escape from boredom. What do ?",15Aug2019,3
489,"Hi all I’m just trying to gather a consensus about whether or not I’m being petty or constructive.

I work in an office that has a sophisticated appraisal system. Every year we do the objectives/results and feedback meetings. Part of this is sending out feedback request to coworkers/project people we work with. These feedback assessments are coming in now. Basically you write what you like about working with the person/what they do good and things they could improve on. 

We had a new girl that started about 6 months ago. I like her enough bc she gets the work we do and that’s big in this group. She’s also good at getting things done for the most part. The thing is she never says “thank you” it seems appreciative. I go over to her desk and help figure stuff out and 9.5 times out of 10 she never says thank you and tbh it’s super annoying. This is mainly bc I’m pretty busy rn closing a project so taking 15 mins to go over something two or three times a day pushes me behind. In about 2 weeks it would be that big of a deal but I would still appreciate a thank you. Anyway, it makes me sort of jaded to helping her.

So in short: is feedback mentioning that her appreciation for help is nonexistent and makes me feel less inclined to help too petty? If it’s not petty, does anyone have an idea on how to word this to respond to this assessment? If it is too petty then I’ll accept some people just suck and offer generic feedback.

Thanks!!",15Aug2019,1
490,"I caught this girl glancing over at me multiple times in several different places, even turning around from her seat several times to look at me in class, so I decided to approach her in person and she was really receptive. We’ve talked a few times but just casually regarding college stuff. She is always engaged and tries her best to keep the conversation going longer, asking me questions etc. My friend also caught her looking at me and told me that she is probably into me.

The one issue is...I added her on fb along with a small message asking her about something but she didn’t even respond. I later learned that she made a new account and apparently doesn’t add boys on there at all so maybe that’s why she didn’t respond...but still I was so disappointed. Anyways after that i decided to brush it off and keep talking to her in real life and while we talked afterwards she asked me why I didn’t come to sit closer to her during an exam...(like of course I won’t sit closer to you because I thought that by ignoring me on fb, you would want to avoid me in real life too) but she would still catch glances at me and once again be active in face to face conversations. I’m so confused, we’re on vacation now and i’ll likely see her again in September when the new college year starts...should I continue talking to her or just move on?


Btw I asked her about the message and she told me she didn’t see my message and seemed a bit surprised. Judging by her reaction I thought she would start avoiding me since I made it a bit awkward when I asked her but then the next day, again, she kept looking at the back (where I usually sit but not this time, sat a bit closer this time) a few times then a few seconds later looked back at me as if she ‘found’ me, you get me? Then I figured the seat right behind her was empty so I took the chance and sat there...after the exam she didn’t actually leave instantly,and came up to me by herself to discuss how the exam went...which all in all I thought was weird. How does she seem so awkward when it comes to social media but so relaxed in real life? What do you think?

I stumbled across her instagram, should I follow her on there or just wait till the new year starts? I honestly can’t wait to talk to her",15Aug2019,3
491,"I got a job in June. In August 25 I will be 2 months. The thing is I was set out to work until next may when I graduate. It's an income tax place. These past 2 weeks I've been getting trained and doing online tax courses that are supposedly suppose to get me ready for income tax season. I do not understand anything at all. My boss told after I finish them, she will be testing me. I feel like I will probably not do good. I realized that this job is only going to get me stressed and i will have to study for it as well as my school work. I didn't think work was going to be like this. I feel like I will get stressed and I think I might quit when I start school so that it won't look that bad. The thing is they have to train someone right now in these months before income tax season begins. I did think of lasting until next year but on top of that I have been having stomach and sleeping problems and I only go part time. I get paid minimum wage and the pay supposedly increases at 3 months. And also if I stay for income tax season she said we would be getting a raise. I would only go three days out of the week maybe 5 hours or the whole day but I think it will be worse because when clients come in I have to tell them to wait for the girl that takes care of that and if they are not showing me much yet in 5 days I doubt I will learn alot in 3 days So i am guessing that I will not be able to handle it once I go back to school.

496,"I'm a college student with one year left before I graduate. I ran into a number of issues regarding my mental health, and ended up needing to take an extra year to finish my degree. I'm trying to work out my living situation for the semester, and I need to find an apartment as soon as possible. I'm looking for work in order to support myself financially, but my parents are still my primary financial support. 

My mom isn't always the easiest person to get along with all the time, but I love her to death. She is currently unemployed. She has very strong opinions and perspectives, and it takes a lot of roundabout arguing and time for her to be able to see others' points of view. Money is a huge talking point for her, and she often reminds me that I should be grateful for the money they're spending on my education (which I am, eternally) and insists that we're going into debt because of me. My dad, on the other hand, is a fairly rational and laid-back guy. He's the primary breadwinner. When I discuss the issues she brings up with me, he says she's blowing everything out of proportion.

Because of the guilt I feel, however, I've decided to instead ask my grandparents (my father's parents, my mother's parents are both deceased) to help with my rent for the year I have left, and in exchange I'd be doing a number of services and odd tasks for them. My mom, however, doesn't think I should be getting my own place at all.

Instead, she's insisting that any option other than moving in with my boyfriend would be ""stupid"". My boyfriend lives on his own in a one-bedroom, and has expressed to me that he would like to continue living alone. We're both young, and I've had negative experiences living with romantic partners in the past, and so I agree with him on this. She's threatening to get in the way of my agreement with my grandparents, meaning I would have to be living at home for the forseeable future and put off finishing my degree even longer. 

My plan was to meet with my dad and my grandparents alone to discuss the situation, and come to her once everything has been settled. Is this a good idea? Honestly, I'd just like any input on this situation. I'm more than willing to clarify anything.",15Aug2019,1

I'm a little disappointed in myself. For my GCSE's and tests since I got straight A*'s and was told I could get into a very good university. Luckily I didn't have to go through clearing, but I didn't get into my first choice. I got into my insurance, the university of Kent, which is quite a good local uni or community college, but I'm not sure if this is what I want. 

I guess I just got cocky, I've been told most of my secondary school career I'd go far in life and so didn't try as hard as I could have, relying on talent alone. I guess a good thing to come out of this is being humbled and that hard work does pay off. I also realised I've been quite unhappy the last year. I've been in a relationship with a girl I don't love (I think I'm gay) and just have no idea what I want to do. I don't even think the degree program I got accepted into is the one I like. 

Part of me wants to do a resit year. Try and get better grades, the ones I wanted, and also use that time to figure myself out a bit more and find a degree I actually like. I also want to prove myself a bit, as I feel I've let some of my teachers down.

(TL;DR at the bottom)

So some context, at the start of June my boyfriend overdosed on xanax. He was with friends, and took at least 7 (28 times the recommended dose), which unbeknownst to him were laced, though his friends knew this. The only reason he is still here today is because somehow, in the utter state he was in, managed to walk half the way home and mutter one word on the phone that gave me indication of his whereabouts. If he had stayed at his friends he would have died. The whole ordeal was a bit traumatic, and after over 15 hours in the hospital, he was still fucked, and wasn't a very nice person under the effects.

A whole other heap of stuff happened that weekend, leading to him and his friends vowing to not touch hard drugs again.

His friends stuck to this for 5 days. 

The whole event put our relationship through the ringer. My pre-existing anxiety increased massively, which I then put on my boyfriend. Due to the anxiety, I was having panic attacks when he stayed out for the night (with the same friends), and asked him to come home basically everytime, which led to us nearly splitting. I'm still getting over this;  I don't want to be the selfish and controlling girlfriend. 

Now, his birthday is at the end of the month, and he wants to take hard drugs (not xanax) with his friends. He says that he is going to be responsible and take it easy, but he crumbles under peer pressure, and his friends don't know the definition of taking ot easy. To summarise, I said to him that I would rather he didn't do drugs, but I can't stop him from doing what he wants to do.
If he does decide to do drugs with his friends, I am likely going to be sick with worry for 2 days. If I pressure him into not doing them it is likely going to fracture our relationship.

How can I find the best result for everyone in this situation?

TL;DR

My boyfriend overdosed a couple months back and, wants to do drugs with the friends he was with when he overdosed. How can  I reason with him to ideally not do drugs, or find a comprise?",15Aug2019,1

I was diagnosed with clinical depression and a general anxiety disorder in highschool, and most recently diagnosed with a panic disorder in May. I graduated from college in 2015 with a diploma in photography, and have since started and then dropped out of college twice, and university once. I started smoking weed three years ago, and was diagnosed with cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome in May, so I have stopped smoking. Due to my daily weed habit, I gained 90 pounds. Throughout the last 5 years, I have been dating a boy I met in highschool (we started dating when I was in my second year of college). We currently live together and are dealing with some issues (his sex drive is extremely low, mine is normal to high). I don't really have a job (got hired in July to work at a grocery store, told 2 weeks after i got hired that i wouldn't start for 21 days, there is an issue with my onboarding process on their end, just keep being told to wait to hear back from them. no start day in sight) I am quickly running out of money, I have less than $100 to my name, can't get a credit card due to filing for bankruptcy last year.

I am such a mess right now. I go to sleep around 3am and usually don't wake up until 3pm. I don't eat until really late in the day, and what I do eat is not nutritious in any way. My rent is $400, my phone bill is $100 and my gym membership is $24. No idea how I'm going to pay for that in September.

I've been here 3 years, I don't hate it but I don't like it either, but that's not really the point. 

I really want to switch career paths to something in the psychology field. I currently have an associates degree in communications.

I know this is probably a pointless question that I already know the answer to but I'm naively hoping there is just some way that I've overlooked.

Is there any possible way to get from my ""career"" path now to where I want to be without making myself destitute in the process or incurring even more student loans?

Context: we’ve discussed how to improve our sex life but I feel the main issue is still a lack of natural sexual chemistry which you can’t really do anything to improve if it’s just not there! 

We tried an open relationship about 2 years ago which didn’t end very well as we deffo thought it would be easier than it actually was (in terms of boundaries and communication etc) - it really tested us as a couple and didn’t help that I was going through a bad mental health time when this was going on. 

Because of this negative experience I don’t think my other half would consider an open relationship again, whereas the more I explore the concepts of poly lifestyles the more I feel that I generally don’t think that monogamy is right for me (at least at this point in my life). 

So in conclusion - has anyone been in this situation before and have any advice? 

Do you think sexual chemistry is important enough to risk a perfectly lovely and healthy relationship outside of this? We do truly love each other and have a really wonderful relationship aside from our sex life.

Last night he called me crying and said he loved and was sorry but he just couldn’t do it anymore. I asked where he was and he told me what road he was on  out in the country. ( I’ve lived in that town and Familiar with where he was, I think he told me so someone could get his body when he did it). He said I gotta go his brother was calling. I called the cops and they found him with the gun to his head. I talked to the officer and he gave me a list of things they could charge him with but said he was already going through enough they could tell and didn’t want to add to it. They said they were calling the mental health facility and would pick him up. They took him to the community center and put him on the phone with the crisis counselor at the facility. They determined that he had calmed down and they didn’t need to go get him! ( the police had his gun). A friend was going to pick him up but I don’t know what to do now or how to help him  when I’m not there. He won’t come to me and don’t trust his friends to push him to get the help he needs. Any advice would be appreciated, I feel so upset I don’t even think I’m thinking straight to figure something out. Thanks in advance.

I work full time for $13 an hour and get in state tuition at this college due to my ACT score (28). My girlfriend who is 18 graduated this spring and was planning on going to the same college as me, but her ACT was a 19-20 so she doesn’t qualify for in state, raising her tuition by over $12k a year. As a result, the subsidized and unsubsidized loans I can get from the govt (10k a year) don’t have be paid back until I’m finished with college. But, her govt loans aren’t enough to reach the full total of her tuition, leaving her $14k a YEAR that she would have to take out in private loans that she can’t afford to pay back yet as she doesn’t work full time.

These past 2 weeks I've been getting trained and doing online tax courses that are supposedly suppose to get me ready for income tax season. I do not understand anything at all. My boss told after I finish them, she will be testing me. I feel like I will probably not do good. I realized that this job is only going to get me stressed and i will have to study for it as well as my school work. I didn't think work was going to be like this. I feel like I will get stressed and I think I might quit when I start school so that it won't look that bad. The thing is they have to train someone right now in these months before income tax season begins. I did think of lasting until next year but on top of that I have been having stomach and sleeping problems and I only go part time. I get paid minimum wage and the pay supposedly increases at 3 months. And also if I stay for income tax season she said we would be getting a raise. I would only go three days out of the week maybe 5 hours or the whole day but I think it will be worse because when clients come in I have to tell them to wait for the girl that takes care of that and if they are not showing me much yet in 5 days I doubt I will learn alot in 3 days So i am guessing that I will not be able to handle it once I go back to school.

At some points during the relationship I was probably emotionally abusive (calling her names, i stopped this once we talked about it but I was still an asshole sometimes). I was also kinda of controlling. Mostly because of anxiety. Not an excuse just saying. Like she lived an hour away from her family and work so I would just be like why not go after work to see your fam instead of driving down there again on your day off? More bitchy than that but yeah. I moved up to where she’s from so she could be closer to her family and work. Now I’m here an hour away from my job and stuck for a year. Everything reminds me of her. 

She was so loving and caring and would do anything for me. I would and did anything for her as well it just wasn’t enough with the other bullshit.

542,"I live in an apartment building with three other apartments. One of my neighbors who lives downstairs is a gentleman with Downs syndrome. He's a nice guy and everything. But one day a few months ago, he met me as I was just getting back from work, and asked me if I could drive him down to the gas station at the end of the road so he could pick up some snacks. He said he usually walks, but it was about to rain, and he didn't want to get wet; nobody else was home. I was still right in my car, so I said sure, no problem, and gave him a ride.

And after that, he just kept ringing my doorbell. For the past few months, at least once every other week or so - sometimes more often - he's rung my doorbell to ask me for a ride, and will not take no for an answer. It doesn't matter how I'm feeling (sometimes I get bad migraines), or what I'm doing at the time. Rain or shine. He'll ask me if I'm busy, and then when I answer that I am (because often I'm cooking dinner or cleaning or am in the middle of something), he'll just say, ""Okay, so I'll meet you downstairs and then you can drive me."" He won't respect my answer when I say *no*, and makes me feel guilty for it until I agree to take him.

I don't want to be rude or mean to him, but I also can't keep doing this. I don't know his situation, or what he did before I agreed to give him a ride that day. I recently asked him if he had anyone else he could ask, and he said no; I asked him about walking, and now he says it's too far. I can't help feeling like he's taking advantage of me not wanting to hurt his feelings. However, I have an extremely busy schedule and can't keep dropping everything to drive my neighbor to the gas station whenever he asks me to.

543,"I went to the same elementary since gr 1 with the same people. But in gr 7 a bunch of new kids came since their school was demolished, so the population of my school doubled for every grade. Ever since then all the people I already knew in my grade started avoiding me subtly and would say I “changed”. On top of that it was obvious to everyone the new kids who came didn’t like me and they bullied me all the time (make fun of me, yelled at me, criticized and judged me). These bullies also became close friends with my now ex friends. 

I find it coincidental that i have never experienced bullying and only when these kids come who do not like me, not only was I bullied but my existing friends while becoming close to them started avoiding me and on occasion getting mad at me saying I changed and I started acting stupid (which i feel means that they were hearing lies about me from one or few of the new kids that hated me, trying to change my friend opinion if me and turn them against me).  

I also found it funny that the insults I received from my ex friends were the same things that where my bullies were saying to me. Things that previously my friends never had any problem with.  

Then when my bullies told me that no one liked me and I complained about it, they denied telling me these things and use this as an example to tell my friends that I was causing problems. Further hurting my friendships.

***My question is I was judged and made fun of and honestly just treated like everything I did was wrong. I developed social anxiety in grade 9 as a result of me thinking I caused this and therefore that I will be bullied again in highschool and now I’m in grade 11. I thought that I did something wrong for so many people to hate me and all my friends to turn against me. And I haven’t ever been myself since. What should I have done then and what should I do now to stop believing the put downs they told me and that I will be bullied again when/if i start being myself again?

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‘mines 21st’ and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays...are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

550,"This is a long one so if you stick it out I’d really appreciate it.

About 10 years ago I was pulled over for having a dirty license plate and subsequently also got charged with having a small(less than a gram) of marijuana(in the US). About a week later the cop that ticketed me somehow got my phone number and at about 10pm called me, asked me in an hour to drive to a hardware store next to the station, turn off my car and headlights, and wait to be approached by him and another officer who would then bring me to a “shed behind the police station” for question(this was a small town). Following this call I immediately called my dad(a lawyer) who told me not to go(obviously) and to not answer any of his calls if he were to call again. My dad called the police station which didn’t answer and left a message stating I was now being represented by him and that all communication was to go through him. The cop proceeded to call me 6-10 times after this happened which prompted my now even more furious father to call the station again. He stopped calling.

About a year after this I moved to a neighboring town and was in an abusive relationship where the police made a couple visits. This cop showed up to one of these visits and apparently had transferred to this new towns police force. He recognized me and made me feel very uncomfortable... even smirked at me as a sat on the floor bruised and in tears. After this night I also saw him come into my job on a few occasions but never said anything to me.

I left that relationship soon after that night, and around that time the FBI visited my dads office because they had heard he may know something about local police corruption— my dad told them about this officer. They’d wanted to meet to talk with me but I wasn’t interested. I moved away to a city about an hour away and figured that would be the end of it.

I started working in a bar/restaurant about a year and a half ago and everything was going really well— I even got my AS degree and then started working towards and undergrad. I was not working one night and had had a few drinks with my BF and a few friends when I look behind me and there he is. That cop has now transferred to my new city(his fourth department, that I know of, in the last ten years). With a bit of liquid courage I went up to him, asked if he remembered me(he said he didn’t) and I then called him a scumbag or something of the sort, went back to my group and cried... I left and went home shortly after.

Which brings us to today. Yesterday my bosses asked to meet with me and brought up the incident. Apparently he had been golfing with that cop who told him he was “so scared of me that he had to hide in the bathroom and refused to come back”.... he never hid in the bathroom. I never even raised my voice to him. I apologized that this incident happened at their bar and I admitted to it being inappropriate. My boss lamented that he wasn’t interested in our histories(kept implying it was romantic) and I was so upset that I knew I wouldn’t even be able to tell my side of things without crying. Apparently this cop wants a personal apology from me and my boss wants to set this up for next week. Thing is I’m not sorry. I’m sorry that this happened at my place of work— that was inappropriate and a poor choice but I’m not sorry for what I said. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to lose my job over this but my integrity and self respect mean more to me... there are always other jobs. My boyfriend and father think I should tell my bosses my side and not apologize... I’m skeptical that even if they knew it wouldn’t make a difference. What would you do?",15Aug2019,1
551,"So this is gonna be a little childish, but it's something that's been making me stressed.

So basically this happened a few days ago, me and my friends were drunk and we went outside to lay in the grass. My friends sort of quit smoking, they switched  from cigarettes to vapes, and so i brought down Friend #1's vape to the garden. Friend #2 asked for the vape, so i gave it to them. He left it on the ground. After about half an hour, we went inside because it started raining, then we went to sleep. The next day i got yelled at for leaving it outside, even though i clearly gave it to Friend #2, which in my opinion would mean i was no longer responsible for it. They put the device in rice, and it worked for a few hours, but after they switched out the battery, it stopped working. Now Friend #1 demands i pay for it.

 We are quite young, i just started working, and half of my paycheck would go towards this.

Who is at fault here? Is it me not realising or am i in the right?

TL;DR: I brought a vape in the garden, gave it to someone else who left it out in the rain. The next day they put it in rice, (it worked) but then they tinkered with it and now it doesn't. They want me to pay for it.",15Aug2019,0

553,"Okay. I (17F) have had awful, mind-numming period cramps since I was 13. I struggled silently for a long time, but last year I actually feared I would die because of my pain. It took a year after that incident for me to suck it up and admit that the pain was not normal nor something I could live with, so I went to my school nurse last May and decided to get birth control pills.
My relationship with my pills took a bad turn right in the beginning. When getting pills, the doctor performs an ultrasound on you. We found that I had this mass on my ovary (that later turned out to be just fine, but not the point). That turned taking the pill from ""my own will"" to almost mandatory in fear of a certain disease. 
I don't know what, but something about that made me feel awful about taking the pill. I guess I have to have at least a certain amount of control over something like that to feel comfortable with it. I felt like that control was taken from me.
But now to the reason I am saddened by my BC. It has helped with the pain a litylr bit but it made my already heavy periods *way* heavier. It also makes me so moody. I can deal with bloating, or gaining a bit of weight or pimples, but I honestly feel like a different person. I am not myself anymore and I hate it. I keep crying all the time, I don't want to get out of bed and I am very anxious about everything for some reason.
What I need advice with:
I don't know what to do. I really want to quit and be myself again, but I don't want the pain back. I have no energy to start the rumba of finding ""the right bc pill for me"". I know the side effects have persisted and I don't think they will be going anywhere.",15Aug2019,1

561,"I am a disabled individual with Autism.   I find a lot of discrimination on Reddit and people acting like jerks, or on power trips.   I just got banned from r/needadvice, and well guess why?    I asked why I could post on there when I had 141 karma, and an account that is over a year old. 

I get a response that I had 121 post karma and 20 comment karma.   Since I asked the moderators, it is obvious I didn't know that there was a difference between post karma and comment karma, or they even separated them that way.   I thought the number in the right hand side of the screen.

On the rules on r/needadvice, they don't even explain that there is a difference for people who don't understand how this site works and how karma works.     

Then this is the message the mod sends me:

You have been banned from participating in [r/needadvice](https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice). You can still view and subscribe to [r/needadvice](https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice), but you won't be able to post or comment.

Note from the moderators:

When you didn't have enough karma to participate in needadvice, you posted, then got your post approved in error. Which means that a goodly portion of your comment karma never should have been allowed. So now I have to remove you from the sub.

If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for [r/needadvice](https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice) by replying to this message.

This is the message I get, when I asked for help as to why I couldn't post.   Now of the 20 comment karma, I have on Reddit, 99% of it is from posts out of r/needadvice.   Some of the posts I deleted, because of how people treated me, but that comment karma still remained, as far I know.      

Next I received a total of 3 comment Karma on the so called post that this mod banned me on r/needadvice.  A total of 3 comment karma out of 20.   I only posted one total comment on that thread, that had 3 karma.    So how did I quote get the majority of my comment karma from 1 single comment on that thread, that totals 3 karma.

Not only that, but the moderator team, who I messaged for help, asking why I couldn't post if I had 141 karma, should of realized that not only me, but many, many, many other people won't realize that there is a different between post and comment karma.      Furthermore, if my post went thru, then probably hundreds of other posts got thru, when someone posted on r/needadvice at the time when they just started that rule.     So there are hundreds of people, who got comment karma, on that Reddit, when their post was posted when it shouldn't of been approved.   So what do they do?   They single out the one person, who is asking for help, who doesn't obviously understand that there is a difference between comment and post karma.     Furthermore, at the time, that I posted that thread, I may very well of had over 50 karma being displayed in the right hand corner of my screen, and I would likewise not of known there was a difference, because I didn't know today there wasn't.

So I end up deleting the thread on Reddit, where you get harassed by immature people, and kept the thread on [sevenforums.com](https://sevenforums.com).

The same when I posted to the autism forum or help for getting transportation for a cat when I suffer suicidal depression.   I get trolled when I ask for help for transportation when I suffer suicidal depression.    Not one single person intervenes when this happens, and it happened on this very Reddit.    Not one person even seem to recognize the need for a pet for someone who suffers suicidal thoughts and has no other company.   There is many therapists who use animal therapy in their practice for help in depression, and there have been actual medical research and scientific study on the use of animals in helping to relieve depression.   But hey, nobody on Reddit, can seem to even recognize that fact or the validity of it.

Then I post on the autism forums, and the post that gets the highest upvotes has a prejudicial comment, and I list the actual dictionary definition of prejudice that most dictionaries on the internet uses and explain how it fits.     I then talk about many things, that I researched in the 13 years that I was diagnosed with autism.   Many of these things are things that people in the medical industry, actually getting paid money to do this, agree that the research I did on the internet and my facts are correct.    Everyone seems to just focus on arguing and it all seems to be more a popularity contest, then actually caring about the content of what I right.

So the reason I am listing all this, I look to know what other good forum or discussion sites there are.   I know of Quora, and I would use that more then Reddit, but you constantly have your posts remove if they don't fit extremely ridiculous English grammar rules.    My current therapist was an English teacher for 35 years, before retiring and becoming a therapist, and he quoted something that Winston Churchill said about ending a sentence with a proposition and he basically insulted all the people who were accusing him (Winston Churchill) of using incorrect grammar.     There is nothing in the actual English grammar rules that disallow it, and Winston Churchill made a joke statement demonstrating it.  

Anyways, so what other good forums or discussion groups are there, where it is less of a popularity contest and it is more important what you actually write?",15Aug2019,3

566,"So in the last two weeks I've had a plethora of fun stuff happen to me.

1. Lost my best friend because he decided that he cares about two things in this world. Cars and himself.

2. Finally built up the courage to ask out a co-worker of mine (after a year or so of trying to convince myself) and she said yes to a first date then immediately after said date sent me a message saying she had a bad experience with dating a co-worker in the past and isn't willing to date me to avoid a similar situation

3. Found out that my dream job that has a 7 month hiring process that I applied to 9 months ago has been delayed due to lack of funding for an indeterminate amount of time

4. Learned that I can't leave the job I have now because my prospective employer needs a consistent and steady work history to consider me for the position.

So in total I'm just completely lost and have no idea what to do with my life in general.  I feel like I'm going to be stuck alone with a shit job for an indeterminate amount of time and that every aspect of my life is going nowhere.",15Aug2019,1

568," Before anything, I'm not trying to get into a relationship with her, I just like making friends, but don't like pursuing a friendship if it makes her uncomfortable in the process.

Here's the thing, I'm unsure of whether my co-worker is okay with me, or is just being professional. Whenever we're in a group, she's usually very bubbly and touchy with our other friends (both men and women), and though she DOES talk and joke around a bit with me, it's clearly way less than she does with everyone else, that kinda made me feel like she's uncomfortable with me. Other than that, our usual interactions inside the office is whenever she needs to ask me questions about our projects.

But whenever I ask people to lunch, she's usually the first one to join me, she even joins me almost every time I go for coffee after lunch, but even when it's just us, she's not as talkative as she usually is, I'm not exactly very talkative myself but often times I have to start the conversation just to get her to talk, but after a few short answers, she goes silent again, it gets awkward sometimes, I don't really know what to do and I'm running out of icebreakers.

But she's really a good person, and I'd really like to think we're friends, but I don't like forcing myself to people if it makes them uncomfortable, it's usually easy to tell whether someone's okay with you or not, but this one confuses me. Sorry if this is a bit shallow, we're all good friends where I work, and she's the only one who's like this with me, and I don't like the thought of making her uneasy.

Should I just straight up ask her if I'm making her uncomfortable? I'm afraid that when I do, she might be too polite to tell the truth, and I'd just make her uncomfortable even more, but should I anyway? What are your opinions on the situation?",15Aug2019,1

580,"So some strange stuff is happening to me and I don't know if I'm going crazy, someone is playing a prank on me or whatever else.

3 weeks ago on Thursday I received a phone call from a blocked number on my private mobile phone. I never pick up when a hidden number is calling and let them speak onto my mailbox. And they did just that. The message was something similar like this:

""Dear Mr. \[*My name*\], this is \[*Name of my landlord*\], from \[*My address*\] (we live in the same apartment building). I'm calling you in regards of your new apartment, please call me back.""

Strange about this is that first, he never called me with hidden number before and second, I don't plan to move apartments. I'm living in my current apartment for over 2 years now. His voice sounded similar to my landlord but I don't speak to him often so I don't know. Because I didn't receive any more calls from him or any written letter I shrugged it off as some scam call.

Today (again on Thursday for whatever that's worth) I'm receiving a call from a hidden number again. This time it was a female person calling and leaving the following message:

""Dear Mr. \[*My name*\], this is \[*My personal contact from my bank*\], I'm calling you in regards of your account change, please call me back today or my colleague \[*Name of her actual colleague*\] tomorrow under the following number \[*Phone number*\].""

Getting worried I called my Bank under their central number and they confirmed the number given in the mailbox message as being the right one. So I called her back but instead of her, or the mentioned colleague, a different one answers the phone. I asked him if I used the proper number and He said ""Yes, but both of them are on vacation this week."" So I told him that I received a call from her today from a hidden number and he got very confused understandably because she wasn't even present in office all week. He checked my account and told me that he can't find any reason anyone should have called me to begin with. I did have an account change but that, just as me moving into my new apartment, is over 2 years ago.

So what in the actual f\*ck is going on?! If it's a scammer it makes no sense leaving the actual number of my contact person on the voice mail. I could image a hand full of people knowing my address and name of landlord who might want to prank me but I can't imagine anyone knowing the name of my contact at my bank and her number. None of this makes sense to me.

Does anyone have any idea what is going on and/or what I should do? I do have slight anxiety issues and am taking medication for it and the situation at this point is driving me crazy. Especially because it just makes no sense at all to me.

I'm happy for every bit off advice what might be going on here and what I should do.",15Aug2019,1
581,"I've been kinda conflicted about this one for a while, but I decided to come here in hopes of solving the problem.

My friend (who we'll call Shawn) and I were going into my garage to get water bottles for our walk (he's trying to lose some weight, so I offered to walk around the block with him each day.) I punched in the code for the garage door, and it started opening up. Shawn was getting impatient and decided to try and force the door to open faster by sticking his hands under the door and pushing it upwards (the door opens at a set speed). I heard some pretty nasty mechanical noises coming from the door, so I pulled Shawn off of it and told him that he shouldn't be messing with the garage door. He apologized, so I decided to let bygones be bygones. 

Cut to the next day, and the garage door is acting up. It will randomly stop in the middle of opening or closing and do the exact opposite (i.e. go from closing to opening back up) and generally be unresponsive. My parents are at a loss for what happened to it, but I think that Shawn damaged the door in some way, which would make sense, giving the timing. 

Here's where the problem comes in: I can't know for sure if Shawn broke the door, or if this is all just a coincidence. If I tell my parents about what happened, and it turns out to be a completely unrelated issue, I'm gonna look like an asshole to Shawn. If I *don't* tell my parents what happened, they might not be able to fix/correct the garage door.

What would be the best course of action here?",15Aug2019,1

584,"I'm a 25yr old male, settled in India with my family. We have had a stable and secure life growing up, albeit a bit lonely because we live in a small town with few kids of similar age. My parents are both school teachers. We weren't super rich, I worked my ass off through medical school and became a doctor. My sister was always a spoiled child. My parents lost their authority and ability to control her sometime along the way. I moved out of the house for college and studies when she was nine. Since then I haven't been around for much if her childhood. Her grades had progressively declined over school because she never worked. My parents enabled her a bit. My father, while non violent, reacts noisily to undesirable things. So she was never honest with either of my parents or shared anything with them. She left for a boarding school at 16 years after barely scraping enough grades to get there. She realised life was hard and the competition tough, and also that she couldn't skate by anymore. The thought must have scared her. She had a minor muscle cramp(medical diagnosis was trapezius syndrome) following which she practically dropped out of school. The authorities let her change schools. She stopped going to school after that. The attendance was given to her because she was intelligent and the teachers were supportive. She failed to clear high school. She ha been living at home for the past three years. She recently turned 18. She was caught hiding a packet of weed and ketamine in her room when she was seventeen. She has a lot of online friendships with older males, refuses to go to college and wants to live at home off my parents. I'm open to advice.",15Aug2019,2
585,"Using a throwaway for obvious reasons, TLDR is the title.

I am a male, was about 12 or 13, and in 8th grade when this happened. This happened in a California private school in the early 2000's. It was the last week or so of class and students were just wandering around the school. Honestly, I don't remember much of the context, and I'm not sure it matters. I walked into a classroom and the teacher, Mr. X, was in the back of the classroom with a male student, Stan. I'm not sure why I went into the classroom or why I went over to them, but I did. The teacher was showing Stan a magazine with naked women in it. I was a late bloomer and didn't know anything more than the science behind sex, so other than being weirded out, I didn't think too much of it.

I ended up moving away shortly after 8th grade and hadn't thought about or even remembered the incident since it happened. This past week, I visited California and started reminiscing about the time I lived there. I looked to see if the school I went to in 8th grade was still open when I found the news article documenting what Mr. X had done. He sexually assaulted a teenage girl that was his student, 5-8 years after the porn incident. 

I did not report the incident to the school, my family, friends.... I didn't say anything to anyone. I don't know why I didn't see this as 'wrong' or 'wrong enough to tell an adult'. I could not sleep at all last night, I just feel responsible and guilty. It's all I can think about today. Logically, I know that I did not hurt this girl. I also know that if I had said something, the teacher would have probably been fired and would not have had the opportunity to hurt this girl.

A true classic for Reddit standard's I assume
So there's no point telling you how it happened it just did saw his dirty messages with this woman ..and yes I'm sure of it 
 I would like to mention that my dad has loved me and will probably will until his time come unconditionally. He is literally there for me for everything I might need from physical values till emotional support .
So I am very confused about my course of action right now and what to do.
I can't just tell my mother about this cause they've been married for 31 years god damn it.
Recently, I've confronted my dad about this matter and he said that he has been always  loyal to my mum and not to worry, he even let to look at his phone but ofc all of the messages were deleted..(recently I've noticed he spends a lot of time using his phone when not working..)
On the other hand, I think who am I to judge what 2 middle aged people I call parents are doing at their own bedroom?? It's their relationship and I have a life to live and I don't to get dragged by something that is none of my concern! Who knows maybe my mum is aware of this as well or she has an affair too..!!
Anyway my point is that I can't cause a scene in our ordinary lives just because something  that is NONE of my concern and I am not responsible for it  is taking place. I would talk to a therapist but ofc I can't ask money to do that unjustified
Please help me.
How can I cope with this?? I have university and other responsibilities...

591,"So I’m a 22 year old female, and I recently graduated from college in December. Like nearly everyone else my age, I couldn’t make enough money to pay rent and my student loans as a part-time server, so I reluctantly moved in with my parents.

Let me give you all just a little bit of background. Moving in with my parents has always been worst case scenario in my mind. My mother is a narcissistic control freak, and while I know she does love me, she’s very selfish and will basically do anything to convince me to stay with her because she absolutely hates her life and is one of the most negative people I know. It’s gotten better as I’ve gotten older, but she has no boundaries and we have a really unhealthy relationship. For example, when I moved in, I asked to borrow some lotion and went digging through her vanity. I found a clump of my hair in the drawer. I KNOW it was mine, because no one else in my family has copper hair. When I asked if she hadn’t cleaned in a while, she gave me this look that told me she kept it on purpose- which is really gross and creepy and made me incredibly uncomfortable. I don’t care if she’s my mom, who keeps a clump of dead hair from w hairbrush? I think she’s low key obsessed with me, and tells me all the time that my sister (12) and I are the only reasons she’s alive.

Also my dad is an alcoholic and he’s sort of in the process of stopping drinking, so naturally, he’s being a massive douchebag, because he’s going through withdrawal. But I mostly avoid him when he’s in a mood, and it’s something I can deal with.

I think it’s obvious that staying in this house is a bad idea for my emotional and mental health. But I recently started a job working for a pretty big company, it’s in the entertainment industry, but like barely. I basically edit the TV Guide. Which is a monotonous job- I basically compare schedules to what’s in the system and then make changes if there are any. But that’s like all I do ALL day. I also work 1 to 9:30. Which I thought I would like, but it’s turning out to be exhausting. 

Where I live now, my parents moved here halfway through college. It’s a really tiny town up north and almost nothing ever happens. There are virtually no people my age, because people are all dying to get out of here, or they’re already married with children. So I have one friend who lives 45 minutes away and that’s IT. I see her maybe once or twice a month. But our schedules are so opposite, so it’s gotten almost impossible to see her. So I don’t even spend my weekends doing anything as a reprieve. I just sit and play video games- which is fine sometimes- but I have NO social life and I’m a very outgoing person, so it bothers me to no end and I find myself missing my college town and my friends DESPERATELY. 

SO with that in mind, this isn’t going to work in the long term. I could deal with any one of those depressing facets of my life, but the fact that family, work, and friends are all really shitty- I’m naturally depressed and I don’t want this to be my life forever.

My end goal, I would really like to be an entertainment publicist in LA. I did an internship there last summer and I loved it so much, and I know that’s what I want to do. Obviously LA is expensive, so I need to save up money to move, and I would also need a job that would pay at least $20/hr, because I’m a small white girl, and I don’t want to live in an area that’s sketchy.

If I stay at my parents, I can save money, but I’m not really sure that this job experience is worth much because I’m not getting experience doing anything relevant to publicity. Like I said, I edit the TV Guide. And pretty much every job in this building is like that, and this is a tiny town and there’s just not a lot of job opportunities here. There are tons of homeless and jobless people.

But my best friend/roommate from college wants to live with me. She and I could possibly get an apartment together, and there’s a job opening as a marketing assistant for a theater and I’m super qualified. Another friend also knows the manager and could put in a good word for me. I think I would be much happier at that job, I’d get all the same benefits I have at my current job, and it pays more.

I know that I wouldn’t be able to save as much money, but the actual work is more relevant to what I want to do, and I would only be 45 minutes from my college and generally closer to all my friends. Right now, I’m 9 hours away. I know I would be infinitely happier. I would definitely need to be frugal, but I would need to stay for a while and get job experience anyway, so I would have time to save.

My mom thinks moving with my friend is a mistake. Not that she dislikes her, but she thinks I’ll look like a flake on my resume for leaving this job, and that I won’t be able to save and that she can’t help me financially if I leave. She would still cover my phone bill and health insurance. So the only things I would be adding to my bills now are food, which I paid for during college anyway, and rent. But if I’m making more money, I would be able to afford rent and student loans. 

——————— 

SO TL;DR. My life sucks currently, do I leave my parents’ house to live with my best friend although it’s riskier financially or do I stay at home, because it’s safer financially, but it’s really toxic for my mental health and I’m really miserable?",15Aug2019,1
592,"So theres this new girl at my school(around 3 weeks in now) who I have a crush on. So I decided to speak to her during the only two periods we have together, and in those moments I make her laugh so much. The lamest joke (word play with kidnap and dognap) ended up making her laugh for like half a minute, and it seemed pretty genuine to me.

I found out she had a boyfriend in her old school and they this toxic relationship (where he was receiving nudes from other girls), but I figured it would be over soon enough. I really doubt it is, though, but I give it a month or less.
However, I'm trying to know her as a friend first, before diving straight down. It's hard for me to talk to her in person, so I text her. Nonetheless, she limits herself to a couple of words per answer, and shows no interest whatsoever in advancing the conversation. I've tried like 3 times to text her already, same result, so I haven't been able to know her. Not a clue what she likes, how many siblings she has, her favourite color. I literally don't know anything about her. She's closed I guess.

Something worth mentioning is that many (+/-5) guys have tried hitting on her, all getting rejected.

So what I'm getting at is, how can I get her to feel more open (and comfortable?) with me, enough for me to get to know her but not too much so that she friendzones me. Should I stop what I've been doing and wait for her and her boyfriend to break up?

*Note: what I know about her is cause a friend told me (someone that has no intentions other than to be her friend)",15Aug2019,2
593,"My wife and I have been together for 8 years. One thing I have trouble with is empathizing with what are, to her, big problems. I can see how they affect her and acknowledge that it is a big deal for her. An example would be work related stress of a late project and having to work on the weekend to finish it.

The trouble is, I have a long history of severe emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. I’ve managed to get help from therapy and become an upstanding member of society against all odds. I’ve been forced to become more resilient in order to function and develop my own mastery of self. My threshold for a ‘crisis situation’ is far, far higher than hers.

I struggle when it comes to being patient when my wife is dealing with her big things, and not internally comparing as a molehill vs the mountains I’ve overcome. I am supportive and understand that it IS a big deal to her. The level of stress and preoccupation with the problem of the week seems... disproportionate... to how big the problem is in the grand picture of our lives and it’s actual effects.

I’ve been thinking about taking a gap year for a while to help out my family, work to get work experience and save up money for university as well as figure out what I want to study, however I’m still conflicted. I currently have then option to try to get into university for a course that I’m not completely certain about or take the gap year. University has always been something I’ve seen myself do immediately after high school, and my friends and family see it the same way and all expect me to go this year. I’m also afraid next year I won’t fit in too well being older than the normal undergrad. Like I said I’m very conflicted and would love if anyone could weigh in a little, and outside perspective would be nice since most people I know are very against the gap year.",15Aug2019,1
598,"Hiya!

I have been a iPhone user since the time of iPod Classics and I still have my iPhone 4 (it doesn't work anymore). However, I have heard about Samsung phones for quite some time now and I am seriously considering getting a Note 10+. I have been disappointed for a little bit by the iPhones just because of the battery life and the camera.

If anyone can tell me about the specs or anything about the Samsung, I would greatly appreciate it! I never had a Samsung, so any information would be awesome!

Thanks :)",15Aug2019,1

So, next year I'm going to university (hopefully) and since I'm finishing high school my mother has decided that I can get a gift that's going to help me on my career. I've decided that I want a laptop.
The thing is, my career involves lots of programming and I'm only informed in gaming PC's and I don't know what specs should I look for.

604,"My boyfriend and I have been living with his sister and husband and kid since this past November. They aren't bad people by any means, just not the best roommates. My boyfriend and I are very nonconfrontational people and usually just push our discomfort out of the way to keep everything at peace, but I feel like this should be brought up because these dogs need help. 
 My boyfriend's sister got two pitbull puppies at the end of May this year, knowing that they already have another kid on the way and barely had enough time to take care of the chocolate lab they already have. Usually the responsibility of taking care of them falls unto my boyfriend and I since the kennel is downstairs where we sleep so we usually get woken up by their barking. Sadly though,  we work at a warehouse in town most days and aren't home usually. This leaves the dogs in the kennel all day and maybe let out to eat once when my boyfriend and I make it home. His sister doesn't work and stays home all day to take care of her kid while her husband drives truck. I feel as though she should have time when her kid is napping or something to take the dogs out but she just doesn't do it. 
Yesterday we didnt get home till close to one in the morning from work and thought that maybe the dogs have already been taken out. Nope. They left them in the kennel all fucking day yesterday. When we took the pups out this morning they pissed all over the sidewalk and had trouble pooping. They were shaking because they hadn't been fed in a day and one of them is getting scary thin. At this point I dont know what to do. I know we cant take care of them and my boyfriends sister is clearly not able to either. Should I confront her about it or take action myself??",15Aug2019,1

I was going to a psychiatrist earlier this year but they left me on my own while I'm waiting to get an appointment to a neuropsychiatric place (undiagnosed adhd at the moment). Still haven't heard anything about when/if they'll help me.

I've started to go to the gym since almost 3 weeks, 2-3 times per week. It's not helping. When does exercise start helping? Do I have to go to the gym every day? Even doing as much as I am takes a lot out of me, since I don't even feel like brushing my teeth atm..

For example, I am pregnant and having a hard time with a lot of symptoms. I feel like so many women are tougher than me out there while I feel like I need to cry in bed all day over the pain. (Yes I’m seeing my doctor and everything that can be done is being done). 

Another example is emotionally I struggle with depression and anxiety and when times are hard like starting a new job or dealing with fatigue, I struggle to push through and want to give up, and sometimes do. 

My husband is sweet but he also has made little comments here and there saying I can push through it and maybe I need to toughen up a tiny bit. 

This is just one example (my pregnancy), but there have been other things in my life that try me this way too. I just see women around me that are TOUGH. They push through hard times and people call them the “toughest” or “strongest woman I know”. And I know no one can say that honestly about me.

612,"This is long but I need you to really immerse yourself in my discomfort.

The day I moved into my house, almost a year ago, was when I initially got a taste of Bob's socially unfavourable mannerisms. The entire time I was lugging stuff into my house he lingered around his yard aimlessly and didn't go in his house for about 4-5 hours. Bob is a 70 year old-looking 55 year old who's been living off disability for some years now and seems to prefer occupying his time with being concerned with what I do. Here are some of my creepy and odd encounters with him:

1. **Whenever I have company Bob will either linger in his yard**; walking from the back to his front yard and/or taking a back-and-forth stroll past my house repeatedly. He really does not make any attempt to establish subtlety.
2. **He seems to correlate his time outside with my time outside;** whenever I'm doing yard work he'll always make the effort to be outside as well, usually just sitting in a chair until I go back inside. He will also be so bold as to walk over and make awkward conversation with me, mostly consisting of him telling me how to do my yard work. When the conversation is obviously over Bob will continue to hover over me, lingering in uncomfortable silence.
3. **He must have adapted the same schedule as me;** quite often when I leave for work in the morning Bob will be sitting in his car and when I leave my driveway and head to get my morning coffee he will be right behind me getting his morning coffee. He's even gone so far as to follow me to a different coffee shop in my attempt to determine if he was truly tailing me.  When I'm getting off night shift he is usually leaving his house so we will pass each other on my way home. When I'm coming off my day shift he is ALWAYS sitting on his front porch and will walk over to me in hopes to strike a conversation as I emerge from my car. On my days off he does none of these things, in fact he barely leaves his house unless I do. I also encounter frequent run-ins with him at the grocery store which has happened in such excess to be a coincidence. Yes, I live in a small town but there are a few grocery stores and he seems to favour the ones I choose to go to that day.
4. **He's admitted to watching me;** when my dad was visiting me Bob told my dad ""I was watching your daughter struggle to scrape the ice off her car, I think you need to fix the heat in her car."" He seemed to be quite unaware 1/4"" thick ice is difficult to scrape off when you don't have the time to let it thaw for half hour. He's not the brightest individual I've met but he believes otherwise. He's also referenced in conversation with me, times I've been out in my yard or when I've left my house indicating he keeps a disturbingly close eye on me even in the comfort of his own home.
5. **I tried to do the neighbourly thing and it backfired one me tremendously;** I noticed his lawn mower wouldn't start and he was cutting his grass with a line trimmer. I figured I would do the nice thing and offered him my lawn mower. Well it wasn;t but 2 minutes of him using it I heard a loud crunch outside. Bob said to me, ""I think you need to return this it's not working properly."" Upon further investigation I came to the conclusion he ran over a rock with my brand new never-before-used mower as evidenced by the giant chunk taken out of the blade. Later that day I was cleaning my car out and Bob frightens me as he is suddenly standing right over me and says ""Did you find that receipt for the mower, its probably in your purse."" I don't have a purse and after i finished informing him I was not looking for a receipt and that I cannot return an item that was damaged after the purchase, he continues to again, hover over me, lingering in silence.
6. **He attempted to lie to me about my other neighbour;** most recently, Bob falsely informed this gentleman who lives down the street was snooping around my yard and being belligerent with Bob about me not having a permit to build a shed. I later found out this was untrue. Not sure why Bob would make this up but it is definitely questionable behaviour that only intensified my uneasiness about him.

I'm just a 25 year old girl who likes to keep to herself and enjoys some privacy. I live alone. I've become so uncomfortable that I hate just walking to my car in my own driveway as I know Bob is always watching.  My yard looks terrible as I don't even want to go outside and do yard work feeling so weary about him. I'm very short with him, I avoid him like the plague, I just don't know how to make him stop or get make him get the hint I really just want him to leave me alone. Any ideas?

I'm not sure if he's creepy or just bored and harmless, either way I'm at my wits end.",15Aug2019,3

My friend was crying for a couple days because she didn't know what to do, she didn't know if she was into girls or not, and didn't want to end up hurting her. A week or two after that they began dating. My friend would constantly text me about how happy she is, how much she loves her girlfriend, and how her girlfriend would send her cute paragraphs. A few months pass,  her girlfriend tells her that she's going to give her hickies when they have a little date at the park. My friend texts me at 2 am, incredibly nervous about their date, and about the hickies she's going to receive. During their date, her girlfriend tried putting her hands down my friend's pants... my friend rejected that because she felt very uncomfortable. As soon as my friend rejected that, her girlfriend broke up with her and said, ""I was going to break up or hurt with you anyway. We can remain as friends, though."" Obviously, my friend wants nothing to do with her and she feels very hurt. Unfortunately, as I said in the beginning, her ex-girlfriend is her mentor, which means she'll have to see her quite often.

615,"Hello Reddit,

Let me start with some backstory...

Three days after getting my driver's license, I caused an accident in my moms car. This was in September. I ran a red light. I didn't do it on purpose, but I take full responsibility as it was my negligence for driving tired. It's been 11 months and I just got an email from State Farm, that they will not be renewing my insurance and that I need to find new insurance by 9/5/2019.

I pay State Farm $225 a month for full coverage, towing, and of course liability. Today I was researching and getting quotes from all the major insurance companies, and every single one is estimating around $415/month as well as around a $2k sign-on fee. 

I can by no means afford this. I have other than the aforementioned accident, zero traffic infractions/accidents. It's been 11 months, I have a 90% score on the Drive-Safe-and-Save app. I've paid my bill on time every time. Is there anything I can do?

I don't need full coverage as my car is only worth around $2,000 but I need liability.  What can I do. The only time I've ever been this stressed is the day of the accident and I'm freaking out.",15Aug2019,1

As soon as people took notice of my grandfather's illness people jumped on top of him like vultures and I'm afraid I can't do much yet...

I feel guilty if I end up having casual sex at my parents house if I potentially bring a girl here. But at the same time I doubt that the girl would let me go to her place or would want to go to a hotel?

I think she wouldn’t want to go to a hotel because it seems sleazy and she wouldn’t trust me with it as it will possibly be a one night stand?

What is the best course of action to take and would I be wrong for doing this?

For your interest my parents are religious and don’t believe in casual sex which would make it even worse? We never talk about sex or girlfriends ever, I have to do all of this discretely?

 So my SO (M21) and I (F19) have been together for over a year. We are in a long distance relationship, and plan to move in with eachother after he graduates, which will be in about a year. 

Anywho, when he comes down, he stays at my parents house with us. However, at the parents house, we have a good amount of rules, which makes sense, we aren't disputing that. For example, I still have a curfew, no sex in the house, no sleeping in the same bed, etc. They recommended, if we wanted to do those things, mainly the sex/sleeping together, then we should get a hotel, because that's what they did when they were dating while still living with parents. 

So that's what we did, and my mom found out about it, and I thought was okay with it, but it seems like she's not. This morning she barely said a word to either of us, and my dad hasn't talked to us either. It seems like they're mad at us because we decided to actually take their advice and pay for a hotel. 

I don't know what to do, because I want them to like my bf, and they did, but it seems like they kinda hate him now. I know I'm gonna be with this man for the rest of my life and I feel like it would be so awkward for them to be like this forever. 

I don't know if it's like a gender thing, their only daughter (and youngest) is having sex or what. It seems like they're fine with my brothers (29 and 22) having sex, but not me.

626,"So, I moved about 70 miles away from my old place without setting up a job first. I rushed into it partly due to some family conflicts, and have struggled to get a job since. I liked my old job and would have kept it, however the commute was far too long for what I was making. I got pretty depressed about not having a job, so when one that paid close enough to my old job popped up, I immediately accepted without really contemplating what I was getting into. This job is through a staffing agency. I go into a food manufacturing plant and pack baked goods for 12 hours. A shorter shift is not available. I get 3 20 minute breaks throughout the day, and I have to stay on my feet and I'm not allowed to leave the job site until my shift is over. It almost sounds like a glorified sweat shop and I'm afraid to start. I want desperately to back out, but I'm not sure which is worse, being jobless, or working shifts like this. The one perk is that I set my own schedule (other than 2 days a week, which I have been set to work every week), and thus I get 5 days off if I want them. When I really started worrying is when I caught the agency lying to me. I was told I could pick my work days week by week, and I don't have to work the same days each week, which has turned out not to be true, so I wonder what else they may be lying to me about. Either way, whether I call out or not, I will be trying to find another job, hopefully within a few weeks. I have a few interviews upcoming.

Background: 
I have been at this job for almost 11 months now and it has been rough. Switching teams multiple times, friends coming and going. The turnover at the company is incredibly high, but this is my first job out of college, so yeah I didn't think it would be my dream job. I didn't expect it to be this bad. In my time here, I have not gotten any of my full bonuses (3 quarters) because everything I get halfway through a quarter, they switch me to a new team and my progress starts over. I took the job at 32k a year with a 10k bonus. For the city I am in, it's not possible to life off of that money without the bonus. Now I am making 42k with a 10k bonus but still have never gotten 100% of the potential.

 I also took the job because the recruiter told me that they like to promote people quickly. That was a blatant lie. The managers all know each other and I have heard of 3 cases of employees sleeping with managers for promotions. This makes it hard to dedicate myself to working hard to impress people when some idiot can offer their body and become a manager. The workplace is stressful, toxic, exhausting, and an hour from my house. With the daily traffic I experience, it is not unusual to have 2 hour drives home after work. I'm typically away from my house for 11 hours a day but only working for 8. 

The recent problems: 
My old 2nd level manager who I liked was let go and replaced with an absolute buffoon who is intent on changing the successful processes we have established with new, nonsensical ones that are causing us to lose sales and lose moral. This combined with a new 1st level manager who (surprise) slept with one of the married directors of the company and now he just promotes her so she doesn't say anything. It feels like my company is stuck in Mad Men times. Our stock is at an all time low, we are in a financial crisis and they just paid several million dollars to send corporate stockholders to Wimbledon. 

I am on a team that is helping one of the world's largest software companies make sales ro compete with the likes of Microsoft. It sounds cool, but they bombard us with tasks that do not count towards our bonuses. I have tried to express my concerns but nobody cares enough to challenge them. 

My situation:
I have applied to a friends company but was rejected for someone else that had more experience. My degree does not seem to be helping and I am currently regretting getting it. I dont have the option to go to in person interviews or else my current job will come down on me hard for not coming to work. I got married this year so no PTO to speak of. My wife was a teacher but quit after a terrible experience and multiple shooting threats. She is currently studying to be an actuary. I am the sole income earner. We spend roughly 2500 a month on all of our expenses and have around 7k in savings. I don't want to blow through it. 

I am currently having panic attacks and intense chest pains nearly every day at work that leave me hiding in the bathroom for awhile. I get physically ill in the mornings before I make the long drive to work and I cant seem to be cheered up until about 2 hours after I get home. I have no interest in anything physical with my wife till the weekend comes and i fall into a sadness when Sunday rolls around. I find myself to generally be a positive person but lately, I've been having dark thoughts. Wishing I was dead instead of being here. Suicidal thoughts a few times but they really scare me. It's not something I've dealt with before. I want my wife to have a career she loves and she should get a job in 30-40 days but I dont know how long I can last before having a mental breakdown. Also I have continued to gain weight and have no energy to workout or focus on eating well with my current work-life balance. 

Again, sorry for the long post. Any advice is appreciated. 

TLDR:
My job is stuck in 1960s style corporate management, is toxic and I hate my life being here. Wife should get a really good job in the next 1-2months but idk how much more I can take before I snap and get fired.",15Aug2019,1
636,"Backstory time: I’ve wanted to shave my head for a long time. My hair is damaged, baldness offers convenience and a fresh start, and it’s a bucket list item for me. I’m a young female, as stated in the title, which is where I’m worried things get complicated for job hunting.

Right now, I’m looking to switch jobs to something more professional/consecutive. I work in a retail store with lower hours, and I doubt I’m going to work up the ladder at that establishment. Therefore, I’ve been thinking of some jobs such as receptionist, bank teller, cashier at businesses less sales-based, or anything along those lines. I’m looking for something to stick with for a year or two to save up for schooling later.

Would having a shaved head as a female hurt me with finding a job like this? I’m not in a position where I’m desperate for a better job, but I really want to find something slightly better for my savings. I’m all about self expression, on one hand. On the other, I’m broke. What would be a wiser decision for now?

639,"So I’ve been wanting to take dance lessons for a long time now. I haven’t told my parents yet. I used to dance ballet as a little girl, but it was nothing serious. 

Two years ago, my parents told me to pick a sport that I’d want to train, because I apparently spend too much time in my room. I didn’t pick anything, but for the past year I’ve had a huge desire to dance.

My parents were just telling me a few days ago that dancing isn’t a sport and they acted all surprised when I told them that it actually is a sport. They just don’t like dancing at all. 

My problem is, I don’t want to tell my parents that I’d like to dance, because they’d laugh at me. Also I have no one that would want to dance with me, so I’d have to go there alone and I’m terrified of that, because I’m extremely shy.

I tell them what I am doing or update them on my life and I am bombarded with advice they’ve told me a hundred times. Go into trades trades will ALWAYS BE AROUND, WE ARENT GOING TO LISTEN TO ANY NEWS ABOUT AUTOMATION. Dont quit your crummy job that lies to you. Always be careful because the economy is always ready to collapse. You don’t have room to complain. You need to be patient. 

It makes me want to pop my eardrums.

Most of their advice is stuff I’m already doing, or is common sense shit anyway. All it does when they just throw this shit at me is feel like I’m a goddamn moronic failure who shouldn’t have any self worth (your job gives you a paycheck you have to make them happy), that anything I try is destined to fail (don’t take that risk or this chance the world is probably going to collapse on you) it feels like they want to hijack my life and drive it to the pit of waking up when your forty and hate living. 

Meanwhile any advice I offer is outright ignored. Even when I’m asked, I may as well be throwing up on my damn shirt! My job makes me feel like a chump for trying to do a good job (look at this work horse, he thinks working hard will pay off! Make him cover this shift but don’t let him have his birthday off, what’s he gonna do? He’s too stupid to do anything else! Honest chumps are the best)

I’m angry at family close up and I’m angry at society and the extremely wealthy broadly.

I just want to burn it all down, see some merciless justice exacted on the thieves and pedophiles that are draining our economy and robbing us all blind.

651,"I really love her and care about her, and I know she feels the same for me. But lately we've been so disconnected. The fact she's going to highschool still and I'm already going to college does make me uncomfortable in itself and I feel like she's embarrassed by me because of it sometimes. Not just that as of late she's just been sort of ignoring me. I don't want to be clingy or overbearing, but even the other day when she came over she didn't really interact much. Just sort of sat on her phone and took a nap on my shoulder, the most attention I got from her was when she started getting sort of sexual which bothered me since it was her idea not to get sexual. Which doesn't seem too bad, but I went out of my way to get her to come by talking to her parents and getting her out of trouble. It just felt kind of like she didn't care to come over anyways. We've been together for almost a year now and we haven't had any big problems. Mostly because we haven't had anything get too far between us, but with school I know for a fact it'll be tough and I'm not sure it'll be worth being in a relationship where she's just not trying as hard so I'm as alone as I used to be.

This is the shorter version :
I met this girl when I had moved countries because we were in a club together (it was once a week for 50 mins so that’s the time I saw her) for the second half of term of school. She was the exact opposite of me (outgoing, loud, crazy and weird) and I was too shy and quiet to feel comfy being her friend. Fast forward to term 2 and I joined the friend group she is in. We were a friend group of 7 (me and 6 other girls). 3 of them were best friends and the other three were best friends. So 2 groups of best friends that hung out together. I didn’t have best friends or friends and I was part of both bff groups so it was a bit weird but it was fine. The girl let’s call her Elise. Elise was in the group A with 2 others and the other bff group was 3 girls (call them group B) 
The main girl (the Regina George) of group B left school, one of them ditched us for popular girls group and the last one just stayed alone with no friends and kept to herself like always. Group A remained the same and whole and I joined them and became a bff of all them. One of the girls left in December 2018 for another country so then it was me and 2 others left and I’m very close with them and friends with them now. Elise is one of the 2

Elise came out to me and the girl that later left the country as bisexual in June of 2018. I came out to her and 2 bffs as pan.

At around October or November Elise found out I was self harming and gave me this long speech about how I’m selfish and stupid and an idiot and how I don’t have a right to feel sad cuz others have it worse than me (btw made me feel 100 times worse and made me think more about self harming again. Don’t do this to friends ever)
During that hurtful speech she stated she doesn’t wanna lose me because she likes me. She LIKE likes me.
I kinda knew but I wasn’t exactly sure. This made things a bit awkward but it was fine. We had a thing where our bff group said hi by hugs and she would give me LOOONG hugs and keep saying “I love you” over and over. It made me a bit uncomfortable but I let it slide. She also calls me babe and baby and it makes me so uncomfortable.
In March/April she became so flirty with me and she would do things like put on romantic music and say “this is for u” or “u know who this is for? You know what it means? ;)” . She would lean on my shoulders and do things that couples would do I guess.
Made me super uncomfortable but I didn’t do anything 
She then asked me out and said “just try it and if it works then great if not then we break up and go back to being friends!” And I said ya to try it out cuz i don’t even like her like that. I barely like her as a friend . My real bff is our other friend. 
Next day I broke up with her cuz I like someone else and it wouldn’t be fair towards her, ya know? 
So then she got so mad and salty and said I was avoiding her and stuff when in reality I wanted to be friends instead of gfs and I never wanted to avoid her but she avoided me. “Just try it out” she said. “We’ll go back to being friends” she said 
Since then she brings up the topic of me breaking her heart so much and anyone who I like like she hates and despises and gets made and salty af when I mention their name. She makes me do things like voice/video call ( which I hate so much and makes me so uncomfortable) by pressuring me and her excuse is that she “missed my voice” . I don’t know who to talk to or what to do. Where I live it’s illegal to be lgbt so everyone is also homophobic and I can’t talk to any teacher about it.

669,"UPDATE: For now, I managed to work as a full time temp with our IT guy upgrading our systems to Windows 10 and help with troubleshooting or fixing problems people have around the dealerships. Pay is still $10/hr but no bonus with this since I’m not in parts anymore. This position will last until the beginning of next year so it’s basically a grace period to look for something else. If the IT guy likes me enough he might keep me as full time but for now this will give me IT job experience I can add to my resume. This position is a better fit for me since I’m good with computers and it’s what I want to do as a career. Super happy something worked out for now but bills and stuff will be even more of a struggle. Just wanted to give an update!


I just want to start off by saying I didn't want to make this post. I usually never ask people for help but I don't have a choice at this point. Feel free to ask questions as I won't go into to much detail on things.

I currently work at a car dealership as a Parts Advisor/Assistant. I've been in this position for a month and I know absolutely nothing about cars and our types of cars in general. In this department they use CDK which is a popular auto dealer software that many dealerships use. It allows you to do all the business related things with certain op codes. They also use a software called StarParts which is the Mopar catalog that can give you any part in the entire vehicle with or without the VIN#. During this time I've tried to learn these 2 programs the best I can and I simply just can't make it click. There are just so many steps to each task and I get things mixed up with other tasks.

My boss approached me today after lunch and said that I'm not a good fit for this position because of my in-experience with cars, constantly have to go back over my mistakes, and ""laziness"". The thing is, I still barely know what I'm doing half the time and I've told him numerous times that I'm trying my best to learn and just to be patient with me but I guess his patience is gone. The other 2 advisors help me anytime I have a question which I was very thankful to have but I think they're also fed up with me. I make $10/hr with a bonus every month from our departments gross profit. It's not much but it helps pay rent and helps out alot.

I'm pretty good with computers and that's what I actually want to get into as a career so I've been helping our IT guy upgrade all of our systems to Windows 10. I immediately asked him if there was a position he had available but he would have to talk with our HR department and go from there.

It's unfortunate this happens during the situation I'm in because I'm 21, paying all of my bills including my mothers. I barely make enough a month to get us by and now if lose this job I will be living in my car soon. My mother has suffered from depression for years and now drinks to ""cope"" with it and has became lazy and can't get a job to help. We also just had to put our dog down which has made things 10x worse and I'm to my breaking point of just leaving my mom and letting her figure shit out on her own since she's not getting any better. It seems like nothing has went right or gotten any better in the past 8-9 months and I don't expect it to get any better.",15Aug2019,1
670,"so maybe this makes me awful but my brother is three ( about to turn four) and man, i'm just. starting to have super negative feelings about him? I would never hurt him or anything but goddamn I'm signifigantly less fond of him than what I would see as normal? 
I don't know. Maybe it's because my parents make me babysit for no pay, and I know I shouldn't be whiny about it... but he's throwing tantrums constantly and whenever I ignore him or try to discipline him ( through time outs or whatever) they say I am being too harsh with him. I babysit for hours, and I guess I'm just sort of pissed that they act like I am awful and mean whenever I get annoyed and don't want to play with him. He can do anything: hit, punch, kick, scream, and they might get a little mad, but if I so much as forget to help wash dishes I get yelled at. I know that he is a baby and I am almost an adult, but I guess I just am mad that I'm expected to do so much perfectly. I'm starting to take out my frustrations on him: not in terms of abuse, I just don't play with him as much and get annoyed with him often. I guess my question is, 1: how can I handle my frustration and anger in a healthy way ( any coping mechanisms?) and 2: should I try to talk to my mom about how I am feeling, or just deal with it myself?",15Aug2019,1
671,"I have a wedgie fetish, and it’s something that I have a lot of shame around. In my last relationship, I opened up to my partner about it, and we incorporated them into foreplay. It added a lot of fun and intensity to our sex life, and it was our special thing.

The relationship was incredibly abusive, with a common theme being her threatening to kill herself if I expressed that I felt controlled and unhappy with her. I broke things off with her, and after two weeks of her trying to get back together, I blocked her. 

Since then, she has mentioned my kink on her social media on two separate occasions, one of which showing dirty texts I sent her describing the act in detail, which sounds extremely cringey when removed from the context. She removed my name in both of them, but her followers know who I am because of how heavily she documented our relationship on instagram. I have had multiple people directly message me telling me that I’m a bad boyfriend for hurting her, and making fun of my kink. I have since deleted all my social media, but it hurts knowing that there are people out there who know nothing about me besides the odd thing that turns me on.

I do not want to pursue legal action or get revenge on her in anyway. I still really love her, even though she hurt me extremely badly. I just wish things had turned out differently, because there are so many amazing things about her. 

I’m looking for any advice to move on. I’m thinking of talking about this with my therapist, but I’m ashamed of the fetish so it’s a huge leap for me. I don’t really have a support system, and even if I did, I don’t want to talk about my kink with any friends.",15Aug2019,2

673," Hi! Hoping for some advice.

I (F/27) have been dating my partner (M/28) for 7 1/2 years. We have a normal, loving relationship. He's never cheated, loving to me, my family and pets, and is always there when I need him. He typically does work on my mother's house, drives her to the store, etc--essentially anything she asks of him, he's there for her no matter what.

Over the last 7 1/2 years, my mother has been EXTREMELY against me dating my partner--even though they are now very close. Here's some reasons she thinks we should break up:

1. He's Irish (i'm black &amp; Hispanic)
2. He uses me (she had nothing to back this argument up with)
3. He's immature and needs to grow up ( lives on his own, raises his child single-handedly, pays him own bills, got a college degree, gets paid almost $30/HR with benefits)
4. I need to date more (she hates that he was my first big relationship that I stuck with)
5. My life revolves around him (I have friends, a full-time job and am studying for my MBA so I don't know how that would be possible)
6. He has a child (said child is over the house constantly, loves my mother and she dotes on him)

Now, I live with my mother, but my partner lives literally half a block away if not closer, so he's always around hanging out sometimes just with her.

The last few weeks she has been trying to have these 'sit-down' talks with me about the fact that she's CONVINCED he's a pill-popping drug addict. Now if she were being a caring mother like she swears this is about, I wouldn't be bothered. But I know for a fact he's not on drugs (he's straight-edge) and she has had so many of these bullshit talks about why I shouldn't be with him, I'm emotionally exhausted.

My question is--how should I handle her? We just had a phone call about this whole thing and it ended with me telling her I no longer want nor need her opinion or thoughts on my relationship. The conversation turned left almost immediately because anytime you disagree with her, that's what happens. I'm almost 28 years old and the last almost 8 years I've been dealing with anxiety over her issues with my partner that she refuses to let go.",15Aug2019,2
674,"A while back, I started to believe that none of my friends wanted to be around me. I would invite them to do something and they would decline. No problem, right? The problem is that I found out that they hung out with each other multiple times and never mentioned it to me. So... that sucks.

Since I was 13, I was always in the ""never text first"" mindset for 2 reasons:
1. I believed it made me look ""desperate""
2. I believed that I was intruding on others' lives and they didn't want to be bothered. If they wanted me, they'll message me.

That, unsurprisingly, has left me feeling very isolated. The issue, however, is that every time I *did* message first, I got very short responses and they seemed uninterested.

I eventually stopped messaging them, and haven't spoken to a ""friend"" in over a month.

I read this article today (will link below) and it has given me mixed feelings. One the one hand, I *am* ""testing"" people by not making any contact. On the other hand, they don't seem to want me to make contact. I'm caught between a rock and a hard place.

I don't know what to do. I can't go on without any social contact, but I have too much pride to be rejected with short messages, if I even get a reply to begin with.

Any advice? If you have questions, please ask. :)

Thank you. 

TL;DR: Rarely message friends first, they never message me. Short and uninterested responses when I do message them. No social contact as a result.",15Aug2019,1
675,"Hi all. As some of you may know, today is A-Level results day here in the UK, and that means that hundreds of students like me have received their final grades from their courses and are deciding on their next steps forward.  
Today was a good day, I got better grades than I expected (and was hoping for!) and have been accepted into my two top choices for universities - one far away and one closer to home.   
The further away university has the highest employability ratings in terms of the course offered, and some of the highest in general in England and seems like a nice place to be. The course is 3 years long by default, and they recommend that you take a year's placement to boost your employability, which means that there are a potential 4 years of timely - and monetary - investment to go to the far-away university.  
The university that is closer to home has a good reputation in terms of the subject, however it is not so highly regarded in terms of employability. The course is 2 years long by default and, with a placement year, that means that there is a potential of 3 years of investment. The closer to home university, however, has lowered fees due to it being in my county.  
I am lucky enough for university education to not be the sole option for me, however. I have some apprenticeships on the line and am constantly applying to more (3 in 4 tend to ignore me, annoyingly!). All of these apprenticeships are degree apprenticeships in the same area, so I end up with a degree in the subject area regardless of the above routes.   
The final option is to go straight into full or part-time work. Because I have only just finished school, with a few past jobs and A-Levels being the highest form of qualification, that means that I will realistically only be able to get jobs in retail or similar which, considering how much I dislike my current part-time job in retail, is not really an option I would like to go down.  
I am coming here for advice because I don't know who else to talk to. My friends are busy with sorting themselves out, so I don't want to come to them. My nuclear family have not been through university and so can only give their side of the debate. I just feel lost and a little overwhelmed. What I decide over the next few days will decide the course of my life from here on in.   
Who better to trust than 299,000 strangers on the internet, hey?  
Thank you for taking the time to read my post. I really hope you can give me some good advice.",15Aug2019,1

680,"So, I am so uncomfortable talking about this topic that I created a different reddit account to ask for help, just because if I write from my original account, it will be on my history.

People around me that are my age usually express their feelings on how they hate their body etc. For some reason, even though I know that people have similar issues and that they will not start seeing me differently, I remain silent about my own body issues and listen to others'. I don’t know why I can’t talk to anyone about it, but it just makes me really uncomfortable to know that others know I don’t like my body.

Most of my gal friends look at models on Instagram, and my guy friends look at bodybuilders/footballers and they hate their body. I keep getting told that I am lucky because I don’t aspire to have a body like a footballer, and I keep hearing that social media influencers naturally make girls uncomfortable with their bodies. Jesus fucking christ, my problem is way different.

My role models are punk rockers. Scratch that, rock musicians or metal musicians in general. I do get happy when my music sounds cool (I am very lucky because I have been making music since I was very young, so I am trained and I like to be really confident about my music). However, I see that these musicians are actually fucking thin. Like jesus christ. I am not thin, I have a healthy weight and height ratio, you could say that I am a guy with feminine type of curves, not in a Robert Plant way, in a very dysfunctional way. I am also hella short. I fucking hate this. My friends are lucky and they have no idea. I don’t eat at all and I do sports, while they eat a shit ton and don’t do anything at all but some fucking how, they look healthier than I do.

Can someone please come here and tell me that not all musicians look like Joey fucking Ramone?",15Aug2019,1

I've always been a homebody, never leaving my house much cause I just didn't have the desire to do so, but lately, I've been feeling so shitty and I honestly don't know what else to do other than write down on a post on Reddit. I guess what really makes me feel lonely is that missing connection with people, yes I'm social, yes I have 2 great loving parents I talk with daily, friends I message daily. And yes they do care about me and I know that but it's not the same as someone liking you.

I don't know if it's naive to say this but I guess I'm just looking for someone who cares about me on another level and who I can care for on another level other then friends. I'm prepared to work for it but I just don't know where to start, I want to meet people and have some sort of relationship, after all, I've never had one.

TL;DR I'm feeling lonely and want to know what it's like having a relationship since I think that's what I need in my life right now, please let me know where I can start.

682,"Life decision advice needed:

First let me give you some context. I am a greek student in Athens, my parents live in an island, and we dont get along very well. I dont have many courses left for my degree so i dont have to attend classes anymore. 

At the end of September I will have to leave my house cause the contract is expiring, and - details dont matter - i cant renew it.
As most of you might already know, Greece's economy is really shitty, and all of my salary goes to living expenses. Plus, I don't get any financial help from my parents. 

So, my options are:
1) Find a new house in Athens (which I love as a city) and continue surviving with the shitty salary.
 
2) Go live with my parents and find a job there. Pro: I will not have any living expenses and my salary will stay untouched and i will be able to collect some money for a master's degree or whatever. Con: I get to live with my parents and we'll fight all the time and I'll be miserable. 

3) Move to London. My best friend lives there and he offered to help me find a house and lend me some money to get started. I haven't really thought of all the pros and cons yet, but some of the pros: I know that I won't be spending all of my salary just in living expenses. Once i get my degree in January i will be able to find a job on my field  of study (in greece i wouldn't find a job anyway and i would be forced to continue being a waitress). A con, well not all things in life go according to plan, so I might end up owing money and being unable to pay my friend back.

He treated his girlfriends terribly, lied constantly, even though he was genuinely in love with each of them, he just had problems. He tried to stab someone in his own family and had be put in the psych ward once or twice. He was a very angry, violent person. Fucked with the psych ward staff a LOT. I met him at an alternative school after he started taking his meds properly, and lived in a much safer environment, with no toxic, hoarding, insane mother. 

He’s not that person anymore. He’s one of the most charming, kind, genuine people I’ve ever met. He treats me like a queen, much better than I deserve, and totally out of my league.

He’s the perfect guy. Almost too perfect to be true. 

Is it possible he’s really changed? Should I trust him?

686,"I fell ill earlier in the week with a fever that turned into strep throat. My supervisor is out, so I made sure to email him that I would be staying home (but still working as to not fall behind in my tasks). I came back in on Wednesday, but the fever rose higher and I was told by two people at work to go home, as it's irresponsible to be sick at work and that I should rest. I stayed the rest of the day, and then made my way to urgent care where I was given antibiotics and the instructions to stay home for one day while they kick in.

So I emailed my supervisor again, screenshotting the doctors note stating I was not to come into work the next day and repeated the message that I will be working from home again but if I was required to enter PTO, please let me know and I will do that.

Another person in my department (a higher title than me but in no way someone I report to) emailed me on my second day out basically scolding me for taking advantage of the company's work from home policy and that my supervisor's boss (an exec) was notified. I replied attaching the email to my supervisor indicating my doctors note, but all she replied with was that I should have been sent that email in the first place.

I wanted to reply with ""well I do not report to you so why would I"", but that would only cause trouble. Should I confront my supervisor about this when he comes back? I'm really afraid this left a bad taste in my supervisor's boss who handles the promotions at the end of the year.

It's also super fucking confusing when you have some people who expect you to work through any illness but then others who look down on you for potentially getting everyone else in the office sick. This person in my department always acts like I am a direct report to her, and I want to say something, but she has a higher title than me and has been with the company 5 times as long as me, so I feel like that would only backfire.",15Aug2019,1

689,"**Background**

Friends for 4 years, we kissed 2 years ago and were always quite flirty. Most of our discussions were about serious topics and we supported each other when in need.

**What happened**

Fast-forward a month ago, I was at his place, one thing led to another and we slept together. We also talked about our feelings and we got a bit emotional, on the verge of crying. We have romantic feelings for each other and are very much alike in many aspects, but a long-term relationship is impossible because:

- I'm going through a break-up after a long-term, long-distance relationship
- we're still different in many aspects
- he is going to live abroad
- he wants kids, I am almost sure I don't

**The problem**

When we text, each of us used to reply after a week or so, but after we hooked up we texted every day for a while (including about planning the next meeting), then he stopped replying when he went on a big trip abroad. He is still abroad (my last text was about playing an online game with him, so it's impossible because he doesn't have his laptop anyway), but will move abroad soon, so I don't know if I should ask him when he is going to be in my city. 

**I admit that...**

I would like us to sleep together again, but I mostly want to see him and just that. How should I even text him?",15Aug2019,1
690,"So some strange stuff is happening to me and I don't know if I'm going crazy, someone is playing a prank on me or whatever else.

3  weeks ago on Thursday I received a phone call from a blocked number on  my private mobile phone. I never pick up when a hidden number is calling  and let them speak onto my mailbox. And they did just that. The message  was something similar like this:

""Dear Mr. \[*My name*\], this is \[*Name of my landlord*\], from \[*My address*\] (we live in the same apartment building). I'm calling you in regards of your new apartment, please call me back.""

Strange  about this is that first, he never called me with hidden number before  and second, I don't plan to move apartments. I'm living in my current  apartment for over 2 years now. His voice sounded similar to my landlord  but I don't speak to him often so I don't know. Because I didn't  receive any more calls from him or any written letter I shrugged it off  as some scam call.

Today (again on  Thursday for whatever that's worth) I'm receiving a call from a hidden  number again. This time it was a female person calling and leaving the  following message:

""Dear Mr. \[*My name*\], this is \[*My personal contact from my bank*\], I'm calling you in regards of your account change, please call me back today or my colleague \[*Name of her actual colleague*\] tomorrow under the following number \[*Phone number*\].""

Getting  worried I called my Bank under their central number and they confirmed  the number given in the mailbox message as being the right one. So I  called her back but instead of her, or the mentioned colleague, a  different one answers the phone. I asked him if I used the proper number  and He said ""Yes, but both of them are on vacation this week."" So I  told him that I received a call from her today from a hidden number and  he got very confused understandably because she wasn't even present in  office all week. He checked my account and told me that he can't find  any reason anyone should have called me to begin with. I did have an  account change but that, just as me moving into my new apartment, is  over 2 years ago.

So what in the  actual f\*ck is going on?! If it's a scammer it makes no sense leaving  the actual number of my contact person on the voice mail. I could image a  hand full of people knowing my address and name of landlord who might  want to prank me but I can't imagine anyone knowing the name of my  contact at my bank and her number. None of this makes sense to me.

Does  anyone have any idea what is going on and/or what I should do? I do  have slight anxiety issues and am taking medication for it and the  situation at this point is driving me crazy. Especially because it just  makes no sense at all to me.

692,"Ok so just cutting straight to the chase. This is my  (18M) first real relationship. I was a senior in high school when this started (since graduated). This girl told me she liked me. Turned out I liked her too, but she was too busy to actually spend time with me. So I waited a month and still she’s too busy. Finally around 5 weeks later we have a date. She and I get somewhat intimate and I drop her back home. I see her once again after like a week very briefly (in the presence of her mom: meaning no intimacy). At this point I know our relationship will be short lived. Since we both are going to college. And so basically I keep asking her to do things and she keeps being busy. Then 4 weeks after our first date I see her again and we pick up sort of where we left off. But I saw her in a group setting and it couldn’t be that intimate, and she had to leave early. That was like June 14. After that I didn’t see her at all. And note that she solemnly responded to texts, and FaceTimes. As you can imagine I was blaming this on myself and this was causing me a great deal of stress. But the reason she was so busy was because she was practicing for this really big dance recital (it’s an indian thing called an arangetram). I saw her in that recital exactly a month later in July. Note that I’ve had minimal contact with her for the last month: I don’t know if we’re dating, or what’s going on. I don’t want to stress her out because she has a lot on her plate but I thought that after the arangetram she’d have time and we could discuss this. I spoke to her once during her recital and she told me that she felt bad for me and that we can try to do something “this week”. I said ok. About 4 days later I text her asking if we can (I refrained from me reaching out, since I’ve always been the one making the first move and I didn’t wanna seem like a creep) (I Also felt like [and I know this is irrational] that she didn’t really have feelings for me anymore and that she was just trying to be nice to spend time w me since I was asking for so long).  I decided to ask her because for the rest of the summer I’d be in Delhi, India with my family. Anyways I texted her four days later, and she responded back with “Hey, I’m actually on my way to the airport for India rn” (she’s from a different part that I cannot go to) but basically she didn’t even tell me she was going to India. I didn’t feel included at all in anything and like I know I’m not entitled to it and that she probably lost feelings for me or something (even though for some reason she insisted on cuddling and stuff even at her arangetram [when no one was looking ofc]). I never felt like her boyfriend but at that time I didn’t even feel like her friend or even an acquaintance. 

Ok so after she left I sorta texted her when I was a tiny bit under the influence of a couple shots of vodka (by no means drunk texting, I’m actually glad I sent these texts bc I would be too afraid to do so when I was completely sober). I basically told her that things shouldn’t be awkward between us and that the elephant in the room is the relationship we had and that we should just be friends. (Nothing about the stress, which I feel like is just sorta my problem overthinking all this stuff). She actually responded and she agreed to be friends and not awkward, and she also sorta apologized for ruining my first relationship but told me I was a great guy. I felt sorta obligated to say the same stuff but honestly for some reason I feel like she was just saying that stuff, and I honestly don’t know why. 

Anyways, I’m in India right now. And I just got a text from her today wishing me a happy belated birthday. It seemed like all that inflated “being nice stuff” like she called me an “amazing person” and again like it just didn’t seem sincere to me. I then had an entire conversation over text w her just now. And for some reason every time I talk to her I legit just feel bad. I feel like every compliment is hollow, yet I also feel like all of this is just my problem and it comes from me over thinking everything . Like legit every time anyone talks to me about her I just feel bad. Like what the hell is wrong with me: it was 2 times I saw herI need to get over myself.",15Aug2019,1

694,"Sorry, this is a long one: 

This girl has been watching my ig stories for over a year, she messaged me a couple times and I eventually saw it and replied. 

We sent voice messages and connected on a psychological level. She asks me to hang out, I eventually agree and I tell her to meet me in K-Town for a drink (Manhattan NYC).

She pulls up in a bat-mobile. An actual fuckin bat-mobile. 

I get in, she’s adorable- half Serbian, half Mongolian, subtle goth/punk look (black was the dominant tone in her style). She actually kinda looked like an anime character. 

She starts driving, and her energy is immediately attractive as she talks in a confident “don’t-fuck-with-me”, angsty tone. No negative energy was directed at me, but our conversation was very negative, in the best kind of way- we connected in this shared darkness.

She goes on a rant about how people never treat her with any respect because she’s a tiny girl and has a high-pitched voice (she sounds like a anime character). How people call her a bitch for not taking any shit from anyone, for holding people accountable for their mistakes, how everybody feels entitled to her and try to treat her like a child even though she’s “the fucking CEO”.

As she talks, it’s obvious to me that she’s frightfully intelligent, and is extremely aware (both self-aware and situationally-aware). In fact, she was so fucking smart and wild that I began to think she could be a possible sociopath. Either way, she was mesmerizing and super endearing, and I like hearing her talk, so I decided to go with it. 

Then she drives past k town and goes straight to the jersey bridge. I ask her where we’re going, she says “I figured we could just go to my place and just talk”. Risky as fuck, but I didn’t care, I was fine with it. But I made a mental note of it since she pulled a slick move. 

We pull up to a 5 story Beverly-hills style mansion with huge rectangular windows. It looks like a bigger version of the Cullen’s house from twilight, but the inside was far more sophisticated.

The metropolitan museum of art is the quickest way to paint a visual of the interior. Beautiful antique furniture, framed paintings of all different sizes completely covered the walls, a chandelier, marble chess set, an elevator with a real “canal st” subway sign (full-sized), a bonsai garden outside. It’s a lot to take in.

I watched her calculate every move-

 1. She makes me coffee, we talk on the coach, she waits for my coffee to be half-done until she invites me upstairs for hookah. 

2. We go up one flight, and she grabs a couple hoodies from one of the rooms, hands me one. 

3. We got up another flight and go on the balcony to smoke hookah (beautiful close up view of the manhattan skyline). Our conversation is deep and personal, she tears up a little as we relate to each other’s past trauma. Then the hookah finishes. 

4. She mentions that she owns a violin and invites me upstairs to her room to find it. Once in her room, we sit on the bed and she hands me a guitar so I could play for her (putting me in the position to serenade her). I play some flamenco finger picking guitar, classical Spanish melodies for the most part. Then I play her an original song on the violin. 

5. She stares me dead in the eyes in silence for a few seconds before giving me one of the warmest, tightest hugs I’ve ever had in my life. We fall backwards onto the bed, and suddenly it’s two days later. 

The experience was indescribable. It felt like there were magnets in our chests pulling at each other- we spent at least 3 hours just hugging, kissing, and nuzzling each other before it got sexual. Penetration didn’t even happen until the sun was out, and that was only the first night. 

We somehow went through the entire next day, and fell asleep holding each other. For reference, I got to her place on Friday night and left Sunday night, but time didn’t seem to exist anymore. We spent hours staring each other in the eyes and it was a surreal emotional experience. Then she says it- “I love you”.

I don’t say it back, I don’t react further than an eye twitch- I don’t know how to respond. She flat out pulled a Ted Mosby on me. But it doesn’t feel awkward. Girls have prematurely professed their love for me a few times before, so I’m used to it at this point and sometimes expect it/have a prepared response. Not this time. 

She pulls out an astrology book and connects our signs/numbers to our theoretical relationship, and claims that we are linked by the soul. She says she’s been looking for her “twin” her entire life, and now that she’s found me, she doesn’t want to waste any time; she wants to be with me. 

I calmly explain that we should find out if we’re compatible first, and she’s happy with that answer because she knows I already want to wife her up, she can pretty much accurately read about 60% of my thoughts based off my facial expressions and body language at this point. And she knows that I know she can read me. 

She casually tells me she loves me again, and that she’s never experienced a connection like this, referencing the strong magnetic pull that had us squeezing each other so tightly that our bones would pop. I don’t feel pressured when she says it, I don’t feel forced. I don’t feel like I’ve even been seduced. And I still don’t trust her- by now I’m sure she has sociopathic tendencies, but that was fine as long as her intent wasn’t malicious. 

She drives me home Sunday night and parks under the above-ground subway bridge. It’s late, but the streets are packed, and the neon lights flash through the windows of her bat-mobile, illuminating her face. She looks sad. 

She started opening up about her feelings: 

“What we experienced was beyond sexual”
“This wasn’t normal, I’ve never felt anything like this before”
“Our souls touched”
“I love you”
“What do you want me to be?”

I tell her I would ideally want a relationship with her, once time reveals our compatibility. She hugs me, kisses me, hugs me again. She doesn’t feel desperate. She feels lonely. She’s holding on to me like she doesn’t want to ever let go, and I realize I’d been holding on to her for dear life the entire weekend. This is some spooky shit.

She mentions she’d like me to move in with her eventually, and somehow doesn’t sound psycho or possessive or controlling- just stating what she would want. But never speaking with force, never speaking with the intent to guilt-trip me, never speaking to influence my mind. It felt genuine. 

As soon as I close the door to her bat-mobile, I felt a wave of intense energy fall off my shoulders, and I was back on planet earth. Literally felt like I had just got out of a time-machine or spaceship or some shit. 

She messages me as soon as she gets home, sends several memes of couples hugging with quotes about how good a relationship can be. This continues on for two days, messaging back and forth, her talking to me openly about how she feels about me, how she misses me, etc.

I like her, but it’s obvious she’s fucking dangerous. Intelligent as fuck and pretty much a walking lie-defector. She reads people on a level that’s borderline Sherlock . She speaks 7 languages, has a photographic memory, plays 3 instruments, draws, gardens, snowboards, writes academic journals, was a psychologist, a real-estate agent, a financial-advisor, a company owner, and a math wizz. And that’s just from the top of my head...

But her most dangerous trait was her seemingly-sociopathic amount of awareness. Every choice she made had purpose. She told me she had “fallen onto my lap”, but I literally just replied to her on ig. All I did was show up. She took me to her place, she moved me in steps up to her room, she gave me instruments to play for her while on the bed, she made the first move. 

We meet again a few days later at a bar by my place (I didn’t give her my address). She had just got off work and wanted to see me, I told her I’d keep her updated. She waited for me in the city for several hours, and when i texted her I was free she asked if she could come meet me. I didn’t realize she had waited in the city just for a chance to see me (she occupied her time by shopping, meeting with some friends in a tattoo shop she frequents, drove around).

Fuck it. I meet her at a bar by my flat, but don’t invite her over (could be dangerous still). I like her, she’s super unique and kind of amazing, but I ain’t in love.

First time we hang out in public, she gets out her bat-mobile and hugs me like she hasn’t seen me in years, then we walk in the bar. I buy her a beer, she waits behind me and doesn’t interact with anybody. The bar has an outdoor patio in the back, completely made of wood with a sun roof. We’re the only ones sitting out there, Christmas lights dangling from the ceiling, the night sky peeking through the beams as the above-ground 7 train passes through in the distance.

We barely touch our beers, and we talk until the bar closes. Then she asks me if I wanna go on a walk, so I take her around my neighborhood and we talk until 4:00 am. All night, walking and talking while taking random seats on a park bench, stairs of a church, entrance to the train station, etc. She seems so happy to just be spending time with me. When I tell her I gotta go, it seems she genuinely doesn’t want to leave, but doesn’t impose. She asks me if she can keep me, I say “did you seriously just quote caper the friendly ghost?”. 
She knows she has me, so she doesn’t push. She knows she isn’t making me feel uncomfortable. She knows I think it’s weird, but she still smiles and hugs me tight before kissing me goodbye.

The next day, she bought a $2,000 hand made violin, made from Japanese wood but crafted in Italy, the last of its kind before the maker died. She tells me it would be more for me than her.
The day after that, she gets in touch with her friend that owns a management company- the same management team that managed matchbox 20, David Bowie, George Michael, etc. and connects me to them. Then sends me a poetic essay she wrote about what she thought “love” was (written several years ago as she claimed). 

That night, I got home at 12:00 am, she messages me asking if she can come give me a hug. She’s by my flat in 30 mins, and we go for another walk, skipping the bar since we barely touched our drinks last time. 

This girl walked with me and talked with me from around 12:30 to 6:00 am, and not once showed any signs of being bored or entitled. She genuinely loved talking to me, and I loved talking to her. 5 1/2 hours of walking, sitting, cuddling n shit, and talking. And it flew by, still she didn’t want to leave again. But this time she had to work and needed to get some sleep, so she drove home and messaged me some romantic shit before passing out. 

This. Girl. Is. Fucking. Insane. 

She’s so obviously mental, she ain’t even hiding it nor denying it. She acknowledges it. I know she has the power to fuck with people’s heads. I know she intimidates the shit out of everyone. But she’s treated me with nothing but respect and even helped me come to terms with a couple of my own demons. 

She has real empathy. She’s suffered. Her brain is like an encyclopedia, she knows a little bit about everything. She’s successful and she’s lonely. And for some reason, she’s so quickly set on me? 

I really like this girl. She’s unreal, down to her Edward Cullen mansion on top of a hill in New Jersey, to her bat-mobile parked in its garage. 
But if she fucks with me, if she ever becomes an obstacle or even hints at it, I won’t hesitate to drop her. 

When I told her this, she promised me that she would never get in my way, and that her only intent was to “join me on my journey”. 
When I asked why, she said something along the lines of: 

“I don’t wanna live and die alone anymore. I need someone with me. And you’re the only guy I’ve ever met that hasn’t tried to control me. And I already know you won’t. I know you won’t take me for granted”. 

So this shit is crazy is basically the theme here.
I think I honestly might end up dating her, but these flags..  are they red flags? I think they are, but it’s getting harder to tell. It’s not a normal situation at all. 

Any advice/opinions would be greatly appreciated.",15Aug2019,1
695,"All I can remember is*constant*, raging arguments from my parents. When I hit my teen years my relationship with my dad completely broke down because he’s an alcoholic/narcissist/controlling/aggressive/general asshole. I absolutely hated my home life and pushed away my family a lot during these years. Moving away for uni three years ago was the easiest decision/transition of my life. I didn’t struggle or get homesick at all and I hated having to go home (still do). I think I have repaired my relationship with my mom now but I don’t love my dad at all. I also don’t necessarily feel anything towards my younger siblings. I feel like an asshole for being so detached and not caring about them. Has anyone had similar feelings?

One thing wouldn’t be a problem if doctors had seen it when I was a kid and fixed it, now I’m 20 and it’s an irreversible problem that is making it so I can never fulfill my lifelong dream. I’m so depressed and I have no motivation to do anything anymore, I have no motivation to hang out with friends, go back to school next week, shower or brush my teeth even. Im having second thoughts about my major in college that I’ve wanted to do since I was a kid, and I’m going into my 3rd year, and it’s too late to back out or change anything. I don’t even know what else I would want to do anyway. I am on antidepressants but I don’t think it’s working evidently. I just keep thinking that if I could ever magically have a way to restart my life with all the knowledge I have now I would be such a better person. My life would be so much better.

700,"None of my friends or family know how I feel because I'm too stubborn and prideful to admit that I think I've made a mistake. 

I've been studying the Japanese language for six years now and I did multiple student exchanges throughout highschool, so going to a 4-year university in Japan seemed like the next step towards fluency. I was accepted into my dream school in Tokyo back in February and, at the time, I had zero doubts. But now my move in date is a month away and I don't think I can do this. 

It's not the language barrier that I'm afraid of. It's leaving all of my friends, my entire family, favorite snacks and familiar places that I'm afraid of. Really, really afraid of. I have a few friends in Japan from my exchanges, but I'm not close with any of them at all. 

It's really difficult to get close with Japanese people as an American because of cultural barriers. I know that I'll meet new friends in Tokyo, but I'm scared of not having as close of a relationship with them compared to my friends back home. 

I know I'm going to feel incredibly lonely and isolated. I already do as is. I have struggled with manic depression my entire life and I fear that I'm going to kill myself while I'm there. 

The closer it gets to the date of my flight, the more upset and nervous I get. My parents tell me that I can come home from school any time if it gets to be too much, but I'm so stubborn that I know I won't. Even if it means I have constant suicidal thoughts for the next four years. I don't know if I can do it. 

How do I cope with this? Who should I talk to? What would I say? Am I being irrational?",15Aug2019,1
701,"disclaimer- throw away account

i'm looking for more of a convo, because i understand giving advice about love and whether someone is or isn't feeling it is impossible. i'm more looking to have a back and forth convo with a few people, either publicly here or through dm's, to help me figure out what i'm feeling. i don't have any friends other than my best friend who this is about, and there's no one in my family i speak with, so having others to talk this through with would be really helpful.

me (38/f) and my best friend (37/m) have known each other since we were 10, and while we haven't always been in touch, our friendship is definitely one of those where we always come back to each other. we genuinely love each other, and both know undoubtedly that the other will be there when needed. 

when we were about 14, we decided to ""date"" and were girlfriend and boyfriend for a bit. i don't remember why it didn't work out, but i'm sure he does, partially because his memory is better than mine, partially because he has less trauma and fear related to emotions, so he doesn't forget experiences like i do. also, i know he was \*really\* into me back then and that our breakup hurt him, a lot. not to say it didn't hurt me, just saying that i tend to allow myself to forget painful experiences, especially when i was younger and didn't know how to handle emotions for shit. 

what i do clearly remember though, is that even after we broke up, we had a convo about always being there for each other, and that if we were still single later in life, we'd marry each other. i want to say originally, we said when we hit 30 but i remember thinking 30 is still mad young! maybe when we're in our 50s, not because we're old then but because if i'm 50 and still single, i'd really be craving cuddles and intimacy and why not have it w/ my best friend? again, i handle emotions very badly, even the good ones that're supposed to be calming like real, platonic love. 

so here we are, in our late 30s, both veeeeeery single and hating it. we both have strong personalities, been told we come off controlling, too much, not enough, blah blah blah, and are both struggling to find a partner to share our life with. a few months ago i told him how much i appreciate being able to comfortably chill w/ him and never feel like he's staring at my body, or that when he hugs me there's anything sexual there. he replied that he loves me and is happy i don't feel like he's tryna fuck me ahahahha. 

he's been single for a while, and i was dating someone for 2 or 3 months, but we just broke up a few days ago. as mentioned, i don't handle emotions well, so i know the break up isn't personal and there's nothing wrong w/ me, but i'm still struggling because i am a very social being and aware that i thrive in life when i have a partner. i don't neeeeeed a guy, but i do WANT one and at 38, i've been single enough to know my desire for a partner doesn't come from a place of need. so don't worry, this isn't a situation of being needy and unable to be alone.

the biggest topic, the most important thing that we don't share a view on is the desire for kids- he wants them, i absolutely 100% confidently do not!! i don't know how strongly he wants kids and if meeting a women who didn't want them would be a deal breaker. he says he doesn't know and that he tries to keep his options open.

lately though, while there's no sexual tension btwn us (and i believe that's because we have such a tight, true friendship that we've lived in for so long), i go back and forth wondering if we'd be good together. and all these movies out about best friends finally hooking up after years of friendship and being happy together aren't helping! i know this topic is very old and these movies have existed through out movie history, nothing new. but they just don't help, you know?

and then last night, i had a dream that we were together! more like the beginnings of hooking up, where we were hanging out, walking somewhere, and he slowly took my hand and held it. the only other thing i remember right before waking up is that we kissed, and i woke up with my heart pounding, feeling at peace. but is this because

\- i want to be w/ him

\- because i just went through a break up

\- because i feel lonely

\- all of the above

\- something else i'm not seeing

how do i approach this, if at all? i fear that if i mention my possible feelings, he might reject them (there's always a chance) by saying that he wants kids, or that he has worked on no longer having feelings for me and so doesn't see me that way anymore (also possible). or what if he does feel the same, but then we don't work out? do i lose my only friend? obviously, i'll never know if i don't try, and none of you can tell me what would be best. which is why i'm asking for a discussion, to help me talk out my emotions and thoughts, see where they land and how i feel about them all. 

**tl;dr:** me (38/f) and my best friend (37/m) have been friends since we were 10. dated for a bit around 14 y.o, didn't work out, but we love each other so much we said if we're still single later in life, we'd marry each other. we're now both very single and have been for a long time (no long, fulfilling relationships for either in maybe 10 yrs). i'd like to have a discussion to help me figure out if i'm just extremely lonely, or if i'm possibly in love w/ him, and if so, do i tell him, how do i tell him, what do i doooooooo? help. please and thanks",15Aug2019,1
702,"So I recently moved into a house with an older lady. She’s retired and rents out the entire second floor of her house, so I get two bedrooms and a full bathroom to myself. We share the living room, kitchen, garage and basement. We get along fairly well, but she recently quit her part time job because of bad work conditions, so now she’s home all the time. I’m in my mid-20’s and living there to save up money and decide what to do about my job. I live in a pretty expensive area, so a roommate is kinda needed. 

Ok, so she’s kinda judgmental older lady. If I wear anything she considers inappropriate, I’ll hear a comment about it. Whatever fine, she’s grew up in a different time. She knows I’m trying to get back into shape, so she also comments on any food I eat. I’m not necessarily a vegetarian, but I don’t really eat meat. I don’t feel great after eating meat and I consider it a luxury you eat on special occasions. So I don’t really want to be eating meat everyday. It’s come to the point where I don’t want to go downstairs, to the kitchen to cook food, cause I’ll have to deal with her and started just doing meal replacement shakes, which isn’t really enough for my busy life style. 

She caught me last night as I was coming back home from the gym and commented on how she was worried about my eating habits and I wasn’t getting enough protein and I should start eating more meat. She comments that there is chicken in the fridge, but I have a thing against chicken. My mother, while she was on a diet years ago, ate chicken exclusively. I ate so much chicken, I got sick of chicken and ,in turn, meat. I learned to cook after that. She comments I should start eating hard boiled eggs, but I hate eggs. Then she says I should put tuna on my salads that I love. I don’t believe meat should really be on salads. Just personal preference. So trying to make peace, I tried to bargain to start eating tuna salad sandwiches before workouts. That wasn’t good enough. I have to be getting my meat on salads apparently. So I went up to my room for the rest of the night.

When I got to work this morning, she had emailed me a shit ton of articles on protein and how to get it through a vegetarian diet. I’m highly offended. Not only did I not request her to send me articles, she’s sticking her nose in my business. She acts like she’s my mother or grandmother and I’m sick of it. But I don’t at the moment have the financial means to move and a lot of places are already full that I’d be able to afford. I’d hate to get into another roommate situation. How do I tell her I don’t appreciate her ‘doing this for me’ and I’m an adult able to make my own decisions?",15Aug2019,1
703,"so firstly I'm sorry if this post is a mess, I'm extremely overwhelmed and having a hard time even grasping what's going on. its so messed up it doesn't feel real. 

possible trigger warning, mention of suicidal thoughts and death

over a year ago I started developing some really bad digestive problems and lost 40lbs. my doctor refused to run further tests after I had a clear colonoscopy and refused to say it could be anything but IBS. my weight continued to drop and around June of last year I was diagnosed in the ER with rectal intussusception, which had been dismissed as hemorrhoids for weeks at that point. from the ER, I was sent to a surgeon, who sent me to another surgeon, who sent me to another surgeon at a larger hospital out of town, who then sent me to another specialized surgeon at another large hospital out of town. he ran tests and confirmed that this was in fact a rectal intussusception and determined that I would definitely need surgery to repair it. keep in mind that this appointment wasn't until march (5 months ago) thanks to being passed from doctor to doctor for almost a year. all while still living with the intussusception and so called (worsening) IBS.  In April he decided he would book my surgery for June.  He brought me in the first week of June for my pre OP appointment and I was supposed to go to the office to pick a date immediately after the appointment, but of course his receptionist had left for the day at that point. the next day I called and couldn't get through for about two weeks. eventually they called me back to tell me that the surgeon no longer felt comfortable operating on me because he does not believe IBS caused this, and he wanted to find the underlying cause prior to surgery to prevent reoccurance. I was told all of this by the receptionist and she could not give any further info or even let me speak to him. all she could do was give me an appointment a month later. I took the appointment and immediately got on the phone with the previous surgeon. I explained what was going on and expressed that I was really struggling to live with this condition at this point. he told me there was no question about it that I needed the surgery and he brought me in the next week to discuss other options  for if the other surgeon decided he wouldn't operate. he examined me and saw that the rectal intussusception had progressed to full external rectal prolapse and got on the phone with the other surgeon to let him know I needed to be seen sooner. the other surgeon moved up my appointment to the next week and he brought me in just to tell me that he wanted to run further tests, but would be operating in the fall. I was extremely frustrated by this but I agreed to it because what else can I do. It's now middle of August and I havrny heard from anyone, my rectum is coming about an inch out of my body and is extremely uncomfortable,  my bladder and vagina have started to prolapse out as well, I've been on constant antibiotics for two months due to some stupid fever we cant find the cause of and no one will answer my calls or emails. I am 97lbs at 5'5 despite trying everything to maintain weight.  my ears ring when I stand and I can barely move around without fainting. I feel generally awful and am terrified that soon the blood flow will be cut off in my rectum/bowel and by the time I finally get in the hospital it will be too late. at this point I feel at the very least I will need a bowel resection, likely an ostomy, but I'm really concerned that I'm honestly just going to die soon. I'm worried that the fevers that I can't manage are a factor of my bowels poisoning me or something. there's no way of knowing what's going on because no one  will see me or even answer my calls. I've gone to the local ER multiple times for fevers and pain and vomiting and I'm always sent home with them telling me they cant treat me there and that I will need to wait for the surgeon. they just make me feel like I'm wasting their time at this point, so if this does turn to an emergency I will be too hesitant to go  and I'm worried by the time I suck it up it will be too late. I really dont understand in what world it is morally correct to leave a 20 year old girl at 97lbs with her bowels sticking out her body for over a year. I fully believe I will die soon if nothing gets done. every night I go to bed trying to accept that I'll never go to college or get a real job or have a family. it's horrible and there's absolutely nothing I can do and I'm almost ready to say fuck it and off myself because obviously if they have left me like this and let me get this bad for over a year, why should I believe they are ever actually going to do anything in time.  it feels like killing myself is truly the only way to make the pain and discomfort stop at this point because no one will do anything for me. I need someone to tell me what to do because I'm honestly at a loss. I cant live this way anymore . I dont even have it in me to get into the details but as you can imagine there are tons of details that make this condition very unbearable most days. someone please help me",15Aug2019,1

705,"I will be heading back to university in September out of town for my second year of a nursing program, but I'm considering dropping out. So far in the program it's been very boring but I've been told that the second year is a lot better so I'm a bit conflicted. On top of this the university I am attending is in a very small town away from my family and friends and I dread having to go to that town for another eight months. This is my third career change in university; I'm 24 and I've never gotten out of first year in university. Also, my mother is a nurse and she was really proud of me once I showed an interest in nursing, but I don't know if it's for me. 

I've been practicing programming online and it can be hard to motivate myself but I think in the long run once I start making my own stuff it will become more interesting. I'm considering taking a programming boot camp instead of going back to university, but I've also left everything to the last minute. I could go back to the nursing program and study programming in my spare time, but if I don't feel that passionate about it it seems like a waste of time and money. At the same time, if I drop out of university and end up hating programming I don't really have anything to fall back on because I left the nursing program. At this point staying in the nursing program just feels like the safe option but I'm not sure if I'll be happy with it.",15Aug2019,1
706,"Okay, hear me out, I'm just really confused right now and I'm not sure of this is normal because no one talks about this stuff (around here anyway). Basically, when I have a problem (IE: bad grade, had a fight, upset about something etc) I pretend that problem happens to someone else and it either effects me less or the problem just doesn't effect me at all. I pretend it happens to someone completely different to me so therefore my brain is tricked into thinking the problem didn't happen to me.

This makes me feel better but I've started thinking that maybe not everyone does that because someone was talking about something similar and said it was 'weird' and 'wrong'. They said only trauma victims do it, but I'm not a trauma victim of any kind I'm pretty sure so I'm confused. Why do I do it? Do any of you guys do it?",15Aug2019,1

712,"I made a throwaway because this is hard for me to talk about. My marriage has been really rough since I had my baby four months ago. I’ve been really depressed and anxious, and I haven’t done too much to try to lose the baby weight. My husband and I were arguing about something unrelated the other day, and in order to hurt my feelings, he told me that my body looks like a Hershey’s kiss. I guess it does, but I should mention he gained just as much weight as I did while I was pregnant. Obviously we are really unhealthy mentally and physically. After him saying that about my body, I can’t imagine ever letting him see me naked again. We are already in counseling but I feel like this is something that counseling can’t fix for me. I can’t imagine ever being able to let go of what he said. 

Divorce isn’t an option because he wants to take the baby 50-50 and I can’t live with that. So now I’m scared to let him see me changing or in the shower...In fact I don’t even want him to look at me with clothes on because I feel like he’s judging me. I’m also sad because sex was my favorite way of connecting with him. I don’t see how we will ever be able to heal our relationship. Even if I lose weight, I’ll never be able to forget what he said. 

So remember, divorce isn’t an option. What else can I possibly do? I’m so angry and sad. I just don’t know what would make me feel better. I do want to start working on losing the baby weight, but I don’t want him to think I’m doing it for him.",15Aug2019,1

This was the first dog I’ve ever owned, and I’d honestly call him my best friend. He saved my life a time or two when I was really depressed and was overall just an excellent partner for the 14 years he was part of my life.

The defense is trying to make it sound like I’m not a credible witness because I take medications for depression and anxiety. I don’t really know how to get past this because it makes my blood boil. His lawyer stated and I quote “her medication rendered her ability to remember she consented”. I was driven outside of the city during a storm and told to have sex with him or walk home. 

During the pre lim hearing it started to get to me and I had to remember to remain calm and not let him get to me. Now that it’s going to trial, I’m scared how I will react. It disgusts me how people think that victims of a sexual assault is less credible because they take medications. My story has never changed and I’ve never lied.

718,"Normally, this wouldn't be a big deal, so when I saw it pop up in my email, I ignored it. Several weeks passed, my wife noticed it and that's when the questions started. She thinks I stayed at this hotel and I am trying to prove to her that I didn't. 

Now for the details. This was at a Hampton Inn that I've never been to before. I have the folio with the details of the stay. My credit card was not used, but my Hilton Honors number, and thus, my name and email, were tied to the reservation somehow. When I called the hotel a few weeks after receiving the folio, they had already overwritten security footage. They do not have a copy of the license of the person who checked in and stayed there. I've spoken to the assistant GM and asked her to contact the payment processor to get a name for the credit card used to pay for the room. She was unable to give me a name but told me the credit card was from a specific bank (that I do not have an account at) and that that CC was present to be swiped in person.  I'm trying to get ahold of her again to encourage her to call the payment processor again, but I'm about at my wit's end, and my wife is growing increasingly upset about the situation and with me. This ""simple mistake"" feels like it's about to cost me my marriage. 

other details: i have pictures I took the day of that check-in at an airshow. last one taken around 4:30pm. Checkin was at 7pm. That doesn't clear me. My phone's GPS (via google maps) doesn't show any data for that time. We didn't watch anything on Netflix that night. 

Please, no relationship advice. I'm just looking for advice on how to uncover the name that was on the credit card that paid for the room, or for any other actions i can take that would show definitive proof that I did not stay there.",15Aug2019,1
719,"Serious Post This is a throw away account for the purposes of gathering information on what my mother needs to do about this mess. I was not there thru this but my mother was there in the room for the whole show. I’m asking for advice because she currently doesn’t have the will to do so on her own. My brother is dead and I think a hospital caused his death. I’ve refrained on naming the state or people in this case in the hopes or remaining anonymous during this trying time but may talk to individuals who’ve responded. Thanks in advance.
A short back story - my brother lived with my mother most of his adult life as a special needs person. He had a heart ablation surgery performed for an irregular heartbeat about 3 weeks before this event and had blood work and a general checkout done only a few days before this happened and at that time he showed to be fine.
On the day of his death he passed out and fell for some reason and it took some time (for mom it seemed ages) for him to recover. Since he’d had a recent surgery, out of abundance of caution, mom called an ambulance. He appeared fine by the time they arrived and the emt guys hooked him up to an ekg machine and said he looked fine. Still, being that he didn’t have any history of fainting, she let them take him to the hospital. Once he arrived he was given a cat scan, a chest xray, and they did some bloodwork. Someone determined, apparently from the bloodwork, that he was low on magnesium and an order was given for a magnesium iv drip. The nurse starting the drip had a problem with the machine. I’m no doctor but I guess there are machines that dispense iv drips at a certain rate or something that they use and this one was screaming that there was air in the line. Mom says it looked as if she was hitting the reset and repowering the device and did so a few times and shook the device - all the while it’s reporting air in the iv line. The nurse retrieved another machine and hooked it up and it said the same thing. Again she dis the reset/repower/shake and said the machines are unreliable, held up a section of line and said “See? No air.” And got a 3rd machine. Mom pointed to air further down the line and the nurse said that a trap will catch that. At no time did she disconnect the iv line thru this process. Later a doc arrived with an ultrasound machine to check mark’s chest and said his heart looked great and at that time my brother began to cough. His cough got worse, he began to phlegm and his temperature spiked to 102. Later he coughed up a handful of blood and his temp went down some and this is when he began to get some rest from his ordeal - up until this point he just wanted to go home. About an hour after he appeared to be sleeping they came back in and woke him up and started asking him questions. He couldn’t name the people in the room. He was gone shortly after that. They did more tests and my mother was told that they found his brain so inflamed that the damage was unsurvivable - had they cut his scull open to relieve the pressure, his brain would have exploded thru the open hole. The autopsy revealed that the cause of death was cerebral air embolism.

hey reddit! i kind of need advice of someone who is a little older than me. i have 2 trans friends, both male to female. one has been a longtime friend who recently told me she was trans and if i could call her she. the other friend i met on summercamp and we became friends really fast. then she told me she was a female in male body and basically how unhappy she was. now i dont know how they feel even though i’m trying to understand. they are both in the same situation, (not out to alot of people, MTF, too young to get transitioned, etc) so i was thinking about introducing them to eachother, so they can talk about their experiences and give support to the other. i feel like it would really help them, but i dont know how to introduce them to eachtother. does anyone have an idea how i can connect them without making it awkward?

726," 

I already posted before because I was getting hate comments and other vulgar stuff being said to me on an alt account. I am honestly just looking for advice on how to deal with some trauma

 What happened was there is a coffee shop near my house that I like to visit every morning, and parallel to the street the shop is on, there is a bus stand. As I was crossing the street, I saw a big, turbaned man standing and waiting, so I decided to start a conversation with him because in my town there are virtually zero sikhs/muslims/indians/south asians/middle eastern folk etc.

The conversation sort of went as follows:

Me: Hey

Him: Hey

Me; So are you a sikh or muslim? I honestly have no clue how to tell you guys apart

Him: I'm sikh

And after asking a few irrelevant questions like ""where are you from"" and ""do you live here"" and such which he responded in a disinterested and kind of annoyed tone, I wanted to make a joke which went like, "" hey, do you wanna know what's wrong with sikhs, the sikh community?"" ""Y'all are a bunch of sick fucks!"" (which I said not to bully or insult him, I just thought that was a clever play on words). After chuckling a little bit, the next thing I know the guy slaps me so hard and out of nowhere, I fell to the ground. The guy started yelling at me in Indian, and called me a bhenchod a couple times which is something i do know the meaning of prior to my interaction with him. It was so embarrassing and shocking, because this was the first time anyone has ever laid hands one me, let alone slapped me. When I got home, even though I am a grown man, I do admit that I did cry because the embarrassment and shock just poured out.

A few weeks have passed, and I still get really angry and embarrassed thinking about it, even when I'm in a good mood, this incident just pops into my head and immediately puts me in a bitter mood.

727,"Okay, so my last post about the secret hidden floor on my school was met with mixed reviews, but I remembered a couple of other things that may be important to the story. These are just some facts that I failed to mention in my first post. 

1.) When I first started talking and asking teachers about the staircase, the mayor of my town (small town) was just...in the school for a few days. I would spot him in the halls and classrooms, and when the door to the staircase was shut and locked and had the plaque changed, he wasn't around anymore. I asked a teacher why he was there and the teacher told me he was a substitute for the cooking teacher, but that didn't make sense since our cooking teacher wasn't gone at all when the mayor was there. Mayor also is friendly with everyone and works with the Lions Club that I talked about in part one.

2.) The Lions Club has a storage unit on school grounds that I have looked into the windows of, and it is absolutely full of rubbish and random supplies.

3.) There is always ""construction"" happening in the school, even when nothing seems to be changing. Last year they were allegedly doing construction on the back hallway where the door to the stairs is, and wouldn't let anyone in the hallway. I snuck into the hall during lunch with a friend and we heard odd noises coming from behind the door... didn't open it, though. Nothing was different about the hall or where they were working on when the construction crew packed up and left.

4.) Some of the teachers in the school have this weird look in their eyes constantly, and I'm not the only one who notices. Everyone agrees on the teachers who have it, and call them the ""Crazy eyed teachers"". These teachers ALWAYS chaperone at dances/events and seem to have the most power of any others. I swear most of the crazy eyed hear voices, they never seem to be all there. All of the crazy eyed twitch and/or talk to themselves.

5.) In the back hallway that is connected to the door, there's way more cameras than in any part of the school. There's one spot with three all arranged in a triangle so they film every angle, and those aren't the only cameras in the hall either. 

6.) Both of the ladies at the front desk are named Cindy and if you leave the lunchroom during lunch or do something she doesn't like, she WILL find you on the cameras and hunt you down. 

7.) Our school COMMONLY partners with the Freemasons, and this graduation the Masons were there in full getup. They used to have a lodge where they conducted secret meetings not far from the school, on hospital grounds. 

8.) In the past two years alone, THREE well liked teachers have been fired for being predatory-two for being predatory towards children 15-17 years old. 

I would also like to clear up some theories from my last post, number one being that the plaque was not from the theater arts building. The rooms down there have names of their own. The arm and tits weren't from there either, as the theater arts building doesn't employ janitors, and they have their own storage area. I know this because I'm heavily involved in theater and have seen these things, and know the directors personally. Plus no plays have used props like that. I'm either in or watch them all, as well as work on props, so I would have seen them.

Second, J would likely have not told anyone about the arm/breasts since she's the type to heavily rationalize everything, and I don't have enough evidence to ask about it, plus if something weird really is happening, then I don't know who I can trust and would rather not risk it.

Third and lastly is that I don't believe it's an elaborate joke on me. Teachers aren't allowed to do that, and my friends just aren't the type to pull out all the stops and humor me for so long without the grande ""Sike!"" at the end-there is no end in sight. 

Anyway, I suppose that's all I've got until I can personally explore the upstairs. What do you guys think? Is there something weird going on in my town or am I genuinely losing my mind? The entire thing seems cultish to me.",15Aug2019,0

733,"TW: mention of death, depression, anxiety, mention of alcohol, mention of suicide and self harm 

Hello everyone,
I am 21 years old and a university student. I live in a small southern European country, so maybe some of you might be unfamiliar with some of the situations I am going to describe, but I am going to do my best to explain everything as good as possible.
 It all started 3 years ago, when I was still a highschool student. Here higher education is free, but you have to take some very difficult entrance exams to be able to study in university. I was always a good student in school, but despite all of my efforts, I didn't do too well in my entrance exams. I was still aple to join some good university courses though. My mom became furious with me, not because I didn't have access to some courses, but because she wanted me to have a good grade so she can be proud of me. She was being insulting and very hurtful to me nearly every day for around 4 months. Maybe this wouldn't be a big deal for a lot of people, but I am really sensitive and it really lowered my self esteem. I started developing a fear of death and I was anxious that and mother will die before I have the time to make up for my bad grades. She used to say that she's going to be sad about it until she turns 80, so I felt that there's nothing that I can do to make her happy and have a good mother/daughter relationship. I started developing an identity crisis and I was afraid that I was losing myself, I couldn't really understand who I was at some point, something that caused me great anxiety. Meanwhile, I was pretending that everything is good to my family, so my mother doesn't find more reasons to blame me. I started university with a very bad mood, I did well in year one, even though I wasn't motivated at all about it. After what happened with my mother last summer, I couldn't really focus on studying or in lesson, and I feel that I did good because I was too lucky. Next year, I found a job as a tutor. It was a good experience itself, but it caused me even more anxiety and I ended up taking zero exams in uni because I felt like I was unprepared for them. I still had the identity crisis that I mentioned. My escape was my mobile phone, something that ended up making me addicted to it, spending around 8 hours a day using it, feeling like I'm wasting my life but not being able to cut the use. In the end of year 2,i found a boyfriend, with who I had a really weird relationship with. You can read about it in my post history if you're interested. The whole situation with him made me even more depressed and led me to drinking alcohol to escape, aside from my phone. I was getting anxiety attacks all the time, sweating in bed from the stress and not being able to sleep. My mother kept giving me a hard time throughout the years, but not as intensely as after the entrance exams. I didn't mention that during everything, one more coping mechanism I had was self harming by punching or cutting myself, a habit that I've had since I was younger. Also, this year I did a suicide attempt, but it failed.

Fast forward to now, I am still with my boyfriend, who has really changed his behavior and I'm getting ready for my fourth year of university. In my country, the minimum you can do is 4 years, but most people do some extra time. I'll probably do one extra semester if everything goes well. Despite things being a little better, such as the fact that my parents have been more supportive, my mother understood her toxic behaviour and is trying to change it and that I am now seeing a psychologist, things are still extremely difficult for me. I am trying to use my phone less, I've cut down alcohol, i am trying to study so I pass my lessons and my grades don't drop, but I feel like i can't make it. There's nothing that I'm motivated to do nor that I feel like i can do. Despite things being a bit better since May, I did another suicide attempt in July, and I still get panic attacks from time to time. It feels like not being here anymore is the only way for me sometimes.
Thank you if you reached this point of my text. Basically, I need help for turning my life around, but it feels extremely difficult after all these years, because I keep falling in old habits, such as extreme phone usage and self harm.

734,"Multiple people have told me that my voice is annoying. I talk a lot (I mean A LOT) and very loudly (I’m not aware of that, it’s just how I’ve been my entire life so I guess you could say my voice is very strong). I’ve become very self conscious about it in the past couple of months. 
I don’t know how constructive others opinion is because whenever I hear a recording in which I speak I hate my voice but I know that’s how everyone is since we are not used to our “real” voice.
Please any kind of advice would be helpful (except shit like “just get over it” or “don’t listen to them” because that doesn’t help my situation whatsoever.",15Aug2019,1
735,"So my friend isn’t very self-aware, she often says things without thinking and admits to never feeling empathy to others which she blames on her “lack of conscience”. She was still a great friend and I knew she was slightly exaggerating when saying she would never feel empathy, but her attitude would sometimes create problems or arguments.

So today we were talking and I forgot how but she brought up her feeling “no conscience”.  She told me it was all because when she first met me she didn’t want to be anything like me so she somehow threw away her “conscience”.  At first I laughed, thinking she was joking but to my horror she wasn’t. 

Now I can kind of see how this is because I am prone to a lot of anxiety, but I can’t help but feel deeply hurt by she saying this, that she would actively try NOT to be like me so much it would become a pivotal point of her personality.  Another bad implication is that it was MY FAULT for her bad behaviours, and I can’t help but feel very guilty. I just can’t stop feeling upset and angry at myself after she said that, and I don’t know what to do.

Is she justified in saying this? How should I tell her it upset me without being petty?

I’m really not sure what to do so any help would be appreciated!",15Aug2019,1

My current plan is to move in with a friend to split rent and work full time (possibly multiple jobs) in daycare and/or CNA work. 

I really don’t want to go to college for multiple personal reasons (I struggle heavily with school, I have a chronic illness, and I have ZERO money saved [my parents also have zero money for me]). All around I’m not in a place to go to school again.

I know there are pros and cons to both options but I’m honestly just so indecisive. I have no idea what to do.

Advice? Personal experiences? I’m not sure if I should apply to colleges just in case or stick with my current plan. I know I can always go to school later on.",15Aug2019,1
738,"Didn't know what sub I should post this, but I know I need advice so i chose this one. 

I am 16 about to turn 17 this weekend, my parents are divorced and my mother is coming to see me. I stay with my father in an apartment and my mother comes to visit when she can, she lives in another state so she doesn't visit as often as she'd like, but always comes on my birthday. They have been divorced for a few years, and there has never been any complications other than scheduling, but this weekend is my birthday and my parents and I have planned for her to come Saturday and she will leave Sunday before dinner. This is has been the way she has visited for the last few years. My parents have both moved on with my father having 2 serious relationships where I have met his girlfriend. During his first relationship after the divorce, my mother would visit me, and my father would stay at his girlfriend's house or at the apartment (my parents divorce was civil and they have remained friendly, so my mother staying the night in his home with him is not complicated.). Now he is in another relationship where his girlfriend often stays here when she is in town (she is a flight attendant so I guess she has some kind of layover thing IDK) which last a few days, and my dad knows in advanced when she is coming. I've told my father that I'm not comfortable with her staying here, as she has essentially moved in, but that could be another post. This weekend his girlfriend is coming, and my mother is coming. I told my mom this since my dad didn't tell her, and my mom is not happy. Both my mother and I think it is weird that all 4 of us will be under the same roof. The apartment isn't small, there is enough space for all of us, but everybody would definitely cross paths. My mom and I told my dad how we feel, but he just thinks that we are overreacting and that my mom should still sleep over unless she is really uncomfortable about it. There is probably more that I can say about the situation and how I am uncomfortable with my dad's girlfriend, but I feel this post is too long and that it could be made into a different post. So, I just want to know if my mom and I should feel uncomfortable with me, my mom, dad, and my dad's girlfriend staying together under the same roof, or if we are just overreacting. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Parents are divorced, I stay with my dad in an apartment. Mom is visiting this weekend for my birthday and staying the night. My dad's girlfriend is also going to be here. Me, my mom, my dad, and his girlfriend are all going to be at the apartment for the weekend. My mom and I are not comfortable with this. Dad says we are overreacting. 

If we are overreacting, advice on how to deal with it please.

If we are right in being uncomfortable, where do we go from here.",15Aug2019,2

My daughter’s birthday is coming up at the end of the month. Several months ago, my mother asked me if she could get my daughter a tricycle for her birthday present. I said I thought it was a great idea. I forgot about the tricycle until my husband and I were discussing what we are going to do for our daughter birthday this year. I told him that my mom was planning to get her a tricycle for her birthday. He said my mom could not get her a bike because he wanted to get it for her. To be more accurate, he is not going to buy her one but fix one up that our neighbor gave us. I think that is a very sweet idea but truth be told, my husband has a lot of ideas and projects, and he might start them, but does not finish them. There are many half-finished projects laying around. I don’t want to tell my mom no because she really is looking forward to getting it for her, but I also don’t want my husband to be ticked off if she gets her the tricycle.  I also don’t want to tell my mom no and then have my husband not finish the bike we already have. My mother and husband have had a rocky relationship in the past and recently it’s starting to become more amicable. I would hate to mess things up now that they’re starting to get along better. If my mother lived closer, I would say that my daughter could have a bike at both places, but my daughter visits my mother maybe 4 or 5 times a year. So there really isn’t a need for two bikes. I’m not sure how to handle this situation.",15Aug2019,0

I am 19, moved from a town  into a big city, working in a widely known tourist attraction and yet, I am getting bored and it's eating me up inside. 

I got nothing to do at work. While others get loaded with tasks, i don't have much to do. My job is to research, order new things and spare parts and to have a huge knowledge over my ""department"". But there is the problem. I am new to the job, working since july 1st, 2019. And most of my time I am spending with surfing and listening to music. I do have a very small list of things I could (!) do, but they are not necessary. And when I completed those tasks I am afraid that I again would not have anything to do. The mentioned knowledge is there. Without wanting to sound like a d*ck, but I have more knowledge about the department than most others. 

When I come home, I neither got something to do. No 
work needed to be done, no friends except two. I had to leave the rest back at the town. Yes, I can talk to my friends via discord or so. That is in my daily routine, but there are not often more than two others who still come 
online. The only glimpse of hope or happiness I get throughout the day js when a special girl is writing me, and no, I asked, she has no such feelings for me as I have for her. 

My hobbies, before I moved out, were model railways, working on my car or playing with my cat. But, as usual, my own flat is too small to contain a railway, also it costs alot. My project car is done by today, so this part is falling of and my cat stayed in the town. 

I probably am too pessimistic about it, but I don't know what to do. The answer will probably be easy and obvious, but right now I don't know any further. So- could you guys help me?",15Aug2019,0

751,"Okay, here’s some context. I am no longer able to recall exactly how old I was when this happened. But I was definitely in grade school. I think it is due to me suppressing the memory for so long, that I can’t remember the exact time it happened. But now it resurged about two weeks ago and I’ve been feeling a mixture of guilt and disgust about it, even though I know that objectively I was an innocent kid meaning no harm- I knew he would not wake up as he is a  heavy sleeper. From what I remember from whatever is left from the suppressed memory, I was watching some tv show where two people were french kissing, and being that it was the first time I saw anything like it, I was curious and wanted to try it out myself I guess? But the whole thing is just so weird and gross. I don’t know if I should tell my friends. I don’t know if I should see a therapist about it. Some part of me tried to convince myself that the memory was really just a dream, but the imagery when I think about it is too strong for that to be true. I’ve tried laughing it off and seeing the very humorous side of the whole situation, but that only helped me for about a day before I started feeling terrible again. All I know is that if I don’t do anything about it, the images it brings to mind will haunt me forever.",15Aug2019,1
752,"I am in similar situation. I just dumped 2 of my bff’s, because I felt that I didn’t feel good with them anymore. I am really sad that I had to go that way. But there was no other way. Let my steam off.
At first they were never a friends when we met. When we both went to musical school in middle school age. That time I was the center of everything in musical school. I know everyone, what friends with everyone. Everybody respected me, and I was sort of leader. It was big instance. It was also the best musical school in my country. I played violin. Still proud to study it there. Many of my school mates and friends now play in the highest lvl in classical music, like Vienna Philharmony or London. But yeah. One of them was guy who everybody bullied although he was not like everybody. I also always have felt different than other. In school I was smarter than many, but that didn’t show in grades. But in musical school I was king. So this guy was interesting. He was also really smart and I loved to talk with him. We developed great friendships, that carried through years. Even before that I had meet the other guy. His specialty was, it was always fun with him. We did bullshit and I loved the sweet and adrenaline filled adventures with him. We developed even deeper connection. Years went, we always held together. 
Once they met at my 16 birthday with my parents they had seen each other, but they weren’t friends. But instead of being cool with me, they started by making jokes at my expense. I didn’t feel to good as they also started acting weird. Isolating me and trying to escape me. It was my birthday and they never on their own did that. Jokes became meaner and meaner. After my birthday they started to hang out more and more with each other. They started to bully me. I felt really bad. I was forced to cut ties, as they became really really mean every time they saw me. They accused me of bullshit. Laughed as my worst bully. Even made racist and anti Semitic jokes. I’m Jewish who’s great grandparents were lost in concentration camps, whose 75% family got killed in camps. It was not funny. Now after few years I managed to create a divide between them. I began to hung out separately. I cultivate hate between them. They didn’t meet each other. Everything was splendid. This January I figured that 4 years have passed. And created a”by chance” Meeting where they met again. Actually it was a bit of mismanagement thing I had and failure in my plans, and was not 100% planed. But old habits came back. After being really afraid of loosing the one of them, the 2nd one as I tried to talk about my fears, consoled me, year his words don’t match action.I felt that the smart one (ex-friend) is planting behind my back. One time he even lied to me, that he is in different city, but when I visited the 2nds friends work as a surprise there he was. Also the best hey really try to make me feel like I don’t belong. Now I was forced to make a line again. Again I’m left alone. Happily I have 2 friends left, but our interest rarely match, I don’t enjoy much hanging around with them, recently I renewed few contacts, but one friend of mine that was quite close managed to betray me and threatened with compromat. I barely escaped huge trouble. Now aagain I’m left all alone. I’m sad and despite courage and a bit of charisma the relationship with girls are not working out the way I want them to. But I sure as hell have become fucking depressed despite my career and education going really well. I recently recognised, that I fill emptiness inside my chest with phone addiction, that actually make me feel really bad, but here go.",15Aug2019,1
753,"I recently arrived back in the US from Norway. I was an exchange student and I worked in the summer. I met a guy (he’s from Iceland) on Grindr and he lives in Norway now. We went out several times together and we’ve even spent the night at each other’s places (no sex; just cuddling and kissing).

We still keep contact on Snapchat, and I really do miss him a lot. However he seemed like he lost interest about halfway through July so I cut contact with him in July so I don’t get attached to someone who’s not interested.

Early August, he messages me asking why I stopped talking to him (this is on Grindr; he reached out to me) and that he always was interested but was constantly working and didn’t have a lot of free time. By the time he messaged me I was a day away from leaving Norway. But he said wants to keep in touch and we exchange a few snaps on Snapchat a couple times a day still.

When we met for the first time we clicked instantly. I’m shy, but around him I was talkative and we always asked about each other. In fact, just yesterday I brought up the idea of us both visiting Iceland together for a couple of days in June as tickets to Iceland from the US are affordable, round-trip. He said he liked the idea and he wants to show me places. I also brought up the idea of Skyping sometimes and he would like that. He also wants to come to the US. While in Norway, we met about 5 times. I miss it a lot.

What I’m afraid of is being hurt. What if he finds another guy before then and doesn’t want to meet me? I really like this guy and I want to see him again and see where things go, but I know that he’s going to meet more people. I can’t do anything about that. Also, I fall for guys easily so I don’t want to get too attached in case he meets someone else. But I also know I can’t be clingy so I’m keeping my cool and not going crazy. What do you guys think? Is there any way I can show him I like him emotionally without blatantly saying it? How can I keep this guy interested in me without looking desperate?",15Aug2019,1
754,"i’m a 17 year old girl, of a bit more promiscuous nature. i have 3 best best bestest friends whom i share absolutely everything with, but they don’t live very close to me, but during the school year we live together. 

Anyways, I have them, and I have friends from my hometown, who I’d usually see on weekends only, and there was this one girl, let’s call her Anne, who was kinda like my best friend, but not really. We would go out together every weekend, and I’d share some parts of my life with her, but not all, because she’s judgy and I’m insecure. So, she didn’t know I wasn’t a virgin or that I’ve done some things that I have. 

Well, one day, when I got a tad bit too drunk, she asked me if I’d hook up with her friend - a dude that lives around here. I said sure, why not, as I didn’t really have any respect for myself anyways. So we went in this little closed off room and we just made out and I ended up sucking his dick but then running away from him because he forced me to do it. I ran up to Anne saying I did that, and how he was forcing me too. She immediately started telling me i was a whore and “easy”. The next morning she was shaming me so much about what I did, I felt like I did the worst thing in the world. I had a few mental breakdowns and couldn’t calm down for a few days. 

We were still hanging out though and she always found a way to shame me. Always insulting either my whorish nature, my boring make up, boring long brown hair (and the pressure i felt to change it up), and what she did was always, and i mean always hook up (make out basically) with a boy that i’d hooked up a few weekends before. “Stealing” guys from me and then telling me how they didn’t even remember me or know my name. Made me feel like a real piece of shit. Forced me to go out when I didn’t want to. And I didn’t have much of an attitude, or a character, to stand up to her. That was about a year ago. 

I like to travel, and me and my 3 friends would plan out a few trips throughout the year to go around Europe. Anne, however, couldn’t stand whenever I talked about traveling. she said I was bragging, so I stopped talking about anything cool that I did. Though she felt the need to always tell everyone how she buys expensive motorbikes and how her parents’ house is actually written down on her name. I guess I then realised she really just wanted to be better than me at absolutely everything. 

Now, a few months ago she got very mad at me because I went on a picnic with the 3 of my best friends without inviting her. she texted me some really rude stuff and i just ignored her texts. she would text me here and there, asking to meet up, on which i’d just reply politely refusing or saying i’m too busy with something. a few weeks later I cut my hair up to my shoulders and dyed it black. 

I cut out all toxic people from my life and started to do my best to build confidence and respect for myself. I started exercising, eating healthy and working too. Started feeling good. 

She had a birthday party, and she invited me. I said I will probably not go (and i didnt go) as I was planning to go to the beach to soak up the sun - I work all day and as we live near the coast (15-30 mins) I think it’s a good idea to spend the other half of my day chilling in the sun. She told me to try to make it and to bring some of the 3 of my best friends. I didn’t even open her message. She never saw me with black hair, and I’m not much of a social media girl, i don’t really post my pics anywhere, but I took a selfie in the sun that I kinda liked and my friends said I looked good so I put it on my instagram story. Anne puts everything on her instagram(not that thats a bad thing!) so she uploaded pictures of black hair dye (she’s blonde) and then later pics of her with black hair. 

I thought it was pretty funny how she dyed her hair black just after me, but i didn’t think much of it because it’s probably a coincidence. 

Today, she texted me saying “Happy anniversary”. I was confused - it’s a text out of the blue after I didn’t respond to her last text a few weeks ago. I thought, a facebook friends anniversary? I don’t even use fb. so i checked, but nope, nothing. 

then it dawned on me - does the mean the anniversary of the day when I’ve done that with that dude? is she really still stuck on that? That’s the only thing that could possibly have happened on todays date. 

so I didn’t reply to her. i saw the message and ignored it. I thought, if I asked, she would somehow think I care and shame me more. 

so she texted again. “Seen?” She said. I ignored again. I asked my friends what do they think about this situation, and they said she’s obsessed with me. 

Is she? Is this normal? Am I supposed to feel this anxious? This is a person who has been ruining my self esteem for years and years and I’m trying to shake her off but she just will not leave me alone. Should I do something about this? 

Idk if its important to the story too but here we have an odd educational system, and I’ll say it as simple as I can - she goes to a high school with which you can’t go to college, and she has really bad grades and kinda no future especially in this small city where we live. Unless she’s willing to leave to the rest of EU and work hard jobs because she’s got a weak educational background. I do very good at school and I go to a good, very appreciated school with which I have no choice but to go to college. Now, I always tried to kinda tell her to study, to make it good, we could go to college together! she didn’t want to. she would make fun of my good grades and good school, saying “stupid people often have good grades.” “Grades don’t equal knowledge.” Which is not a lie, grades are really not very equal to knowledge, but does that mean she was implying I’m stupid? 

Is she jealous of me for whatever reason?",15Aug2019,1
755,"To elaborate, I rescued a cat a around 4 years ago and I decided to keep him with me and I named him Mittens.We had a lot of good times and 2 weeks ago we were preparing to go to vacation when my mom called me to check on my cat, who was in our front yard, since he was breathing weird and after some investigating I realized he was shot, so we rushed him to the vet who did his best and everything looked to be fine and so I went to sleep hoping to see Mittens and comfort him however, as you can probably tell by the title when I woke up I discovered he had passed away a few hours ago in my moms arms, most likely out of internal bleeding, and sure I cried like a baby especially since the night before I didn’t pet him since he was still covered in blood and I though I’m gonna see him tomorrow, and I tried to get over it especially with the vacation coming up.
I tried forgetting about him I really did but I’ve been consistently having dreams about him where he just walks up to me and I can’t believe he’s alive but I decide to go with it and pet him which I can’t do anymore and then i wake up.
I’ve tried to write this last paragraph 4 times now but every time I’m about to finish I break into tears.
My question is: Is it okay to get attached to a cat this much? Because I keep thinking to myself: If I can’t get over a cats death I sure as hell won’t be able to get over a family members death, and I’m about what I will do when that time eventually arrives.

768,"This is gonna be long so sorry. 

Ok so this is about a good friend of mine. Something to first know is that we’ve been friends for almost 6 years now and for the first 3, we were almost inseparable. Then we started different high schools and things kinda... changed.

So what prompted me to come here was an incident that happened today. Yesterday I messaged her and asked if she wanted to hang out tomorrow (today). She said yes, and we agreed to meet at 2 downtown in a agreed spot. So today comes and at around 10 she texts me and ask if we can push the time up to 17:30 instead because she forgot that she had to help her mom with the laundry.

A bit annoyed but ok, whatever.

So the time comes for me to leave the house at around 16:50 (takes me about 30min to get there) and right as I’m about to leave, she texts me to say that she’s really tired from helping her mom with the laundry. 

I ask her if she could just come out anyway and just stay for 1h or so (as she lives like 3min away from there with train). 

She doesn’t answer. 

I get to the agreed upon spot, and try to reach her. Literally nothing works. I text her, I call her, I Snapchat her (she loves that app) and I even try to call her mom.

Still no answer. 

So after that I just walk around the place. I picked up some medicine, had dinner, and shopped.

About an hour and a half passes and she finally texts me back. She tells me that she’s so sorry but that she fell asleep because she was so tired. 

Now. Before you judge, you should know, this isn’t the first time she’s done this. Not the second time either. I honestly can’t count how many times she’s given me that exact same reason/excuse. 

My replies were very bland and it basically said “whatever”. I even told her to tell me immediately if she can’t come the next time this happens (Insinuating that I’m fairly pissed of and being a bit petty about it)

I told my parents later and my mom (who knows this girl) basically told me that she isn’t worth it. And that I should either address this with her because it’s happened so many times, or to just simply don’t make plans with her again. 

The part I need advice on is: I don’t know what to choose. I truly love this girl as my friend, and we have a lot of fun together. But as previously stated we drifted apart after we started high school and we don’t see each other a lot anymore. It’s mostly texting and whatnot. 

So please help me, should I try and save this friendship or not???",15Aug2019,1
769,"so i'm 18 and i haven't finished reading a fiction book in years. basically ever since my depression started, though this hasn't gone away as my depression lessened. i used to love reading, but nowadays i can't read anything i enjoy without stopping around halfway through because i'm terrified of endings. endings make me get extremely emotional and overthink, and they also cause me some physical discomforts such as churning in my stomach and getting very jittery as i try to press on towards the last page.

my main problem is with fictional stories in book form, but it also applies to shows and video games as well. any medium of fictional storytelling that requires more than around a movie length of time to finish (i have no problem watching movies), i have trouble consuming in its entirety.

When we went from party, those 2 friends started shouting at me what kind of slut I am, that they won't be friends with me if I'm like that, that they don't even want to lose words on me. With us was some of my classmates and hear that all. I feel terrible and just try not to cry. Then ""my"" guy came and he wanted to talk with me but I sais that now is not the best time (I really didn't want to cry) and one of those 2 friends shouted yeah she is like this. First she is with someone then left him. I started crying silently looking away. Later they keep calling me slut and they SAW ME crying but they didn't stop. Finally when we all went to sleep they stop. I cryed all night. Next day we went in train and they started talking how I was ""making out with everbody and definetly even sleep with some of them"". They were relling that to everbody in train around us.
From that day on I feel like slut. Yesterday I found out that those 2 give idea that they should lie to me how I was acting because it would be funny. Third friend didn't like that but stay silenced, but still tell me that yesterday because she seen how I feel now. I promise I wouldn't tell them that I know.
I feel terrible and mad. Because of that I still feel like slut even thought I know it was lie.

774,"I don't really know what to do here. My dad has always been invasive and aggressive for not particular reason my entire life.  Recently I (24) have fallen on bad times and have had to move back with my family brother(19) mom(42) dad(65).  I've been trying to keep to myself and help out when I can I pay for wifi/necessitates and most groceries[will explain later] but lately things have been getting out of control.  First my dad started taking my laundry out of the machine when it as mid cycle, throwing it on the floor, so that he can put his gym clothes in.  then he started throwing out groceries he didn't like (i.e.yogurt, which my mom and i eat) and eating entire necessities/ base good (loafs of bread/cheese/ what I cook for 4 people/ice cream etc) so that there wasn't really anything else for anyone to eat.  (he wont share)

This has all sucked and brought back allot of unpleasant memories.  However recently(past few weeks) I've woken up to him looking through my stuff/ watching me sleep. (not in an endearing way but with mild hate/like I'm an ugly sofa)  When hes upset he will rip up my clothes/break my possessions, even if I'm not home and have no connection to why he is upset.   He has also found my vibrator(which was v well hidden) broke it, and keeps it.  In his office, in plain view(WTF).

The worst thing hes been doing lately (besides looking through m bank statements &amp; demanding I give 2/3rds of every paycheck when the house already gets half).  Is hes started getting into the habit of pulling my USED tampons out of the trash and scream-ask me and anyone else around what they are.  It doesn't matter where I hide them, he finds them and he absolutely freaks out.  He will show them to me in front of my friends/coworkers neighbors and he has shown them in front of my brother, and his friends.  He always screams ""what is this"" while stomping like a five year old and will always be GRIPING the thing like a mic.

He doesn't do this to our mom who thinks its funny? Idk what his motivation is for doing this besides humiliating me.  I wrap them until there is no color seeping out and put them as far down in the garbage as I can.  And I don't know where to hide them. In the past  I've kept them in my car in and drooped them off in random trashcans, but he has now claimed control of my car (even though I payed for it and it is in my moms name).  And I'm pretty sure if a start digging holes in the ground he will know something is up. 
(I've also used pads but he does the same thing and I find them uncomfortable so there's not real point in switching)
It sounds pathetic but his actions make me want to die, I don't make allot of money and am in debt from college so essentially only 1/4 of my savings goes moving out.(that's like 300 a week lol)

TL;DR
Dad gets angry that I have period and shows the world my dirty sanitary napkins while asking for more money and breaking my things.  Please help me stop him from continuing this brown stained path of destruction.",15Aug2019,3

777,"“Sorry, I’m reposting this from yesterday  because it didn’t get any responses which is uncharacteristic from reddit.”

Ok so to start this off I don’t personally think I have a problem, but the first things addicts tell themselves is that they don’t have a problem and can quit whenever they want and the whole thing. So I’m coming here for perspective because obviously I can’t trust myself with that. 

A little stage setting here, I’m a huge whiskey person. I love Scotch, Bourbon, Irish even some blended Canadian is alright depending on the bottle. I don’t drink it to get drunk (although it’s a fun side effect obviously) nor do I think I’m drinking to numb any sort of pain. I also don’t think I often drink in excess (barring the occasional tear it up night with friends) except there have been times where I’ve poured too heavily or enjoyed the first glass so much I went back for a second. Simply, I just like the taste. I like to pride myself on being able to pick the subtle flavors and complex notes out of a good bottle. I also recently got married and with that came a shit load of whiskey so my consumption of distilled and barrel aged corn/rye/wheat spirit has skyrocketed in the last three months. This is mostly just due to the fact that I have a much higher level of access to it now. 

So here’s where I think others could potentially say I may be inching in on a drinking problem. In the last month and a half I think there may have been two days where I didn’t have a glass. Again, I don’t think I’m drinking too much (those 45 days I would have very confidently said I wasn’t drunk), I just came home from work and had a drink. I finished off three different bottles all of which were already opened if not half empty. I also often find myself craving a glass of scotch or bourbon during work. Again I don’t think it’s a substance abuse issue here as much as I think of it like somebody else craving a steak or an ice cream cone. It just sounds REALLY good. 

So I’m coming to reddit for some outside perspective on my drinking habits. Do I sound like somebody who should cutback on the sauce or are my habits at within the realm of acceptable?",15Aug2019,2

781,"Hello, this is my first post and I have really no idea what to do.Sorry for my english, I'm working on it.Background:I  bought through ebay a pair of dress shoes, they were supposed to be  sent from Latvia and should take around 15 days for them to be delivered  to me (Germany).

I live in a Student Residence and had until now no problems with packages or anything.

The  thing is that a few days ago a friend told me that a Package for me was  in the Lobby (the building just have like a waiting room as a lobby but  nobody is actually there), a few hours later after work when I went to  pick up my package, it wasn't there.

I  sent an email to the seller because no tracking number was given, after  a few days I got a tracking number and I was told to look for the  status of the package in [www.17track.net](http://www.17track.net/)  , really weird If you ask me. There says that DHL is the actual carrier  of my package. I tried the same tracking number in DHL's website but it  didn't work. Usually if something is delivered and the person isn't at  home at the moment they take it to central station and leave you a note  for you to go and pick it up there or that it was left with a neighbor  and the information of the person. This time as you can imagine nothing  was left in my mailbox.

I printed some posters and left them around the building if someone took it by mistake or something....

Ebay  is supposed to take care of the issue with ther client safety policy, I  don't know if they will pay me back because the package was already  ""delivered"". I say delivered because on the tracking website/ ebay or  anywhere isn't marked as delivered.

I don't know how to proceed. Maybe just check if someone is wearing the shoes or anythingWhat do you guys think?",15Aug2019,1
782,"      I've been working for about 5 years at a grocery store and I'm a part time butcher keep in mind this is my very first job. Although I'm part time were usually always understaffed so I open and manage seafood department  while also working in meat department cutting a few things and working out cold cuts and I've been being scheduled full time hours for the past year or so. I'm starting school in a couple of days so my hours are being cut back because I need them to be. Even so I still receive a hard time for even asking for this. 

       Half of the stores equipment is broken or outdated that you either have to work around it or find some way to make it things work. I make bales which is in recieving because hardly anyone knows how to make a bale in the first place. I've worked in deli and center store and know how to do anything in those department as well as produce. I've only ever been given one raise and when I asked for another raise this year I was told ""if I want a raise theres a ladder in the back"" by my store manager. I've watched 5 different store managers come and go and not all of them were kind. I've stopped plenty of shoplifters and covered for multiple departments and managers on several occasions. I've never been told I do a great job but I'm always told that I just do what I want to do. When I'm asked to come in and help on my days off I come through and help out because I believe in hard work and I enjoy being supportive.

       Even when I try to go above and beyond thinking to myself hey alright maybe I'm not doing enough let's do everything and do it great to impress and be proud in my own hardwork for example setting up both departments and cleaning what wasnt cleaned last night by our closers to at least have some eye appeal, break down pallets and take inventory, keep everything full and still lend a hand to other coworkers which could even include taking out the entire stores trash helping customers find items or answer questions but the second I forget something or mess up my manager makes sure to let me know in a heartbeat and tells me I'm just wasting time or I do what I want to do. If I'm even seen sitting down for a minute they're always up my ass asking are you on lunch or shouldn't you be working when really I'm either actually on lunch or just trying to get some water and breathe. Once I received a compliment I think from my manager because he said I was just bragging about you and when I asked what he said about me twice he just remained silent.

        I worked during the hurricane even on my days off to help out and we got payed extra for it and that felt great because it finally felt like some appreciation only to find out next week the company said they messed up and overpaid us and is going to take it out of our paychecks. When I tried to call the payroll administrator or even emailed them there was no reply until a week later. I'm pissed because I already feel overwhelmed overworked unappreciated and underpaid but this felt like a slap in the face so I'm fighting it saying I shouldn't have to pay for your mistake and they should own up to it instead getting their employees to pay it back. I went to find my check stub but it suddenly couldn't be found. Just some really shady stuff. I tried to talk to my managers about it but they were no real help. So I printed out policies and handbooks and read over them but I dont even know if I should care anymore because I overheard my manager say dont listen to him hes just gonna cry about it.

    These past couple of months I have been doing worse and worse at my job. Showing up late fighting myself to get out of bed and staring off into space. Everything is pissing me off and I even have a difficult time trying not to be an asshole to customers. I've been extremely stressed, nauseated, tired, and depressed. I feel detached and distant at times not just at work but everywhere. I stare off into space more frequently. I want to think I work hard but honestly I question everything now. Maybe I'm just lazy and work is like this everywhere else.

785,"I'm an ex Muslim in my early 20s. I became an atheist when I was 17. 

When I stopped believing in God it was so liberating. I had all this weight off my shoulders and it was just a relief. It allowed me to live by life in a way I wanted and I didn't have to think carefully before I did something such as eating food that isn't halal etc. 

Recently, I've decided to take on an academic challenge that, if successful, will have a massive positive impact on my future. 

It's going to be the hardest thing I've done in my life. It will require me to work hard for the next two years. I've never been in a a tougher or more  critical situation in my life. 

One of the issues is that I will be doing all this alone. No friends or family are going to support me. This is like a mission for me. 

I've recently been thinking that if someone believes in god then at least they have something that they can believe and that gives them hope and comfort. I don't have any of that. 

**How do I get over this feeling like I'm completely doing this alone? **The feeling that nobody is watching over me**. 

It must be so comforting to feel like someone has your back no matter what, but I won't/don't have that. 

To make it clear, I don't want to convert to any religion. I don't believe in God at all. I feel like I'm wasting my time when I at least try to pray. Even bowing my head and saying a prayer asking for someone force in the universe to help me just makes me feel like I'm doing something pointless. 

I just don't know what's going to keep me strong and motivate me. God seems like a perfect answer to that, but like I said it doesn't work for me to pray. 

I know this is very awkwardly written, but I just don't know how to word all this.

Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

794,"i recently started feeling very uncomfortable on my home. 

i will give you a bit of an idea why this may be ill start with my parents, i know they are not the best but they do give all for me to have a nice life which im greatful for or at least i try to be most of the time. my mom is okay but my dad has anxiety and depression (hes a mix bag of emotions) before he started his medication (1 year or so ago) he was angry all the time which made it hard to connect to him since everything i did was wrong or he was just simply angry and he would retaliate with other family members and make conflict arguments. then he started taking hes medication and hes a very different person, he has a more mild temper and hes more relaxed than he used to which i nice but i have to learn to re live with him and his new character the hard part is that whenever he doesnt take his meds he becomes irritable and agry like he used too. which in turn makes me no want to be near him since his bad mood get contagious and makes me have a bad mood aswell. he recently asked me why i wasnt close to him, of course i never mentioned that i never got closed to him or open towards him because of his attitude in the past, it was really difficult for me to connect with him when he as pissed off all the time even more so when i was a teenager having to deal with all the teen stuff. he would often get pissed at me because i was ""overreacting"" over the mindless teen drama that was happening in my life and he kept saying that real men have real problems. therefore i lost interest on opening up to him since he always shut me down very quickly. until now that hes mentally better hes reconnecting with me. (he tried to kick me out of the house a couple of times over some dumb teenager stuff and said you either leaver or ""man up) so yes its hard for me to reconnect with someone with such a bad temper. hes also said that he feels a bit guilty about all a lot of stuff that he did. yet i do reciprocate and understand that feeling is still hard to jus reconnect with him when for over 10 years he was abusive towards me or his mental condition was towards me. 

i also have two siblings a sister and a brother. im not really close to any of them mainly because we have a wide age gap (between 5 or 6 years if difference) so theres not that much for us to talk about. yet with my sister (youngest) i have a better relationship than with my brother. my brother has aspergers and he also suffers from depression and anxiety. through all my childhood he bullied me both mentally and physically, he was also incredibly unempathic towards me. me being younger than him couldnt do much so i stopped trying to have a relationship with him pretty quickly and whatever of a relationship we had ended up when i was a teen and he infront of my parents tried to brutally beat me up.

&amp;#x200B;

fastfoward to the present day i have little to no relationship with my brother even though we live in the same house. we bearly talk and whenever he gets home never says hello to me. 

just recently his girlfriend moved into my parents house where i live which made the situation even more uncomfortable for me to live there since everyday i have to reconnect with my dad and deal with my brothers asperger and assholeness but in top of that i have to deal that the already shitty dinamic of my family is getting someone that i bearly now, didnt had much of a saying on the subject and my parents try to make me see her as a sister which i dont, i like her but thats it i feel i shouldnt be forced to live with her niether.

There is a car like 15 feet in front of me that is waiting to enter the road while the cars are moving slowly to accelerate. I don't see why I need to stop my to let the guy in front of me when the light turns green. If it was a red light I would've let the car turn into the road to get in front of me. The car tries to get in the road and I honk and it was a somewhat near collison. Im trying to ask, legally and socially are you obligated to stop your car so a car from an adjacent car is trying to get to the road?

For my B-day (in July) me and jacob saw a movie and he spent the night. Not once did he acknowledge the fact that it was my birthday and he didn’t get me a present. I don’t really care he didn’t get me a present but it’s the thought that counts. The only times he’s called or texted me was when he got a VR headset, went to Universal Studios, and when it was his birthday, (also in July). I don’t know what to do because school starts next week and I think I should not be his friend anymore because he is really toxic. Throughout the whole year he has bullied kids, shared personal secrets, ETC. Him and I always have fun in person but I feel like he is just using me in a way.",15Aug2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

Well this is the thing, i (M 23) met E (F 23), she have been the most intense relationship i've been so far, in so many levels, but since the beggining we've having a lot of problems, all because of me and my insecurities. things like im being jelaus with her, and she have been the most trustful person in my life, but i still feel very insecure about her going places with people, like no matter what the worst case scenario just stays there and i feel axious, i try not to act anxious like overtexting her, but still in my interactions, you can feel the insecurity.

i been trying self parenting methods, i've been trying isolating myself from things that put me on that insecure state, to look to the core of the problem and see if there lays the solution, im changing my enviroment, my workplace, my friends,  but nothing so far works fast enough or deep enough, its like, a short fix instead of a deep beneficial change.

and thats the other thing, everytime we have a problem i manage to understand the problem and formulate a solution, then i do the solution but, nothing really changes, and im not talking about her anymore, i feel like i dont change, like my insecurities doesnt leave, like my lack of empathy at the moment of thinking my actions doesnt change, im trying hard to stop being a child and start being a man for the benefit of my own life and the ones who cares about me but i dont find the way of doing it",15Aug2019,3
800,"i’m a 17 year old girl, of a bit more promiscuous nature. i have 3 best best bestest friends whom i share absolutely everything with, but they don’t live very close to me, but during the school year we live together. 

Anyways, I have them, and I have friends from my hometown, who I’d usually see on weekends only, and there was this one girl, let’s call her Anne, who was kinda like my best friend, but not really. We would go out together every weekend, and I’d share some parts of my life with her, but not all, because she’s judgy and I’m insecure. So, she didn’t know I wasn’t a virgin or that I’ve done some things that I have. 

Well, one day, when I got a tad bit too drunk, she asked me if I’d hook up with her friend - a dude that lives around here. I said sure, why not, as I didn’t really have any respect for myself anyways. So we went in this little closed off room and we just made out and I ended up sucking his dick but then running away from him because he forced me to do it. I ran up to Anne saying I did that, and how he was forcing me too. She immediately started telling me i was a whore and “easy”. The next morning she was shaming me so much about what I did, I felt like I did the worst thing in the world. I had a few mental breakdowns and couldn’t calm down for a few days. 

We were still hanging out though and she always found a way to shame me. Always insulting either my whorish nature, my boring make up, boring long brown hair (and the pressure i felt to change it up), and what she did was always, and i mean always hook up (make out basically) with a boy that i’d hooked up a few weekends before. “Stealing” guys from me and then telling me how they didn’t even remember me or know my name. Made me feel like a real piece of shit. Forced me to go out when I didn’t want to. And I didn’t have much of an attitude, or a character, to stand up to her. That was about a year ago. 

I like to travel, and me and my 3 friends would plan out a few trips throughout the year to go around Europe. Anne, however, couldn’t stand whenever I talked about traveling. she said I was bragging, so I stopped talking about anything cool that I did. Though she felt the need to always tell everyone how she buys expensive motorbikes and how her parents’ house is actually written down on her name. I guess I then realised she really just wanted to be better than me at absolutely everything. 

Now, a few months ago she got very mad at me because I went on a picnic with the 3 of my best friends without inviting her. she texted me some really rude stuff and i just ignored her texts. she would text me here and there, asking to meet up, on which i’d just reply politely refusing or saying i’m too busy with something. a few weeks later I cut my hair up to my shoulders and dyed it black. 

I cut out all toxic people from my life and started to do my best to build confidence and respect for myself. I started exercising, eating healthy and working too. Started feeling good. 

She had a birthday party, and she invited me. I said I will probably not go (and i didnt go) as I was planning to go to the beach to soak up the sun - I work all day and as we live near the coast (15-30 mins) I think it’s a good idea to spend the other half of my day chilling in the sun. She told me to try to make it and to bring some of the 3 of my best friends. I didn’t even open her message. She never saw me with black hair, and I’m not much of a social media girl, i don’t really post my pics anywhere, but I took a selfie in the sun that I kinda liked and my friends said I looked good so I put it on my instagram story. Anne puts everything on her instagram(not that thats a bad thing!) so she uploaded pictures of black hair dye (she’s blonde) and then later pics of her with black hair. 

I thought it was pretty funny how she dyed her hair black just after me, but i didn’t think much of it because it’s probably a coincidence. 

Today, she texted me saying “Happy anniversary”. I was confused - it’s a text out of the blue after I didn’t respond to her last text a few weeks ago. I thought, a facebook friends anniversary? I don’t even use fb. so i checked, but nope, nothing. 

then it dawned on me - does the mean the anniversary of the day when I’ve done that with that dude? is she really still stuck on that? That’s the only thing that could possibly have happened on todays date. 

so I didn’t reply to her. i saw the message and ignored it. I thought, if I asked, she would somehow think I care and shame me more. 

so she texted again. “Seen?” She said. I ignored again. I asked my friends what do they think about this situation, and they said she’s obsessed with me. 

Is she? Is this normal? Am I supposed to feel this anxious? This is a person who has been ruining my self esteem for years and years and I’m trying to shake her off but she just will not leave me alone. Should I do something about this? 

Idk if its important to the story too but here we have an odd educational system, and I’ll say it as simple as I can - she goes to a high school with which you can’t go to college, and she has really bad grades and kinda no future especially in this small city where we live. Unless she’s willing to leave to the rest of EU and work hard jobs because she’s got a weak educational background. I do very good at school and I go to a good, very appreciated school with which I have no choice but to go to college. Now, I always tried to kinda tell her to study, to make it good, we could go to college together! she didn’t want to. she would make fun of my good grades and good school, saying “stupid people often have good grades.” “Grades don’t equal knowledge.” Which is not a lie, grades are really not very equal to knowledge, but does that mean she was implying I’m stupid? 

Is she jealous of me for whatever reason?",15Aug2019,0

802,"Hey, this is an really complicated matter and i just genuinely cant understand anymore how i should tackle this.

So, my oldest brother(23) is having a girlfriend that is 18 years older than him and has 2 sons ( 17 and 10) one of them lives with hil and the girlfriend at his apartment. My mother was kind of taken aback that he took a liking to her because of the age difference but didnt stand in the way at first.

The girlfriend began living at ours after she brike up with her husband at the time because of some strange fights. The husband is a friend of my mother btw so that made it more confusing why she took her in in the first place and she lived in our old storage rooms. For veeeery low rent for the space she got. It was like 5 rooms worth 600€ rent normally and she had to pay 330 or so. My little brother (10) is friends with the youngest son and he spent some tkme down there. After a few months tension set in. My mothrr started to dispise the girlfriend because... reasons? She claims that she spread misinformation about her and so on. At the time my mother also started to tell my oldest brother to break up wkth his gf. My brother was never a big fan of my mom so he was like, ehh no? And a few days later a fight errupted between them where at the peak my brother said to her that he has so low respect to her thst she could fall dead and he didnt care and spit in front of her (my mother claims he spit her in the face but i was there) and she then slapped him 3 times HARD in the face. Whereas he didnt fight back. Mind you, my mom is not lightweight she isnt right out fat but has a bit on her ribs. Imagine a typical eastern europesn housewife that could butcher a f'ing pig. (Yes) she glt strength. I'm a firm pacifist because of my past in school and i think neither of them acted right but they now are so damn aggressive on one another. He moved to the apartment where my grandma lived before she died and gf and son live with him now and they have heavy word fights sometimes. 

Now here is the problem: if it would be only that i would honestly not care. They both fucked me off with their fighting because they involved me heavily in it and then got pissed at me for remaining neutral and try to reason to both. He believes that EVERY person has to earn respect not have it instantly not even a mother. And she believes because she set him in the world she deserves respect from him. 

But. Here is the but. My little brother LOVES my oldest really much and he is really really devestated that my oldest cant do so much anymore with him. Almost nothing. Now my mother doesnt out right ban him from interacting with my brother but the gf is not allowed anywhere near my little brother because ""she will set him up against me"" and today my little bro bawled his eyes out because he wants to spent time with my brother but because ld this shit thing he cant. My oldest has 2 jobs one full time and one part time where he works directly after the full time job ends at the day. He has time only at home and my brother cant visit him. I tried to reason to both to talk it out but my mother wont budge a inch to the clause that gf cant even be NEXT ROOM. And my brother truly loves his gf as far as i've seen it. 

It breaks my because i am almost ready to f'ing bash their heads in both. Because my little brother is so sad. He builds up anger because of it and already smashed his controller once and almost broke it. 

Can someone maybe advise? I know that such situations are difficult and I cant just ""live it out"" with my bro because i alone cant replace my oldest for him. And i've got a life too where i have to do stuff. School and friends y'know? 

They both just cant be reasoned with. I also tried the ""but dont you care for the well being of [little brother]?"" And she ALWAYS just says ""i said already that i dlnt prohibit him from contacting him. But she will nowhere be near him in any way"" which i think is absurd.

Also she just can go fucking mental when we go into a discussion about the gf because she believes that she is the root of all problems with my oldest brother.  Ugh.

Any advice would be highly appreciated. It just drains my energy day in day out.",15Aug2019,1

805,"I apologize in advance if this is all over the place and long , it’s hard to know what to include. TLDR at the bottom.

Some background: My boyfriend (27M) and I (24F) have been together for 5 years. We’ve had our ups and downs, but overall we’re both happy in our relationship. We both suffer from depression and anxiety. I’ve had depression for the majority of my life, and it’s on the severe side. I am currently on antidepressants, and am always fighting, but it is a fight and I do struggle. I don’t have much of a support system. My boyfriend has BPD, so his depression and issues overall look a bit different than mine, and he can be erratic at times. But, I understand living with mental illness pretty well and try to be supportive. So- he is also suicidal, and has been for the entirety of our relationship. This is where I’m struggling. 

It seems like he’s given up on trying. Which, I understand comes with suicidal ideation. I truly do empathize, but it effects me and my life as well. He hasn’t kept a job for more than a few months throughout or entire relationship. We live with his parents, which I am over at this point. I want my own place. He doesn’t pay any bills at all, his parents paid for his car and pay for it’s maintenance and insurance. His parents enable irresponsible behavior, and coddle him, and he is immature for his age because of it. On top of the living situation, I pay for everything aside from the few months here and there that he is employed. Anything we want to do, I have to pay for both of us. I don’t make much money and simply cannot afford to be the breadwinner for both of us. He blames his mental illness for not being able to keep a job. Of course, this causes a lot of strain on our relationship. I have a future in mind for myself, and I feel like I’m being held back because he doesn’t care about the future. When we argue about this, or honestly anything, we always end up at the same place. He blames the issue on his mental illness, talks about how suicidal he is, starts crying, and then I’m backed into a corner and made to feel like my issues or our relationships issues don’t matter. Nothing gets resolved because instead of talking about the issue at hand, it becomes a pity party. His parents are old fashioned and don’t take mental illness seriously, and he doesn’t have much other family. He has one close friend that he can talk to about these things, but rarely does. The weight of it usually ends up falling on me, and as someone who also struggles with severe depression and is mostly alive for my loved ones, I am genuinely not the best person to single handedly be his support system. I feel stuck and helpless. He has gotten plenty of professional help in the past but didn’t take it seriously at the time, and now he has no insurance. 

I’m looking for any and all advice around this situation. What can I realistically do to help him? Also, where do I draw the line? I love him and want a future with him, but if he doesn’t want a future at all, what am I supposed to do?

TLDR: Boyfriend is suicidal and uses it as a reason for not working and to get out of arguments. He doesn’t consider the future, I do. I am also really his only support system. Trying to balance being supportive for him/ limiting self sacrifice.",15Aug2019,1

I apologize for reposting some of the same info but I’ve added updates.   

I’ll try to keep this as brief as possible. I’m 26, in a relationship with a man 7 years older than me for several years now. 

Everything started out great - I was so taken by his maturity and honesty and kindness. Unselfish, generous. But I was going through difficult emotional issues at the time, and I felt that he was eager to settle down and I didn’t feel ready to give him what he needed. I tried to explain this to him and work through it but my intuition insisted that I leave, and I broke up with him rather abruptly - we ended up getting back together, because I was determined to make it work while continuing to work on myself so as not to lose him, but it’s something I’ve always felt bad about. 

I confided a lot to him about my past relationships, nothing positive about my exes but I guess it upset him that I hadn’t dumped those guys who hurt me and so he has brought up my “past” in a shaming way many times since. 

Though he continued to be kind and thoughtful for the most part, and made me feel loved, anything in my world outside of him seemed to threaten him. He’d find indirect reasons why my going to see friends is a problem (bad timing/why didn’t you bring anything back for me/it’s strange to hang out for so long) etc. It has escalated as far as him accusing me of sleeping with my best friend (a girl) and packing up all the things I have at his place because I received a text from a platonic male friend late at night. I don’t talk to males anymore as he even grows suspicious when I’m polite with waiters. 

I am a very socially anxious person with only a small number of friends, but it got to the point where I’d decline invitations if I felt it would be at a time that would incite him. I don’t party or do anything that I could see concerning someone; I simply meet with one girlfriend at a time when I do hang out. Nevertheless we’ve fought for days because I dared to ask if I could spend time with a friend on his day off when I’d normally be with him. I’d like to do more social things but that seems out of the question now without involving him, and honestly I don’t want to. We have different interests, plus his presence feels heavy at times, like he’s analyzing my interactions. 

He claims this started because I didn’t invite him to hang out with my friends, but I don’t have a “group” and honestly I want girl time, and so do my friends, who no longer like him. He has met them all at least once. He has also met my family, but they don’t like him anymore and he avoids them.  

His language in arguments is abrasive, to the point that my body starts to shake - he’s called me a bitch more times than I can count, and in one especially vicious fight he called me worthless. I’ve tried to set boundaries and talk through these conflicts and make it clear that I won’t tolerate this behavior, but he accuses me of being cold for always having the power to walk away from the relationship. He is offended if I suggest that his insecurities are at the root of this and gets mad that i don’t appreciate him. 

I’ve accepted his apologies in the past because when things are good, they truly are good and I felt like he was someone I could build a life with. He’s responsible and considerate and I trust him to stay with me and not stray. These are all qualities that I worry are hard to find elsewhere, but also confuse me when his actions feel so intolerable that I want to leave. 

After our last argument, I told him if he got in the way of me spending time with friends again we’d be over. Now, only a month later, I accepted an invitation from a friend at a time while he was at work, and he immediately took that opportunity to complain about how I don’t do enough housework (I don’t live with him, btw)and selfishly leave him to do everything while I see my friends all the time (I hung out with friends a total of 3 times this month.)

I’m so confused because I feel that I’ve built my life around this relationship and don’t want to lose what we have, and I’m still struggling with my mental health so the thought of losing my partner feels extremely isolating. 

I told him that in order for us to continue seeing each other he needs to seek out therapy, but he refuses. He insists he knows he has a problem and will deal with it on his own. I’ve also said i can’t jump right into the relationship and suggested that we slowly begin again, but he doesn’t want to “date” me. 

Is this a fair ultimatum?",15Aug2019,1

821,"I've been feeling really bad a lot lately. I think I'm experiencing a lot of symptoms that I think may be linked to anxiety disorders. I'm also having a lot of trouble expressing my feelings in a way that is not agressive, or just me holing myself up in my room. I want to see a therapist to talk to, but my mom won't make an appointment. I've researched all the information she wanted to know and she has recieved it. She just keeps asking me questions I don't feel comfortable talking to her about. If I answer, she'll try to fix the problem herself, but if I don't answer, she'll say that she can't make the appointment until she knows what's wrong with me. I don't think she realizes how hard it is to talk to her. Whenever we conversate, she always makes me feel like everything I feel is either my fault, or I'm disrespecting her. When she gives her unwanted response, she incorporates her religion into it. I am not religious, but she doesn't know this and I can't tell her. I have a strong feeling that she will try and find a religious therapist, but I don't want one because I hear enough religion based answers from my mom. I know I can't keep going on like this because it's only going to get worse. How can I convince her to listen to me and get me a therapist?",15Aug2019,1
822,"Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this. 

So I've been volunteering for a few weeks now and everything seems too good to be true. I realized that talking to random strangers is something that energizes me, which makes even the most mundane jobs exciting. Furthermore, everyone has somehow become friends super quickly. Everything just feels *right*, like I'm finally living a normal life; furthermore, I can actually think coherently there and all of my sentences are complete. 

School is the complete opposite, even though it's meant to be more of a social place. I feel incompetent, shy, and worthless there, and I spend a good amount of time dissociating. No joke, I have done so much research on how to be social and at one point suspected that I was mildly autistic because I was so bad at functioning. Furthermore, everything just felt wrong. I was never sure if anyone actually saw me as a friend or whether I was simply just annoying everyone.

But for some reason, at that job, everything just flowed like it was supposed to.

I'm so scared that I'm dreaming, and it makes me incredibly sad that after this summer, I will have to leave everyone (because it's ~2 hours away from where I live) and return to the shithole. I have never missed anyone in my life this much (excluding when I moved out of the country without prior knowledge of it beforehand, literally losing all contact with my friends).

824,"In essence, I want to train Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and my father doesn't want me to. The thing is, I can't just sign up by myself because I'm not 18 yet (a couple of months away). So I need my dad's permission.

My father said he won't let practise BJJ me and offered I train Krav Maga instead, but that's out of the question. That ground fighting experience simply isn't going to gain itself.

Here are my father's arguments why I shouldn't practise BJJ:
* he trained Judo when he was young. Based on that, he said people are often reckless when applying leverage and he doesn't want me to get hurt
* choking is disgusting and horrid
* BJJ is used on the ground. (I don't know why that's a bad thing)
* I need self-defence, not fighting skills. That's his opinion.
* BJJ is used in MMA, which my father contemns. He considers it a sport for criminals. (My dad's a retired policeman, he doesn't like crime)

While some of these are fair points, well, what do you expect? It's a fucking martial art god damn it! Of course there will be pain and I might get hurt! A year ago I wanted to do boxing, lo and behold, I wasn't allowed to! I got to train Wing Chun instead, which was okay, but I don't even have the opportunity to verify my skills, because we don't spar. And what does my father say? *Your training is sufficient to defend yourself in need. You don't need to spar.* Bullshit.

For those of you who'd say: *Why don't you ask your mother for permission?*. That's a fair point. I did. The answer I got was along the lines of: *My God, why?! Son, what's wrong with you? Why do you want to fight all the time? You have too much energy, make use of it by working in the garden or something.*

I never thought I would write here about this but I need some advice.
I think I’m falling in love with one of my best friends. And it’s stressing me out.

We’ve been good friends from the second we met. And we’ve already passed the point where We liked each other (in the beginning of our friendship). We had a short chat about it. But he came to the conclusion that starting something would be impossible. He’s going to college and I won’t be home much due work.  This extremely short conversation was a while ago. 

During the past summer we hung out a lot, and we still do. But the more I’m with him. The more I want to be with him. I want to spend all my time with him. We don’t do much. We just do nothing all the time. I just love the feeling of being with him. 

Today I came back from my 10 day vacation. During that trip he was the only person on my mind. And even though I had a huge jet lag he came over. We watched a movie for the first time and did some minimal cuddling. I kinda told him how I felt. That I like spending time with him. And that I want to spend all my time with him. And that I didn’t want him to leave.
All he replied was that he thought it was really sweet. And he said something about him being a cool guy to hang out with. (That was a joke because he’s not the kind of person to say something like that about him self)

He’s really sweet, kinda shy and always shares his stuff with me. (Like his drinks, food and other stuff) He’s always scared to hurt me in a physical way. So when I say something he does hurt (even though I don’t mean it and I never mean it because he never hurts me) he immediately backs of and apologizes.

But he must know how I feel right? I mean he’s a smart and sensitive guy.
 We are 18 and both beginning a totally new chapter in our lives. I’m scared to miss him every day when I’m traveling and he’s in college.
I don’t want summer to be over with me knowing what’s up. And I don’t have the balls to just ask,
I just don’t know what to do. So Reddit, please give me some advice.

My Father and I had it out hard last week over some political drama, he started going off on his tangents, and I, being on the opposite, responded. Not aggressive, I attempted to point out that he was make reference to A bunch of right wing articles and conspiracy that were debunked. At which point he went at me. I attempted to defuse the situation by reminding him that We were trying to celebrate moms birthday, but he wasn't having it. Eventually my temper flared and I responded with ""Alright, can you shut the fuck up!?"" and that's when things fell apart. He started threatening to beat the shit out of me for daring to disrespect him in his own house. and eventually told me to get the fuck out and that I wasn't welcome there anymore.   


After that I decided to block my dad's Number, FB, Etc. But now my mother is trying to get us to reconcile and frankly, I don't think I want to....My mom is saying I'm mostly to blame for telling him to shut the fuck up and that REALLY Gets to me. She says I shouldn't state my opinion and I should be quiet. and just let him be. But that seems backwards and insane to me.  Ignoring the fact that ""I'm to blame.""

I feel like I can't say anything because, in the end, they're just expressing their feelings.

I want to give them the benefit of the doubt since their actions can be linked back to traumas but I get really nervous everytime I see them online; it's gotten to the point where I'd avoid the platforms they're active on.

I was planning on the letting the silence on my end distance us but then they've sent a message a few days ago and part of me wants to respond. I don't think friendships are supposed drain me like this but another part of me thinks that I'm an inconsiderate coward trying to run away from a friend in need, especially when the friend has issues with making and keeping friends already.

835,"Roughly over a year ago I was in a car crash where I hit black ice and slid into the oncoming lane broadside, hitting another car. I was 17, on my way to school and traveling the speed limit, not distracted. I was unconscious after collision but only had a minor concussion afterwards, no long term effects. The car which I had hit had a woman driving with the husband in the passenger seat and a small girl, (6 or 7) in the backseat. Both the parents had minor cuts, however the child ended up in critical condition. The mother was also tested and was driving under the influence. Their car was also not under any form of insurance.  The child within 1 week was diagnosed to make a full recovery and deemed not in critical condition any more. From there obviously our insurance took care of all their bills and payments and we looked to settle but that was about a month ago and we have not heard back yet and I believe they are going to sue my family. I just wondered if anyone has any idea or perspective on what the outcome would be if they would sue and if my family is at risk of losing everything. Although the driver was DUI when I lost control they had been coming over a hill and debatably couldn’t have swerved in time regardless so I guess that has no input?

836,"I don’t really know where else to go with this but I figured I’d start here. 

I started because I have a few members of my family who have lost everything in their lives to mental health issues and it’s so painful to watch. For me, the most painful part is seeing how easy it was for them to reach that stage. 

Anorexia being the most severe in the family to date. It’s been so hard seeing someone you love and adore seemingly throw everything away down to lifestyle choices and habits that went too long unaddressed. I’ve started fearing beyond words, that exact same thing happening to me. So I’ve started second guessing everything. 

It started small, 
- ‘do I want a donut’ 
- ‘no I shouldn’t that’s bad for you’ 
- ‘that’s what your sister would say’ 
- ‘ok so it’s unhealthy not to eat that donut’ 

And then it developed,
- ‘do I want to join my friends for a joint’ 
- ‘yes’ 
- ‘that’s an unhealthy lifestyle choice’ 
- ‘don’t join them’ 
- ‘that’s what an unpopular person would do’ 
- ‘ok so it’s unhealthy for me to not join them’ 

All the way to driving home I’ll second guess every route or speed or anything to do with the journey. 

Everything I do. I second guess, and third guess and fourth guess blah blah blah. 

And it’s an endless loop and it’s driving me crazy. I have tremendous guilt on the decisions I made wrong, self loathing because it’s not like I didn’t give it enough thought to still get wrong. 

Then there’s the anxiety, I’m terrified of when I might make a wrong decision, and I’m scared of feeling guilty, and then I feel guilty for being an anxious person when my family needs me to be strong during this period of time when so many people around me are struggling so much and there’s nothing I can do.

I’ll take any advice I can get but it would be really cool if I could get some input from male redditors since the situation is so specific. 

So my(26M) cousin (we’ll call him Micheal, 14M) and his siblings tragically lost their dad a few years ago when they were very young. And because they live about 3 hours away and because, until recently, I’ve been real busy with school, I’ve only been able to see them a handful of times in the years since my uncle’s passing. But now that I’m done with school I’ve been able to see them a lot more. 

Now here’s where I need some advice/encouragement.

My uncle’s passing left my cousin Micheal as the only guy in a house with 5 other girls and no real male role models and, understandably, it hasn’t been ideal for him.

During my most recent visit, my aunt (my cousin’s mom) pulled me aside and, through tears, told me that she really appreciated having me around so that Micheal has someone to talk to and she also told me that she would be grateful if I could be a kind of “big brother” to him as he gets ready to start high school and grows up. 

So the following night I decided to talk to Micheal. As we were going to sleep I just asked him if he would want to start talking more. He didn’t hesitate to say that he definitely wanted to talk more, which kinda surprised me. So my next question was how often he wanted to talk and he said “as much as we can”. And that kinda broke my heart. He’s clearly desperate to have someone to talk to and I literally had no idea. 

So my question for redditors who can relate to my cousin Micheal is, how can I be the person/role model/big brother that my cousin clearly needs right now? What did you need at his age? 

Obviously I plan to be way more involved in his life than I have been and I also plan to be there whenever he needs to talk but should I reach out to him? Wait for him to reach out to me? I just don’t want him to feel the way he does right now ever again.

""Just got back from work tired, I stood near a bus stop ready to walk straight to my house. I took a look at the remainings of the old sandbox, where I used to play with my friends. The only thing that was left there was just a small square of sand among the bushes of a high grass. I stopped there for a second and...looked backed at the time I was 12 and this was our playground, our kingdom. I saw myself, and one of my childhood friends the day before he was moving out of our neighborhood. At that time I was convinced that we will still be in contact, that we will still be friends. But that wasn't true, and it repeated over and over again. I still have this scene in the back of my head, and that was the time that it came back and hit me hard. Because I miss them and it was my dream to ever make friends and just spend time with other people, especially around that time. But right now, I'm 19 years old, basically an old guy - I do feel like a one - and last years I was hopeful, I was positive that that will change. It never broke me from the outside, I was always a funny, lighthearted person and I kept being one, although being a bit tense because I cared too much. In the meantime as I was rethinking all this stuff i kept checking my phone. I have this habit of checking messages whenever I hear the notification as fast as I can, and when I'm waiting for somebody to response - but I think that this one is actually normal, wow finally I feel like a normal person. I checked, nothing.

My mind went back to that day, once again. I stood across myself-version-2012 wanting to tell myself to not be naive and to try keeping this friendship alive so he won't feel what I felt. But could that even change anything? Seconds after our friend left, went to his house and that was the last time I talked with him. I looked at my younger self, he smiled at me, my tiredness took its toll on me as I heard him saying something to me. Great, first hallucinations, now delusions, just a normal day of a normal teen. He said: ""You don't feel the same, do you?"" And he was right, I know right now that I have to fight for what's important for me. But then he added: ""You weren't afraid of losing something you like or care for. But now you are. That's why you're thinking of it."". Not gonna lie, I would call myself a genius of a psychology but then, he's me so he obviously knows, well, me and knows how I feel. Anyway...yes, that's right. I'm afraid. Afraid, because I didn't get to spend more time with a person that become my first real friend, whom I didn't tell how much that relationship meant for me. Afraid, because I wasted most of time we spend together on just a talks, which literally was just me being a crybaby or trying to not be stressed and actually ask about doing anything.

And when I decided to change, when I decided to ask him if we can be friends - even if that always sounded so dumb to say to anybody - I lost my only chance because when I got another one, after thinking that it will be much better now, he said that he's moving out. Yep, I heard that one before. 

And here I am now, standing in a freaking sandbox, thinking about this things. It'll all be over when the september ends - my summer job which i'm tired of, my chances to spend well time with my best friend. And even if I said to myself that I won't be depressed when studying I just feel like I lost. That i've been fighting, losing every single time but not giving up.

But here the outcome of a battle isn't the worst, the course of a a battle is - that I can't really do nothing when he has no time for me and have some other friends.""

&amp;#x200B;

That's all I wanted to wrote here, hope that at least you had a good time reading this not so good piece of a ""drama"". I'm basically feeling down that I can't do anything to spend some time with that guy(because I can't change his mind, I'm really happy that he'll study on a better university than he would here) and that's what I'm thinking all the time right now. Maybe I should just try on the next occasion say it all to him(would be hard because it's not that easy task for me haha,he's a good guy so I think he'll understand) Would like you to, if you can help what to do in my situation, write maybe what I could do or maybe I should make some things clearer because I really really like writing to the point i'm getting off topic really easy(it's way easier when I'm writting in my native language because I'm more used to it and know much more words &lt;also perfect grammar because I'm smart haha&gt; but I'm trying my best to write in english as well) and that way I forget about writing down important stuff and I'm just focusing on details. 

Anyway, wish you guys a good day/night/whatever time zone you're at(I have wake up in next 6 hours, I spent some time writing this).",15Aug2019,1
847,"I met my childhood “best friend” (we’ll call her Destiny) when I was 2, our parents were friends at the time. Somehow we’ve stayed in touch, despite my parents moving our family around growing up.
When I was in about 3rd grade, we moved back to my home town, about an hour away from Destiny, and I saw Destiny more and more.
She was a bully.
I don’t want to go into details, but basically she was a bad influence on me, wasn’t respectful of my boundaries, and would guilt trip me to stay friends with her when I would get upset with her behavior.
Since we’ve become adults, she struggled with drug addiction for a brief period, drinks and smokes weed everyday (granted, I used to smoke weed everyday until I formed real support groups), has a 1 year old baby (which is fine, except she continued her bad habits during pregnancy), and has had multiple arrests (latest arrest was about a month ago for pointing her gun in someone’s face).
She has owned up to her abusive behavior in our childhood and has since apologized.
She thinks of me as a sister.
I don’t reciprocate.
She constantly asks when I’m going to visit her and meet her new baby. I’m always giving excuses to avoid doing this.
We have nothing in common anymore except for our childhood memories, which we seem to have very different perspectives.
I wrote out what is essentially a break up note to send her to cut her out of my life completely.
But I’m too chicken to send it.
My mom said I can just block her number, and leave it at that.
I feel like after everything we’ve been through, I should end it the “right” way even though it risks her being angry with me and trying to guilt me again.
So.. is it better to tell her our friendship is over, or is it better to simply block all contact?
Worth noting, my family removed her from Facebook after I told them this, they’re super supportive of my decision.",15Aug2019,2
848,"I just found this sub and I think this would be the perfect place to put this.

I am now 14, and I moved away from my home (California) with my dad. My dad is a single dad, my mom passed away when I was younger. He then remarried and and a daughter, my half sister, and then got divorced. My dad has wanted to move to Hawaii for a long time, me and him are both surfers and I was really excited for it. I wouldn’t say I’m a very introverted kid, actually most people say I’m very extroverted, but I just haven’t been able to find any friends in Hawaii. I originally went to a private school there, and I found some friends, but then my dad decided to put me in online school for the rest of the year. He has now decided to put me in a online school for the next school year as well, and I feel like my only friends are the ones back in California. I know I should probably tell my dad I want to go to school, but it’s already too late, I am no longer enrolled and can’t get back in. I’m feeling really lonely in Hawaii and I really only get to be social with kids my age when I travel back to California. I don’t know if this is the best sub to put this in, but I mainly just needed to get this off my chest.",15Aug2019,1
849,"So, to start this off: last weekend I was hanging with a group of friends. My ex-roommate (A) was there and she turns to me and asks how I've been, how was the girl I was seeing at the time, etc. The usual 'hey, let's catch up!' questions.

I shrugged, grimaced, and said I wasn't seeing her anymore because she became too clingy. A, who's a counselor, immediately said ""It seems like you see every friendship as clingy"" and that gave me a pause. My other friend quickly butted in with a ""that's because she's so awesome everyone wants to be her friend!"" and then changed the subject. The night carried on.

But since then that moment has been repeating in my head and I can't help but notice a pattern with ALL of my friendships. 

I'm an extrovert. I love going out, I love making friends, and sometimes I grow closer to certain friends and it's nice at first, but then for some reason I feel as if they begin to expect too much from me. I feel as if they've place an obligation on my shoulders and I'm suffocating from the stress when they're just asking for me to be there as a friend. Simple stuff. For instance, a friend calls me and asks if I could come and jump-start her car because her battery died and I lived closest. Of course I helped her out, but the entire drive there I felt as if I was boiling from the inside out with rage. It was like ""how DARE she make me take time out of MY day to do this for HER when I'm careful to never ask for ANYTHING so I don't OWE HER."" 

This isn't like me, and I'm terrified sometimes by how angry I can get or how cagey I can feel when all a friend does is ask for help. But since I'm so personally withdrawn from everyone, anytime someone comes to me my thought process is ""but you've done nothing for me so why should I do this for you."" It's mean. I don't like it. Yet I can't stop myself from mentally hitting the off switch and I suddenly want them - the one I've labelled as a stressor - out of my life so I distance myself until they eventually disappear. 

Sometimes I can get bored with a friend. I can wake up and someone I've been constantly texting and hanging with suddenly matters so little to me and I'm off to find another shiny new friend. I have no guilt over it, and in the past I've angered people and have been called manipulative when I genuinely do not mean to be. 

It's scary when I can just FEEL myself losing interest in someone I really liked and I feel helpless to stop it. It's almost as if I only want perfect friends, friends who require no work and are fun, even when I know that's not possible.

So I'm asking anyone who feels this way or if they have a friend like me:  how do you deal with it?",15Aug2019,1

854,"Okay I am going to try to explain all the facts with no bias! I am roommates with another girl and we have lived together since freshman year and we are going into our senior year of college. We started with apartments sophomore year and that year both rooms looked identical so there was no issue. Junior year we found a place where there was one room with a bathroom on the main level and then a second (way nicer) room upstairs with it’s own bathroom. Basically you walked up the stairs and into her massive living space. It was a larger room with a bathroom inside. This year there are two rooms and again one has its own bathroom inside.... here’s the issue, I think I should get this room this year.

I asked her nicely through text and she said she has wanted it and planned on taking it but we could flip a coin on move in day. In the moment, I was furious and didn’t want to let my anger talk so I just agreed. Looking back and talking to more people, I think this is super unfair? Maybe not bt this is why I’m asking for advice.

So here’s the different sides. My roommate does stay all year round at our school as we are from somewhere about 4 hours away. So during breaks and summer she stays at school. I do not, I go back to our hometown to stay with my parents and will visit our apartment about 1-2 times a month. I know this is her only valid reason for wanting the better room but does it even matter if she has the entire apartment to herself anyways? Both rooms are comparable, it’s just the in suite bathroom that is the major difference.

The second thing is I never have house guests over and when I do we hang out in my room. She has house guests over at least 3 times a week (which I don’t care about at all, I just rather not have to deal with the loudness as I have for the past year) and the unwanted room is right by the living room which is where is always entertains her guests. I feel as if I never speak up for any issues I may have because it’s not worth a fight but this one is something I think I truly should get. She is actually an amazing roommate and I am very shocked she replied the way she did because she is a great roommate except for minor things. And maybe I’m in the wrong but I’d just like some perspective on if I should insist on getting the better living space or not. And how I should word it as we would have to live together for this year. Thanks for reading all of this!",15Aug2019,1

Hey, so this is my first time posting here and I’d like to say hey! So I want to start this off by saying that me and my father differ politically very much. He’s a rather conservative libertarian and I am more of a left leaning centrist. We agree on some things such as same sex marriage being completely okay and weed being legalized but for the most part, our views are awfully different. He’s sort of transphobic (though he claims not to be), he’s told me in the past that transgender people are just “confused” and should just deal with not being the gender they identify as because they will “never truly be male/female”. He has stated in the past that he thinks women should serve in the military &amp; that “capitalism is the best way”. Despite not being outwardly homophobic, he tends to become visibly uncomfortable if I start talking about gay men (funnily enough though, he’s completely fine with me talking about girls i find cute, as I’m bisexual) and has told me to “keep it private” when I told him i was getting a shirt mentioning my own sexuality because it “might make *some* people uncomfortable*. He got very upset at me last summer when my mother posted a photo of me flipping off the Whitehouse because it was ""disrespectful” and told me that “just because you don’t like our president doesn’t mean you should defile his position like that” (I actually was banned from my grandparents house, where he lived, for a few months because my grandparents were “offended by my actions”) We have actually banned political discussion when around each other because it always ends in us fighting. Sorry for the long backstory, I just thought it was important to note.

Around a year ago, my father joined our regions proud boys chapter. If you don’t know who they are, the group is basically a neo-facist right wing organization who promote violence against those who oppose them (I would suggest reading articles on them, their wiki page does a good job explaining). I had heard of them before (they were associated with that racist Charlottesville rally a few years ago) and I brought up my consern to him, of which he “reassured” me was just me “listening to the snowflakes”. He continued to tell me that it “wasn’t racist because there’s a black gay guy in the chapter!” of which made me roll my eyes. He didn’t bring it up much at first, just talking about the events he attended in passing.

Another part of joining the club is that you need to get beat up and get a large tattoo that says “proud boy”. My father sent me the photo of it when he got it and it made my blood run cold. I had researched more into the club by this time, their awfully facist views making me awfully worried. I told him it looked fine (it didn’t; it’s huge and goes up his entire forearm in large lettering) and left it at that.

Before I go any further I’d like to note that my father is a recovering alcoholic. He has fallen off the wagon a few times and at this time last year was over a year clean. Anyways, back to the story.

As time went on, the things he mentioned began to concern me. He would mention the wild parties his chapter went to and would tell me about the drinking that was going on at them. He told me he was not getting involved in that but frankly I didn’t buy it…I didn’t say anything though as much as I now wish i would have. They gave him a nickname (I’m not going to say what it was but it was because of how he is Irish and short) that raised a few red flags due to the drinking culture that immediately came to mind when he said it.

In may he confessed to me what I had suspected all along: he was drinking again. He claimed it was only occasionally but i didn’t believe him. I told him I was concerned but he brushed me off as usual. I was genuinely worried at this point. My father is not the same person I love when he’s drinking. He’s more manic and bipolar and makes rash decisions. He’s acknowledged this in the past but I don’t think he knows how good at telling if hes feeling like that because of how he was always drinking while i was growing up. At that moment i knew the club wasn’t good for him but yet again I kept my mouth shut.

Around memorial day, when coming home from a camping trip, I received a message my dad had sent two days before. It was long but to put it simply, he told me he was in the hospital after contemplating suicide. My grandparents had apparently kicked him out as well and he was going to move in with one of his friends from the club. That wasn’t even the most disturbing part. He told me that I was the only reason he didn’t do it. I immediately broke down in tears, my mom &amp; her fiancee asking what was wrong. I wanted to tell them but my dad had told me not to let my mother know in fear of backlash. I kept this shit a secret for months , causing my mental health to deteriorate &amp; making it hard for me to focus on schoolwork. I eventually did tell my mother but fuck wasn’t it hard.

This all leads up to about two months ago, the day i got out of school, when my dad let me know he had a falling out with the club. He told me everything I had suspected. They apparently didn’t take his drinking problem seriously and pressured him into drinking copious amounts at regional events with other chapters. He apparently was also coaxed into doing cocaine for the first time in his 43 years of life. He had moved back in with my grandparents after his “chapter brothers” started giving him shit for focusing on his mental health instead of getting fucked up every weekend. He left the club because of this, the toxicity of it all drowning him and forcing him to leave. Despite this, he still supports the group. I’ve tried explaining that it isn’t good for him &amp; that they aren’t good people but he isnt having any of it. What’s even worse is that he still has that tattoo , a literal fucking inking that advertises a group who is basically two steps under the KKK. He changes the subject whenever i suggest maybe getting it covered up, just saying he will just always wear long sleeves. What is even more worrisome is that he supports this group , a group with some awfully anti semetic ideals, despite having a Jewish daughter (I’m not religious though, I’m ethnically &amp; culturally a Jew). I don’t know how to bring up my concerns to my father without making him upset. I love him very much (growing up he was my best friend) and I hate having this shit driving us apart. Especially after the news of that chapter in Portland, the idea of him being associated at all with the proud boys makes me sick to my stomach. I haven't seen him since the weekend after he told me and frankly I'm nervous.

Advice for bringing this up with him? Thanks.

862,"Hi, this is my first post on Reddit ever so I apologize in advance if anything is formated wrong or I do something incorrectly. This has been an extremely emotionally taxing situation for me and I just feel I have no idea what to even do regarding this situation.

I got accepted to my dream school with decent scholarships (about half of my tuition was paid for through scholarships and grants); I had known far in advance though that I would need to take out a decent-sized loan to make up for the rest of the costs due to my mom being the single provider for our household, and not making a ton of money in the first place. I would have to take on about $24,000 in loans for my first year. 

However, when it came to actually taking out a private loan, I was denied the option to have my loan request even reviewed by numerous private institutions as I'm fresh out of high school and don't really have a credit history built for myself yet. My mom attempted to be my cosigner but due to the fact that she had only finalized a bankruptcy last year and she's still working on building up her credit score back up, she was denied both as a cosigner for a private loan as well as the federal parent PLUS loan program. So there was no way she was going to be able to help me obtain the loan I needed.

My dad, on the other hand, provided me no help whatsoever despite making three times more than my mom annually, owning his own house (my mom only rents), getting remarried, buying a motorcycle, and paying off his car payment. He refuses to cosign or provide any help in this situation, which is devastating to me. 

The only other option would be my grandfather who I'm close to, but he rarely uses his credit card and his credit score would be too low to qualify for a private loan. So there is no way I will be able to secure a loan to pay for the other half of my schooling. 

This has all primarily blown up roughly two weeks before I am about to head out to school; hotels were booked for my family to see me off out there, I shipped my belongings to the school and paid for them, I already had a decent paying job out there that hired me and gave me amazing hours that worked with my school schedule... only for it all to blow up on me. I have no idea where to go from here. It's too late to quickly enroll in a local university or community college but I can't stand the thought of sitting at home and taking a gap year. I had worked two years throughout high school to save up a decent amount of money, I already had 15 college credits from taking dual and ap courses, I won scholarships through my high school, and worked my ass off to get a high GPA and SAT/ACT scores. I feel so lost because this has been a dream I've worked towards for years and I feel like now it's all going to waste because of my situation. People are still telling me to be positive and still try but I feel like it's all useless at this point.

I just need advice, I guess. I feel lost and like I've greatly disappointed myself and the people I care about. As a first-generation college student, I had wanted to be the first in my family to succeed but I feel like this situation is only setting me back and just putting me on track to just end up like my parents, and I never wanted that for myself.",15Aug2019,1
863,"Hi,

I have a very peculier case of flat feet. Basically my right foot is flat and my left isn't. I know this  may be common but my issue is with my custom foot orthotics. 

I have gotten almost 5 pairs of custom orthotics from 3 different podiatrists but nothing seems to work. ($500 x 5 = $2500 down the drain)

When I wear the orthotics, my right foot (the flat one) feels great but my left foot (the non flat one) is in pain. I'm not sure why my left foot is rejecting the insole so much. The pain persists mostly where the arch is on the insole. My doctor has tried altering the left insole so that the arch is lower on the left side but that so far hasn't helped. 

When I wear regular shoes with no insoles, my left foot feels great but of course my right foot which is flat is in pain. 

I've also tried wearing the right insole with the right foot and leaving the left foot without the custom insole. This does reduce foot pain slightly however I feel unbalanced and I get pain in my left knee. 

Does anybody else have this problem? If so please let me know what you did to fix it? 

This problem has really made my life less enjoyable and I just want to find a way to fix it so I can run, walk, jump and play sports without pain.",15Aug2019,1

865,"This is kind of a weird advice post, but I didn't know where else to post.

Our bedroom in our complex has a large two pane glass door out to our patio. The window faces to the East, so in the early morning, around 5:30am, we get a blinding light coming into our room which makes it hard to sleep. We decided to put up blackout curtains. Since we put up curtains in our living room, we didn't even think to ask the office if this was okay, but as I was looking at our bedroom blinds today, I realized that we for sure will have to take them down. The blinds are vertical and huge, no curtain rod would fit over them. It's impossible. So I called the office to ask if they had a place to store the blinds once we take them down (as we don't have enough storage in our place) and they told us we weren't allowed to take the blinds down.

I explained that the light is blinding and there is no way a curtain rod would fit over them and hang correctly. She came back with a ""tough luck"" sort of answer. My question is, if we take them down anyways and just find a place to keep these giant ass blinds in the apartment somewhere, is it possible that the apartment complex could kick us out for something so small?

I'm an early 20 years old 6""4  275lb big guy from Canada, and I kind of grew up with some twisted shit. 

When I was 2 years old, my mother started beating up my father. I didn't get my body shape from the neighbor.

I remember him just standing still, getting his face rearanged by her and doing nothing to stop it. She laughed and acted psychotic while in the act. He sometimes even fell and she would keep kicking and punching him until he ran away in his car with a bloody face. And then he came back the day after and the cycle restarted.

I got 4 or 5 and it was my turn now. It started with slaps to the back of the head for stupid reasons, then beating my ass until it turned purple, and then I got the same treatment as my dad. But you know what? It didnt stop. She started using weapons, since ""because of us she didnt have dexterity anymore"" and tried to suffocate me in different liquid: ice cold baths in the middle of night, numerous times in the pool and finaly, 3 times in used toilet water. My head was smashed through a wall, I was forced to hold my USED little brothers diaper on my face for hours, got whiped, got death threats, etc. You get the picture.

My father would stand there most of the time, and when he interposed he got beaten right through the door again.

Funny thing is, she was a good psychoeducator for kids and even had a kindergarden once. I guess thats how she convinced us it was all my fathers doing with his evil mind powers.

When I got 12 child services came with the police and I got sent in a foster home for 6 months. The bitch got thrown in jail and still denies everything to this day.


€To hell with her, now here's the present issue:

I keep having flashbacks and getting depressive, but my dad wants to live a new life with my little brother (he was too young to remember anything), my stepmother and her kids.

I followed therapies, took meds, saw psychiatrists, but the only thing that keeps me alive is not wanting to make him sad. He had enough sadness for a lifetime.

He would send messages saying he loved me, and I would feel ""meh"" (english is not my first language, I just don't know what word to use to express how I feel, sorry). But when he dumped me, it hurt me so much I could not even eat during one month. I did not feel love, but I felt the sadness at the end. I felt terrible because I did not understand how I could hurt when I was so uninterested when I was with him. Some ways to show love even make me cringe. But I do feel lust for the person I am with, I do feel peaks of love at time where I want to tell them I love them. But it happens very rarely. I don't understand, I loved both of the boys I got out with, but I never felt it. Is this just what love is, or maybe am I too young and these are not real love ? Because I do feel it's the most I can love, I love my boyfriend, but I'm still just ""meh"".",15Aug2019,2

874,"I hired an artist roughly 2 years ago on a long-term project costing me over $2,000. Our agreement was that he got the first thousand after finishing concept art, and then the other thousand after finishing the work. If he didn't go through with it and quit on me halfway, the first thousand was forfeit.

He suddenly vanished about two or three months back. I've been trying to search for him online and nothing. Not only am I concerned since that thousand was from my college fund, but I'm also worried about him since he expressed having suicidal thoughts before. He lives in the Philippines, I live in the US.",15Aug2019,1

877,"So today, my sister got mad at me for not wanting to put water bottles in the fridge, even though I put waters in the fridge after saying that. She said to give her my phone and I got a bit anxious. I have online friends on Discord and we talk about memes and play games together. I know they arent adults. We are all female  and are younger than 17. We showed our faces to a discord group too. We even do voice chats together. My family isnt accepting of friends online, which is why i kept it a secret since November, when we all met up. Now i'm banned from using my phone and computer for I dont know how long. Im using some old phone that cant download apps so im using the desktop version of Reddit. I cant get on discord on desktop. I haven't seen them in a while and i've been feeling sad. They make me so happy and we laugh together. I have no other friends irl since im a bit lonely and get some anxiety when im talking to other people. I know theg didnt grow up with the internet but they think everyone here are pedos. I know about how to stay safe on the Internet. Please help. Sorry if theres mistakes im in a rush.",15Aug2019,3
878,"I recently tried to buy a bottle of wine at a grocery store, and I'm 21. I showed her my ID that showed I was 21, but she immediately handed it back and told me no - I was under 21. Despite my repeated insistence to just look at the date that showed I was 21 and that it was still valid, the checkout lady instead decided to treat me incredibly rudely and more or less told me to go away, like I was some sort of child. It was incredibly frustrating, not to mention embarrassing to me, for this to happen.

In the moment I was completely shocked and just gave up and walked away, but to be honest I'm pretty pissed about it. Is it worth calling up the store and trying to talk to the manager to complain, or should I just let it go? Like I said, it was pretty embarrassing for me and I want some sort of apology for the disgusting way that was handled.",15Aug2019,5
879,"I apologise in advance if my grammar is messed up as I typed this out in a rush and my formatting might be weird as it was typed out on mobile.

My boyfriend of 3 months has been quite busy lately and so have I, as I'm having exams at the moment. I've known from the start that I wouldn't be his top priority at the moment as he's currently in the army and he is a very family oriented person. I do not put him as a top priority as well as my studies, family and friends come first. However he always makes an effort to text me as and when he is able to. 

I text him a lot and he has told me that he appreciates it but at the same time he feels that I'm wasting my time and he said he feels that I deserve better. Honestly I'm happy with him and I think he's enough so how do I tell him this?",15Aug2019,2
880,"Hi guys 
My parents have been happily married for about 30 years and me and my siblings are more or less grown adults now and living our lives working and studying etc.
My mum has reached some sort of mid life crisis and did this weird thing where she’s hidden a completely different side of her. A few months ago she basically packed up her stuff in a suitcase and left home without telling my dad or the rest of the family. Leaving so suddenly is so odd especially when she has all of us even though we live in different cities..
Anyway we found out she’d been talking to another guy over social media and planned to meet him. She got on a plane and flew to another country without any notice etc. 
We managed to get her back because luckily we have family in the country she flew to so they bought plane tickets to the final destination and managed to stop her boarding the plane at the gate. 
At this point she didn’t want to speak to any of us..
Fast forward a few months she’s acting a bit shady again and red flags have started to pop up again as she isn’t being herself? Hiding her phone and buying LOADS of new clothing that she wouldn’t normally wear which is what she did just before she took off the first time. 
We don’t know how to approach her on what’s happened and if she’s planning another runaway? Her mind evidently isn’t in the right head space which is so upsetting seeing as we’ve always been such a strong family. 
Whenever my dad has tried to speak about the situation since it happened my mum gets really defensive and starts getting really angry and insisting everything is in the past... 
Obviously my dad is heart broken and hurt that this has happened, she’s been swayed by a guy over the internet that she’s never met before and she has a supportive and loving family? 

I’m just wondering what would be the best approach to speak about what’s happened with my mum? And how do we get to understand what’s happening in her head when she is displaying a different side of her to our faces :( I’m struggling to even get my head around everything :( 

Thankyou x",15Aug2019,4
881,"So my sister and I were on eachothers phones today. We do this pretty often. She took screenshots of some things on instagram and later on wanted to crop them or something.

Later on today I took some pictures of myself which I think we all can guess what they were of. Well I was feeling myself this morning so I took some pictures of myself naked. I wasn’t sending them anywhere , I was just taking them for myself and forgot to delete them. 

She didn’t say anything but she definitely saw them. I’m so embarrassed. Me and my sister are like best friends and I’m scared this will change something between us.

TL;DR Sister saw my nudes on my phone but didn’t say anything.",15Aug2019,2
882,"So I’m currently am a sophomore that just started school yesterday. I came to the high school that I am currently am at the beginning of the freshman year. Since I was new to the district I didn’t have any friends whatsoever but by then end of the year I made   Some(although I’m nowhere near popular). Fast forward to today and I’m moving out of the city in a month and kinda scared to start all over. I’m pretty shy and introverted so making friends it’s a bit rough  but it will be even worse considering everybody will already have their friend groups established.Ive been telling myself that once I go to this new school I’m going to join a sport to make friends easily. I’ve been thinking of joining Football but the thing is, I’m pretty small and skinny(I’m 5’1 or 154 cm) so I don’t know if I’ll have much of a chance another thing to note is I don’t have much experience in sports at all. Don’t know how to play football at or not any sport for that matter. I don’t think I’ve ever played football in my life if I’m being honest and I don’t even know how to throw a football but I kind of want to learn.",15Aug2019,1
883,"Quick warning: this is post has a bit of backstory but it is mostly essential information. 

I live in the us,  east coast. Sally, sally’s sister, and collin all live out west . 


Early in July of last month i was talking to a friend mine, lets call her sally. I’ve been online friends with sally for about 2 years now. We’ve been mostly gaming buddies but at some point last year we exchanged phone numbers. In addition, we made an effort to talk / associate over non-gaming related topics. We became really good friends and it got the point where i was invited to join her and her sister for some online gaming. After playing with her and her sister a few times , i became pretty good friends with her sister as well. I began to game with either of them individually depending when everyone was online. Sally’s sister introduced me to her husband, collin, and i wound up gaming with both of them for sometime. Great people, good company. 

At this point i should mention that Sally is about 20. During these events i was 20. Sally’s sister is in her mid thirties. 

I would talk with sally a few times per week and i would speak with sally’s sister once a week at most. A couple months ago i asked Sally’s sister if she wanted to exchange numbers as well. I figured that texting would be better than trying to continue conversations over the course of weeks. Sally’s sister was ok with it and we exchanged numbers. Around this time , sally told me that she thought i was infatuated with her sister because i asked for her number. I assured her that this was not the case. I was happy to just be friends with sally’s sister. Sally told her sister about this, even after i told her that i had no secret infatuation for her sister. Sally’s sister got really concerned and thought that i was trying to get with her. Recall, the age difference,location difference , and the fact that i was also a online only friend. I assured sally’s sister that this infatuation rumor couldn’t be further from the truth. Sally’s sister eventually agreed, but asked me to not text her phone number and only use online chats. I thought it was a bit much,but i respect it, and i immediately agreed. I removed her number from my phone. I decided to send collin,Sally’s sister’s husband, a text explaining what had occurred. I did not wish for him to think i was attempting to get with his wife. I later received from collin. He was very upset that i asked for his wifes phone number and thought that i was trying to get with her. After explaining that was not the case, he concluded that they were not upset but to never contact either of them again. I have since respected that wish and have not spoke to either of them since. 

I spoke to sally about it and i was really upset about how everything ended up. It doesn’t bother me as much that i was asked to ceased contact , but being falsely accused of something that immoral pissed me off. I gathered from my conversation with sally , that she did not intend for sister to react in such a way and confused why they cut contact with me. Near the end of my conversation Sally apologized for the 100th time and wanted me to remain friends with her. I told her that i would need some time to think. 

Should i still continue my friendship with Sally?",15Aug2019,1
