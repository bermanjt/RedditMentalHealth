0,"Me (MTF)(mid-twenties) and my partner (F) have been together for nearly a decade. We've been through thick and thin together, riding our relationship's boat through the tides no matter the storm. Recently (over the past 5 years) I've been dealing with a lot of my own personal Trauma which has made it impossible for me to work a normal job, or sometimes at all. During this time my partner has been extremely supportive and I always feel guilty for not bringing in an income but I don't know what to do because my mental health always goes to shit whenever I pick up a job. I've recently started coding and have plans for it to become a source of income, and am even considering therapy after many years of stubborn frustration with the psychological support system due to several bad experiences with it during my childhood and teen years.  


The entire time that me and my partner have been together her sister has done everything to tear us apart and always gossips to her friends (and now boyfriend) about how terrible I am. Last night my sister-in-law's boyfriend ""had a talk"" with my partner about our relationship questioning her for the millionth time anyone her sister knows has talked to her. During the talk he said he wants to ""have a talk"" \*with me\* . I have dealt with this shit for a decade... how do I tell her boyfriend (that has only been with my sister-in-law for around 1-2 years) to kindly fuck off with his useless and sexist advice? Because I know what's best for me and am already taking action, and the drama my partner's sister likes to cause is only making things worse for everyone including my partner.",07May2019,3
1,My coworker told me earlier today that he was going to be getting a flu shot tomorrow and I’m worried that I will be infected with the flu if he shows up to work after getting his shot. Should I call in sick and not risk being actually ill?,07May2019,1
2,"I'm a pretty average high school student, maybe a bit below average. But i absolutely cant stand school, i like hanging out with friends in school, i don't get bullied or anything like that. But i just hate doing the school work, homework, the stress associated with doing school work that i have absolutely no motivation to do. Since i live in the state of Florida, almost all the big schools here require around a 4.0 GPA to get into. I am sitting around 3.5 right now and i have no idea if i will be able to get into any University or college at all that isn't a public college. Can i succeed at making $50,000 a year or more without going to college, or going to public a college and getting an associates?",07May2019,1
3,"Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm typing this to help calm myself down as I'm filled with anxiety at the moment... basically my life is an absolute mess. I'm living in my car, I'm living paycheck to paycheck, I've been so broke recently that I've had to restrict my eating--not to mention that I'm 18 years old so I don't have enough credit history to go get a loan or anything--everything has just been so difficult to deal with. To give you some more background, I'm a high-school dropout who works full-time as web-developer. I threw away all of my friends, and a beautiful girlfriend who loved me dearly, all because of money and plain immaturity.  About 8 months ago, I started working for this company in LA (wont name names) and starting making a pretty good amount of money. Now at the time I had just moved to Los Angeles, after leaving my mother's home, and wasn't used to both living on my own, and making so much money. So, I spent like an idiot, I bought the latest Iphone, I found a really nice in the area and split it amongst 2 other people, it was a massive, and beautiful place. To be generous, I started giving my girlfriend (well, now ex-girlfriend) a $100/wk allowance...?? I still can't believe I did that shit, all while still paying for all of our dinners, activities, etc. I wasted so much time fucking around, my schedule was essentially just working till 5, then going to my girlfriends house to essentially just get high, fuck, and lay in bed the rest of the day. And when I wasn't with my girlfriend, say with my friends, I'd be out partying and getting shit-faced until I could barely move. It was terrible. It got bad... really bad... My friends eventually stopped hanging out with me because I got way too invested in my relationship, to the point where I'd constantly bail on them, as all as just acting like a piece of shit to them. Later within my relationship, when I began to realize that I had little money saved up as a result of my spending, I started to grow resentment towards my girlfriend, every dinner, every week of allowance, it just annoyed me. I had too much of an ego, however, to tell her the truth about my financial situation. And one eventful night, while her and her friends we're over my house, getting drunk (myself included)--oh, and let me include the fact that three of us were on acid too :/,  I made the very wise decision to have sex with one of her friends. That, was the breaking point. Evidently, she broke up with me, and till this day (and probably for a while) I cannot forgive myself for what I did that day--mostly because I always told myself that I would never do that to somebody. Not even a week later, I almost get fired at work (you know, the place that's giving me this money in the first place) as a result of me constantly missing work (mostly because of me being too hungover from the previous night), and a couple month later--I get a notice of vacancy from my landlord...a weeks notice. The fucking son of bitch never told us the bank was taking over the home, so we were left with that wonderful surprise. And now, I'm here, I'm living in my car. I've been living in my car for a month, and I'm beyond thankful that I still have my job, I'm actually doing A LOT better at work, and my boss is now in love with me again as he was when he first hired me :p. Now, I work from 8-5, M-F, I go to the gym for 2-3 hours after work, followed by 2 hours a day of reading on python (a programming language I want to master next). It's really tough though, living all alone and being stuck in your head with all of your regrets. I'm hoping to save for the next few months so I get a new place, and take this time to reflect on my actions. It's just unreal to me that all of these things have happened, I just never expected it. I can blame it on my shitty upbringing, or on whatever the fuck, but at the end of the day it has been my poor choices that have led me here. Now it's time to just start from scratch. It just gets really hard sometimes because I'm so alone now, I sometimes just feel so empty. Anyways, I hope you found this story somewhat interesting, if anybody who's read this has any words of wisdom, I'm all ears",07May2019,1
4,"Okay, so I tried out for cheer and made JV as a junior.  I’ve been in the team fresh and soph year, would it be embarrassing to be on the team or should I just stick it out (because sometimes during the season girls get pushed up to varisty).  There’s some people that were on the team last year and didn’t even make V or JV.  I enjoy the sport but JV cheer is kind of treated like shit when it comes to how much attention we get from the coaches.  Thoughts?",07May2019,1
5,"My best friend and I work together at a pizza place in town. We work together 4-5 days a week for about 5 hours a day at most. His sister got us the job, she is the manager there. He started working there about a year before I did. Now I have been working there for about 6 months, and he has been working there a year and a half. However, recently, he has become very distant with me and we haven't been hanging out as much outside of work. Normally we spend a lot of time together and at least 5 days a week we would do something together, even if it was just grabbing food together after work. But it was starting to feel like I was being ignored. When I asked him if he was angry at me, he told me he hates working with me but said there was no reason why, he just hates it. He's been texting his sister about me, telling her I'm incredibly annoying and that I ""take too many days off"" (keep in mind, this was a reference to a day I had to take off for a funeral.) I asked if there was anything I was doing wrong, or if I could change anything about my work routine, and he said ""not really."" So I felt disappointed. It has seriously affected our friendship out of nowhere. We haven't been hanging out, he's stopped texting me the way he used to, and at work it's clear he is avoiding talking to me. I don't know what happened or what I did to make him angry. He tends to lean on the narcissistic scale and he hates dealing with his feelings or anyone else's, (his words not mine) so it can be hard to talk to him and have him open up. It's been making life at home and at work miserable, and when I mentioned quitting, he told me I was selfish because now is ""not a good time to quit"" since one of our coworkers is about to have a baby. I feel so trapped right now and I don't want to lose my best friend. But I don't feel like I'm being respected or given a chance to fix anything, even though I have no idea what I could have done. I haven't made anyone else angry or annoyed anyone else at work as far as I know. And it's just a part time job at a pizza place. What could I possibly be doing that is making him so angry, you know? Does anyone have any advice on working with a close friend? Or any advice on what to do here? Anything would be really appreciated.",07May2019,1
7,"I'm after some advice on how to deal with my wife when she has her period. 

She becomes very mean, depressed, short tempered, emotional, etc. I understand this is normal and I know she's bleeding constantly and it is obviously shit. 

But her moods are extreme. I've lived with many other women in my family and some other relationships so speaking with some experience. 

Just now I noticed her stomping around, muttering and complaining.  I tries to give her a hug and ask her if she's ok and she literally pushed me away. I asked her if she could consider my feelings and this set her off. 

I only think about myself, I'm selfish, etc. etc. 

When we first started dating she was extremely short tempered and had trouble communicating her needs and feelings. She would sulk, act passive aggressively and give me the silent treatment when upset and it took hours of me having to coax it out of her to get to the problem so we could talk about it. She is also prone to depression and very introverted. 

I'm really big on communication and if there is a problem I feel like we need to talk about it to avoid the same patterns happening again. If I bring up this topic is is usually projected right back onto me. 

I am not perfect either and I know I have a lot of problems. I'm not trying to change her. I know I'm not a woman and I will never really know how hard this is. 

I know I should probably shut up and let her be during these periods. However, walking on eggshells for a week every month is exhausting and I think some acknowledgement of her part is appropriate. 

Genuinely seeking answers on how to solve this issue. Please don't give hateful comments on how I'm being an asshole. 

I think this issue is very sensitive, particularly when men talk about their feelings on the issue. In fact it's become taboo to an extent. But I'm putting it out there. 

Thanks!",07May2019,1

12,"I'm an 18 year old girl, and my friend has been in an on and off relationship for 4 years while sleeping with other people in between the relationship, the Friend, we'll call her Faith and her Boyfriend, Greg, are both 17. Yesterday Faith got dumped by Greg and asked to come to my house and spend time with me so she can be comforted, which I happily accepted. After I took her to get ice cream and everything she decided to go to the park with me. We sat in her car and she told me about how for the past month Greg has disrespected her and barely tried in the relationship. I've been in a very steady relationship for a long time, so I don't know how to really help besides saying not to take him back immediately and tell him how much it REALLY bothered her, and that it was her last straw, since she was already threatening him with a break up the day before and gave him a week to fix himself. She went from being a ""Strong independent woman who was going to Colorado for an amazing vet program."" to crying and saying this guy was the love of her life and that they were going to alaska to move there the day before his 18th birthday to start a family ASAP. 

&amp;#x200B;

I knew not to trust her with her idea she told me which was basically have him over that night to ""Sit him down and talk."" I got dropped off at my house ( I had a bloody nose from the heat and she had no tissue in her car.) And she was off of facebook all day. Today I woke up to read that she slept with him to get him to stay. This really frustrated me because I've never liked this guy, he's always treated her like trash, but she INSISTS ""That's not who Greg really is!! Greg is so amazing!! Greg would never do this, greg would never dump anyone over text like he did me! There has to be something wrong! He won't sleep with me anymore, and that's just not him. Greg isn't like this."" But to my knowledge he always has been. This is so frustrating to me because I love Faith like she's my sister, and I just want to protect her but I want her to know she has me and my support. What do I do the next time they split, how do I help?

&amp;#x200B;

16,"Background:

&gt;!I'm in Y13 (18 y/o). A-Level exams are just round the corner. Just last week I had a meeting with my Physics teacher and the heads of 6th Form to discuss whether I stick doing A-Level or drop down to AS, cos I'm failing badly in all my subjects. We decided I'll do Physics and Chemistry AS, and I have this week to decide if I should do the same for Biology.

I'm failing because I have absolutely zero motivation to study, but even when I've tried I haven't been able to focus and I've felt pretty bad the whole time. In exams, it's a similar situation. I'll read questions over and over again, but they'll go in 1 eye and out the other. Then I'll just zone out for a little while before snapping back to reality, and the process'll repeat itself. In the most recent Physics (AQA) exams I only did 1 full question and the multiple choices at the back, giving me an E on one and a U on the other.

I've put a lot of this down to how I'm feeling generally, but also that I'm just not interested in science at all. I don't think I ever was, and it's pretty stupid I'm only figuring this out now. I got 3 As in those same subjects at GCSE so I guess I just thought that's what I'm destined to do and I'll figure it out before Uni.!&lt;

Anyway so recently I started thinking that I feel like I'd like to do something creative. More specifically, I love shows like Steven Universe and Adventure Time (Tumblr trash, ano, ano) and the idea of a career doing something similar to that whole thing sounds so much better than any sciencey, office, etc. jobs.

Now, finally, where I need advice. The only experience I have doing anything creative is the mandatory Art lessons from Y7-Y9 and this random online game I play called Doodle or Die. The idea of this whole like ""transition"" terrifies me, cos I have no clue where to really start, I'm worried about what other people would think of me taking this path and if I'm being unrealistic/stupid. Plus, I feel a pretty overwhelming sense of urgency since whilst I'm 18, a college course would be free but if I faff about and end up only starting a course when I'm 19, it'll cost dosh.

I should hopefully be able to gather myself to talk to my school's Art teacher tomorrow (one of the heads of 6th form said she talked to her about my situation and I could go talk to her myself), and I'm aware of like access courses and day/evening classes, but I literally just need every shred of advice I can get, so yeno, if yous have any, it'll be much appreciated.

We have a close bond but all we ever seem to do together nowadays is get drunk. I wouldn’t say our friendship is based around this *entirely* but recently it’s gotten to the stage where we’ve been getting drunk near enough **every** day. I ended up losing my job because I never woke up and didn’t show up for work one too many times. Whilst these were obviously my actions and I cannot put the blame on her, I feel like she encourages me and it doesn’t help matters. 

Also, because my friend is pretty much the only friend I have around here, I feel like I don’t have my own life. I’m always hanging at her house or with her friends, and I feel like my life is more like an extension of hers. I want to make some more friends of my own and develop my own circle. 

I went away to visit my parents last week and it gave me a lot of perspective. I moved away from home a while ago and unless I want to go back to living in that small town, I need to get myself together and focus on why I came here in the first place.

I live in Tennessee. My best friend of 9 years is a great person. She's funny, and she's thoughtful and selfless. However, around extremely late February, she got caught getting hemp from another student. I knew about it but I let it slip by because I didn't wanna be the goody-two-shoes that ruins all the fun.

I thought she'd learned something after a month of alternative schooling. Apparently not.

Just half an hour ago, we were talking and having fun until she surprised me by saying a 14-year old boy touched her leg and said he wouldn't have minded a threesome (they were with another boy, also 12). I asked what she would have done and she said that she might fuck him. I think I got whiplash reading that text.

I asked if she was serious, and she said she didn't know. I asked her if she knew anything about underaged sex, what would she do if she got pregnant, why would she ever consider this, etc. etc. She started to get mad and said she wouldn't tell me if she did have sex with him, anyways.

I got mad in return. I said if she didn't get her shit together, we're done as friends. In February, I told her that if she did anything like the hemp incident again I would tell her mother. I'm not quite sure what to do now.

37,Over the last few years I’ve watched my parents change dramatically.  They both retired and soon after began making a lot of friends they’d meet on trips.  I’d begin to have suspicions as these seemingly close friends would come and go in a matter of 6 months.  I got a few texts that were weird sent to me accidentally by one of my parents a few times and they’d rush to tell me who they meant to send it to and the meaning behind the text but it just seemed like a lie to me.  I have two siblings and we’re all in our mid 20’s early 30’s.   We were raised in a somewhat strict Christian household.  Over this time the religious part of them has seemingly vanished.  My parents now have these new married friends and hang out with them a lot.  The other day I met one of the husband and he was very friendly.  My dad and I had to run an errand and he left the male friend home alone with my mom.  That was an instant sign to me of what life my parents are leading right now.  I have a toddler and he stuck around all day to meet my son.  He seemed to know everything about myself and my wife.  My parents over the last month have sold the home we all grew up in and they’ve owner for 25 years.  They’re moving about 2 hours away and that just weirds me out so much as they have a you g grandson who is crazy about them.  I’m all for enjoying retirement but I feel extremely hurt and upset to think they are moving away from us to live this secret life with this other couple.  I also honestly don’t like that I’m involved at all.  I don’t want to meet these people and I don’t want them seeing pictures of my son and them knowing everything that’s going on in his life.  To me this goes past the religious aspect of it being morally wrong to me.   I can’t bring myself to talk to them about it or talk to my brothers about it or especially my wife because her opionion of my parents would change dramatically.  So far this has just been an internal battle for me over several years and it’s been made more difficult with them moving away and selling the house.  Just venting and looking for advice on how to move forward with this internal struggle I’m having,07May2019,1

Now as I lay in my hammock outside, I’m reminiscing and filling up with regret and sadness along with happiness. Is this what it’s supposed to feel like? Am I supposed to have this contemplation power hour? I didn’t have that luxurious college life of drinking and banging chicks like college is painted to be. Im about to interview for a job in Dallas Texas. I’m just stuck. I’m genuinely really anxious and I don’t know how to calm down.

41,"So, it’s sort of a long story but hear me out. 
I initially met this guy from tinder, early of my first semester this year and we hit up really great. Since then, we’d hang out, and pretty much go out on dates, and spend the night together on weekends. And after a little while, I confessed to him that I wanted him to officially be my bf. 
And that’s when things sort of went downhill.  He told me he’d been scarred from his past relationships, and wasn’t quite ready to get into a relationship yet, but I am the only one he’s seeing. So I decided that maybe he’d change his mind if he saw that I was different from those women, so I waited.
Fast forward to now, like five months from that moment. Here we still are with our busy school and life in general, we kept hanging out on weekends and I swear our chemistry just kept growing, and he’d occasionally ask about what I had planned for the future (summer plans etc), but that didn’t really go anywhere since I hadn’t gotten any job offers for the summer. 
A little after that, I began having dreams of him and tossing and turning, making me realize I think I am in love with him. 
And so I asked him again if we could date officially, and told him about my dreams of him and my tossing and turning because of it. And he pretty much told me he likes me but isn’t sure because of the summer, where he wouldn’t be able to see me and he said he’d done past long distance relationships and they just didn’t work with him, so he was saving our troubles by not starting it. 
So then, I felt upset because I felt that he sort of just strung me along all those months, and so I told him I couldn’t keep seeing him because it just breaks me and I literally can’t even sleep worrying about us. 
So then we agreed that it was the end of us for now, but we’d perhaps try for a future friendship or relationship. This was three weeks ago. 
The week after that, he deleted me on SMS (I only realized since I tried to send him a snap and it didn’t go through). 
And I’m still having troubles sleeping. 
So then, I decided to disregard his change in SMS behavior; perhaps our “breakup “ was hurting him more than I realized, so he deleted me. I’ll never know^^
But I realized that this was hurting me even more now, since it also seemed to me that he was actively removing me from his life. 
So I asked, in clarification if he would’ve dated me if summer didn’t exist (if he was staying in town near me instead, hypothetically) and he said he didn’t know. I didn’t know how to respond to that, since I’m also sort of lost in life right now too, and can sympathize on just being lost on such a specific question, and still hurting from past wounds.
I’m also worried that I won’t hear from him after summer (long story short, I’ve had an ex do that after and agreed break for the summer and he ghosted me after, I don’t want to repeat that now). Or that, he’s actually using summer to get over me, without just being honest and telling me because he doesn’t want to keep missing me for the summer since it hurts.
So I made up my mind that, even though I know I shouldn’t wait for him but my heart just knows he’s the one, I wanted to keep seeing him at least until he leaves. I just want as much time with him as possible, since I think that is the only thing that will make me feel any better at this point. 
And so, today I just texted him asking  him if we could see each other again, at least until he has to leave for his job. And he still hasn’t responded. 
So now I’m just really mixed up on all of this. Do you think I’ve just totally screwed up all my chances with him? 
Part of me realizes how desperate I must look, but the other part of me can’t deny but be genuine in telling him how I feel and doing what my says I should do.",07May2019,1

After graduation, due to some health issues, I was unable to work for a while. Now that I’m better, I’ve been job searching for about 2 months. I had an interview for a Job A in my area of study 3 weeks ago and hadn’t heard back from them even though I sent a follow up email last week Monday. Last Thursday, I had an interview for a Job B that utilizes my skills, but not exactly in my area of study. I was given a job offer at Job B the very next day, Friday, for a contract job for 3 months with the possibility of being hired as a permanent full time after that. Without any response from Job A or any other places I had applied to, I accepted the offer and decided to start ASAP as I was excited to be working. Just today, Monday, after my first day at Job B, Job A contacted me about wanting to offer me the job. I hadn’t asked about the exact compensation yet, but it would be a permanent full-time job. In my field, in order to get my licensure, I have to have worked in my field for a defined number of hours, which Job A would fulfill. Job A also happens to be half the travel distance of Job B. Despite not being my field of study, Job B is a bigger company. Job B also seems to have a friendlier work environment (from what I could tell based on my short time at Job A for the interview). I know all signs seem to be pointing me to work at Job A, but I’m having doubts. Would it be terrible of me to leave Job B to go for Job A? Should I ask what the compensations of Job A are first?",07May2019,1

54,"As the title states, I’m a bit stumped about my friends. The group started back in our freshman year of high school, we’re now seniors, graduating in about 5 weeks. The groups had some changes, had some people leave, others have filled the gap, now the groups somewhat big. I’m one of the three original people in the group, one being the core of the group, someone I consider my best friend. The other is another kid, I don’t think likes me too much. The rest are people in our grade who have just randomly started being our friends.

I don’t feel very a part of this group anymore, more of a floater if you will. I feel ignored plenty of times, I feel like I’m a last resort when it comes to hanging out, or not even an option at all. The group chat that we have just gives me anxiety at this point. They’re constantly on a group call, I rarely ever join, they’re usually just talking about drama, super niche songs or video games, or just talking about bizarre history facts, not much I can relate to. The group chat is also just filled up with pretty edgy and unfunny memes. They’re pretty edgy in real life too, they jokingly say very racist or derogatory things and that’s just sort of the norm, I’m pretty uncomfortable with saying those kind of things so I’ll just stay quiet usually.  I just feel like I’m outgrowing these people, and hard. I’m close with about 2 other people as well and it’s tough wanting to tell them you don’t want to be with this group anymore. 

They’ve been there for me a number of times, supported me, but I just don’t feel like one of them anymore, and part of it makes me just want to straight up leave. I have other friends, but if I lost this group, I’d be losing a big chunk of my friends...any advice?",07May2019,1

Then during the second slow dance, I was walking to the other girl as she wasn’t dancing with anyone. As I was walking over G came up behind me and asked “Would you like to dance with me”?

56,"So I’ve worked on this farm about 3 and half years, and living on it for about 2. My girlfriend moved in with me about a year and 2 months ago. It’s a double wide trailer, so far not so good, it was pretty dirty when I moved in but with a little bit of elbow grease and patience we made it livable. For a while we were paying $500/month for rent (not bad at all). However after harvest I asked for a raise and instead they said they would make my rent free. At first I was a little skeptical but hey, I’m saving around $6000 per year with this deal. However the house now really seems to be falling apart... we went without water for four days and without hot water for a week. The ducting under our house apparently has gone to shit so it was pretty brutal winter, and now it’s getting warm. Also the floor started to warp incredibly bad and they found a ton of rot/mold under our kitchen. They’ve know about these problems for months and now are just getting around to fixing them. But when I show my displeasure to my bosses they just tell me free rent if free rent. I have another job that will hopefully come through soon, but I do like working here, I just feel neglected I guess? Sometimes I just feel like a chump?

60,"Hey reddit, sorry for any of my past complaints I had on this account I have recently come back.

These past few weeks have been rough for me and question my existence. I know I sound like some spoiled 21-year-old, but I really need help with family, school, future, and possibly friends. So recently my mother got laid off from work due to bipolar disorder and being deemed unfit to work and since a huge amount of our income came from her. It also doesn’t make it better that she mopes around a lot, I feel awful for her and wish her the best, but there are things she has done that makes it difficult to sympathesize with her. 

As an electrical engineer major (only a 3.1 GPA), I am having my 3rd year in a row not having an internship even though I tried this year and got my butt kicked by some of the most difficult electrical engineering classes this semester. I did have a tutoring job and I once worked at J-Crew over the summer, but that is it in terms of job experience. My mother constantly blames me for not being like others and hard-working enough, but sometimes it isn’t easy especially considering I can’t sit in one place in a long period of time and get easily distracted due to ADHD. In addition, she constantly compares me to other kids about how I can’t be as successful as them (Asian parent mentality in a way), so whenever she offers advice, which I do appreciate, she makes comparisons to me that eventually causes me to either lock myself in my room or storm out of the house. 

I have already signed up for a study abroad program for the fall, about the same price as the going to a semester in college, partially to visit Europe for the first time and to escape my family. The oddest thing is that once I leave my family out of business, I tend to make a lot more friends. Recently, my best friend even invited me to go camping with her, which I happily accepted. But my mom told me to cancel my plans as punishment for not being successful in my search for a job (though my best friend already has an internship this summer, despite being a year younger than me). It also doesn’t help my case that I recently broke-up in a 2 month relationship, which I greatly miss and sometimes desire to visit the girlfriend experience for prostitues so I can regain that wonderful feeling. In addition, I am currently texting my phone due to my MacBook Pro crashing down after 4 years of service.

She had cheated in the past before our relationship and has hidden numerous things from me before, which I only found out from one of our mutual friends. She always goes to see him late at night and the only reason they broke up to begin with was because he was moving away for college which hes now back for the summer, I've also been made aware that A) he wants to start a new relationship with her B) has moved in on her before and kissed her cheek and such (which was supposedly decline, but was also hidden from me)  and C) he hates me and doesn't respect me and also doesn't respect our relationship. A multitude of her friends have attempted to get her away from him as hes become a worse person morally since leaving for college but she doesn't listen, she considers him one of her best friends and spends quite a hit of time with him, which when my concerns are brought up she'll apologize but at the same time get overly defensive.

Sorry in advance for the long post. I need to vent. 

In short, I’m not so happy with my life but I feel like I should. I feel guilty and ashamed. I don’t know if the problem comes from me or if I need to change my life. Let me explain.

I’m \[27M\] an academic. A PhD humanities student. Since the beginning of my studies, I have been first in my cohort. Won all university awards, honors and got great research experiences. I obtained scholarships for excellence which gives me financial autonomy and total independence. The only contracts I accept are those that interest me and advance my career. Everything else, I dedicate it to my own researches. An independence of mind and will that many dream! I worked so hard to get there, but I’m still unhappy and melancholy. I have been anxious for a long time and - it is difficult for me to say it - depressed. 

In the last 10 years, I have been passionate about my study field. I spent most of my time reading, studying and writing. I am rather perfectionist and when I start something, I do it thoroughly. It paid me well. Besides that, I also have a very active social life: good friends, romantics, outings, different activities, sports, etc. I was also involved in my community and did a lot of volunteer work. 

Without being pretentious, I can say that people around me perceive me as a good guy, confident, brilliant, funny, caring, etc. In short, from the outside, I am the one who succeeds everything. But inside, since my childhood, I feel anxious, weak and I constantly doubt me and my perceptions. I don’t understand the meaning of life and can’t handle it.  

Last year, I literally snapped. During a lecture I gave. A panic attack. I had many in my youth, but never like that. My mind went crazy. I could not speak or read my notes anymore. I totally lost control of my mind: my biggest fear. I claimed to have a fever and left ... The biggest trauma of my life.  

The whole following week, I lay in bed smoking cigarettes. I had stopped for a year. I guess it’s what we called a burnout. But I prefer to talk about a collapse. From that moment, I was afraid it would happen again. I started to anticipate meetings, when I should speak, and so on. I guess it's what we call anxiety. I used alcohol to cope with it.  

I had read that you had to overcome anxiety by exposing yourself to uncomfortable situations. So I faced my appointments, I refused to isolate myself at home, etc. This winter, I even gave two lectures that went very well. A big victory.

So I think I overcame my trauma, but not my exhaustion and weariness. After the panic attack, I could not take a break. I had to finish my master's thesis. I did it, and I got the honors. My works will be published as a book, which is very rare for a young researcher like me. 

Since these events, I feel like I'm not completely recovered. But I tried. I took several weeks off. I tried to change my lifestyle, to have fixed hours rather than to work constantly. I tried to drink less often,  with mixed results. I took an office on campus and stopped working at home. Nevertheless, I never found this passion and work capacity I had before.

At this very moment, I come back from a week of vacation. But I still feel exhausted. This month, I have to finish a scientific paper and prepare a lecture and that stresses me. All this led me to wonder if I should not change my life. Have a ""real"" job, the kind you start at 8am and finish at 5pm. Indeed, university work is exhausting and always follows you. There is no rest: you could always be reading more or writing better. Even when you rest, you have this guilt about everything that needs to be done. 

On the other side, I feel it would be stupid to stop while I'm doing so well and after all, I like what I'm doing. I doubt I would appreciate more any other job. And most importantly, I don’t know what else I could do. That's the only thing I can do! I took 10 years to learn, will I really go back? My professors are convinced that I will be a university professor in my turn. I don't even know if I want to, but I don’t even know what else I could do. I am the only one to doubt myself.

I realize that I do not really appreciate life. I am always stressed about what I have to do and I put a lot of pressure on myself. But does the problem come from me or from my life? 

I know I should do sports and therapy. I've been thinking about it for a long time, but I can't find the will to do it ... 

TL;DR : I'm successful but I'm not happy with my life. Do I have to change me or my life?",07May2019,1

76,"I have a friend in Australia that doesn't know what steps to take to leave her fiance, given that she's in what would seem a pretty deep hole. She is in pretty sizable debt because of him, and they have a house together which adds a whole lot more to that debt. They don't have any children, but they do have animals (dogs and cats). She doesn't have any friends that she could move in with nor does she have anyone in mind to take her place in paying off the house (if that's how that works, I'm not sure). The only place she has to move back to is with her grandparents. Now, that wouldn't be so terrible if they didn't hate cats. She's quite depressed and in her words, the animals are what get her up in the morning. If she lost them, she would be torn. The rotten cherry on top is that she's also scared to leave him. He has anger management issues but refuses to seek help about it. She's tried to pitch the idea of couples counseling, but he said he doesn't believe in it and to never ask again. 

I desperately want to see her seek and achieve a better life, but she feels so trapped. I can hardly do anything because we're in different countries. All I can do is try my hardest to help guide her. Does anyone have any thoughts on how to handle this?",07May2019,1
77,"Sorry if format is annoying!

My aunt had a rabbit (this might be important) for about 5 years until it died. Everyone cried about it, especially me who played with the rabbit a lot. My grandma had also mourned over the rabbit. The rabbit's name is snowball. My grandma got used to going to snowball's own little room, since the washer and dryer is downstairs and downstairs was where snowball's room was.

My aunt cried about her rabbit for a while, and it was horrible that she had to find her own pet dead in her room. She later then recovered from it and is now considering getting a cat or kitten, but here's the problem, my grandma won't let her.

Now it's tradition to leave your parent's house after getting married. My aunt is still in her 20's, so for now shes with me grandma. I was confused on why she wouldn't let her. It's not that my grandma hates cats, shes absolutely fine with them. I talked to my mother about it and asked if she would ever let me get a pet. She responded with no, she's scared of having mourn after the pet dies. She's scared of having to deal with the loss of a pet. Most of my family has this mentality of being afraid to cry and mourn over something. I think this might be what my grandma is thinking, maybe she's scared to mourn too.

So how can I help my aunt convince my grandma to let her adopt a cat?",07May2019,1
78,"So I want to go into television production, PR, or advertising. I like filmmaking and can easily see myself in a communications/media field. I’m going to community college now and applied as a transfer to several schools. So far, I’ve gotten into two, and I need to make a decision soon because I don’t know if I’m gonna get in anywhere else. One is a pretty prestigious school in itself, but has a meh film/tv program that’s mostly theory/history based and some tv/screenwriting classes. There’s also no communications/media, PR, advertising aspect. The other is a much less well-known school with a great tv/film program that also encompasses media and communications such as advertising and PR, as well as some internships.

So what do I choose? The more prestigious school would be somewhat cheaper, putting me about $26k in debt after two years, while the other school would put me about $49k in debt after two years.

What’s better, especially for this field? A school with name/prestige and an okay, not well known film/tv program, or without name/prestige and a better tv/comm program?

Now me and my sister get the luxury of eating food that taste terrible and barely fills us. This also goes for 'specialty drinks'. We now can only drink 'ICE' basically watered down juices that is carnonated.

The best part of this is he doesn't have to follow it. So while me and my sister starve he can go during his lunch at break to good food place #29.

87,"So this guy (38m) and I (24f) met in February at a party and immediately got into a romantic fling. He was visiting my State but lived in another and I expressed to him that I am working on healing from past events and so am not able to carry on anything deeper but I was glad to have met him and wished him all the best. He got upset asking why we could not heal with each other, and despite me not having the room to open such space for someone else, I decided to stick around. During the next month, he would make aggressive statements that would be intended to provoke a dramatic reaction from me, he would say stuff that made me feel insecure about my weight and skin colour (I am black but very dark and he is also black but very light skinned and had only dated white, Latin, Asian or mixed women). This is not even something I think about but he would always say stuff like ""you're not skinny and my mom, before she died told me never to bring fat chicks home. She would be shocked"" or ""you're not light skinned, you're so dark. It's crazy that I never paid attention to dark skinned girls who are not skinny and don't have long straight hair... Wow.""



I clearly let him know that his comments made me uncomfortable and after repeating them a few times, stopped. See the thing is, I am African and he is Black American - this is a larger point of focus for him on a daily basis than it is for me. He is pro-black and ""anti-white woman"" only because all of the women who have broken up with him are white. Anyway, I don't focus on that. He ended up leaving a few weeks later and had promised to call me but never did. A week later, I called to check in and after much pushing, he ended up admitting to me that he had slept with someone else during his time in my state and found out he had contracted an STD from her, then was upset with me when I found out I had it too and decided to cut off all communication. It was curable and I'm healthy now thank goodness. 



About a month later, I was wondering about him and asked about his health. He told me he wasn't well spiritually and that he felt lonely. I ended up deciding to open space for only a friendship between us, which he agreed to and then told him we could meet when I visit his state about a week later. We ended up meeting on a Saturday and everything went well, he told me he had grown as an individual but I later found out he was still having careless sex. We had fun that night, sharing a lot of laughter and hugs before we parted ways to go back home. We were on good terms. 



On the next day, he invited me and a bunch of his friends to go help him plant on his land. I'm (my name begins with an N; you'll see in the texts and his begins with an S) the only one who showed up and another girl (AK) who came to bring some weed along with her friend later on. Him and I worked hard on the land and AK went off to drop her friend and came back to help some more. Her and I got along super well, we exchanged contacts and it was going well until S started to show some frustration. After we finished up, I suggested we get food and all three of us went for tacos. When we finished, we walked outside and AK offered to drop me at the train station (S had a bike). I walked over to him, hugged him goodbye and then asked him where he was going to see if we could spend more time together. He then hopped on his bike, scoffed at me saying that I'm funny and sped off. He left me there in confusion and on the verge of tears: http://i.imgur.com/NduT4Z8.jpg 



Here is a link to the screenshots of our interaction right after this. In the texts, you see him calling me controlling multiple times and jumping to conclusions, making assumptions about behaviour that I have changed. Am I wrong to feel disrespected and hurt? Please tell me where I may have gone wrong, maybe there's something else I can change. I only see his behaviour as being quite toxic but don't know if mine is the same?

88,"My dad remarried in September of last year. He has known her for about 5 years or so. I think she is narcissistic and emotionally abusive, but I don't know what to do. She started screaming at me today for sitting down rather than putting dishes away or vacuuming my room. She told me I'm fat and eat too much (I weigh 190 and am 20yo), that I smell like ass, and that I'm worthless. I told her she's narcissistic and emotionally abusive in the heat of the moment, and she flipped out even more asking me how. So I told her how she makes everything about her, that everything is always someone else's fault. (She doesn't work btw) And, she yelled at me cuz I'm not paying them enough (My paychecks are generally around $200 dollars, and I usually only keep $20-$25)(I am also not complacent, I have interviews and am looking for some more income).
So I went to my room and locked the door because I started crying, and she connected to the printer in my room, and printed out a list of narcissistic symptoms. She said that she wanted it, but to look over it first because it definitely wasn't her. (I slid it under the door) She said that I'm the narcissistic one because I like to wear makeup so I think I'm prettier than everyone else.  That I am on leave of absence from college (trying to save money) and so I feel like the world is against me. She said that I am narcissistic because I want to be a French teacher, and I want to go to France someday, all from outside me door, then told me I need to look for another place to live.

89,"I am located in Kansas City, MO. My driver's license was issued by the state of Minnesota. 

I actually live here, in Missouri, so the obvious solution to my most immediate problem,  my lack of identification, would be to go get a Missouri ID card, which is something I neither want to do or am able to do at this time.

 I do not want to do that, because I would rather not surrender a valid driver's license, in exchange for an ID card. I don't know if it is the same everywhere, but all I need to get a license here in Missouri, is a valid out-of-state license. I've considered taking advantage of the fact that I do not have a physical copy of my license to surrender, to just pretend like I don't have one right now, and then when all my stuff is in order, I can initiate the process for my Minnesota license with, with an ID, but I'm not sure I want to be on that side of the law. 

I don't even have a painless path to the ID though. I don't know exactly what happened, but my vital documents are gone, including their copies. My birth certificate and social security card, plus the two copies I kept for each one, in separate places. I have my suspisciouns, but I'm not going to delude myself into thinking I will ever get the truth out of my suspect. To be clear, I don't think they were taken with the intent to commit identity fraud, I know they would have been taken with the intent to make it more difficult for me to leave the place I am living, because I make it possible for myself and one other person to have a place to live, food to eat, and take care of our animals. Without my presence here, my roommate would be homeless, at best. Some things never change though. I need to be making more money now, which means I need to find a second, or a replacement, job, neither of which I can do, without an ID and a social security card, and I know my roommate too well to expect that person to have considered this situation as a possibility. 

I hope whoever reads this, is able to make sense of what I have to say. I did not intend to write as much as I did, but I guess it needed to get out of my head. I'm stressed out and fucking irritated. I really don't even have the money to be replacing these items, but I have to do it because I need them, and I need them fast, so I guess I'm paying for expedited service on everything.

I keep getting waves of college related stress. As in I’ll be fine for a week or month, but then one day, randomly, it will all hit me at once, and then I will be very much Not Fine for a little bit.

I don’t feel pressured to go to college when I don’t want to. My mom made a point to ask me if I wanted to do something else, probably because she could see that I was pretty stressed. I do want to go, I got into a good school that I like, and education is important to me.

Theoretically, I want to go, and am excited.  However, the actual moving away from home and to a new place I’m not so sure about.

I think the main cause is that I feel I am not prepared for the large amount of change that is terrifyingly eminent. I think that I am more unready for the change than the actual college part. (though how separate are those two things?)

So, me and my friends were recently on Omegle acting like we were a 12 year old girl and stuff like that, we did that before and we were able to find a Pedophile on there who was 18+ year old and was asking for pictures and were talking sexual stuff with this ""12 yo little girl"" (unfortunately we weren't able to report that guy to the Authorities because he lost connection or something like that). Now, Yesterday we were able to get in touch with a dude who is 20 yo while we were acting like this 12 yo girl who just found out about Omegle or whatever. This guy started talking about sex with us and stuff like that to the point that he taught  ""us"" how to masturbate and watch porn content online without ""our"" parents knowing. After that, we were able to get this dude's number and we started texting each other; It got even worse than that, to the point that he started sending ""us"" love emojis and stuff like that. Today he found out we were trying to screw him up and block then he blocked us so he wouldn't get screwed and all that. Although, after some crazy research, we were able to find his facebook page, we now know who his family is (including mom, dad, friends, siblings and even grandparents). We just don't really know what to do at this point, we definitely don't want to bring that shit to the authorities (don't get me wrong, I am cool with this dude dying if it's what it takes to punish him, we are just worried he would try to sue us or whatever. We don't really want him to kill himself either as that would bring more attention to us and we would eventually get it trouble). The current idea is: We will contact his dad and show him all the proof we have that his son is a sick Pedophile and we'll trust that he will take care of this whole shit. We really didn't want to go to the trouble of dealing with this guy, but he is a disgusting pig and a sick pedophile who, in our opinion, would be ok with abusing some child or someone like that.

I bought my first car 2 years ago and received it with new license plates and insurance for 6 months. As soon as the insurance ran out in October of 2017 I went to my local DMV and had the license plates destroyed gave the title to my grandpa to get rid of the car - received the check for the plates about a month later. I asked the DMV if I needed to hang onto the receipt they said I did not and threw it out.
I just received a parking ticket violation occurring in a city I don’t live in or drive in(as I’m scared to drive in the city) for October of 2018. The parking ticket keeps going up and I have contacted the city explaining that I haven’t had the plates since October 2017. They need me to prove it - as I had thrown the receipt out I cannot prove it. What should/can I do?
Why can’t they just look in their records to see I destroyed the plates in 2017?? How am I supposed to prove it?
This is part of the email they sent me:
This is in response to your email to the Department of Finance.  Parking violations are not dismissed summarily it is your responsibility to submit evidence proving the vehicle was  not legally registered to you at the time the violation was written.  The evidence would include insurance cancellation, bill of sale or transfer document and plate surrender.

   Long story short, my husband works a very demanding job. It's 3rd shift and a lot of hours... Unfortunately, he's salary, and regardless of the hard work he puts in, we just cannot make ends meet. I'm a stay at home mom and we've had no luck making it possible for us to find child care. So I got an idea to open a shop on Etsy or something of that sort to sell crafts I make.
   I tried just sticking to one product a lot of people seemed to like, but quickly got burnt out on it. I have a knack for making things and LOVE doing it, just not one or two things apparently... 
   So, I changed it up and decided to just do a bunch of random stuff I felt like trying. Anywho, does that seem like a bad idea, having a shop that sells nothing specific? Just a bunch of random crafts? I thought maybe I could do commissions or something similar. Maybe post pictures of things I have done so far and take requests for things people want made?

I (m 25) opted out of my work insurance plan in California during enrollment last year, thinking I could stay on my parents plan until im 26. After talking with my parents, they decided that to save money for them, I should take my employers insurance offering. This is after I opted out.

I spoke to my HR rep about this and she laid out the situation of what I needed to do, gave me paperwork, which I filled out and handed to her. She then gave me a packet with their quote of what they would cover. I was incredibly mistaken and stressed out by work at the time and thought that she handed me my benefits package and that I had been covered by my company at that point.

This was in January , and I lost my parents health insurance on the 31st of January.

I havent needed/thought to check my insurance, and unfortunately today just realized after speaking with my HR department that I never got covered by them, and have been uninsured since then, and after speaking to covered california, cannot be insured until the next open enrollment. 

Learning all of this has made me incredibly upset with myself, as it definitely seems like this was avoidable had I payed more attention to the situation. I feel very stupid and afraid of being uninsured for the next 4-6 months.

110,"As I've gone through the process of applying for loans for college, and getting denied for all of them (i am 18 and have no credit history, and my parents don't have fantastic credit)  I don't know what to do. To give you some numbers, my parents make about 110,000 dollars a year, but because of many debts we live paycheck to paycheck so we cant afford to pay much of anything out of pocket. We are in the process of applying for a PLUS loan, however we have to wait until the 15th of this month to apply, and if we get denied for that, then I don't know what to do. I only got 5,500 from the FAFSA, which is helpful of course, but does not do much in the long run.

111,"I work for this new moving supply company that does business between 2 very large cities. (both around 3mil in total population and they're only an hour apart: this parts important) what we do is recycle gently used cardboard boxes and then we distribute them for a fee to other moving companies and individual buyers. It's honestly really cool because our company alone is able to keep 2.5 million card board boxes out of landfills annually. It feels really cool to feel like I'm actually contributing to a place that prides itself on no landfill contribution.   

Here's where I'm a bit confused though... On a weekly basis we bring in around 52,000 boxes, with absolutely NO COST to us. We receive these boxes from outlet centers, malls, strip centers and such. We tell the stores that instead of sending those boxes to the landfill, we'll take them off your hands for no charge to you. Some of our biggest suppliers include: Nike, Old Navy, Gap, Michael Kors, Under Armor, Sketchers and Journeys. Some of the names of these companies are even clearly labeled on the box including the boxing companies names and locations of distributtion. (We usually don't even take the tags off before resale that indicate this)   I was promoted recently because honestly, the business is growing at a stupid rate, to inventory and distributtion manager for the town in-between the cities. Most of the deliveries come from my location alone and now I'm looking over thes agreements we have with these stores and it's all very straightforward and simple. Just one company disposing of another companies trash, but we're making so much money so fast with these new agreements that it just seems weird that we can have this endless supply for absolutely no cost to us with these huge brand name stores.

113,"Okay I want to start this off with saying, I am not trying to come across as unappreciative of my life and the opportunities I have had. Im genuinely in a bad place and nobody seems to be able to give me solid advice or hear me out without thinking I'm crazy. 

Okay so I'm F(22) just finishing my masters in a very good university, came straight from my bachelor's degree in a very prestigious uni that I dreamt of attending since I was a young kid. I have an amazing boyfriend who is genuinely my best friend and a support supportive family. 

I have suffered from depression and anxiety for the guts of 10 years and even as a kid I had quite severe seperation anxiety for my mom.  I've seen many therepists and been medicated several times after attempting suicide. After I met my current SO that rather changed. I started to feel bubbly in myself and he always gloated about how ""sunny"" my personality is. 

Here's my issue. I have no interest in anything... Like genuinely can't find anything I'm passionate about. I've tried many sports over the years and I drifted from them  eventually even if it took a year or more. I dabble in painting and photography but my motivation is so low that I usually just don't bother. I think I enjoy stretching/yoga and do it sometimes but again I can't see to motivate myself to make it into a routine. This was all well and good mostly as I had university to distract me but now it's all over. 

I'm finishing my final exams this week and I've spent the best part of the last few weeks crying and panicking. I went into my BSc in Environmental Science thinking I was very passionate about my course. Nearing final year I was realising that I didn't want to spend the rest of my life working in a lab so I started a masters in env policy. Again I loved it at the start and now that I'm finishing I feel like I've wasted the past 5 years and incredible amounts of money as I don't want to work in either field anymore. 

I feel like I suffer from a ""what's the point"" attitude, especially with my career. What's the point putting in all this effort to ""save the planet"" if nobody gives a crap and they will just push back iregardless. Anyway, I don't know what to do. I don't know what I want from life and feel like I have no passion or purpose. I feel like I'm drifting in some sort of limbo just staying alive cause I don't necessarily want to die. I'm not suicidal and I really don't recognize this as depression as I've experienced this before. This is more of an ongoing and rather upsetting issue. I tried to talk to my SO and he is kinda stumped, he's really passionate about his hobbies and life and just really can't understand how I have no interest in absolutely anything... I'm not a bland or boring person, I'm super educated and extremely open minded I just don't know what to do with myself. 

Has anyone felt this way? Is there light at the end of the tunnel or do I just have to keep doing things because they are the next logical step? I'm lost and fed up crying, I don't want life to pass me by and I don't want to ruin my life.

Hi  everyone. I went to high-school in France, and last year I failed my  baccalaureate test (huge final exam which decides if you graduate and  with which honors). I failed for multiple reasons, one of which is  because French isn't my native language and I'm not very comfortable  studying and writing in French. Another reason is that I didn't work  very hard.

When  I learned that I flunked my baccalaureate I thought it would be a good  idea to continue my education in another school system, Quebec school  system. It's a two (to 3) year pre-university program and it offers  courses in English, my native language. My mom is Canadian so I could  get citizenship and failing my baccalaureate motivated me to work a lot  harder and I'm fairly certain I would succeed academically. When I  moved, I had trouble getting my citizenship and unfortunately couldn't  get it in time, so I couldn't register for this year even though I got  accepted. I have it now and I'm waiting for September.

Waiting  until the next semester made me think about if this is the right  choice. I'm Turing 19 this year and I'm taking the long route, doing  this and it kind of discourages me thinking that I'll be 22 when I enter  university. I know it's not good to compare but thinking about being so  far behind my peers and friends really demotivates me. What worries me  isn't that I'd be starting uni at 22 or late, 22 is truthfully a decent  time to go to uni, it's that I spent my years of 18-22 catching up on  everyone else and who I should have been if I worked harder in school. I  don't know if that makes sense. I've also been wondering if I should even go continue my education in the first place. I think I'd be happier if I had a decent job and self-sustained myself instead of returning to France or doing the pre-university program in Quebec, but I really doubt anybody would hire me without a high-school diploma. 

I've  thought about moving back to France and try my Bac again as an  independent candidate. That could save me two years of my time. Problem  is I *really* hated high-school there,  only my friends stopped me from dropping out. I wonder if, the moment I  step foot in my old house in France, I'd realize it was a mistake to  move back. I don't know.

117,"This is definitely a first world problem.  But here it goes.  A few years ago I discovered my love for hiking and backpacking, and last year I did tons of solo treks and spent almost every weekend in the mountains.  After my most challenging climb I took a little break, and during this time I met someone.  She is an incredible woman who loves to travel (huge plus) and we have fun doing almost anything together.  But the one thing she has absolutely no interest in, I’ve discovered, is going on long hikes.  The most incredible places I have been or want to go are not appealing to her whatsoever.  That has been a huge bummer to me on occasion, because if I had it my way we would hit the road every few weeks to visit National Parks/Forests.

We have joked about taking vacations where we go somewhere scenic and spend a few days together exploring the city, and then split up for a day or two in the middle so I can get my fill of hiking.  While this sounds great, it is difficult in practice because we usually can’t take enough days off to make it work (my job is very demanding during parts of the year).    Taking our own separate trips isn’t a habit I want to get into (at least not too frequently) because I really value our quality time together.  Sometimes we compromise with camping trips that involve no strenuous hiking, and she does enjoy herself—as long as we don’t have to walk long distances and we have a way to bathe.  I have had fun on these trips, but it also leaves me with this restlessness and FOMO because I know there is so much out there to explore, and we’re just hanging out in one flat area (usually with other people and vehicles nearby).  I feel bad even thinking that, because when I am on vacation with my girlfriend I should just be grateful to spend time with her.  And I am grateful.  But I guess I am also a bit greedy, in that I want the best of both worlds—time with my soul mate AND time to do the thing I love the most.

Maybe someday, as I advance in my career, we will be able to afford to go on more trips and this won’t be as much of an issue.  I just worry that I am wasting my young, healthy years away by not doing more of the physically strenuous trips now.

She constantly blames me for things that she's not doing. She always tells me not to spend my money and that I should get a job, but she won't buy me the things I need (like pencils for the ACT) and she won't let me get a job because she doesn't want to have to drive me places. Not that she ever takes me anywhere. She refuses to teach me how to drive, but gets really angry when I ask for a ride. She constantly makes me take care of my younger siblings (ages 5-13), and at this point my two younger brothers (5 and 7) treat me more like their mom than they treat her. They are always coming to me to ask for/about things that you should go to your mom about. My mom is 37 with a good job and yet we are living in her mother's (my grandma) basement. She is constantly in her room with her boyfriend (she says she is ""taking a break"" because we're all so overwhelming) and she always says she will come out and do this or that, but she usually stays in her room for hours, until eventually I have to make my siblings dinner and put them to bed and make sure that they have a lunch for school in the morning. Just today she took my phone away (for probably the eighth time in the past two weeks) because I wasn't ""participating in the family"" and because I was ""disrespecting her"". Keep in mind, the disrespect she was talking about is I talked to her about all of these things and asked her to stop treating me like that. She always gets mad about my room being messy and my grades being bad (even though I am a nearly straight A student), but she doesn't seem to understand that I *can't* keep my room clean and maintain my grades at the same time as doing all of the other stuff she asks of me/that I have to do because she won't.

After she passed away a family member got angry with him and told him how awful he was for forgetting her birthday. It's something I know haunts him. Things like this happen but I have no way of knowing how he feels or how to help with a pain so great. After a few months he quit the job he had for 5 years. It was a job that was not major and not worth keeping. I left that job myself so I didnt think much of it. I understood. He went through a tremendous loss and I dont blame him for it. He stayed home alot and drank. To the point that it was hard liquor bottles every night. I was stupid and naive and I would drink with him and we would have fun. No real problems. I helped him with food and stuff without a second thought. This went on for about a year. And I didnt really push him. Then I moved back into town and thing between us got very serious. And he eneded up moving in with me and my parents. And I was thrilled. My uncle got him a very high paying job. And I was like wow. Now it's my turn to look for good work so we can save up to buy a home. Just like my parents did. I'm so lucky. I ended up getting a really good paying job myself. And the problems started happening. Our liquor started disappearing. Our beer. And I would find them hidden in the most unusual places and not very well hid either so I was like ok weird but no biggy. Then he became very unreasonable. Constantly saying I was cheating. Lord knows I wouldn't cheat on that man. I'm not that kind of person. I deleted my social media. That didnt work. I cut off contact with my friends. That didnt work. I cut contact with family. That didnt work. To the point where I was just at home alone. And that was still not enough. I pleaded and bed him to believe me. My parents tried talking to him but he would not stop accusing me of cheating. I lived with the man. I answered every text immediately answered every call. He could look through my phone anytime he wanted. I lived with him and still that wasnt enough proof. The fighting and drinking got so bad my parents kicked him out. Our home is never a tense place where people fight. It's always calm and welcoming. He ended up losing his job. He would miss work or go there drunk. He would lie and say he was going to look for work at the union he was at and when I would ask him for proof he would get angry or text me he couldn't talk becuase he was at union or in a meeting. Lies and excuses why he couldn't find work. He would lie here and ther about having a job but no proof. Then he finally did get a job in October of last year and I was so happy and proud. Then things didnt add up. Then my snake got sick and need help giving him antibiotics and he would come to my house and help me and I thought it was so sweet of him to lose sleep because I didnt get home from work at midnight and he be up by 430am for work. He would sleep over and make up excuses like oh no work today, or oh half days today so I dont have to go to work til 12pm or what ever was convenient for him. I started getting fed up and I asked him to show me proof and he was good at dodging me for weeks and weeks.i was in complete denial. Finally we got into a heated arguement in January and he spilled the beans that he had been fired. I suspected him being fired since Novemeber. In March he told me he was getting evicted. And he was so stress out he couldn't find work becuase he need to look for a new home. Again things didnt add up. The house looked the same and no packing was done. I even got him boxes and begged him to let me help him to load off the stress. Well the eviction date came and went. Turns of the landlord decided to let them stay. And the landlord was no longer selling the house. Since then he still hasn't looked for work. I think this was just a lie to buy some time to not work. Two weeks ago He said his friend told him to come work at the airport with him. I was excited and supportive. And he found a way to twist and turn it to being my fault. I constantly find bottles in his home. When he is sober and hasn't drank in a while our relationship is great. But we hit another downfall. I am so hurt. I dont know what to do. Everything I do is wrong in his eyes. I cheat, I lie, I'm a horrible person according to him. I spend every day I dont work with him. I fought friends and my family over him. I lost friends. My family doesn't even invite me to events anymore becuae I dont show up. I isolated myself. I've put down my strong beliefs just to satisfy him. And still nothing is enough. Itll be his birthday in a couple of weeks and I been agonizing over the present. I spent this weekend working non stop on his present. That was a huge mistake. He cursed at me and broke up with me calls me just to tell me things and hang up. Then everything was ok but I had to go to work and then he goes again telling me horrible things. What do I do? Is there anything I can do? I feel so lost.",07May2019,1
140,"Hi everyone,

I've been reading this thread for a while but decided to start giving back and ask a question of my own.

A couple of years ago when I was younger my parents got a divorce because my dad cheated on my mom. My mom moved to another location away from where I grew up and where my dad lived. Now I'm in college and evaluating two internship opportunities for the summer. One is where I grew up and it is a much better opportunity. The other isn't bad either but not as good as the other one, except it's near where my mom lives now. As I get older, I feel like I should take this opportunity to be with my mom for the summer (this internship doesn't relate to a full time job for when I graduate). On the other hand, I feel like it would be much better for my career to take this opportunity back home. The internship back home is a unique opportunity. My mom has been pretty sad even years after and I'm not sure what I should do. I would appreciate any thoughts.",07May2019,1
141,"I (25F) have lived with my brother (22M) for the past year or so. He has pretty bad depression issues for a variety of reasons, but mainly stemming from our dad's fast and painful decline due to cancer. He died about 5 years ago after six months of treatment. My brother lived with him the whole time and was the only one out of our siblings to be present during his death (we anticipated another 3-6 months with him). 

Since then my brother has really had no direction in life. He lives with whichever family member has room for him and often ends up burning bridges by not taking responsibility for himself or just generally being antagonistic when he's in a bad mood. When he moved in with me, it was alot of work being patient with him while still setting boundaries and continually reminding him of them. But I believe he has grown tremendously and sacrifices alot to stay on track with his responsibilities. 

However, I have noticed some bad habits that he's been developing while he has lived with me. I've noticed self harm marks on his arms, although not very recently. He blames it on ""tripping"" or whatever, but they're obviously intentional. I've also increasingly heard him throwing up in the bathroom, especially in the morning/early afternoon. When I ask him about it, he says ""that's what you get for eating Taco Bell"" or ""I just didn't feel well"" but I feel like it's happening way too often for it to be a one off thing. I've told him multiple times that depression is treatable, that I see a therapist and it's nothing to be ashamed of. But he ignores me or says he's fine, although obviously he's not. 

Yesterday I found something that really worries me. Disclaimer, I am very inexperienced with drugs, you could probably catch me in a drug dealers house trying to make frosting out of cocaine. But yesterday when I was cleaning out a kitchen closet, I found a bag that belongs to my brother full of needles (albeit for insulin pens that my brother uses because he's diabetic), a common syringe plunger you can find at a Walgreens, a lighter, q-tips, an enema kit, and something that to me looked a hell of a lot like a crack pipe. It had a cylindrical stem, a hollow glass top with a hole, and the whole thing was filled with some kind of resin. I suppose he could have been using it as a makeshift bowl (he smokes a ton of weed) but with the other contents of the bag, it didn't seem plausible, especially because I know he has two bongs that he uses pretty regularly. 

He still goes to work, he's been paying his bills, he's not shown any erratic behavior, but he keeps VERY late hours and I truthfully don't see him much. I'm not sure I would notice if he were losing control and I'm worried that I'm out of my element here. He's been through more than any one person should go through and he's sad. I just don't know how to help. Does anyone have insight into his behavior? Does it sound like my brother is doing hard drugs? Is it even something that I should address or should I mind my own business and keep my snoopy ass self out of other people's bags? And how do I help someone who refuses to be helped?",07May2019,1

145,"Long story short, I (F17) recently told my best friend (F18) that I have fallen hard for her. I have known for a while that she is bi, and about a week ago I finally came out to her as bi while officially admitting my crush. Not exactly the best timing, as she has been with her boyfriend for over a year and they’re going pretty steady for a high school relationship. 

I can’t even imagine how conflicted she must feel. Last week, she waited an hour for me late at night to get out of work, then we just sat in her car and talked. She told me she needed time to process this. A few days later, we were on the phone and I decided to just ask her if she felt any feelings for me too, and to that she said “I don’t want to hurt you.” So I got the hint.

We’re getting close to graduation, and while her and her boyfriend will be staying close to home during college, I’m going somewhere a few hours away. It’s getting harder for me to imagine staying her best friend and watching her be in love with someone else while I still have such intense feelings for her. She has lost so many people over the years and I know losing me would devastate her, but it’s nearing the point of torture to see her with him, and to just see her in general and know she doesn’t feel the same way. She told me that that doesn’t mean nothing will ever happen between us, but... right now is “not our time.” And I can’t stand it anymore. How can I deal with this?",07May2019,1

153,"I(20,F) moved away from my then toxic home to pursue school in  Ottawa last September. I was extremely homesick, which caused me to physically be sick almost all of the time. My home life got better when I wasn’t around which made me continue to miss it. 

I am also in an extremely mind boggling program, which is environmental studies. We had a warning at the beginning of the year that a lot of people find it hard to wrap their heads around the ongoing climate change. I thought I would be fine but it has only caused me to feel more depressed in the truth of the incoming outcome of the world. 

I had an opportunity to travel to New Zealand to plant trees, which is hard labour but good money(I am a pretty broke person so would have been extremely beneficial) . I was interested in going but my boyfriend (22) said he wasn’t sure how to pursue a relationship and wouldn’t much rather me stay in Ottawa so I decided to stay. Our hometown is almost four hours away and he said he wouldn’t be able to take the distance between here and there.

I've tried dating people my own age but it's fucking awful. 18-21 year old girls in my opinion are super immature or basic and aren't anywhere near on the same level I am when it comes to things like having a career and the like. I'm really sick of people putting me down and saying it's disgusting (Not that I give a shit I'm just kind of making it clear I don't want to hear your stance on it because I don't care).

Plus, I am way more attracted to a sexy older woman then I am an 18 year old girl. So my question is, where would I go to find and approach women of this age range? Tinder sucks because I end up meeting with people who just want my body and want to have sex rather than settle down.",07May2019,1

i’m a very sensitive person, and i don’t know why, but whenever he comes to me with a problem he has, it makes me upset because i feel like every move i make is out of love, and the problem my significant other has circulates back to what i did. 

for example, he told me that he didn’t want me to comment on his pictures. he said it would feel like the relationship that we have will backfire if we were to post it on social media. he didn’t want his former suitors commenting negative thing about our relationship. 

i always try to see things from his point of view, but at the same time, i just can’t relate to why he feels a certain way about certain things because knowing myself i wouldn’t, but i guess that’s the point of putting yourself in someone else’s shoes. 

i simply don’t like talking after confrontation. he can get assertive because he wants me to imitate the conversation, but i get too overwhelmed about the conversation that i just mumble and get tongue-tied and he’s like ‘what? speak up. what were you gonna say? nice effort for once’ etc

162,"I've been working through a therapy program that deals a lot with confronting my inner self to administer healing and comfort trauma, and I've started to realize that I don't feel like a man. When I visualize my ideal self, it's a girl. Ever since that realization, I've noticed times in my daily life where I've been comparing myself to females and desiring to be one; sometimes it could be as simple as my sitting posture (legs together and to the side as if I'm wearing a dress), sometimes it could be about what clothes I want to wear, and sometimes it could even be wanting breasts or a vagina. 

I'm not gay; I have a strong, singular attraction to girls. I don't think I'm transgender because I don't feel *female*, I just feel *feminine*.

I'm kinda scared, too, because society definitely has a stigma against 'gender-confused' (or whatever you want to call it) people. I kinda feel like a freak, and I'm worried about people who'll say things like ""just man up"" and stuff.

I'm stuck in a ditch because I don't want to be trans (I'm never going to get an operation or take pills or anything), but I can't just 'man up' because I don't identify with that.

When I try something, i know that I’m going to be bad at it of course. But I guess my expectations are too high because I get upset that I’m not improving or making any progress. Even though it hasn’t been very long. 

On the other hand, I’ll stick with something for awhile (a few months) but I’ve barely made any progress and yet others have improved. I’m aware that everyone learns things at a different pace but still, I can’t help but feel slow and stupid. This leads to me feeling discouraged and not motivated to improve. I know I shouldn’t compare myself to other but sometimes I can’t help it.

When I get asked, some times I’ll tell people that I’m learning a new thing and they’ll get disappointed when I show them because I suck at it. I’ve also been told by friends and family member that I should quit doing certain things because I’ll never improve or that I’m terrible at it. Having people tell me I should quit is disheartening at times. I know I shouldn’t care about what other people say but I do sometimes. 

I have a lot of self doubt. I don’t know if I’m doing something right even though I’ve triple checked to make sure it’s the right thing. I still worry that I’m doing it wrong. It prevents me from doing the thing because I’m worried I’ll mess up badly. 

I also seem to stop myself from improving even though I’m the one who chose to try out X in the first place. Somehow I think I don’t deserve to learn. I don’t deserve to have the chance to be mediocre at something.

So my relationship with my(27) brother(28) is not the best right now. Basically after doing great at his job some time ago, he decided to quit his job and try finding a new life abroad / soul searching. He was making really good money at his old job and when he told me about his new plans, I was supportive at first.

The problem is he's been couchsurfing ever since he quit, which was almost 2 years ago. It seemed like he got into drugs too because after he lost my support, he absolutely lost his temper and acted like I betrayed him, and threatened to cut me out of his life. I had never seen him like that before.

We stopped talking for a while, but now that he's back we had been trying to clear the air. I want to be supportive of his return, but I'm not sure of what to expect from him yet. Reunions are still a bit tense with him. He has regained some weight, which I take as a good sign.

So now he has applied to my place of work. Not in my department, but we would be seeing each other every day. When the hiring director told me they were going to process his application, I was too shocked to say anything. But the more I think about it, the more I know I don't want to see him everyday. With his work history, can find anywhere, but he chose my place of work??

I’m 20, I live at home with my parents, I’m addicted to nicotine which drains all of my motivation, my only hobbies are video games and writing/recording music that I share with friends. I never get out of the house because all of my friends have gone away for college. 

I wake up late for class almost every day because I don’t enjoy my classes. I mean, I understand classes aren’t necessarily going to be enjoyable. It would be okay with me if I had to muddle through tough classes if I had a reason to, or a goal that these classes would help me reach But I don’t have any reason. I have no goals. 

I’m going to college because everyone else is. I’m going to college to resist real life as much as possible, because I have nothing I’m striving for and no long term goals whatsoever. I don’t know where to look for something that interests me.

I’m in college for fine arts (completely useless, I know). On a whim, I thought game design would be a good route for me. I tried for an internship with a small game company as a concept artist, got rejected immediately. I’ll keep trying at different places but I need a job this summer and I’m out of ideas as to where I could work for a summer that would actually benefit me in the long run, especially when I don’t know where this long run is going. 

The thing that bothers me is that I know I’m levelheaded enough to really work for something, but I don’t know *what* that thing is. I’m really just looking for something that sparks my interest and lights up my eyes with a passion.

I’m very willing to listen to advice from you all. I don’t want to become depressed. I don’t want to stay addicted to nicotine. I don’t want to sit on my lazy ass. I’m afraid of becoming a NEET after college. Personal stories are welcome as well.",07May2019,1

About a week ago he moved a little desk covered in his things in front of the couch, soon after that, I noticed him sleeping on the couch at night.

Me: ""oh--""

Him: (walks into the bathroom and closes the door)

I expected him to answer with some kind of explanation about how he is going to clean up or stop sleeping out there.  I know that doesn't make sense, because I never mentioned those things, but I thought he would understand that those things are not cool.  I have a tendency to not say what is bothering me and instead put up with stuff, which usually works for me because I don't spend a ton of time at home.  I know that this is a bad form of communication, but sometimes it feels better than getting into an argument.  

I want to mention that this guy has had a hard time with other roommates, and seems kind of sad about that.  Also, even though he is awkward in other ways, I've never had any issues with him.  We get along fine.

About 2 months ago I had sex with this girl. She said she had an IUD, so I didn't use a condom. Today she called me telling me that something that is a very small chance happened, and she has an ectopic pregnancy.

This means the fetus is forming outside of the uterus. She told me she went to planned parenthood, and they say an abortion could be difficult and possibly life-threatening.

I Googled it a little bit, and have found out that not aborting the baby can have serious medical consequences down the line. I don't know much about any of this, and don't understand what's happening.

We don't want any of our parents to know about this, and I want to keep my name outta the situation oof. Let me know if you know would be a good, safe, discreet way to deal with this, or just any advice that could help me.

Please help

170,"Hi,

I won't go into detail about how I feel about both, because quite frankly I am just as passionate about economics as I am about communications. I was just wondering what degree does everyone think will be more valuable, or what degree will I have a better shot at getting a good job in? (which will make it easier to find a new job)? I want to eventually immigrate from the US to Canada, so that's another factor I want to consider.

171,"Let me just set the scene here first. I am the first born of my family and a girl at that. Now don't get me wrong  I love my parents very much. On the other hand my parents are both very protective but it shows up more with my dad.  He for some reason doesn't like my boyfriend which I would understand but the thing is he never even gave the guy a chance to see if he would like him in the first place. Hes always looked down on him and even told him to his face before that he's essentially ""not good enough"" for me and needs to get his life together which is just messed up. He's even told me before that he will never treat me the same as my brothers and that if I am not looking out for myself then he's going to for me. (Keep in mind again this is really only a bad side that you are seeing my dad in, he's a good person and I love him very much he just has questionable motives and actions when it comes to my relationship with my SO.) Its gotten to a point where it almost seems like he doesn't want me to be happy with the man I am happy with. My mom has never really said anything to that extreme just bits here and there defending my dad and having her own opinion on my life. I understand that I am an adult and I shouldn't necessarily care all that much what they have to say about this event in my life since I haven't lived with them for a few years now, but I am still very close with them and I know it would hurt them so much if they found out about this through anyone else but me.

173,"Kinda a throwaway account for obvious reasons, but I am a 17 year old female in the United States, and I have this “friend” who I fear cutting out of my life as he has mental illness and has attempted suicide before, coming from an abusive household. As far as he knows, I am one of his only two friends, one of which being his girlfriend that he has a rather toxic relationship with. The history of our “friendship” goes like this: 

We met last year in my biology class. Reading back on it, I should have ditched him long ago as he has been a horrible person and is extremely self centered. But I don’t want to leave him as he has threatened suicide many times and yes, he has actually attempted. He called me his best friend as soon as we met and that was already a red flag, but very very quickly he told me about his home life. His mother would beat him every day and call him worthless, we even called CPS as he had a young sister in the house  but they did nothing, like usual in this country. Now he lives with his grandmother which is a lot more stable, but in our history he always made fun of me in gross sexual ways, like commenting on my body and how my breasts were too small but how he wanted to touch them anyways. And he eventually told me he was in love with me and that he masturbated to the thought of me every night. I told him how disgusted I was with this, and that he should never say something like it again if he ever wanted to talk to me. It worked for a while. Later, I met a guy and I began a relationship with him a month later (boyfriend and I are still together, he’s a great guy) and this bad friend always told me how my boyfriend was stealing me from him. I told him to grow up, but as I was debating leaving this friend for the first time he started telling me then, how he was extremely suicidal and wanted to kill himself. It worried me so I always talked to him whenever he needed. I should not have bitten off more than I could chew, but He’d threaten me with his life if I didn’t call him late at night. He always told me “you’ve changed since you got a bf” and how I was betraying him as a friend and he was overall manipulative. 

He constantly told me how this boyfriend of mine was a bad person and that he’s ruined me, and my horrible friend always said my boyfriend had taken me away from him and that I had always “belonged” to the bad friend. He actually went so far as to threaten my boyfriend saying how he (bf) never cared about me in the first place and that bad friend (himself) could treat me so much better, and told him he was a bad person to his FACE. I understand that we are all young individuals and drama like this is not uncommon, but I had thought nobody had still made actions this stupid. This made my boyfriend upset, but he strongly said “you know nothing about us. If you value her opinion, you would know that I treat her right, and I’m really disappointed you’d say something like this. You need to get your act together”. So eventually one incident made me extremely paranoid as he had set a specific time and date to kill himself, so I called the authorities and he was taken to a ward for a week. After he got out something horrible happened- he started dating my best childhood friend of 8 years. I warned her about the gross sexual stuff, knowing that she identifies as asexual and all, and I told him that she’s ace too since I knew how perverted he is and how he had such a sexual focus for his relationships. But he did not see it as a problem, attention is attention. I warned her about his manipulative tendencies. They still got together, she was afraid to say no. So the guy decided to make sexual advances on her anyways, and it made her extremely anxious and depressed (she had diagnosed mental illness before this) and she kept saying “it’s ok it’s fine”when he’d make advances on her because she was afraid he’d die if she said no. And as the manipulation got worse, she eventually said she didn’t wanna do any of that stuff, and that’s when I found out abt it. So then they go on a date to a theater, and he grabs her ass. She told him she didn’t like that and he said a half assed sorry. Then they went on another date, and he sexually assaulted her. She kept saying no but he said please over and over and that he’s so depressed so she said yes(but forced consent isn’t consent). She’s been scarred ever since.

This guy still thinks he’s my best friend and he is extremely irritating. I have to sit right next to him and his girlfriend in my calculus class, and he has absolutely no social awareness whatsoever. I am pretty sure at some point he was diagnosed with APD, but I am not sure if he made that up for attention or not. Either way, he is extremely rude, whiny, and irritating to me, and acts like I am a mother now. It’s kind of tragic, he never had a proper motherly figure in his life, but I do not want him in mine anymore. But I am worried about cutting him off as he has severe suicidal tendencies. Even his girlfriend has expressed gratitude to me for being there as he would be dead now. I don’t understand how she can tolerate him, but at least she’s somewhat rational. 

Fastforward to today, he bragged to me about how much more medicine he takes than me. I am a sufferer of MDD, and a few other diagnosed anxiety disorders and have been on track with therapy for a year and a half with medication. I have some genetic medical conditions as well, but it feels like he wants to try to push that his life is harder than mine by saying how many horrible health and mental problems he has, and how he takes so many meds. He will do something utterly stupid like snap his fingers, too after he says it, and I have about had it. I never text him anymore, I make up excuses to not hang out with him, and I snap at him in class and lash out because I want him to leave me as a friend so I don’t have to leave him as one. I did not want to report him for sexual assault, as he was 16 at the time and not only would it ruin his life, but I pressured my friend to report him somewhat until I realized It is her decision and that it is extremely unlikely it would be punished anyways, as most sexual assault cases go unreported and rapists are rarely convicted. It’s a sad world we live in. What should I do about this situation? Is there a way I could cut him off without his imminent death or making me feel horrible about my decisions?",07May2019,2
174,"At my school I'm on the golf team in my junior year first year playing, im new so im not that good but I really enjoy it and have been improving a lot lately. Only thing is, the golf team is the most hated team in the school for whatever reason, its known as a ""faggy"" sport I guess.

 Admittedly the team isnt that good we havent won a match yet, much like most sports at my school. But people keep making fun of the fact that golf is just ""shit"" and it is a ""trash"" team. It becomes very discouraging when so many people try to bring the team down. I love the game and still love playing outside of school so that will never change. But I just dont see a point in continuing my career playing for the school when nobody fuckin appreciates it. Even the athletic director barely cares about it.

2nd Cat : Male, Knows how to drink but not eating at all.

3rd Cat : Male, Don't know how to drink or eat.

So we've decided to take care of them for a while why we are looking for someone to adopt them, my question is,

 How will I ensure that they survived with their cases.

About a month ago she said she wanted to date me and I was going to meet her dad to start dating her because that's her family's rules. However she said it might not be the best idea to start something when I'm going to be moving. I figured that made sense and accepted it however I still really wanted to just hang out with her without dating. Weeks go by and we continue talking at work. I ask her to see a movie with me and she agrees. I also tried to cheer her up one time because she was really down and she said that I'm the sweetest guy ever and that she will really miss me. So Saturday I ask her if she wants to hang out with me but she said she doesn't hang out with just guys unless it's in a group, it's her family's rules. Yesterday she explained a bit more by saying that she doesn't want to make it harder for us. It sucks though knowing I can't hang out with just her. How would I go about hanging out in a group.

178,"I just have been offered an opportunity to do Form 6 (pre-college programme) at a local school. It's my old school and definitely not a bad school, but I would like to study somewhere else due to several reasons:

&amp;#x200B;

* The students. They're not bad, but I knew them before and they're... Let's just say that I'm just worried that they might distract me from my studies.
* I'm actually bored of the same environment. Seriously, my elementary and secondary school are neighbors. There's a ditch nearby and I have seen it for 12 damn years.
* My brother did his Form 6 in this school too. He's good at History and Literature. He's also goofy as hell. I'm good at writing 'send nudes' on the board. I'm also good at looking like Norman Bates from The Psycho. I've got a few teachers came at me and saying things like ""You are nothing like your brother"" or ""I expect you to be good as him"". It doesn't hurt, but it's just annoying when they said that all the time. He's also pretty popular, so I got that unwanted clout.
* I've always been that tall kid and I didn't like it. I'm 6'2"" and literally everyone in my school is under 5'10"". I'm also lanky and I stuck out like a sore thumb. I might be bitching, but I don't like being noticed.
* They didn't have a subject that I wanted.
* I've had an easy life here because my parents did everything. I'm 17 and didn't know how to use the ATM machine, board a bus and manage my finances. I need to live alone later in life anyway so I better know how to do stuff.
* I love my parents, but I think it's time for me to at least, learn to live without their help all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

My plan is to study form 6 while living with my grandparents who lives 4 hours away from where I'm at now. To be honest, I'm just there to help them. They're hoarders and they have been trying to get someone to help them with their house. I figured that it's great to be studying in a new place, meeting new people and gaining experiences while helping my grandparents to keep their house from deteriorating. I've found a few schools around my grandparents' area that looks okay, some of them are actually good. If they're not okay with me staying with them, I'll just find a school that provides hostels for students.

&amp;#x200B;

But the problem is, my parents. They disapprove it. I'll bring a nuisance to myself, them and my grandparents, I'll have a hard time with transportation, I'll have to face that 'awkward unknown new student' moments, I'm wasting my opportunity to learn at a good school, I'm hating on my old school and using my old teachers as stepping stones and I'm using a lot of money.

&amp;#x200B;

They gave up (not entirely) recently and let me proceed with what I want to do, but they let out those ""But don't regret..."" lines. I don't want them to hate on me their entire life for doing something that could probably go wrong and cost me later in life but damn, I really don't want to study at my old school.

I’m J and I’m 18– I’m a hopeless romantic. I’ve been on dating apps and gone on dates, but it always seems after a few days or even weeks, the girls stop losing interest and end up ghosting me. 

At first, we’re vibing and laughing, having phone calls and whatnot. Maybe I’m being too available since I answer pretty quickly. Anywho, point being, girls always end up ghosting me. After they ghost me, I’m pretty good at catching signs so I leave them alone instead of being those weird guys and keep on texting them after things were cleared.

Maybe I got to stop texting them while we’re good.

185,"So about a week ago the front bumper of my car got caught on something and fell off most of the way, I just taped it back together before taking it to the aforementioned panel beater for a more permanent fix. Despite explicitly confirming that they would give me a quote before they did any work, I received a call from them this morning informing me it was already to be picked and would cost about $700. 

After I told my mum, she gave them a call (she's incredibly more pushy and demanding then I) and told them that they shouldn't have just fixed it like that with out giving any indication of price, and to put the old bumper on so that we can pick it up from them. She told me it was far too expensive, and I should be looking for a second hand bumper or something (I'd told them I'd just been looking for a cheap way, as I'm currently a student who's planning on travelling abroad in Europe for about 5 months and can't really afford to spend that much).

In short, the advice I'm looking for is:

Is it unreasonable for a panel beater to just install the new parts without providing a quote or anything, and are we justified in just taking the car back and not providing them with business?

Is it likely to be a cheaper task then $700 to replace the front bumper, (ie find a second hand one and ask a car savvy friend to help me fit it out) or is $700 about the price I'll have to pay to get it fixed?

We mostly make stupid jokes, talk about video games, etc. The group only had one girl at the start but she brought another one recently. One of the male friends (let's call him john) apparently knows her and he started talking to her a lot. I wanted to talk to the girl too because she was interested in anime. I tried to approach her but whenever I did, John tried to isolate her from me (like not giving her contact, which I got on my own later, having their own groupchat with some few other friends and such). If you haven't guessed by now, it looks like a triangular relationship. The small interest I had with the girl was long gone because of John's behavior. I didn't know they had a groupchat of their own until yesterday (we talk a lot on Discord). Even before all this bullshit John seemed to not like me based on his behavior around me (ignoring and such). I did start chatting with the girl after I got her contact but after a while she stopped. She recognized my username before I even told her because John already told her what it was. Now, in what situation would John tell the girl about my username privately? Probably because he warned her or gossiped about me before I got in touch with her. I'm 99% sure John doesn't like me. There is the fact that I got pretty close to one of his ""best childhood friends"" and maybe that started the hate train, but that's whatever (I came to the area about two years ago without any friends. Was alone for majority of previous year). Yesterday, one of the friends from John's own groupchat told me to shut the fuck up when I was talking with another guy. The guy who yelled was pretty prone to sudden rage especially when playing video games. Another guy chimed in and told me to be quiet. It was as if I read the situation wrong and that's why i needed to shut up, when I perfectly knew what the situation was like. So I left the groupchat I was in.

Anyways I’ve cried/nearly cried to things you wouldn’t really expect to cry to. I tear up when I see someone else tear up. I’ve teared up in class when we were watching a movie and no one around me was even phased by the scene. No one in my family is like this and literally just an hour ago we were watching a soap o where there was this little girl who was suffering from cancer but she didn’t know it. I had to get up and walk to the bathroom and did whatever it took to just keep my cool and not start crying. 

But when something sad happens to me or if someone gets really mad at me or something that would make a sensitive person get emotional, I can really easily control myself and not be affected by it later on.

Im (15m) Go to the computer side, Last Friday we had a meeting and they were mixing the two completely we already shared electives and Lunch but now were sharing classes to, there getting rid of the computers. NOBODY LIKES THIS, even some of the teachers were complaining about it. So today as a joke I started a petition and got about 12 signatures in first hour that almost everyone except the new kids. I went to 2nd hour and my Teacher Who I hate and all my friends do to for the fact he is a big BUM and just a prick in general he goes up to the front and asks if we have any questions about the change I jokingly say how I have a petition and if that dosent work I will order appellant poop to the school if they dont accept my petition. The FUCKING BUM DIDN'T GET THE JOKE AND CALLED THE OFFICE  I didn't know bcuz I was doing my work and then he tells me to go to the principal I go in and wait for him to be free for 20 min and then he calls me in. He asks how Im doing and has this fake smile on. then he asks about the whole thing and I explain no one likes it and explain how it is helping a lot of people and how direct instruction will slow us down. He then asks how Im doing in my classes. (He thinks hes got me here) I reply Im not doing shit bcuz my teachers are ass wholes and always talk shit ab how Im doing stuff wrong I then explain to him why I dont like them.

I walk in to class and the fat bastard looks at me and smiles I show him my ""Cold look"" and he looks away and stops smiling fast. The rest of the day is normal and then when my mom comes home from work she tells me the Principal called her and said ""Jimi is behind in his classes and his rebelling against the school with a petition because apparently everyone dosent like this I haven't heard anyone else complain about it so hes obviously lying if he dosent like the school this much maybe he should transfer lets meet when every your free and talk about this.""

194,"I took a 200 level psychology course this semester and I was doing very well in comparison to the majority of the class. Here is an outline of my grades and how it was weighted: 

MT1: 87 (15%)
MT2: 97 (15%)
Thesis statement: 83 (15%)
Thesis paper: 80 (25%) 
Final: 89 (30%) 
Bonus for participation in research studies: 100 (5%) added on top of final grade

My professor submitted my final grade as an 87 and I was confused since I thought I did really well on the final so I emailed her. She told me I got a 89 but that she had to curve the grades down since they were too high for the college. I understand this but taking my grade from a 92 to an 87 on my final transcript is kinda bullshit. Especially since she curved the second midterm for the class AND offered an alternative grading scheme which allowed some students who were struggling to weigh one of the midterms more or the final more (one of the options even allowed a 70% final. ALSO she had a 10 mark bonus question on the final.

My main issue is that she offered so many different opportunities for struggling students that ultimately it effected someone like me who was already gunning for a 90 in the class. 

Is there anything I can do? Shouldn’t there be an alternate curve for students who didn’t choose the different grading schemes since they were doing well?",07May2019,2

196,"I graduated college and am currently in grad school, with a full-time job that pays enough. We (my brother and I) are still living with our parents. *Now before you judge, it is culturally appropriate for us (where we are from) to live with our parents until we get married and move out. I also pay them a decent amount of money every month for “rent”. I don’t mind living with my parents at all because we don’t have a big family and all we got is each other.

There are however, cons, to living with your family. My brother is still struggling to graduate from college, and I am not even sure if he wants to. I am totally okay if he doesn’t. The thing is he doesn’t know what he wants with his life, and works a part-time minimum wage job. He doesn’t want a full-time job because he wants to graduate from college already, but at the same time doesn’t want to go to college, if that makes sense.  It’s not even that he has other hobbies. He plays video games and goes on dating apps. He doesn’t want to hang out with friends. He doesn’t want to seek help. 

My parents (and I) are getting quite frustrated with him. We tried sitting down with him to see what he wants to do, whether he wants to work full-time or goes back to school full-time because we are ready to support him however he wants to be supported. But he yells whenever we try to have this type of conversation. I understand that he doesn’t want to hear this from a younger sibling but I literally am unsure of how my brother’s life is going to turn out. He thinks we are just nagging at him and pushing him but there’s never been a time when he did anything on his own. 

This really is my business because I care about him. My family isn’t wealthy, and there’s not a lot of us, so I want him to be smart and hardworking now before it’s too late. 

TLDR: I have an older brother who doesn’t want to work full-time nor go to school full-time. What can I do to as his younger sibling?",07May2019,2

198,"For context I'm (18m) a freshman in college and many of my friends and I smoke weed fairly regularly. Last Friday my friends and I were chilling and smoking as we do after classes on Fridays. One of our other friends who doesn't smoke was also there (20f). 

So after a while all of us are pretty high and I decide to lie down in my bed. After a bit, my sober friend asks if we can cuddle, we've cuddled before but I've made it clear that it's completely platonic. They're still here when my other friends leave so eventually it's just us. 

At this point I'm getting pretty tired and I'm still pretty high. All of a sudden my friend starts getting aggressive with the cuddling and sort of groping me. I'm fairly uncomfortable with it but I still tell them I'm ok with it. Eventually it ends up with started to give me a handjob and asking if I want to have Sex. At this point I've still been saying yes to everything, but I know I don't want to have Sex as I'm not atracted to them in that way. 

I do actually say no to this and say ok and basically leave. After this I've just felt really uncomfortable thinking about it and seeing this friend. Yesterday they actually apologized to me about, they said it didn't really register with them that I wasn't sober. I really felt talking to them about it so I just said that it was OK to get them to leave. Since then I've just been feeling wierd and out of. Don't really know what to do about this, because I don't want to ""snitch"" or anything like that but I just feel really uncomfortable in general and am not sure what to do.",07May2019,2
199,"So kind of some background, my gf used to be friends with a guy from middle school and a little bit of high school, let’s call him frank. So frank and my gf used to be friends until they had some argument and disagreement back then and they had stopped being friends. He had taken screenshots of a lot of her private conversations and posted them on social media before without permission but has taken them down after some confrontation. Now, all three of us go to the same college. 

Recently, my gf and frank had a conversation after a while and owned up to each other’s mistakes and decided to be on good terms. My gf made it clear that she didn’t want them to be close friends are anything but just get rid of any hatred or “beef” that they would have so they can grow up and move on. 

So after that happened, he started to hangout with her a lot more than she wanted him to. Frank started to text her a lot more than usual and my gf really did not want to respond to most of his messages but she sometimes feels forced to because frank seems to always get mad and frustrated if she doesn’t respond. So he gets all possessive of her and the only reason my gf even responds to him ever so slightly is because he is the type to get mad over something like that and post her private conversations on social media again. 

Aside from texting, he knows where my friend group and my gf hangout at college and so he would test my gf asking if she’s free, and even if she says she’s busy, he would show up to the place and sit down and start talking to her even if she didn’t want to. If she doesn’t even respond to that question, he still shows up. And she feels like she can’t do anything about it because she is scared that he will post some of her private convos because of this. 

Lastly, after a few weeks of this happening, we realized that frank only shows up when I go to class and she is hanging out with her friends. And recently, I saw frank coming towards our hangout area and I’m assuming he must’ve seen my gf but after i moved into his field of view, he took an immediate turn and went a complete opposite direction and took peeks at our area while walking away. Idek what’s up with this dude lol

What can me and my gf to do deal with someone like this? I’ve been holding back on confronting him because I do not want to cause conflicts but I want soemthing to be done. At this point, I will do whatever solution works.",07May2019,2
200,"Hi, I feel like I’m growing up too fast, as I graduated college at 17.  I just got a job at a reputable call centre and my working hours is 8.30am-6pm from Monday to Friday + half day work on Saturday. 

Before I got this job, I was solely focusing on losing weight.

So now after 6pm, I‘m pushing myself to work out. In 2 weeks time, I plan to take Muay Thai classes as well, which would be 5 days a week after work hours. So I’ll probably reach home by 8pm. 

I’m currently under training but even though I’m working in a call centre, I feel like it’s difficult, I’m working for the money solely coz I want it but I feel like giving up already after 3 days. 

I feel like now I’ll have no social life coz of work, I won’t be able to focus on my personal dreams which is music and comedy because I’ll be too tired to do anything. I even work on Saturday. 

I think I won’t have time for anyone, not my old parents, old friends, and even relationship that I want badly. 

I feel like I’m growing up way too fast. Most of my classmates are just chilling now or at least their are working lesser hours per day, and they have a social life while I don’t.

201,"Currently, I’m 16 years old and a sophomore at my high school with around a 3.9ish GPA. However, ever since around 8th grade, I’ve been smoking weed at least a couple times a week. Normally with friends, but this past January I had to temporarily move across the country for six months. Because of this, I find myself smoking about everyday, but it’s always after I do my homework to relax and chill out. Since I’ve been doing this throughout highscool, I’ve figured out how to stay productive while still being able to smoke. My question is whether this is really that good for me, as I don’t want to be screwing up my future. Besides the obvious health concerns with weed, I really don’t see what the big deal is about anti weed campaigns and such. I don’t go to school high, as it does make it difficult to focus and learn, and I am not at all what you would classify as a “stoner”. My parents do know that I smoke, and they seem to turn a blind eye because my grades and personality have not hindered in the slightest. I do not consider myself depressed, as I am a relatively happy guy and charismatic. I don’t think I have a dependence, as I don’t necessarily look forward or crave being high, and I can go weeks at a time without smoking. 

Am I setting myself up for a bad future, or is smoking weed a healthy way to relive the stress of high school?",07May2019,10

They're not sad at all about it, they like someone else already and talk to them all the time and always gush about how great and sweet they are to me.

But they talk to so many people. I see them texting all the time with multiple people but I'm getting left on read so often. It seems like they only talk to me at this point because they feel bad for me and feel bad that I have to leave and whatnot but don't actually care to talk to or hang out with me at all.

So my friends and I have been going to the gym every day for about 2 months, and it makes us feel great and we’re getting back into shape. But every time after we’re done at the gym I feel STARVING I don’t know if it’s like me tricking myself into thinking I’m hungry after the gym because I’m like “ooo just worked out now I need energy” or if I’m actually just that hungry lol. But one of the main problems is that I usually eat WAY too much or I eat junk. Like where I usually eat is the dining hall after the gym (on a college campus)  I eat a salad every day first, then whatever other random food is offered that day. I usually eat too much and then I’m like “this workout was for nothing because I just ate all my calories back”. Another thing is I usually take “cheat days” on the weekends which literally is me ordering out for dinner from my favorite place and ordering a shit ton of food and eating all of it in one sitting. It’s so so bad and I know it is but the food is so good I can’t help myself from eating it all in one sitting.

I feel slightly responsible for this, so I had a short word with the boss who was going to promote them (she's the same level as me) but she is adamant they are not deserving of the position. I told her I thought it was silly and that it was only one mistake and unfair to punish them so harshly. 

It's no good though she still refused to give them any more chances.

It really was only something silly, small, and a one time mistake that I think they could recover from easily.

3. The family does not speak about him at all
4. I read some child support documents about how he didn’t pay, and he became an alcoholic who POTENTIALLY fathered several other illegitimate children.
5. He lives in the same state as me and has a family now (I know his name, where he lives, etc.)

I have been thinking about reaching out for a while but I love my family and my stepdad dearly and I don’t want to involve them in this, for various reasons. Before I make any effort TO reach out, I wanted to know if there was any surefire way of finding my child support documents, his past history and potential other children, various facts about him, etc. 

Is there some kind of public database I can use to find this info? 

Furthermore, I’m wondering if you think it would be in poor taste to try to contact him, especially considering I have a supportive and loving family. I am doing this solely for curiosity’s sake and a desire for sort of understanding myself better, but is it a wise idea or a mistake?

She said that it was a lot to think about that’s she needs some time to think about it. I’m going to give her the time but it kills me that I hurt her by leaving her and now I want her back.

223,"So, i'm a senior in high school, and this girl is a junior. About 2 years ago, I met this girl in French class. We'll call her K, to protect identities. Well, K and I really vibed and had great conversations (keep in mind my depression wasn't nearly as bad then as it is now). It was clear that I liked her, and because i'm oblivious, I wasn't sure if she liked me or not, despite it being pretty obvious in hindsight. Regardless, I was too much of a coward to ask her at the time. 


Well, fast forward about a year, she's homeschooled due to personal reasons, but we still talk pretty regularly through text or Snapchat or whatever. Either way, I never really see her irl anymore. This puts a strain on our friendship, but nothing we can't handle, then, around early December of last year, we were both in this Christmas acting/choir thing, and it felt like something had changed. I was more nervous around her, and we couldn't hold up a conversation as well. We talked some, but nothing major. 


Then, Christmas Day, I end up getting drunk with my family, and kinda confess all my feelings to her. She admits she felt the same way, but it was clear she didn't anymore, even if she wouldn't say it. This sent me on an emotional decline, and I had nobody to blame but myself, but mr at the time decided to blame her, and I kinda forced myself to cut her out of my life, which lasted for about 4 days, where I went back on my drunken decision, but things were different again. It really didn't feel like we were friends anymore.


She needed some space for the first few days, but we started talking again a few days after I came grovelling back. Now, she ignores me a lot, and when she does respond, she gives 1 word responses, kinda treats me the same as a random that just started talking to her, and when I saw her at our prom for the first time since December (in which my heart fucking jumped) we exchanged a hi, and that was it.


I know i'm in the wrong here, and I fucked up, but i'm kinda at the same impasse I was already at, where I can't get over my feelings for her, yet I know she doesn't feel the same way. My brain is just waiting for a day that'll never come. My last day is next week, and after that, i'll probably never see her again. Do I do or say anything? Do I cut her out of my life?

Basically my friends and I want to remake/redo prom, the experience we had at our High School senior prom wasn’t the best due to certain things so we’re wanting to relive the experience, but this time with better people and better planning.

Photos and dinner is quite easy to plan. The problem that we’re having is where we’re going to be dancing (venue), how to provide music, and decorations (if applicable)

We also plan on inviting a couple of other people to cover expenses by charging them an entry fee

Help me plan this reddit :)",07May2019,1
225,"The title is a bit self explanatory but a bit more detail. 
I’ve been struggling all semester to (badly) manage my mental health, a full course load and working a part time job 5 days a week. Today we got back results from most of our finals and I flunked out of at least four classes of the six. When I tried talking to my mom about how I plan on making up for the classes she forced me into quitting my job. She knows I’ve been working a lot to pay bills off. I was behind on two credit cards and just got caught up on paying late payments on one and setting up a payment plan on the other. She doesn’t care if I won’t be able to make payments due to not having a job because my “credit is shit anyways there’s no fixing it” 
In addition to being forced to quit, its upsetting to lose this job because it was also the main source of social interaction I had, and also being my escape from home life since living back at home with my parents has been difficult

I’m really unsure of what to do and how to feel. I just want to cry out of fear, frustration, shame, defeat and everything in between.",07May2019,1

She tells me all the time that my fingers and tongue work just fine, but when she's constantly bringing up his size it kinda throws me off.

228,"I started working as a waitress as a busy restaurant. I love the job.  I love being busy, I enjoy the challenge that comes working in a past paced environment. However, instead of being a challenge, at this point it is struggle. Every symptom from adhd I experience interferes with my work performance and learning process. I have limited ability to focus, remember and prioritize, which are the most important skills to be successful at the job. It’s beyond frustrating for me.

229,"Not sure if this is the right place to post this, or if it's too long, but ah well.

What the title says. I've been pursuing art since I was really little, like REALLY little. Parents and friends encouraged it, and for a time, I wanted to become an animator. Around the time high school started, however, I got really defensive and stubborn at the slightest flaw pointed out about how I drew/painted. I realized as high school came to an end that I wasn't as good as an artist as I thought. To quell the SUPER weighted question of what I was going to do with my life, I just started to say graphic design out of reflex. I actually do enjoy graphic design, as it's art for an **objective, ephemeral** purpose, and I'm good at THAT. I'm not the most technologically savvy, nor am I a design wizard, but I like to think that I'm pretty decent with the Adobe suite. With my freshman year coming to an end, though, I still feel kind of ""disconnected"" from it in comparison to my peers. 

Things like graphic design and art are weird, in the sense that the effort **I** put toward them never feels fulfilling. Drawing for fun is still fun, and designing things does make me happy, but I **REALLY** like physical labor. Which is weird, since there's a lot of negative connotations around physical labor (like being a garbage man, or a mechanic or something like that). ""Work hard so one day you won't HAVE to work hard!"" But when I'm actually exerting myself I feel like I've actually **earned** something. Even something as simple as cleaning my room is fun, because there are **visible** results. I also have a LOT of energy, and I've kinda been neglecting that. (College is weird--gym class was mandatory, but at least it kept me active lol)

I thought about specific examples of the whole ""visible progress"" thing that I like about physical labor:

* Working at a thrift store for a while was fun because I had to move boxes, tables, chairs, etc. constantly. It gave me things to do.
* In Boy Scouts, we always did these really long work days at our local recycling center (which I used to hate), and those were always a good time. Plus doing an Eagle Project later on.
* Woodshop was a personal favorite class in HS, since I got to apply my drawing skills through planning things out, and actually had to get up and work to see palpable results.

So yeah. I'm not gonna stop pursuing graphic design any time soon (my parents paid too much for me to just quit) but I want to do something that combines what I learn from designing and physical labor. But I have no idea where I'd even start with that. I'm a scrawny nerdy kid, and not the smartest when it comes to like, mechanics or something. Once again I'm not even sure if this is the right place to ask, or if I can even phrase the question right, but what's a profession that combines hard labor with art, and where would I even start to look for that??? I guess???

230,"Alt account because my friends know my main.

My friend of many years is still doing ""high school"" at 21 years old. He is home schooled but his parents didn't start his school work until he was already supposed to be in 2nd grade, and since then it hasn't been consistent or effective. He is just now starting to get to his junior/senior year equivalent.

I know it bothers him a lot but he believes this is his path. He gets frustrated that he still lives with his family and now that he just lost his job (Gamestop) I'm sure he's wondering how he'll get another one. Without a high school diploma or GED it's virtually impossible to get anything where we live.

Now he doesn't have any money to hang out with his friends, who have all moved out on their own and are working full time. Im worried that he'll miss out on some important life moments, and I'm afraid he's going to blow up one day and realize how fucked his situation has become. Are there any tools or resources I can recommend? How do I gently discuss it with him without it sounding patronizing and adding more stress?",07May2019,2

234,"Hello. I'm here to ask if I'm doing the right thing. Please, any advice is helpful.

My mother, about five years ago, just walked out on my father and I. She has been abusing drugs heavily, gone to jail, had my little step sister taken away from her, and is on probation now.

About six months ago, she needed a place to live. She had been homeless and needed somewhere for her PO to come visit. My rules are that her boyfriend, a thieving tweaker I absolutely hate, is not allowed to live here with us. She agreed and moved in. For a while, she did good.

Then, she relapsed. It was like a switch flipped, and she went crawling back to her scummy boyfriend/baby daddy. My father, husband, and I tried so hard to help her and every time, she just uses us. She bathes, eats everything in my fridge, sleeps for 48 hours, then she's gone again.

I tried talking to her and her PO (once I couldn't get through to her), because I didn't know what else to do. My mother seems to think everyone is out to get her, and that's not the case. We love her and want to help her, but I refuse if she isn't willing to help herself. 

Was I wrong for cutting her off and leaving her things (a few bags and a box) at her tweaker friend's house?",07May2019,1

Last Sunday, he informed me he was no longer paying me, but expected me to let out his dogs 2-3 times a day still. He claims his puppy is no longer a puppy therefore he’s not going to pay me and he can’t afford to pay me anymore. 

I didn’t expect this to go on forever but for him to expect me to let his dogs out at specific times when he wants is unfair to me. I refused to give him my work schedule(I work retail and my schedule is random). He told me I’m super self centered and you’re evicted.

237,"TL;DR 17 year old older sister is immature, is in a toxic relationship with an almost 21 tear old, keeps threatening to move out, stays out until 1am all the time, is disrespectful to mother (and quite frankly me too), makes irrational decisions, out of control in summary 

Hello to anyone willing to give advice. My older sister is 17 turning 18 in October but this last year she’s just been so out of control and irrational. 

It started after she got her license and a car a couple months after she turned 16. My mom got her a car so that she would be able to go to work without conflict to my mom’s car. At her job that she has worked at since she was 15, she is at the second position to manager, (default¿, shift leader, manager, owner) she is shift leader. She transferred from the location by our house to one 7 miles away so that she could get that position. She is very business oriented and has the right idea but for some reason just can’t follow through. She is extremely disrespectful to my mom who works hard to make money for our struggling household yet also has chronic pain. My sister calls her bitch and curses her out behind her back to her friends. Most or even all of her friends seem to be over the age of 18 and she just seems to group herself with older people mostly whom she meets from work. She met a guy who is 20 turning 21 soon at work and they have been off and on dating since late last year. There was one time she came home at 1 in the morning crying and basically had a breakdown on the couch for 2 hours because her boyfriend’s ex showed up and was causing trouble. She and him have broken up too many times to count now and there have been multiple times where people (my mom’s coworker’s son who works with said boyfriend) (my sister herself) have been suspicious that he was cheating with his ex yet she keeps going back. The relationship in my view and many others is clearly toxic and not beneficial to either of them but it stumps me because of the age difference where at her age, she is still going through critical developmental st and is a junior in high school and he, if he was in college, would be either graduated or a senior. She also has her mind set on moving out and keeps threatening/bringing it up every time she gets into a fight with my mom which is quite often. She doesn’t understand all the components that go to living on your own. She can’t even pick up her own clothes, do the dishes, take the trash out, or keep her room and our shared family bathroom tidy for more than a week. We don’t even ask her to do any chores anymore because at this point my mom and I have given up. Just two hours ago at around 11 she said that her boyfriend, who mind you lives 7-8 miles away, was coming to pick her up. My mom and her got into an oddly calm word fight and she ended up leaving. 

If you’re wondering why our mom sounds like she doesn’t discipline it’s because she really doesn’t. Ever since my sister and I were little the most we ever got was a time out or had to write sentences because my mom doesn’t know how to put her foot down. She’s very sensitive and takes things personally when sometimes they just need to be let go especially when coming from a 17 year old. [yes i know that words can hurt but to an extent, she lets nonsense words guide her emotions and actions] {she should be in therapy tbh but gives me her problems instead} (i’m drowning in my extremely disfunctional family)

It is now 1:30 in the morning and it’s not unusual for her to be out this late but neither my mom or I can sleep. We are so drained and have no idea what to do. I didn’t even touch on all of it and I feel like I’ve almost written an essay on my phone. 

So basically my question is: what can we do? I know thats quite broad but I am all out of ideas.",07May2019,1
238,"K so I’ve never done this nor do I expect this post to see the light of day but I think I may as well ask to get it out the way. I’m a 14m, almost done my first year of high school, and I’ve just been having some trouble with this issue for some time now. 

Last year I had this friend (14f) and we were incredibly close. I never had feelings for her at the time though we did at some point engage in some nsfw activities throughout the year. She did like me and I was aware of this yet I let it continue. I essentially used her since she was in a position where she had feelings for me and I didn’t reciprocate. She means so much to me though it’s been around 7 months since we stopped talking. Towards the end of our friendship, we just argued a lot and in hindsight, the things I said and arguments I put forth were so selfish, inconsiderate and just plain mean. There were a lot of problems. I would be so neglectful and just ignore her. I stopped caring and took her for granted. She loved me so much and I just treated her like shit. Eventually she blocked me on social media and I just never had the urge to reach out. I never apologized. 

A few months ago, it started to come back. What I did to her, how sorry I felt, but it was too late. I couldn’t fix it and I lost my best friend. We went to different high schools so I saw her once or twice since leaving elementary school. She has anxiety and what I did to her just pushed it even farther, towards depression. Only recently I tried reaching out. We spoke and talked in person for the first time in a long time. She had gotten over me and I’m glad that she’s happy and that she’s found people that could make her much happier than  I ever could have but I don’t know what to do with myself. She thinks that staying out of each other’s lives is for the best. She isn’t 100% sure that she can be friends with somebody who did that to her and I agree. Thing is, I can’t help but miss her. It’s been a while since we talked. That one day I got to see her again was fantastic. We both had a really great time but it was bittersweet considering we’d never have that again. I just feel like shit. Everyday it pops into my head and I remember what I did to her, how she might’ve felt and how terrible I can be. I’m so afraid that I’ll hurt somebody like this again or I won’t improve. I feel like I’m so manipulative and neglectful and the whole shebang ™. Lately it’s gotten to me. I’ve lost motivation to do so many things because I don’t know what to do with myself. I’ve been sleeping so much lately so school work’s been piling up. I just sit down somewhere on my way home from school and I just think about how terrible I am. I know I’m not inherently bad (as nobody is) but I can’t help but feel that I’m one of the bad ones. I just don’t know what to do.

242,"I’m 15 years old, I’m a straight Christian girl and I have both parents that are alive. But almost 3 years ago me, my mom, and my brother decided to run away from my dad and live with my mother’s family up south. Years ago, My dad, whom I’ll call P, became a drug addict and started to spend a lot of money on things he didn’t need. A monster truck, a new fancy laptop, illegal back medication, weed, tattoos, and all sorts of other things. P would bring awful people in our lives and his drug dealer scared me, he always littered cigarettes on the floor and threatened to hurt us when my dad didn’t feel like paying him. He finally one day decided to go to New York to get a new tattoo and me and my mom decided we had to run away before he came back or we would never have another chance to get away. So we packed our things and ran. (We brought my brother of course) Dad cried a lot at first (when we left) and eventually got help from his dad to get clean. (Background to the background) My mom and him had been married for 15 years and he abused us mentally and my mom physically. I had once thought he killed her and that I was next (a whole other story) it had gotten too much. Now, he is barely in my life. He fights and tattles on me to my mom and I thought I shouldn’t talk to him every time I did I would get super depressed. But lately, he has been bothering my family. My mom got really drunk and fought with my step dad who I’ll call K. K is an incredibly nice guy who’s a lot younger than my mom. (He’s above the age of 25 so its legal don’t worry) Since he’s younger, he tends to go out and golf a lot, socialize, often use social media, and this bothers my mom. She seems to be extremely anxious about what he does or who he talks to. So when they fought I was surprised but not at the same time. K has woken me up twice this week. From slamming doors and screaming at my mom. And he keeps saying she’s in the wrong but I believe he doesnt need to be screaming about it. As I write this almost exactly an hour ago K was screaming and taking her phone away. I eventually tucked my mom to sleep but I’m wondering what I should do next time they fight? I should add that my dad now has a son with a girlfriend who we will call M, who is in California. My mom has a baby girl, call her D, with K here in Florida. K is threatening to take D, their baby, away and leave her. I’ve tried to help my mom off the floor or go to sleep when she is like this (when she is drunk, it has only happened 3 times) and I never know what to say to her. She hurts me when she says she has absolutely no one to talk to and that she is entirely alone. She’s my only and best friend and I just want her to know that if things with her and K don’t work out I love her. But she is an excessive drinker. Not during the day but late at night when we are sleeping. Never by herself just with the family friend S, who is one of K’s best friends. Now, my question being: how can I help my mom? I want to tell her to stop drinking or she might lose D to my stepdad K. K was going to take D away the other day when they fought and ended crying and giving D me. D is my half sister but she is everything to me. My mother (unrelated but also crucial) told me she misses my dad and loves him. I feel so sorry because she has been abused her whole life by her father who was strict until he got remarried and then threw her away, and then got with my real dad P, and got thrown away again, and now she is going through this situation with K. What can I do? What can I say to comfort her? How can I get to her that I am here for her and proud of her no matter what?

247,"Ever since I started getting interested into girls and whatnot I had been a sadist. I jack off to some hardcore BDSM stuff (sometimes worse), and every time I finish I just feel ashamed and it just feels like I've committed a sin. It feels like someone is always watching me and I'm getting paranoid. I grew up in a relatively conservative family, and porn is already frowned upon, so I don't like the thought of them finding out what I watch.

I heard that sometimes being a sadists is caused by being abused at a young age. I was heavily abused by my mother, and I think that is part of the reason why I grew up to be such a sadist, I can't remember a lot of it, but I remember feeling really helpless for most of my childhood. I still have not totally resolved my issues with my mother, she still refuses to take full responsibility and I am still angry at her. She is only willing to admit she went a bit ""far"" in her discipline of me, and refuses to acknowledge the times where I had done literally nothing wrong. My parents are divorced, and most of the abuse came from my mother, although sometimes I am still angry at my father for tolerating her behavior. 

I don't remember ever killing or torturing any animals or insects when I younger or anything. I have female friends that I get along with just fine, I have never thought about raping anyone or doing anything against someone's will. I just don't want this addiction to grow any further that it would be a problem.

I have thought about therapy, but I do not have the money for anything like that (I'm a college student). My parents will most definitely not pay for anything like therapy either, they do not believe in such mental illness. Also I am scared to tell them the reason for my therapy sessions even if they were willing to pay for my therapy. Is there anyway that I can fix this problem by myself? I have tried not using porn by exercising and taking cold showers, but sometimes I just have to jack off, and when I do need to use porn I have trouble getting off to normal porn.

Just two hours ago at around 11 she said that her boyfriend, who mind you lives 7-8 miles away, was coming to pick her up. My mom and her got into an oddly calm word fight and she ended up leaving. 

If you’re wondering why our mom sounds like she doesn’t discipline it’s because she really doesn’t. Ever since my sister and I were little the most we ever got was a time out or had to write sentences because my mom doesn’t know how to put her foot down. She’s very sensitive and takes things personally when sometimes they just need to be let go especially when coming from a 17 year old. [yes i know that words can hurt but to an extent, she lets nonsense words guide her emotions and actions] {she should be in therapy tbh but gives me her problems instead} (i’m drowning in my extremely disfunctional family)

It is now 1:30 in the morning and it’s not unusual for her to be out this late but neither my mom or I can sleep. We are so drained and have no idea what to do. I didn’t even touch on all of it and I feel like I’ve almost written an essay on my phone. And all jokes aside, I feel like she does need help for her behavioral issues that have been a problem since she was a baby.

So basically my question is: what can we do? I know thats quite broad but I am all out of ideas.",07May2019,3
250,"Mandatory ""This is a throwaway account."" I don't want anyone I know finding this.  


Hello. I'm 14, my 15th birthday is fast approaching. I need a place to get these feelings out and get advice. I suck at expressing myself so I'm sorry if these seems cluttered and hard to follow.  
TLDR at bottom, though.  


I have a competitive nature. It's not something that shows, it's more of an internal thing because I don't want people to think I'm a cunt. However, this is completely contradictory to the fact that I also think that I'm just a lame zero who's only decent at are Super Smash Brothers and shit like Yu-Gi-Oh. Me, not wanting to be a lame zero, wants to be the best in these games, specifically Smash Brothers. Now this is where the Inferiority Complex comes in. Smash is fun and all, I like playing with my best friend, Dale (obviously not their real name). He doesn't play nearly as much as I do, but when I lose a few games in a row, without showing it, I get a little depressed, wondering if all the time I put playing this game was worth it. I try not to show it, but a string of self-doubt starts to elongate itself. Another thing that gets to me is that none of my friends really root for me in this game, at least the ones that play. I think I'm overreacting, but I let it get to me for some reason. Doesn't help that I come off as a chill dude who doesn't let anything get to him.  


Next part. Remember Dale and my Inferiority Complex? Yes, because I believe that I'm just a ""Budget Dale."" Essentially, represented by the ""Daniel. The cooler Daniel."" meme. I know people say that everyone is unique, but I can't think of a way Dale just isn't better than me. He's smarter, slightly taller, has more friends, etc. He's my best friend and now we're getting to the part that I feel like a real asshole about. I get jealous when people call his name instead of mine. It happens a lot when we're right next to each other, but then the thought ""Why would they wanna talk to me anyway"" runs through my head. He's practically the center of our group, and I dunno, I wanna feel more? I think I'm just seeking attention. I don't actively seek it. Like I want some, but I don't do anything to ""get me it."" I just kind of stand there and think. It trips me out when people call my name instead of his. Another thing that sparks my jealousy is that I have a crush on this girl (well call her Sam), but I already know he has a crush on her too. hAHaH yEaH. I'm always telling people that there is so much time for love and it doesn't matter now, but here I am being a fucking hypocrite. I'm usually myself to leave her to him, but my heart always skips a beat whenever we text or talk (hAHah YeAh), but she's practically always talking to him. She's pretty much always calling his name and it just kind of makes me jealous. ""Why not me?"" ""I'm here too."" ""Please say my name too."" Shit like that goes through my head and I come home depressed. I hate it. Today my friends hung out (I couldn't go since my mom doesn't let me) and when I texted her to say hi, I got a reply an hour later and apparently she was still hanging out with Dale. It hurts, but I wish it didn't. Later I just kind of bEnT? I've just been feeling really dull. I normally talk to myself, but it feels weird today. Like I'm talking with a whole different person.  


TLDR; I'm jealous of my best friend. I seek attention and have an Inferiority complex. I have a crush on this girl, but my friend has a crush on her too and she seems to pay more and/or seek his attention more than mine. How can I stop being a jealous cunt?",07May2019,1

ok, i’ll start off by saying that yes I know the chances are small, but i’m starting to freak out. I made a throwaway account just for this because I need advice or just reassurance.

For background, i’m (19f) a virgin. However, my boyfriend and I have done other stuff that includes oral, hand stuff, and naked grinding. sorry, TMI.

I just have to explain it fully to give the picture. sorry. 

in the last month, we’ve used condoms when we tried penetration, but due to a chronic illness that causes me to feel more pain than the average person, I kept making him stop before he barely got in because the pain was just truly unbearable.

However, we’ve been naked on top of one another a few times, and yeah, he had pre cum. Not a TON but, I guess just like average??? idk.

I’m two weeks late on my period, and I’m worried I could be pregnant. A few days ago I took a test and it came back negative...but I still haven’t gotten my period so is it possible I’m pregnant? Did I take the test too early?

My problem is I live in a religious household and JUST moved back from college yesterday. There’s almost no way I could get ahold of a test right now. I’m so terrified. 

I’ve been under an extreme amount of stress lately so I’m hoping that’s why my period is late but still i’m panicking.

Again, I know getting pregnant off pre cum is slim, and i’m pretty educated on sex. But i can’t help but panic a bit. How possible is it, despite a negative test? Maybe I took it too early? How can I bring this up to my mom if I find out I really am pregnant? I would likely be kicked out, and I would want an abortion but I know my parents would literally disown me.

Sorry for the rant. I’m losing so much sleep and i’m constantly panicking. Thanks to anyone who can help.",07May2019,0

&amp;#x200B;

Have been having issues with my mental health lately, things haven't been great at home and at work. I have an appointment on Friday to see a psychologist, but I was hoping for advice from people who are in the same boat as me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've always been a sensitive person, I've been working on this since I was a teenager. I'm 25F. When I was younger, if I was told off I would cry. Now as an adult, I don't cry straight away if I'm being told off, the issue is when I'm having serious discussions with my partner about something that is bothering me in our relationship, I start crying. It's not like sobbing or hysterical crying, tears will just stream down my face. My partner bought up in our most recent discussion (after a big fight we had) that he feels he can't have these conversations with me or bring up something he feels isn't going right, because I cry, and he feels like the bad guy. (My mother is exactly the same as me, she's in her early fifties and still struggles with it) I said to him that it's something I'm conscious of and am working on, but he may need to accept that's part of who I am. It wasn't really resolved, he's really bad at communication and expressing his feelings. Refuses to go to counseling or to see a psychologist about his mental health and his alcohol abuse.  

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I can't bring things up because I may cry and he'll get upset or frustrated with me.

272,"I’m in a really bad predicament and I don’t know what to do. It’s a long story so buckle up.

To not get confused in the story, the people are going to be, me, girl 1, girl 2, 

So this story all starts off a couple weeks ago. Girl 1, is a girl that I’ve had a crush on the longest and she recently told me that she was into me again. So we start talking again this whole charade of your typical teen “love” and what not. Things start getting rocky when she was having problems with her ex and she told me that she didn’t want a relationship. Of course crushed, I say ok and try to hold myself together, we’re still friends and we still somewhat flirt but it’s not really the same. 

Then enter this Friday, I’m really emotional and I also tend to overthink things, so this combined with girl 1 basically avoiding me makes me feel like crap and I end up breaking down. Since she’s not to good with confrontations she doesn’t really say anything to me till after school. She asked if I was ok, and then I tell her what I was feeling and the whole situation with her feeling like she was avoiding me. Things get talked  out and I feel like things are better. But oh boy I was wrong. Because this isn’t the first time I’ve felt like this I’ve obviously talked to my other friends for advice, on what to do. (This next part is sort of confusing) She calls me pissed because she heard from other people that I’ve called her manipulative and a gold digger, which I’ve never said and I never would because she’s such an amazing girl. I’m confused and distraught and I don’t know what to do so I tell her I never said that but she still doesn’t believe me which again destroys me.

A few days later, my friend was having a birthday party and guess who was invited. Having previous mental problems clinically proven I feel like crap and everything is just crappy. It’s a beach party and I go because I wanted to at least say happy birthday to my friend. Me and girl 1 have that awkward tension and the party was just awkward for the first half, until she semi-talks to me and asks if I’m going to swim in the ocean. That interaction made me happy and confused and mad and just a lot. But either ways I swam and she left early and the party was great. 

I text her an hour later telling her that I’m sorry, and that I really hopes she believes me that I didn’t say those things, because I never did and it hurts that she actually believed someone else’s word over mine. She didn’t respond but instead just asked if I was going to an outdoor concert later that day, I say yes and get ready and go. Enter girl 2, she was with girl 1 at the concert (it’s a small mosh concert) and she had a pen (weed) and we all start getting up in the air. We go back to my car to smoke some more and I open the back of my car which is spacious and they sit in there while I’m in the middle seat. I tried talking to her about her situation but she still believes the rumors and just shrugs it off. After taking hits for about 20 minutes passing the pen around. Girl 2, goes into the passenger seat and girl 1 goes into the middle with me. Obviously all of us high, we start conversations and then out of no where she lays onto my lap and I just go with it (she only did it for like a minute) and me and girl 2 are talking. Girl 1 sits down and kind scoots forward not being completely on the seat but leaving a little room on the back. Me being high and flirty, lay my head down in the little space available and hug her while laying down, and hand my hand on her thigh. Here’s where the trouble comes in and I feel like such a human piece of garbage for doing. She told me to stop but I didn’t. This goes on for the remainder of like 10 minutes, her telling me to get up which I do but then go back in to the same position. Then Getting up for the last time I realized what I was doing and immediately stopped because it was just wrong. S decides to get out and ride my longboard and I feel like a complete dick for doing that to her and treating her right like garbage. They decide to go back to the  concert and I decide to leave because of realizing what if did. But while they were walking they thought I was going to go with them, but instead I just wanted to go home. Obviously high they don’t want me to because of my safety but I eventually persuade them and leave getting home safe. I don’t text her instead make an edit of our memories, I don’t know why I didn’t tell her anything about the situation but just instead send her a stupid edit. Girl 1 then tells me “(the song I played in the background) is NOT our song nor will it ever be. Now leave me the fuck alone. Don’t text me and don’t call you. You treated me like actual trash last night touching me when I told you to stop multiple times. That’s sexual assault. Don’t ever talk to me again.” And at this point I feel like a even bigger douche and I don’t know what to do.

I told her I was sorry and I truly am. I just want to do the right thing at this point and I don’t know if I should turn myself in to the proper authority and take have myself possibly taken to court but, I would feel good about my decision turning myself in because I know I did the right thing. Or should I just leave her alone and not let the situation get any bigger than it is, but this choice i know I’ll never let myself live it down because of the terrible thing that I did.

278,"Hello there.

I personally have always had quite good mental health, despite various life issues. I have always been unbelievably terrible at talking to people and understanding other people, to the point where I'm genuinely starting to think it's a condition. I also have trouble figuring out boundaries (i.e. ""Are we close enough to bring this up/do this?"") which makes me extremely paranoid in conversations in case I say the wrong thing.

In the last few months, I have made a new friend. We'll call her T. The two of us have become very close very quickly, and I am glad to have her. Recently, she went to the hospital with tonsillitis. While they were there, they found scars that she had from self-harming. She felt close enough to me to confess this to me the week she was discharged.

My other friend (who we'll call J) has always been a strong and kind figure to me and our entire friend group. However, she recently broke down in front of a large group of people, and was very upset for hours afterwards.

My other friend (who we'll call P) has always shown signs of being sad or depressed, and I've always been worried about her.

There's more, but those three are the cases I am most worried about.

Because of my paranoia that I mentioned earlier, I am always to scared to give them so much as a pat on the back, let alone talk to them about it. Because of this, I tend to just watch ither friends comfort them like an idiot. It's obvious that they don't take kindly to me watching them suffer helplessly, but saying why I don't say anything feels so stupid to say out loud that I'm positive they'll think I'm just making up excuses. I genuinely have never had a close friend once in my entire life because of this. It prevents me from having any conversation that isn't just telling jokes and messing around. 

Does anyone have any tips on talking to them and getting closer?",07May2019,2
279,"I need to add some back story here before I get to the point of asking for advice. Bear with me here please, I am so desperate to find a good solution. It's kind of a long back story, I'll do my best to keep it short without missing any major details. 

The short story is I desperately want my social life back that I had while working day shift, but I'm afraid if I ask for it I'll get fired. I'm a supervisor and running the night crew now which is ever expanding so I doubt I'll be able to. 

I worked at this company for 4.5 years, then corporate took over and it got really stressful so I left. I got tired of working in a kitchen with zero benefits so after about 2 years I came back to the corporate machine. I love the work I do there but I didn't like all the drama and people around constantly during the day.

 I came back because they had a night shift position open. The hours were great because I can't stand mornings. At the beginning I was going to br one of maybe 5 people working at night. Perfect. Also I am young, going out to party late at night and not having to worry about getting up early sounded like a great idea. 

Well that was 3 years ago. A lot has happened since then. I am a very hard worker and I care about getting things done right so they quickly pushed me in the direction of having more of a leadership role. I went along with it because I thought it would be a good opportunity, and I stupidly thought it would always be me and those 5 people to work with. They just kept expanding more and more and the next thing you know I am supervising a whole night crew operation through all departments.

It's nice that I have come this far and all that other happy stuff but the hours are truly depressing me. I don't know how much more of this I can take. I don't get any daylight in my life any more. Even on Friday nights, I am working. I miss everything social and fun that is going on all the time. I basically have no social life any more. Even my family has stopped waiting around for me to do stuff. Things like seeing a new movie that just came out, we used to do that stuff as a family but now that I'm working they go without me all the time. I know it sounds petty but it really is the little things. 

I sleep all day until it's time to go to work then I come home and drink until I'm tired. I have nothing better to do. Since I already left this company once and came back, I doubt they would hire me back a 3rd time if I left and decided I am an idiot again, and I really do have it good there, again. Now I am management, so it's not like I can just trade shifts and go back to days. The major reason I have made it this far is because I am one of few willing to work these hours. 

The only ways I have seen supervisors leave this job is retirement, or getting fired. There is no leaving on good terms unless you are retiring. I absolutely can't afford to get fired right now. My father passed away about a month ago, my family is stretched very thin financially. I have always been independent in that aspect. Own my own home, car paid off, blah, blah, blah. If I were to lose this job I do not have any savings to help me, and my mother is in no shape to bail anyone out given she just had to bury her husband. 

The few people I have told about this keep saying I only feel this way because I am grieving the loss of my father. Of course I am still grieving that loss. Of course I am acting and thinking differently than I did before he passed. I am trying to just suck it up. But really I can't stop thinking how great it would be to have the evenings off again. 

What do I do? Do I stay where I am? Do I ask to be demoted knowing it really means I'm asking to get fired? To I find a new job and pray that I don't regret leaving for the 2nd time? Please please please someone give me your perspective. I keep changing my mind, and if I don't stop I'm afraid I'll blow up one day and do something stupid and just walk out with no warning.",07May2019,2

288,"It's been about a year and a half since I got my Bachelor's in game development. I'd been hearing less-than-great things about the industry while I was in college, but I figured I'd be fine if I got in quickly and tried to get around. Then family stuff came up and I haven't been able to really do much job-hunting until about now. But industry news just keeps making it sound more difficult to enter and grimmer to survive, as I've been falling out of practice and out of the loop. Getting a job is seeming more intimidating by the day.

My family did a lot to help with getting my degree and wouldn't be particularly pleased if I didn't get at least something somewhat related to it and that won't be able to scale up to something at least somewhat ""proper"" (so stuff like retail or public services are double-out, but I can probably justify most anything in tech if I can actually get it), but I don't think my programming skills can keep up with those people who live and breathe code that are all over other tech fields, and there's no way my art skills can keep up with that massive, ancient industry. I've always been a jack-of-all-trades type, which I knew would hurt with the job search, but struggled to really address.

I've got basically no connections, only average skills and training, and a dwindling bank account on one hand and family expectations on the other. Unlike many people in the industry I wouldn't even call myself ""passionate"" for games, only that it seemed like the best way to use my broad-yet-shallow skillset.

I can just try applying and applying all over if it's my only option, but if anyone else has some advice for someone who's moderately lost in life, I'd be glad to hear it!",07May2019,1

Without getting into detail, honestly my relationship feels like it is nearing its end. But to answer your question, I think it would be best to be platonic friends or at least have that mindset and have that be the expectation. 

She said: 
Thanks for being upfront. 
So it seems there is no chance of us seeing each other romantically in the future? I feel like we have a connection but I’m assuming that it’s tainted to the point of no return, correct?

I think using extremes like no chance or 100% is not productive. However, You just described it perfectly, and I am pretty torn and not sure how to interpret this situation. A situation that I've thought about a lot and still don't know what to make of it. That's just the truth.

I always think of you and your family because y’all made me who I am. Sorry that I reach out and pester so often. I just am trying to grow and better myself and find myself reflecting on lessons y’all taught me to do so. So naturally I end up thinking of y’all. Have a good night.

292,"My coworker and I were good work friends I would say. We would laugh and make jokes and if we had issues about work we’d normally be on the same page.

Recently they got promoted, but not a serious promotion, they are more like a shift lead which didn’t exist before.

Since then they kind of seem like they are on a power trip, bragging about how they know stuff but then says they “can’t disclose any more info.” Sitting at the day time manager’s desk (we work overnight). And they always complained about coworkers, but now it seems like it’s an “I know more than them why are won’t they stop talking,” kind of complaining... as if they are above us. They won’t even correct the person just kind of talk behind their back.

They no longer talk to me or my other coworker during the shift, at first I thought this was maybe to be a professional boss but then they text me more complaints about coworkers while we are working, but again won’t talk in person.

Lately I have started to notice the way they are talking to me, feeling comfortable announcing that I sometimes interrupt people or am too loud, things that I know I need to work on but before it was never an issue with them. Even criticism has gone from helpful to kind of aggressive and leaves me more irritated than wanting to be better at my job. They overall aren’t friendly unless THEY want to complain about something. 

A little background on this person is they always use to tell me how no one likes them and they don’t know why because they are so genuine and how they’ve been bullied almost their whole life. However I’ve noticed some of these conversations almost seem like “poor me” and they never offer to fix the situation. Everyone else is the problem but not them... 

This is my first job out of college and I’m unsure if this is how people are in the working world. Were they only my friend because I was on the same shift with them and was nice? Are they power hungry? Is it worth bringing up or is this just a more superior vs lower employee relationship? 

I think I may be a little sensitive but it’s really put me in a funk at work and I don’t even feel comfortable talking in front of them now without them bitching about me, someone else or inflating their own ego/views.

297,"content warning: emotional turmoil

Heyo.

So, to preface I am seeing both a social worker and a psych.

But, for about 2 to 3 years I refused to see either and it messed me about. I have some emotional issues - mainly mood swings, depressive spells, etc etc - stemming from genetics and trauma. 

It’s taken me a bit to finish school, I’m a year behind, but I’ve done a lot of really interesting stuff - DJed, worked at a gallery, wrote some undergraduate research, etc. it’s taken a lot for me to get remotely where I am. I had a bad experience my freshman year that messed me about, was terrified of people for a while, fought an eating disorder and was suicidal this time last year. I had a breakdown in the fall, which is whatever, but my grades suffered.

Im finishing up with a business/IT related degree, and I have a lot of seemingly unconnected skills and networks - I can program pretty well, I have marketing/design experience from floral design, I have a good knack for business. I really dislike my degree, and don’t think I’ll want to work in the field, nor think it’s remotely healthy for me.

Right now I’m sort of at a weird point, where I managed to talk my way into a project/grant sort of thing for an intermédia public works project. I have a lot to finish here, but it’s super tempting to leave this small city, take online classes, and start over. I feel reminded of breaking down all the time.

My options are:
- move home for a bit, commute into campus. Save money and work hard and unfuck my head, but risk isolating myself. Once I graduate, move out to NY or LA. I have an uncle who is a well known editor in film, so i’ll be okay.
- stay here, pay rent, maybe move into a better living situation. *Be* in the city, try to enjoy my youth and relatively newfound ability to be around other people without freaking out. Unfuck my head here. And then move to LA or NY.
- Just go. Just leave and start working for my uncle, and do freelance/online classes to pay rent.

I feel really trapped with a degree I didn’t want but got to please my parents, projects I did to prove myself to others, and just a general fear that there are people doing stuff I have the aptitude for - but they don’t have ptsd. I just turned 23 and am so anxious to just start a career in something creative.

Regardless, I know that as long as I get my mental health in order I’ll be okay, but honestly I terrify myself at the moment. I want to be sure to build the right foundation without regressing. I’m losing credibility but everything is so overwhelming. It’s super tough trying to make a career shift while balancing health while processing while creating while working while taking full credits.

Sorry if this is long winded and confusing, it’s emotional to write. I know it should probably be in r/depression, but I want differing opinions on this, as mental health is a factor but totally not the main point.

298,"Hey, so I am currently living at my parents house, doing first year university. I am studying a Bachelor of Science, chem major. I genuinely enjoy my subjects, and wish to continue them, but I find it INCREDIBLY easy to get distracted. Like, ADHD levels. If there is a computer anywhere near me, its almost guaranteed that I am scrolling through facebook, reddit or youtube.

The problem here is that nearly all of my university work involves online quizzes to be completed, work that has to be submitted online etc.

I have a shitload of stuff (some related to uni, some not) to do atm, and every day I spend all my time endlessly scrolling through these fucking websites. I have had plenty of jobs before, and have no issue in a work environment where I don't have access to these things, but I really do want to continue my course, I genuinely enjoy doing work in labs, but I can't motivate myself to actually do all the stuff I need to do. 

I have tried taking every stimulant you can imagine to make myself focus, none of them work, all they do is make me enjoy social media and music even more. I have tried rewarding myself when I do manage to finish something (rare), and I have no idea how to end the cycle of endlessly scrolling through social media.

High school was fucking easy, I did fuck all and got above average marks, now I can't focus on what I actually want to do. 

To give you an idea of how addicting reddit/fb are for me, I have a few doses worth of meth sitting on my shelf. I have no desire to use it, and I'll save them for some party in the future. At any point right now, I KNOW I could get more enjoyment doing other things, but I will still end up scrolling all fucking day. 

Do you have any suggestions on how to help?

302,"I'm a 22 year old male on a study abroad. I'm living with random roommates in an apartment filled with other abroad students. This has put me in a great position to get out of my bubble is see different things. Especially through my roommates. 

There's two girls who I am great friends with. Let's call one Amy and the other Marg. Marg is Amy's bitch in every way shape and form. The girl will do anything to make Amy happy with her. She's insanely dependent on her as she has not made any friends whatsoever (besides her roommates) and has not spent more than 5 hours apart from Amy. She needs Amy and her friends to go out, needs her to go travel with, etc etc. Amy can be quite mean to Marg at times. One day, after Amy and Marg got into a fight, Marg and I went for a walk for roughly 2 hours. She vented about how bad of a friend Amy has been. But 3 months later that convo has gone nowhere. Marg also has a partner for a project that did roughly half the work Marg did, and Marg could not stand up to her. I've obviously attempted to help her at times.

I could go on a lot with some stories, but to sum it up: Amy is a bitch. I've thought of her as a toxic person multiple times. Yet, whatever she says, it comes from her. She will stick up for herself and I've even seen her stick up for Marg. As much as we differ and have fought, we have a MUCH better relationship.

Marg, however, has really fallen out of the light with me. I've never gotten into an argument with her. She is a nice girl. If I ever let her borrow something of mine, I know I could trust her to give it back in the same quality if not better. She is the better human being. However, I've gotten sick of her. The things she says aren't genuine--she will like the same things Amy likes and will do what Amy likes. I think at the beginning I felt pity for her because she can't stand up to adversity, however now I tend to blame her for the problems she brings upon herself because she can't stand up for herself. This is something new to me. In the past I would've always felt bad for her, but now I don't. And this has happened with other people who I've gotten close to on this trip.

304,"So here at school you're allowed to leave the grounds during lunch or study break if you're senior year. I do this quite a lot and go to the nearby park. Fairly safe area. At lunch there's usually a few people sitting around, during study it's emptier but you still get a handful of people walking through.

On Monday I was sitting near the road when I noticed a guy who was standing on the other side of the road, near the crossing, for quite a while. Sometimes he'd awkwardly walk around in a circle, came off as being a bit uneasy. I figured he was just waiting for someone, but I find this kind of thing annoying so I moved so he was at least out of my field of vision. Right as I was about to sit down again (a few seconds later) I saw he'd started walking away.

Funny thing is a similar thing happened maybe a month or two ago. Same park, was sitting in a nearby place, facing the carpark when I saw a truck parked in front of me, not far away, with a guy sitting in it. Having someone potentially be staring right at me was a bit unnerving so I moved away. I thought he was probably just minding his own business - again, might just be waiting for something. Weird thing is not long after I moved away the truck left too.

I hope I don't come off as crazy here. I am aware that somebody hanging around a park and then leaving is by itself no big deal. I'm not even sure if it's the same guy or not - couldn't make out his face. But it seems like a strange coincidence to have somebody not doing much, maybe watching you, maybe not, leave not long after you leave - twice in a row. For some context I'm 17, female, and only go there on my own. So I'm probably a liability. I've heard the warnings and don't really feel like having something bad happen to me. Sucks I can't go to the park and enjoy myself without getting paranoid over my safety though.

Should I be worried? What are the chances this is innocuous or malicious behaviour? Is there anything you think I should do? Not sure if I plan on going to the park for a while, not when it's emptier anyway. I was thinking that if he turns up again I'll get a picture (and carefully leave - the school's just across the road and there's a public pool on the other side of the park) so if something does happen I at least have a bit of evidence. Hell maybe the cops know him.

Or is this paranoid ramblings of a madwoman? I've been told I might have anxiety before. Maybe that's making me jump to the worst possible conclusions idk.

For the past 13 years every night as I try to sleep I have fantasized about various things and created stories in my head as I have found that it helps my mind drift off and it is quite fun to do. However, in recent years I've found myself doing this in my free time throughout the day as well. I didn't think this was much of an issue until I noticed I was preferring to do it over other things such as reading or playing games. I used to very much enjoy the stories brought through these mediums but I've been finding them less interesting because the stories in my head can be exactly what I want. 

Is this an unhealthy thing to be doing or should I not worry about it?",07May2019,1
309,"Okay, before I start, quick context: 

\- On my mom's side of the family the majority of females have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 1 and males with ADHD or mood disorder 

\- Dad's side of the family consists of several cousins on the autism spectrum

So that has always made me worried and slightly paranoid that something might be up with my mental health.

But ever since I was 13 (I am currently 23 ) I started noticing things that made me really unhappy with myself: 

\- I can't seem to focus during conversations with people. People will say something that might trigger a memory of mine or a chain of thoughts, and without really noticing I'll start drifting off and stop listening, only to realize at some point the other person is still talking, and quickly refocusing. Or I'll feel this incredibly strong urge to interrupt them because I have a thought about what they said, and while I am fighting that impulse I also can't focus on what they are saying. Most people don't notice (thank god), but many people very close to me often complain that they feel I don't listen. I feel really bad about this, because I really, really try, and it makes conversations very energy consuming. And I started hating myself for it: why can't I just show interest in other people?

\- I have a million thoughts at once, so it happens quite often that I will start one activity, get distracted by A, start interacting with A, get distracted by B, start interacting with B, etc. By the time I notice what I am doing, I have often also forgotten what I had wanted to do in the first place. However, this never happens when it is something I really enjoy doing: oftentimes I forget to eat/drink in those instances, or go to the bathroom, and it could keep me occupied all day. And for some reason I cannot finish long projects or assignments properly. 

\- When I start working on a project that I know will require serious cognitive effort and time, my brain tries to actively fall asleep. It's the weirdest sensation, because I have to actively fight my brain and body to prevent it from going into sleep mode: my eyeballs want to roll backwards, I can't keep my eyes open, I yawn constantly, and it becomes difficult to stay conscious (or so it feels, I have never actually lost consciousness over this). 

\- For the life of me I CAN NOT multitask. I mean, I can chew and walk at the same time, or breathe and type this at the same time, but I can't listen to music and read at the same time, for example. 

There is more, but I don't feel like going into that. 

Anywho, I thought at some point I might be overworked/overstressed (university was a lot of pressure, my sister has been seriously ill for many years, my horse died in an accident, I got into a traffic accident that resulted into a hospital stay, etc), and seeing as I have always been a restless/anxious/stressy person, I went to seek help from a professional. 

I didn't want to be diagnosed, I just wanted some peace and quiet inside my head. I've never had that, and some days it's just too much noise up there. I am less anxious now, I have less nightmares, but my concentration problems and spontaneous 'sleepy brain' experiences are only becoming more frequent. 

And then today it hit me: could I maybe have ADHD?

I don't want to self-diagnose, but I also don't want to go to the doctor out of fear that it is just my paranoia about my family history. But I just want to be able to give the people I love the attention they deserve and be able to handle the more complex aspects of my studies without having to fight my own body.

Flash forward, it's been 4 years and I still haven't told my parents about them. My mother had an inkling and even talked to me when it was just with her and was like ""tell me the truth, you're dating \[SO\] aren't you?"" and I panicked and made a terrible terrible terrible TERRIBLE decision and lied and now she believes that I am single and that I am not and never did date my \[SO\].

But it's been so long and I don't know how to approach my parents and tell them about this. I'm really scared of breaking my mother's heart for lying to her for so long. 

For context, I'm asian and they're white. My family members aren't strangers to interracial couples. All of my married cousins married white people. The reason I've held off on telling them for so long is because they ingrained in me that I was not to have a SO until college (the usual parent thing to say) because I need to focus on my studies.

I have friends from last year who are now in high school and they are all grown up but I don’t know if they would hang out with me still since we haven’t really talked so much or saw each other.

I need advise on making good friends who have the same interests as me and how I can work on being myself and showing what I love? How can I look approachable and friendly so people can talk to me more?,07May2019,1
313,"Let me set this straight to not concern anyone; there’s no violence involved ever and noone is in physical or mental danger 

I’m a teenager (14) and atm I’m the only child who lives at home. I live with both of my parents, both mid-fifties in Europe. My dad works full-time and is generally really helpful and realistic. Not without his flaws, but noone is ever perfect, so no complaints about that

My mom however, is extremely annoying. She gets pissed very fast. Instead of telling me to not do something, she waits until I did it and then yells at me. Instead of telling me to stop voicechatting, she stores up anger and when I ask her what’s wrong she yells. Whenever I’m playing games past 8 PM she gets mad because “the living room is not only yours, I want to be able to sit in silence”. She gets mad when I don’t immediately throw my socks in the bin for to-be-washed clothes. She says she “almost breaks her neck” whenever I leave something on the stairs. You get the idea. She gets mad fast and often

It never ever comes to the point of abuse and violence and it probably never will, but I am so done with her. Whenever she does a favor for me she acts like it’s the biggest kind of kindness but when she wants me to do something she talks in “we”, as in her and my dad. My dad just goes along because he just doesn’t want trouble. My mom is the biggest negativity factor in the family and I don’t know what to do

I can’t confront her, that’ll make her mad. I can’t always prevent her getting mad, it’s basically impossible. I don’t know what’s a good outcome here. Talking to her, in any tone, won’t do shit. 

How do I fix this",07May2019,1
314,"We are in complete shock. What turned into a quick run to the bank together turned into our worst nightmare. I had forgotten my wallet and needed to run back into the house. I asked my husband to go, my back had been hurting.

My husband walked in on it. I can't imagine having to live with that image ingrained into my head. My 5 year old bent over a bed. Startled, he jumps up from behind her and accidentally tucks his shirt into his shorts.

My husband asked repeqtedly""what's going on here?"" Only to hear ""I don't know"" each time. ""You're 16, what donyou mean you don't know?"" Finally he asked our daughter and she told him ""he's putting his weiner on me""

""NO I WASN'T "" he hollers as he hides his erection with the cat ""now you're gonna abandon me just like my mom did"" and he storms towards the back 

So husband walks back out to the car to come get me ""I need your help, I just caught son raping daughter""

My eyes opened wide in complete horror. ""What?! Are you serious?""

He tells me what he just witnessed and what he just exclaimed. 

""If he's done this before we need to call the police.""

Police are called and I keep our other 3 kids by the car. Ages 3m, 5f and 9m. Police question my stepson, and he tells them that I made it all up, because I like making trouble. Police officer tells him, I know your mom, yeah, she is in a trouble maker, but tell me about what your dad saw""

""I don't know. She asked me to do it to her.""

The officer then bluffs ""Son, I know you've seen the TV shows with police, we are gonna be able to figure out exactly what happened and we will be able to tell you exactly what happened, so you might as well come clean, it'll be less trouble for you.""

He then admits to doing it to her at least 10 times since January. And to his sisters that live with his mom, and that his mother knew about those.

That night I had to take my 5 year old to have a rape kit performed on her, and I had to demand they take swabs of her vaginal area. They almost didn't. We waited 4 hours in the hospital. They take her panties, her pants, her socks, her shirt.

The long drive home is deafening silent so my husband and I think out loud to soften the dead air.

Suddenly all the little odd things start to make sense. 

7 months ago his 14yo sister's best friend called him after he moved in here, calling him a rapist. So we called his mom (let's call her crazy crystal) to ask what the hell is wrong with his sister? Why is she telling her friends shit like that?

""I'll handle it, she's going through something, she's lying.""

My head spins as we drive. All the memories that make sense. The time my daughter said to me ""mom, he put his weiner on me."" And we did nothing because it happened around the time of the rape accusations, and we saw how badly it had affected my stepson to be accused like that. Besides, what did that even mean? Did he brush up against her? Did he think it was funny and put his weiner on her shoulder or something? At the time I couldn't get a better answer out of her.  I then start drowning in my own guilt, and my husband tell me of a time she said that to him too, when we were mushroom hunting in the woods. My God... we were there in the  woods for so long. It eats away at my soul. The drive home was making me nauseated. How could he do all of this? We always suspected that douchebag Derek had done something to Chase when he was smaller. Is that what happened? Did Douchebag Derek rape my stepson? He's been known to get high on meth and suck dudes off in the forest (oh how tickled pink I was when I was given that bit of information years ago).

We get home and I text my 14yo stepdaughter. ""Oh honey I am so sorry, I never knew!"" 

We chat, she tells me about all the other times. Inask deeper questions about when her mom knew. She ended up telling a school counselor in the middle of 8th grade. She's almost finished her freshman year in high school. The school counselor made her call in her parents, and she calls her junkie stepdad in, instead. They go home and sit down when their mother gets home, and our stepson denies everything.

He's been living with us for 8 months. Since August.

That... fucking...bitch... knew. And she didnt warn us when she sent him to live with us. She served my 5 year old daughter up on a silver platter.

The school failed to call CPS or the police after my stepdaughter confided in her counselor. Crazy Crystal swept it under the rug and just ""made sure not to leave him alone with the girls."" 

This is not possible. She works 3rd shift, and her cheating trailerpark trash husband (we'll call him douchebag Derek) leaves for days on end, stealing scrap metal for his meth habits. He JUST got off on felony theft charges, and she just skated by with child endangerment charges for punching her stepson in the face. Great human beings these people. We wont divulge their lengthy list of legal battles and run ins with CPS.

Suddenly my text message conversations with my stepdaughter are changing. Her story changes to protect her mother. Step daughter tells my sister-in-law ""I can't be taken away from my mother. I'll kill myself. She's my everything. My rock. The reason I live""

The next day at 11am I take my 5 year old to have her body examined by a Child Advocacy Center, and to have all 3 children interviewed. In these interviews theyndrob another bombshell: my 9 year old had also been inappropriate with my 5 year old. The degree is significantly lower, but she had still been a victim by her 2 older brothers. This news breaks the rest of my heart.

They ask us if there is anywhere my 9yo can stay. ""Do you have family or a friend that can take him?""

""No, we have no family willing or available to help."" I then have to voluntarily sign over custody of my first born child, and place him in a shelter while this is being investigated. I am completely broken. He has autism and I worry about the care that he will recieve. 

My mind had an IED explode inside, and my eyes have long ago cried off any hint of makeup I had put on that morning. We drive another long, hour drive home.

Crazy Crystal is now texting my husband that this is all his fault, because ""all the incidents happened under your roof smart one"" showing absolutely no sympathy for my 5 year old daughter. ""Grade A parenting there smart guy"" she tells him, exposing her heartless soul.

I've never wanted to murder someone before, but now I know the feeling. These nights at work in the lab are long and quiet. Leaving open space in my head for all to my thoughts to breakdance. I forget to breathe sometimes.

I refuse to let this destroy me so I gave myself a new focus.

I've gotten a lawyer, I am going after Crazy Crystal, Douchebag Derek, The school for failure to report, and CPS if they knew and didn't act.

Will my sanity ever return? How do I calm my blood lust? Will the anger ever subside? 

I can now say I understand why some victims say ""the punishment will never be enough.""

I want to grind that bitch into a pulp.",07May2019,4059
315,"Hey, I need some advice about this.

It may sound stupid. Currently I work at a gas station nearby. This gas station is very small with only a few customers. They can't even pay me (or the other workers there) minimum wage. I was in desperate need of money so I started working there in this work grew on me, also the co-workers. Everyone is really nice and the work times a very flexible what's awesome because I go to uni and come whenever I have time. But I also pity my boss. Last week he told me that if the gas price is too low, that he pays on top. So he wouldn't make any profit. Let's say at this point: my Boss is a car dealer with workshop (? is that really the word for where they repair cars? ), that's what he earns money with primarily. My brother works in the workshop (he's educated at this job so he gets paid union rate (?) and I really don't want to make anything that could thread his job there). 

&amp;#x200B;

So yesterday I got a call from antoher nearby gas station that they still got my data and would hire me and I should come today. So today I went there and I got asked what my other job is and, well, told the truth. The woman instantly said that I won't be able to work there if I work at the nearby gas station, too. But thinking about the money I said I would quit at my other job. I'll get a call later this week from them.

&amp;#x200B;

So what should I do? I really like the smaller gas station but I really need to earn some additional money, since I'm 25 and have to pay insurance myself. I thought about primarily working at the bigger gas station but not completely quitting at the smaller one. But I'm afraid that if I would do that, somebody would notice.",07May2019,1

320,"Hi everyone!

As the title says, I often get upset and sad about small things, for example today has been ruined for me because I got a ticket on public trasport.  I had a monthly student pass (bought it 2 days ago) but I forgot the card in my other jacket. I had proof I bought it, but still I had to pay. It wasn't a lot of money, more like what I'm getting paid for 4 hours of work at my part time job. I'm just upset at myself because I forgot it and I repeat obsessively in my head scenarios in which I don't get the ticket: like taking the other jacket, getting late and catching another bus etc.

Another example would be when I do something embarrasing. Even if it's just a small thing, I keep repeating it in my head and getting sad about it.

I know It's normal to feel sad for a bit, but I hate that I'm letting these small inconveniences ruin my day. How can I prevent this? I'm trying really hard to not think about it but eventually I remember again. Has anyone been through this?

322,"This got pretty long, so TL;DR included at the end.

I’ve spent nearly 6 months, with other friends, helping my friend “K” get out of a shitty relationship. 
K’s partner was verbally abusive, manipulative, and acted superior to everyone. 
They made no effort to try and make friends (and was actively arrogant and dismissive of others), but would complain that no one like him.
He did things like call K as slut and a bitch because a photo of her got more likes than a photo of the two of them.
She left him, and we all helped her move out. During this time she talked about how awful he made her feel, how she felt isolated and belittled by him.
 
But, 6 months later, she got back with him, and they swiftly moved back in together.
She says he’s changed, but he is exactly the same from the outside.
In addition, she’s now had weeks where she’s dropped of the radar totally, not responding to texts or messages.
She says it’s “old injuries” or a mental health flare up, but I know her partner has slated her before about needing any mental health support.
She’s gone though 3 jobs since getting back with him, and she had only just started to get her life on track.
 
My question is, what do I do?
And how do I stay in touch with her, when I can pretty much never see her without him?
 
He makes me so uncomfortable and mad, even if she wasn’t dating him, but I don’t want to not see her because he’s around.
She knows I still think he’s an abusive dick, but I feel like she had rose-tinted glasses on.
Do I remind her that I really feel uncomfortable with him around, and suggest we do solo meets?
 
**TL;DR** my friend returned to her abusive ex after months of all her friend helping her out of the relationship, and her agreeing he was a dick.
They’re back together, and he makes me uncomfortable, but they pretty much only socialise together now.

323,"Since a few years I have been having a bit of social anxiety. For example: in near future there is a public party where almost all of my grade is going to, because we finshed our last school exams. In order to get a table tough, you had to sort of preorder as a big group, but back then I didn‘t, so technically I am not invited? Thing is that I could still practically go there since it‘s not a place to sit really, but more to stand; let‘s just say it‘s a whole mess there and everyone will be drunk. I want to go with them, but I don‘t know if I will get accepted since I didn‘t preorder like the others. I have fear that they just say: „well you didn‘t preorder, you can go home“ or smth like that, but I know that this scenario is very unlikely and it will probably be like this: „oh what you came?! Nice!“. But still the only possibility of being rejected just bothers me so much...
But the more serious problem about this is another thing. Today I found out that my older brother is coincidently going to the same public party on the same date (the party is open for like 1 month, so he had a 1/30 chance of going at the same date I wanted to go...). And since my family only knows me as a guy that never leaves his apartment and rarely smiles, I don‘t want them or my brother see me drunk there, idk why really but that scene what just be a bit irritating...And my brother spits out everything just to make me suffer or something like that (although he may be doing that unconsciously) like „oh mom did you see him drunk?! Omg I didnt know you were such a guy!“
So now I am at a dilemma:
Either I go and my brother sees me drunk  and make a big deal out of and as well as risking to be rejected; or I don‘t go and my brother and family (especially my brother) will say 24/7: „won‘t you go party since you finished school? Omg you‘re such a loner“ and somehow make me feel so bad that I want to die inside.

329,"(First post so I hope I'm doing this right). 

&amp;#x200B;

Where to start with this? 

&amp;#x200B;

So I have a lot of online friends. None of them know any personal information about me because my mum has always warned me that people online can lie and be evil ect ect. Recently, I've started gaming with some of them. We do use Voice chat, but it's all very pleasent and I still haven't revealed any personal info. My mum found out though and flipped. She thinks it could be extremely dangerous for me to be talking to people I don't know. 

Bearing in mind that she also doesn't like my school friends that she hasn't met (and tried to suggest i stop talking to them) I have been ignoring her advice. I also called her out on that one, but she denied doing it, saying that she couldn't remember that at all and that I must have misheard her or something. Which is possible I suppose... 

But recently I've been having to lie to her just to be able to commuincate with my online friends. She always wants to know who I'm talking to, and if I tell her it's an online friend she flips out. I'm starting to think maybe I just need to stop talking to my online friends and gaming? Although I don't like this idea at all, I don't really know what else to do. I don't want to be alone, but I also hate lying to my mum. 

The thing with my rl friends is that they are all really busy with exams or uni, so I don't see them much. If I stop talking to my online friends I'll have hardly anyone to talk to again. And that's not fun. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice? Any tips on how to convince my mum that not everyone is child predator? Or should I just cut communications with all my online friends alltogether? I am open to the fact that my mum may be right (she usually is), but if so, i need to hear it from someone else. I feel kinda stupid posting this here, since my mum says that you can't trust what anyone says on the interent... but i don't know who else to ask. I don't want to bother my rl friends. Thanks in advance for replying.",07May2019,3
332,"I have a question that hopefully someone can legitimately help me understand. I just want to know if im being an unrealistic friend or if what im asking is in fact legit and shouldn't be a problem. All answers are welcome because i really am torn right now on what to do and am wondering if i ended our friendship for no reason because of my idea of what a friend should be and want to be. 

So i got a friend who i literally do everything for. He needs me, im there. He calls me, i answer. He txts, i reply, needs my help, i help. Im out and see something that he might like or want or will help him out, i get it. I always make time to be there for him and make him a priority whenever he hits me up for anything. But im lucky to even get 2 or 3 things outta everything i just wrote. 

He doesnt txt or call to ask how im doing or to see if i wanna hangout. He ONLY txt/calls whenever he wants to come over and smoke. In fact, thats the only time i ever even see him is just when he hits me up to smoke. He will come over for no more than an hour (usually less) smoke and leave and wont hear or see him again until he wants to come back over to smoke. 

I have talked to him about this on multiple occasions and tild him i feel like u only come here and use me to smoke and each time he says he understands and sees where im coming from and has even admitted to me that the main reason he comes over to chill is to smoke. I have invited him to hangout and do things on multiple occasions and he never accepts. I have tried making plans with him in advance so he can have time to prepare and he agreed but literally everytime it came time to come thru with those plans he literally txt me the day of saying he couldn't do it. Hell, one time we made plans that we agreed on just for him not to even tell me he wasnt gna go thru with it. 

For some reason i just had a gut feeling because thats what he literally always does so i asked the day before ""we still are on for tomorrow right?"" and he literally told me ""i cant tomorrow because i got plans with a friend to watch game of thrones and hangout with my boyfriend"" even tho we made our plans a week prior and he didnt have nothing goin on and said he was down for that day. Then chose to say ""but we can still hangout tomorrow, just not tomorrow night. But we can hangout all day!"" even tho i thought that was bullshit cuz we had plans to do shit like go shooting and stuff like tht i was still willing to except the fact tht i was still going to atleast be able to hangout with him without smoking being involved. But do u think that happened?? Naahhh.. so we went from habing plans to have a bro night, to him changing it to a bro day, but when that day came he messaged me at like 9:00am and literally said *copied and pasted original txt* ""Yea, but boyfriend is only gone till about 1:00, so I can only hang this morning. Was thinking about going ahead and heading your way"" and i say ""Actually u dont even have to worry about it bro... i dont want u feelin obligated to have to come ova lol I mean clearly we arent even gonna actually hangout or do anything &amp; chill &amp; have good time since u gotta be back by 1. This is just gna be one of those cme ova and smoke til u gotta go type of deals that im honestly tired of lol U said ur tired &amp; could sleep more, so if u want, just rest up so u have full energy when boyfriend gets back &amp; do whatever yall plan on doin lol. U dont have to make cmin here a priority or make it seem like u HAVE to cme here"" and he says ""That's why I said up to you. I am free this morning and want to chill for a couple hours. But if you don't want me to come over let me know and I will just head home"" 

Well, he came over and do u think we went shooting or did any plans we had planned??? Nope.... but we sure did smoke! At this point i kinda knew that he really didnt have any interests in actually seeing me or wanting to hanging out cuz literally everytime he wants to chill, its just to smoke for 20min then dips out. 

So that was the last time i even attempted to make plans with him. He has never once attempted to make plans to chill or have a friend day with me. I on the other hand had attempted like 4 times to make plans and each time he agreed and then bailed oit at last minute. I have invited him to go bowling, rock climbing, swimming, indoor skydiving, pool, darts among some other things and he has yet to take me up on any offer. 

He also goes out out and does a bunch of things and i literally dont get invited to anything that he does. I feel like im constantly trying and trying and trying to actually be friends with somebody who literally could cares less if we actually see eachother. He says he cant make time cuz hes constantly busy with work and cuz his bf doesnt like me. But his bf didnt like me way before our 2nd go around at being friends.

Iv known this dude for a lil oba 2yrs and we hit it off fast. We both jabe good personality amd bonded over movies and drinking and actually going out and having good time. His bf was always jelous of our friendship and always thought we had something going on with eachother, which we didnt. I considered him my nrother and would have died for him. Thats how much i loved this guy amd valued our friendship. Well, one day we got in a fight and it got physical and we didn't speak for bout 8 or 9 months.

We recently reconnected and since then, its literally been what i described above, where i feel like im the only one trying to get this friendship back to where it was and he literally doesnt wanna see me or hangout unless smoking is involved. He says his boyfriend is constantly starting fights with him cuz he dont want him seeing or talking to me again and he said that he is constantly fighting for our friendship with his bf.

When he told me that i literally thought ""what friendship are you trying to have?"" Cuz the only time you make time to see me, is to smoke. The only time you wanna hangout, is to smoke. I can honestly say that since we started back up our ""friendship"" maybeeee 4months ago or so. We literally haven't chilled or did anything that has been outside my front room. I can suggest things, tell him my comcerns of him only cming here to use me, tell him i want to actually hangout and do shit that friends do and not just only see him for 20min a day but never tries to change a thing and is happy the way things are now amd says ""well what do u call whatbwe are doing now? We are hanging out arent we?"" No, we arent hanginout, tf??? Ur gettin a high then dippin. Theres a big difference amd6 he acts like hes not understanding even tho i kno he does cuz he TOLD me tht the main reason he does come thru is to smoke he understood and tht he would be a better friend amd think of the friendship more but still till this day its the same thing.

So i bring it up to him again today and we get in a argument and i tell him that im kind of over this friendship and dont want nothing to do with him anymore cuz im not gna put all my time, effort and energy into a one sided friendship that doesnt benifit me. In which he said ""i agree cuz im tired of being called a bad friend"" and ""i literally dont care if we are friends"" and then said that i have an unrealistic idea of what a friend should be or consist of. Now, il be the first to admit that i am a bitch when it comes to friends and if ur my friend then u ARE my friend! Ima have ur back till the end, be there for u till the end, think of you, be ur ride or die, buy u gifts on hollidays, wish you happy hollidays, txt/call to see how ur doing cuz i legit care.

I guess that is the question i need help with! Is my idea of what a friend should be really that hard? Am i really asking to much? Is it really a far fetched idea for a friend to invite you places? To have a bro day? To go swimmin? To go out to eat? To make plans with you? To want to hangout? To not ditch u everytime you make plans? To accept am offer from a friend whose imviting him somewhere? To go to the movies? To txt/call wlcuz they literally wamt to know how im doing instead of only hittin u up with a agenda in mind? To ask you to hangout without an agenda?

Literally the only time he wants to ""hangout"" is ONLY if its cming over and sitting in my front room to smoke OR if his boyfriend is gone amd then he hits me up just to ""hangout"" and it just turms into a longer smoking session and whenever i call him out on it he wants to get defensive and say tht he cant just go and hangout like tht whenever he want and that his bf dont like me and that he dont have time to chill cuz of his boyfriend who he has been with for almost 9yrs.

I understand if they were newly together with that whole honeymoon stage going on but 9yrs!? 9yrs and you're telling me that you cant have your own friends? 9yrs and he has the right to tell you who you can and cant hang with? 9yrs and you can't think for yourself? 9yrs and you cant take just, idk, 1 damn day every few weeks to kick it? I mean its not like im tryimg to see him everyday of the fuckin week. Im just tryin to hangout atleast ONCE and do shit that i thought friends do. 

Never have i heard of or seen something like tht lol everyone i know who has been in relationships for, hell, 4 or 5yrs always make the time to see friends. They have friend days. They dont need their nf or gf with them with everythung they do chz they know friends are important too amd honestly, this is my opinion lol but i think thays unhealthy if u literally got to ne attavjed to there side comstantly and cant go out and do ur own thing with a friend without them throwing a fit demanding you to come home. Like are you saying that people in relationships cant have friends? Iv been in plenty relationships and always found the time to be there and make time for the ones who always made time amd was there for me.

Idk his reasoning just isnt making sense. He says he dont habe time to chill, he says his bf dont like me, he says hes always busy... but yet he says he cant do all these things for those reasons but he still always manages to come over once or twice everyday to smoke??? His bf knows he comes over here btw. Not to smoke but he knows he comes over here. So he can be willing to fight with his boyfriend &amp; risk getting caught coming here to smoke but hes not willing to fight with bf or risk getting caught to hangout or be a friend to someone who is literally there for them?

At the end of the day i dont blame the bf because if a friend really wanted you in their lives then they would make the time, put in effort, make u a priority amd wouldnt let someones hatred of someone get in the way of being your friend and seeing you. He literally doesnt do any of those things FOR ME! But he damn sure makes the time, puts in effort, makes a priority and doesnt let his bfs anger get in the way of coming here to get lifted lol.

I know this has been alot to read but agter all that, is my idea of a friend making time to hangout with me and tht be the only reason and not because of what i got? Was I wrong for calling him out and overreacting. Should i not have ended the friendship. Did the friendship seem one sided to you? Did it seem like i was being used? Did it seem like he was putting in any effort? Or am i being an emotional bitch who just expect the same level of frienship i put out to them and am gna end up hurt by friends everytime? Like j said i really value friendship and take it to heart. But i dnt think me just wanting to go out and so something is really asking to much. 

Please help me yall. As you can see im really hurt and saddened by this. It really is hard to lose somebody who u think of as a brother just to realize that they dont value you or your friendship the same you do theirs and acts like they could care less if you're friends. Hell i posted on fb the other day talkin bout shitty friends and i cut them off and dont want them in my life and he saw it but still always came by to smoke and didnt even mention or aknowledge what i posted. Just came thru like nothing was wrong, smoked and left.",07May2019,1
333,"I am just an average 25 years old guy, i have some nice beard, a little beer belly, so much scars and a few tattoos on my body, i read alot, i ride my bike alot and i am(was) drinking alot. I am quite confident about myself, not trying to be the 10/10 kind white knight when around girls, instead i try to act more profound, sincere and normal. I am always trusted and loved by my female friends. Well, i am pretty sure you are saying what the fuck is wrong with this, nothing bad so far. That is not true my friends. I often, i mean everytime find myself in the strangest situations. I cant say no to a girl, cant stop myself kissing back if a girl kind enough to kiss me. Cant stop caring and listening if a girl is trusting me and opening her vulnerable spots while talking about her problems. I end up being a fucktoy and a few days later future husband candidate for almost every single females i met, when they see me with other girls, they lose their shit and hate me for it, which i never promise anyone to be their property and only theirs for the rest of my life. I really love and care about every lady i’ve met and i wanted them to find some relief from the cruel world, never meant any harm but ended up harming them. I really know how hard to be a women in this era, but being an average guy is no simple task either. I am lately trying to stay away from females in my real life and seeking some unreal and completely stranger female attention in order to talk while i get my shit together. Which does not goes well, nobody texting or returning my pms, i guess no female charm for me in the online world. I really need some advice. It is also killing my relationships with my co-workers and my male friends. I am falling apart and i fucked up big time.

334,"My (F22) mum (47) was diagnosed with cancer two years ago. We managed, everything turned out as good as possible, and now she’s completely clean. 
However, she’s been thinking that it’s a punishment for the sins she’s committed. Months ago she told me that it was because when she was 21 she had an abortion. It was very heavy on her, because she didn’t want to, but had no choice. 
Last night, she broke down crying and told me she was kidnapped and raped back when she was 19. It was violent and she counted her lucky stars and basically managed to outsmart them. It was people she knew (friends of my dad). She went on to details, and I can see she’s heavily traumatised. No one knows aside from my dad and his cousin, who wasted no time to find her abusers and made them pay. 
But I didn’t know what to say, I was just shocked about her thought process and the guilt she feels. She thinks it was her fault. I think that’s ridiculous, but I just froze and couldn’t say much, except to reassure her that she did the best thing at the time to survive. She doesn’t think so. I told her to talk to a professional, but she refuses to. 
Now I understand why I was raised the way I was, and will be lying if I said it didn’t affect me as I didn’t have a normal childhood. 
I want to help her but I just don’t know how. She genuinely believes that God is punishing her for her kidnaping and rape, by giving her cancer. She finished the conversation by saying that she’s so sorry for telling me all of that, and that she’s not a good mother, and that she’d like it if we don’t mention it anymore. I was just paralyzed.

336,"So I (German) am living with my wife (Lithuanian) and 2 young kids (1 and 5) in Denmark. I am working and providing for the family. Good salary, incl. nice retirement bonus and interesting work which can give me a lot for future.
My wife finalized her studies and isn't able to get a job in her profession - ending up with depression. She stays at home with young baby and our bigger son is attending pre-school.

Her solution for this situation is to go back to her home country and start her career there - we shall all move. I could find a job there. Bummer though is, salary will be only 33% of my current one, forget about any retirement plan and in my CV this will also be not as shiny as the current one.
For sure, living costs over there are cheaper but more like 75%, not 33%.
HOW can I go for this? It hurts my brain, it looks silly, it's retarded. I anyway never would like to stay there forever, so it may be temporary, few years, until she has some more experience. But we wouldn't save a penny in that time, would be bound to that country due to low overall budget. Not sure if I could land a nice job later and have the same opportunities in life.

342,"I just want to preface by saying I know this is a really really trivial post especially compared to some of the others I've seen here, sorry )-:

I started my first year of uni a few months ago and I'm now about three weeks from the end of semester. I chose 'ancient greece' as an elective, and the very first Wednesday of semester happened to be my
first tutorial for that class. I saw this particular guy walk in and I COULD NOT take my eyes off of him because i just knew i recognised him (i eventually figured out that I didn't know him and he just looks exactly like Eric Osborne but with a beard). Anyway, he sort of stuck in my mind the next few weeks, but I ended up dropping ancient greece and picking up a new subject. I was a bit bummed that I wouldn't get to see him anymore (I'm doing a law course and he's doing a history course I'm assuming, so all we had in common was my elective), but come first tutorial of the new subject and there he is again!!!!! I'm pretty sure he recognised me, either that or he just thought I was weird for staring at him like a bug after seeing him again. 


I'm quite shy face to face so I was never able to talk to him or sit near him even. I get the feeling that he was trying to sit on the same table as me but I always freaked out and sat at the furthest possible table because I didn't want to annoy him. We always make regular eye contact during class but that's honestly pretty much it. Last week we finally managed to sit at the same table and he spoke up in class for the first time!!! He is so soft spoken and gentle and shy it makes my heart hurt!!! He seems so sweet, he always talks to people but only when they start a conversation but he always smiles and keeps the conversation going when they do. And as we were leaving class, I was waiting for my friend to pack up while I held the door open, and he was coming out so I had to push myself closer to the door so he could leave and he said ""thank you"" and then I said ""that's ok"" but I might have been too quiet so maybe he didn't hear me, but I was really happy regardless because that was the first time we talked. 

The semester will be ending very soon, we only have the tutorial once a week for an hour and it's usually pretty full on so we never get the chance to talk amongst ourselves. I highly doubt I'll be able to talk to him during. He sits by himself during the lectures which makes me think he might just enjoy his own company. It makes me not want to approach him just in case it will annoy him or make him uncomfortable and he is so sweet I would never want to do that. 

I'm a little bummed out because we only have about three tutorials left and that's not enough time to get to know him, I most likely won't see him at all next semester due to our courses being different, and he never hangs around between classes for lunch or just at the library like I usually do. 


I wouldn't say i'm unattractive, but I do feel like he's WAY out of my league. He is genuinely the prettiest guy I've ever seen. I've never asked a guy out so I wouldn't even know how to go about it. I was easily able to find his facebook (we have no mutual friends on facebook though, but we do have a mutual friend irl) so I worry that it will be weird to add him out of nowhere. 

I finally worked up the courage to sit next to and talk to him today, WOKE UP AT 5:30 A.M TO GET READY, only for him to be absent. it's as if he could sense me trying to make a move and stayed home to avoid it.

thoughts pls )-: thank you

346,"Greetings dear readers,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm now 27 years old but something came back to my mind. I did not visit my mother in the Hospital after she got a little hearth attack. 

To explain the circumstances: I was living with my mother and her new husband. Additionally my uncle and my aunt came to our home and lived there for 3 weeks.

It were the last free weeks that i had before i did my abitur (highest high school graduation in germany). I was extremely stressed and i couldnt sleep in my bed because my uncle and my aunt lived there so i had to sleep on the couch for weeks.

Back to the heart attack

My Mother got it in the middle of the night. Her new husband drove her to the hospital and she got treated. She got is because of stress , (she also has  a manic depression discorder :/ ) 

i did not go to visit her , i just fled to a friend to sleep there. I felt extremly tired and stressed because of our whole living situation.

I dont know if thats the case but i think seeing my mother weak  maybe was too much to me.

I just dont know.

&amp;#x200B;

I only remeber my uncle got extremely mad for me not visiting her and after 1 or 2 days i drove to the hospital and talked to her. Gladly she is now more healthy.

347,"*Hi!  I’m 20 years old and I’m ready to leave home.  No really, my family is insane and abusive.   It’s also a very conservative area &amp; that doesn’t mesh well with who I am.*

First and foremost I don’t mean I want to live alone.  There’s absolutely no way I could right now &amp; I’m totally okay with roommates.  That said,  I don’t have any friends willing to move across the country with me &amp; I don’t know anyone who lives in the Seattle area.   I was thinking looking online?  But I’m not sure how that works either.  

I’ve got just over 4k saved up.   Literally no job experience though.  I’m not sure if I should apply for jobs, get one &amp; then look for roomies?  Which doesn’t even make sense in my mind.  Or should I find roomies, move, pay rent for a few months with my savings, and then look for a job in the meantime, and pray I get lucky?  

I currently live in a super tiny town.  There’s no job opportunities.   It’s hard to even get an interview around here.  And I have no credit, yada, yada.  Getting out is my only way.   College would’ve been my first choice but again we’re poor.   No car,  no public transportation, so a community college that’s 45 minutes away isn’t happening.   So, in my mind this is a really good decision for me.  

Also, want to add I don’t have a car.   I do have a license, but I don’t want the financial burden of a car right now.  So, I have to be moving to a place where public transportation &amp; Uber are easily accessible.  Otherwise I can’t.   I’m actually about to make a budget because I haven’t done that yet.  Idk why.

I realised my feelings for her had evolved about 6 months ago. I didnt feel the need confront her about it at the time because she had a boyfriend and the answer was simple; shes in a relationship. Move on.

Oddly that was a refreshing scapegoat answer. I also knew that she DID NOT reciprocate those emotions for me. She viewed me as a surrogate brother. I was able to do some dating in the meantime and work on me. 

Fast forward a few months and her and the long term boyfriend have split for good. As soon as this happens, the feelings that i had done so well to ignore hit me like a tonne of bricks! Compounding this anxiety is the renewed effort on her part to move out of state to find better paying work and more purpose in her career. Not only did i feel the strength of my feelings grow, but there was now an urgency to discuss these out in the open with her. 

After dealing with the fear of rejection and conselling with some close friends (who agreed i had to talk to her if not to clear the air, at least for my own deteriorating mental health) i sacked up and told her how i felt. 

I went to her house, we sat down and i told her the whole story. I made it explicitily clear that a) what was most important for me that i didnt lose her as a friend and that, despite this, we try to maintain that friendship. And b) i was aware of how she saw me (not as a romantic option) and respected her feelings.

We talked for a while. She confirmed that she did not have feelings for me in that way and that, at least, while we worked together nothing would ever happen between us. We discussed her moving out of state and that i would try to support her decision if and when she left. I asked her not too, as she had been, go into graphic detail about her love life (previously it had been torturous). We talked about when i started feeling these feelings, how ive been coping and, most importantly, what the next steps were... I had no answer.

We agreed we would try and work through it together, and that we should continue to be open and honest with each other. 

I left emotionally lighter and happy it was in open. 

In the month since, its becoming more and more obvious that moving on is going to be a difficult and taxing task. We have been giving each other space. She has, unfortunately, been pretty skittish around me. As have I. We havent hung out together in a while. Weve talked once as a follow up. I think it was a little too soon after, as i dont think i had properly processed yet. 

Now that it had settled i feel disappointed and anxious. Disappointed that she didnt feel the same way about me (irrational i know, but you have to feel what you feel). Anxious because i truly dont know what happens next with my best friend, and with me. 

The irrational part of my mind fears everything will collapse into bitterness and resentment if i dont fix it quickly. The rational part understands that these things take a LOT time to work out. 

Im worried and anxious. I dont know what to do next... i dont know how to move on. Ive lined up a tinder date to go on in the next couple of days. Hopefully thats a good starting place. I have hobbies to do this weekend and will be making the rounds with a few of my mates too. 

What else can i do? How do i stop feeling anxious about the situation and how do i stop feeling romantic feelings toward someone who does not reciprocate?

TLDR; fell in love with a best friend. She doesnt feel the same way. How do i move on?",07May2019,1

UNWANTED SEXUAL ADVANCES, SEXUAL HARASSMENT.  


Hello Reddit. I've heard so much about you. This is my first post. A friend needs your help. I really hope you guys can help. Please read carefully, good people, as it is quite a complicated situation.  


Where I live, prostitution is legal. Brothels are legal. A friend of mine is a sex worker in a brothel. Nothing illegal going on as far as the business goes. In fact, it's all fairly regular... most of the time. But then, our perspective of 'normal' is probably quite different to those who have never worked in the industry. Anyway, on to the problem:  


The owner is a male. He likes to help himself to the services on offer. It's not an everyday thing, it's more that he likes to 'teach' the new girls. He'll also just straight-up grope some girls. Now, \*obviously\* this is sexual harassment in the workplace - we're both well aware of that (my friend and I), but this isn't a normal workplace. To put it bluntly: she risks getting fired if she says no, I risk both of us getting fired if I say anything. As much as it would be great to imagine, sweeping changes through the industry are not about to happen (you can blame us for that if you like, but facts are facts). I'm trying to pre-empt all the well-intentioned people telling us that it is not OK, and we should report all sexual harassment, and blah blah, because it doesn't work like that. The industry is technically perfectly legal, but things are still very shady. Any mention of the cops is completely out of the question: getting everybody fired is not a solution. Violence is out of the question.  


How can she tell him that she doesn't want to be 'taught', and that it's not OK for him to touch her, without sounding like she's saying no? Is there something she can do? Something that might curb his advances? She would not say this herself, but she doesn't know how to stand up for herself. It is my opinion that he tends to go for the girls who he thinks are 'weaker'. Typical predatory behaviour, I know.  


She has had to deal with issues relating to sexual assault before, and this is all dredging up some pretty bad memories.  
We were thinking we could play off his ego; make it all about 'her respect for him'. Make sure it's framed in such a way that he's the big man - he's the wise one... that sort of thing. One thing that she's come up with is to make sure she's never alone with him, but that only eases the problem, it doesn't solve it, as the threat still looms large. I cannot stress enough that this is not like other industries. Please don't think I am excusing his behaviour; I just want people to understand her predicament. Yes, it's bad. Yes, this is an outrage. Yes, I too wish the World were a better place, but this is the way it is. Again: not excusing, just don't want her to get fired. Remember that he doesn't need a good reason to fire her: in fact, he can just ghost her by not putting her on the roster. It happens all the time in this industry. It's very bitchy, and very underhanded.  


Extra information off the top of my head:  


\- There are other managers, some female (all ex-workers), but they could really go either way, and probably are not going to be any help  
\- I hardly know this guy, but he is much older than her  
\- Her reaction thus far has always been just to freeze (in fact, I've seen her react that way to a similar issue)  


I was thinking that somebody out there must have gone through the same experience. We really need your help, and we really need your understanding on this one. Thank you so much in advance, kind strangers.",07May2019,1

354,"It was just a normal day. I was doing my homework, minding my own business when all the sudden my mom just enters my room with like a screw driver and some sort of device in her hand. She was tearing it apart. She went on to tell me that she found a camera installed in the clock in their bedroom and was obviously quite disturbed which also freaked me out as well. She told me to check my clock and to our surprise we found another camera. 

I don’t know what his intentions were installing cameras in our bedrooms, or if there are more cameras around the house. My mom and I looked it up online and apparently it was an audio &amp; video recording with a 160° wide angle viewing range. I’m paranoid that there are more cameras around my house now, but the fact that he one in my bedroom where I change and do private stuff really disgusted me..

My mom called him immediately and told him he was a pervert and to never call us again or come back to the house. He literally had no excuse for why he had done this. All he did was say he could do whatever he wants since it’s his house and he pays the rent.

I don’t know what to do. I felt so heart broken and sick to my stomach. I don’t know if i’m overreacting and this isn’t really a big deal.

355,"Hi, 19F here. This turned out to be way longer than I expected so I tried to structure it in a way that made sense. TL;DR at the bottom. Also, to make it clear: when I use the words ""major"", ""study programme"" and ""university"" I esentially mean the same thing.

I'm a first year university student studying languages in my hometown. When I chose my study programme last year I was really happy with my choice, but since I actually starting attending classes I have realised that this isn't for me at all. I couldn't care less about what I'm learning, have no motivation to do anything school-related and sincerely cannot imagine dealing with English and French syntax for the rest of my life. In short, I really, REALLY want to change my field of study.

One big problem is that I don't actually know what I want to do with my life. I have wanted to be a teacher since I was little, but now I'm more aware each day how little I actually know about teaching and I think I'm not the most well-suited person for the job. I'm bored out of my mind in my classes and can't imagine dealing with the same thing for the rest of my life. I know that teaching isn't the only thing you can do with a language degree, but based on my disinterest with my major I'm not even sure that I'll manage to gather enough motivation to finish my studies; I most likely won't succeed to pass my finals this year. Even if I did get a degree, I don't want to deal with languages for the rest of my life.

Another problem with my major is getting a job after university. I know for a fact that it's really hard to get a job with what will eventually be my degree, and that we have too many humanities students in our country. That's why I'm thinking about studying something to do with science: biology, biotechnology or something similar. These are very diverse fields of study and are known for their high employment rate. I have some friends who attend these study programmes and am planning to ask them about their courses and attend some classes so I won't make a rushed decision.

So my dislike for my field of study and the low employment rate are the two most grave reasons that make me want to change universities. There are also smaller things like some of my professors being extremely unqualified and the fact that the French programme at my university is a joke. I'd be willing to deal with that but I don't see the reason to if I don't even want to deal with languages as my profession anymore.

Now that you know why i WANT to change my major, there are two main things that make me question enrolling into another study programme: my parents and losing my student status.

I have tried telling my parents many times how unhappy I am with my current major. Seriously, I told them I had plans to change universities at least four times now, starting in the beginning of the school year. They have dismissed me every single time though, and they claim that I'm not thinking about my future and that college is only the means to get an education (basically that I have to be patient and finish my studies so I'll get the education that I need to become a teacher). They're sort of right in that regard but I'm not even sure that I want to be a teacher anymore. I admit that it seems like a rewarding profession to me, but I don't think that I'm right for the job or that I'd be very happy doing it. Again, I probably won't even get a job as a teacher based on the employment rate.

Anyway, it seriously bothers me that they don't seem to care about what I'm dealing with. It's my life that's on the line here and they wouldn't lose anything if I changed majors. My mother is also convinced that I'm some sort of genious when it comes to languages, especially French. I don't know what she based that belief on because I have been extremely average in French in both my grades and the final exams, so it's not like I'd be throwing some big talent of mine to waste by changing majors.

I'm willing to deal with my parents and their criticism if they don't approve of my choice (and I have other relatives that support me in my decision), but I'm worried that they won't support me if I go along with this. My parents are quite well-off but my mother has made it clear on multiple occasions that they will continue to support me financially only if I'm in school, but no longer if I ever drop out. The law in my country states that the parents have to financially support their children until they turn 18 years old AND have to continue to do so for as long as they're getting a higher education (until they turn 26).

Now, if I could start attending another university next school year this wouldn't be a problem. But since I took my finals knowing that I'd study languages, I didn't even consider taking a biology exam. And I can't imagine being accepted into the biology study programme without taking that exam as it is practically impossible that I would get in due to the competition. Luckily, I can take that exam, but I would most likely have to take it next year (I wrote a letter to the school secretary about this and am still waiting for the reply). That would mean that I'd lose my student status for a whole year so I would lose a lot of bonuses, including the option to work part-time through a student organization.

I could avoid losing my student status by successfully passing all my exams this year and enrolling into the next year of study (the second school year).I could then take the biology final next year while retaining my student status. This would be optimal but I'm afraid that I won't make it. I don't think that I qualify to take the final exam of one of my classes because I've missed too many lessons and didn't turn in all of my work on time. I'll have to speak to my lecturer to be completely sure, but I know I completely screwed up that class and I'll have to deal with the consequences. The class is optional and I may be able to somehow pass without it (again, I have to speak to the lecturer to be sure).

Since I would most likely have to take a break from my studies for a whole school year to retake the high school final exams I would lose my student status and my parents would no longer be obliged to house or help me. I make 50€ a month by cleaning a building complex but that's nearly not enough for rent, food, etc. Of course I'd look for a job if they threw me out, but it's not easy to earn money with only a high-school education and without a student status in my country. I should also make it clear that attending university is FREE in my country and that you can retake a year OR  change your mayor ONE TIME for it to remain free. If you do either of those things more than once (or if you do a combination of both) you have to start paying to attend college each semester (but it isn't nearly as expensive than in the US).

I admit that I feel guilty about this whole ordeal because changing majors would mean that I'd be 2 whole years behind the rest of my generation. I'm angry at myself that I didn't explore more options before choosing my major and that I don't just suck it up and at least try to finish my studies. I'm scared of putting my life on hold for a whole year, but I'd rather make a change now than be unhappy with my major for the next 4 years it takes me to get my masters degree and be able to start to teach. I don't want to hate my job at 40 and regret that I didn't at least try to change universities for the rest of my life.

So what do you think? Any advice on what to do in this situation would be highly appreciated.

TL;DR I don't know if I should stick with the study major that I don't like and avoid a serious set-back or at least try to make a change and enrol into another university.",07May2019,1
356,"This happened awhile ago, but here is a backstory on are friendship.
We where in a large friendship group we all split off into small subgroups due to boyfriends and stuff, I ended up becoming super close with this girl Ann and her boyfriend I was close with Ann she was like my best friend and the guy Deck was like my brother we would play PS4 all night and watch anime. 
Things started to get odd they started to act sexual especially Deck, when I was in the room not normal couple love stuff like he would grab my friends pussy in front of me and would look at me to try and get a reaction? but I just ignored it, then they started to have sex when I was sleeping in the same bed/top bunk and I would hear EVERYTHING, I felt uncomfortable so I sat them down after they kept doing it every time I was there, and basically said stop having sex when I’m in the room and they agreed to stop.
Then the boyfriend started to get overly friendly he would touch my legs leave his hands on my upper thighs and knees... then one night I had to sleep in the same bed as him and his girlfriend, I woke up with him resting his head on my boob and him cuddling me he would have tickle fights pinned me down etc he never touched me pussy but did touch my boobs/ass he would do this when my friend was in the room he would slide his hand on my upper thighs while cuddling his girlfriend.
I think he got off with touching me when his girlfriend was in the room like a dirty secret, the final night I saw them I made them coffee walked in the room and he was eating her out I had a massive argument with them and never saw them again.
Should I have told my ex best friend about what he did? Did I do the right thing?. I need advice from you guys, I was 17 at the time so was the guy and the girl was 16.",07May2019,1
357," Soo me and my boyfriend of 2 1/2 years broke up this Sunday, we both agreed on it and we ended it very peacefully and happily. I have severe depression, and I just started on anti-depressants that include the side effect of severe suicidal thoughts.  
Long story short, I am now in a youth psych ward, because I am in danger for myself if I am left alone. This has nothing to do with him at all, it's just crappy timing that I started feeling like this.

One of the reasons we broke up is because it was effecting his school work how I was feeling, so it feels selfish to tell him that I'm here now, especially because he would blame himself because of how soon after we broke up this happened. But if the situation was reversed I would wanna know.

Should I tell him or not?

 Edit: We agreed to meet up tomorrow and talk about some more stuff, but I won't be out of here before that, should I come up with a lie for why I can't meet him or is it better I tell the absolute truth?",07May2019,1
358,"So, my (19m) friend (22f) comes over every so often to watch anime with me. We're both second year uni, and she's very cuddly, so we'll usually both have our arms around each other in my bed whilst watching. Now she has a bf of 3 years, both of them international students and gamers.

Now, things start getting... Interesting, about the third time she comes round. She does cuddle up unusually close, but since the first time she came we got high together, I just thought it was that. This time, we're completely sober, and I notice exactly how tightly she's hugging me, and how close her body is to mine. I start to let my hands wander a little and she's into it. Only a bit of over the clothes stuff, nothing overtly sexual.

We have a chat about it after and she said it was dumb and we shouldn't do it again, but lo and behold, next time she comes around, I find her nuzzling right back up into my neck again and so it begins again.

I don't really think we've passed the point of no going back, I haven't undressed or kissed her or anything, not even touched blatantly sexual places you know? Just enough to know that we're both clearly into each other. 

I just want to know what people think I guess. I've had one friend (f19) tell me it's not my responsibility to save their relationship, or not go for something that we both clearly want, and I've also had another friend (also f19) to tell me to stay well clear of things.",07May2019,0
360,"I am lowkey freaking out. I have my AP Bio exam in less than a week and my AP World History Exam in a little more than a week. I haven't started studying for either of them... Now for Bio, I feel like I know all the concepts decently well, since I've always passed the tests with a 90 or above. My teacher is really good and prepared us pretty well. I think I understand all the equations and stuff for the grid-ins. My plan for that is to just review with slides and look through the test prep book.

&amp;#x200B;

AP World on the other hand... Our teacher is so ass. He's never taught us a single thing. That whole class has just been organizers and we would have to read the book ourselves. He didn't even grade the organizers (not a single homework grade in his class) so most people didn't bother to do them. I've probably only read 10 out of the 36 chapters in the book. I have no time to read the ones I've missed and I don't know what to do. I don't know anything and on most tests I get a 70 or lower, but he gives us extra credit and curves the grade so I still have an A+ in the class.

364,"throwaway because I just don't want this on my main account.

I am 21 years old. Recently I've had nightmares and sleep paralasys that are very disturbing to me, and ususally involve my dad. I started to feel uncomfortable around him but chalked it up to random dreams. But as they began occuring more and more and I would wake up in cold sweat (which, in my entire life, has never happened to me) I thought maybe there is some soul searching that I need to do.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a bit embarassing to admit, but I was always very sexual. When I was young (about 5), I would masturbate a lot on like, random furniture. I am the youngest of 3 kids so my brother and sister would lways be disgusted but I just couldn't stop. I wish I could say I grew out of it (I tried) but it's like a wierd urge that I have to obey. I never thought much of it, but combined with the (very vivid) dreams and with some other incidents that come up the more I think about this topic, I fear that there is something that my brain  just pushed aside until I could fully deal with it.

The other incidents include-

\-me waking up a few times when I was very young naked. I thought I just somehow took my clothes off when I was sleeping, but this honestly never happened again or before.

\-we moved houses when I was 9 and my sister and I finally got our own rooms. My dad insisted on me being in the room next to them, because it was bigger (it wasn't). Though I think that I'm reading to much into this one.

\-a few other minor things that i'm not sure how to put into words yet.

I am ashamed to bring this up with my boyfriend. I always think ""maybe these are just dreams"", and leave it at that. But lately thinking about it makes my stomach turn and I can't sleep alone without having these nightmares. I can't lock my door (everyone else can, I now wonder why I wasn't also given a key) so I have been pulling my chair to my door, tying the handle and the closet door together, anything so I could sleep well, but the nightmares haunt me.

Seeing a therapist is not an option. I live at home with my parents and my sister. it's mostly just my mom and me here because my dad works long hours and my sister isn't always around.

I love my dad dearly, but I am scared of listening to whatever my mind is trying to convey. how do I deal with all of this? How can I make sense of everything that I'm feeling?",07May2019,0

I had a headache and couldn't walk straight so thought maybe it's stress and I should just rest (I recently started a new job as an assistant psychologist and the psychologist left so been stressful on my own). Felt better by the Sunday but then Monday at work it hit me really hard when I was with a patient and I had to go home early as my body felt heavy on one side when I was walking and I couldn't walk straight. 

I had a telephone consultation with the doctor on the Tuesday and she told me it sounds like labyrinthitis so told me to take prochlorperazine to help with the symptoms.

So it's my birthday tomorrow. I'm turning 22. A week ago I looked forward to my birthday and the suprises it would hold. I was going to a quiz night (unrelated to my bday) w/friends then getting dressed up going for dinner and gambling with my partner who had never done it before.
Now with less then 6hours to go, I couldn't care less and just want the day over and done with as it now more feels like an obligation to celebrate and enjoy the day than anything else. 
I  found out last night my family wont be visiting me on my birthday, my grandparnts who live ten mins away and are retired dropped my cards off to my house two days ago while I was at work; they know I am home all day tomorrow by myself,  Nobody else has planned anything/havent remebered.
That's not a big deal, it's expected.
My partner tells ms he wants to book us dinner at the most expensive japanese restaurant in town, which 90% serves seafood and raw, which he loves. I don't dont and have very 'white people pallet' when it comes to that food.
I had already said two nights before I wasn't sure about it because I don't want to push outside my comfort zone (I'm a recovering anorexic so food is dicey at the best of times)
He came home yesterday trying to sell the place to me, talking about how it has great food and all these claims from people he works with who have been.
I again stressed the point of my comfort and asked if he'd even looked at the menu yet to SEE if there was anything I'd eat on it. He Hadn't. 
I'm not exactly excited about it but I didn't have any backup idea on somewhere to eat so I said sure after I read the menu and saw there was two things I would eat. 
for his birthday I asked what  he'd like, he said meat so I went and found a nice place that serves a huge range of it. He loved it.My issue with this whole dinner thing is. a) as a recoveing its hard to try new food or anything that smells 'gross'. b) eating out makes me anxious c.) I HATE and can hardly stand that fishy smell most seafood has d.) We are supposed to be saving money for a holiday; He's trying to blow $$$ on something I never certaintly said I wanted, the topper he's not getting me a gift; He's just seeing if he can get last years gift fixed which was a pendant but one of the stones cracked which will most likely cost more than the pendant itself due to the type of stone it is. he thought it would be 'sentimental' apparently he was also going to replace the chain but conveniently that only came up after I called out the fact that even if the stone was fixed I still couldn't wear it bc it has a busted  chain. It was going to be a suprise but when I guessed at it he straight up told me thats what he was doing. Didnt even try deny it. I've been hinting for months at wanting a new pericing or body jewelry or even a cute charm from him for my bracelet, or new shoes.
For his birthday I got him some skin care stuff he wanted and books for his hobbies/career that he had been talking about for months of wanting to do more and got him tickets to a comedy show (we didn't even use them).

We ended up fighting about it today BC when he confirmed my thought of replacing the stone I clearly wasn't excited. It hurt he's feelings and he  pulled the 'sorry its not good enough card' which didn't go down verbally to well. I've made it clear I no longer care about celebrating my birthday but he wants to make it a good day for me. I feel obligated to enjoy myself even though if we went a did what i wanted in the end it wouldn't be that great because it was tthe afterthought in the first place. We haven't spoke since. (We live together) but he's away right now.
 
I'm not ungrateful for the effort(?) he's put in and I dont feel like it's not good enough but it just feels like what I wanted wasn't really considered and all those other feelings I talked about. Even after the consideration I put into his, which he tried to say wasn't fair BC he's been busy but I was very busy with work around his birthday.

382,"*Reposted because I got no comments on my last post*

Hello there.

I personally have always had quite good mental health, despite various life issues. I have always been unbelievably terrible at talking to people and understanding other people, to the point where I'm genuinely starting to think it's a condition. I also have trouble figuring out boundaries (i.e. ""Are we close enough to bring this up/do this?"") which makes me extremely paranoid in conversations in case I say the wrong thing.

In the last few months, I have made a new friend. We'll call her T. The two of us have become very close very quickly, and I am glad to have her. Recently, she went to the hospital with tonsillitis. While they were there, they found scars that she had from self-harming. She felt close enough to me to confess this to me the week she was discharged.

My other friend (who we'll call J) has always been a strong and kind figure to me and our entire friend group. However, she recently broke down in front of a large group of people, and was very upset for hours afterwards.

My other friend (who we'll call P) has always shown signs of being sad or depressed, and I've always been worried about her.

There's more, but those three are the cases I am most worried about.

Because of my paranoia that I mentioned earlier, I am always to scared to give them so much as a pat on the back, let alone talk to them about it. Because of this, I tend to just watch ither friends comfort them like an idiot. It's obvious that they don't take kindly to me watching them suffer helplessly, but saying why I don't say anything feels so stupid to say out loud that I'm positive they'll think I'm just making up excuses. I genuinely have never had a close friend once in my entire life because of this. It prevents me from having any conversation that isn't just telling jokes and messing around. 

Does anyone have any tips on talking to them and getting closer?",07May2019,2
383,"Since I was around 12 or so, I wanted to get into acting and modelling. Now I'm actually starting to pursue a career in it, and I'm looking back on when the desire to do so first hit and realizing that a strong motivator is the attention, respect and admiration that I've seen people in the public eye getting, and wanting that for myself.

I come from a family where I had a mentally ill parent, so most of the attention went to them and I was basically taught to stay invisible and stay silent about things, for fear of upsetting or offending others (religious upbringing as well).

I was also bullied for most of my life, particularly at the start of high school, which is the time when I decided I wanted to get into acting and modelling to start with, and recognize that a lot of it has to do with wanting to have attention (I crave it, yet feel really uncomfortable when I have it), but also the respect which I didn't get until I'd undergone two major surgeries in 8th grade.

I feel like attention, respect and admiration are really shallow reasons to want to pursue a career in modeling or entertainment, so I partially justify it as also having a love of storytelling, and getting dressed up and having my photo taken (both very true), as well as wanting to build up a public platform to share my experiences with bullying, mental illness and religious toxicity. (I put it as wanting to have a Kardashian level of fame so I can use it to do good and inspire others through what I've experienced and what I've been able to overcome)

Someone I met recently asked me how I'd feel if I published my autobiography (which I'm still gradually working on) and no one read it or it didn't get the level of exposure I'd hoped it would. I told her I'd feel disappointed, but also a sense of relief and pride that I'd gotten my story out there and released it, now it was just about marketing and the right people would eventually find it.

Whenever I watch celebrity interviews, look at tabloids (very rarely) or awards shows, I always feel a sense of excitement and wonder what it would be like to be in them myself. I keep thinking that if it wasn't something I was meant to pursue, I wouldn't have a nagging need to do so. Every time I've done an extras job or met someone new in the industry, I feel excited because it's one step closer to making it big time, regardless of how long that might take.

I think I feel concerned about my desire for fame and notoriety being a bad thing because of all the negative things I've heard celebrities say about it, which makes me feel like there's something wrong with wanting to pursue it, not for the sake of fame, but for having brought positive value to people's lives and earning their respect as a result.

I don't know whether it's that, or having my mother's voice in my head telling me I shouldn't want to stand out or draw attention to myself, so wanting or craving any kind of attention, makes me feel a sense of shame and embarrassment.",07May2019,1

It hurts so bad and he says he sorry and doesn’t mean it and he gets angry but idk how long I can take 19 years of apologizing. Why I’m on here and asking for advice is bc he told me the worse possible thing you can ever tell your child. 

He told me I’m the reason why he wants to end his life and why it sucks and that my mom and me did this on purpose to fuck his life over (which is not true!) and it’s every tiny little mess up he blows up about and will go on for HOURS of just screaming and yelling at me and banging shit. I just don’t know how long I can take holding my child while she’s crying and I’m holding everything in the best I can feeling like I’m stuck to the ground and can’t move and he’s pointing and screaming in my face telling me how much of a terrible human being I am. 

He’s constantly telling me I’m stupid and then says “I’m not calling you stupid the actions that you’re doing right now is stupid” like I know what he’s doing and saying. I’m tired of his word games. It’s taking a toll on my mental health and I don’t want to blame that on him, but I’m tired of saying sorry and feeling bad over things I can’t control and I If any of you have any advice it would be much appreciated.

390,"Greetings people sorting by new. I'm on mobile and that cool fun stuff. Anyhow I have this friend that I met about a year and a half ago and we really became good friends. All my other friends treated me like shit a lot of the time and didn't really care so it was good to have someone who was the opposite. She really helped me through a lot of shit. I really thank her for that. Anyway the problem started around January. She had some separate issues and was a little less active in talking and stuff. I don't blame her for this and understand and tried to help. This paired with the fact that our schedules for school have not allowed at all has made us a little distant. This really sucks and I really love her and want her to be around. Anyway we still don't talk as much and I spend a lot of the day just having anxiety and feeling alone just waiting and seeing if she comes on. I know this isn't healthy but it's whatever. So the real problem is that because of our schedules we only have about five minutes a day to talk in person and I've been through a very bad depression thing and am very low energy. Especially in the morning she tries to talk to me and I'm really trying to communicate but it's too much for me. I end up saying a few responses and she leaves and talks to someone else and I just kinda stand there. She always tells me this bothers her and I try to tell her I'm trying but I know it just come along as me being an asshole. This and the fact I think she's taking it as I don't want to talk to her. Which is one hundred percent the opposite case. I don't know how to fix this how friendship I'm really trying but it's just falling apart and she's the one person who cares about me and I care about her.

400,"Okay.... so to start off with, I'm the only one in my family that actually knows about this (I believe). So I don't really have anyone to go to in that regards and I have a rather big issue of opening up emotionally to people I actually know. Family more so, as for some reason I've become the go to they go to person to dump horrible news on. In other words **ALL** the bad crap that happens in my family end up being told to me usually when someone else decides to get drunk.  


A couple months ago my sister and mother got very nearly blackout drunk. They both came pretty much barging into my flat when I was having a few friends over as we were gonna go clubbing. After thoroughly embarrassing me in front of my friends and asking if any of us had any drugs for my sister to do, they both left to go to my kitchen to have a chat. At this point having been rather annoyed about the entire situation I decided to drink quite a bit to help me not lose my shit. So after awhile my friends and I decided we better get ready to leave soon so I went into the kitchen to tell them we were going to be leaving soon. (That may seem insensitive but I had been looking forward to that night for ages, as I very rarely decide to ""let go"" and have fun simply because whenever I decide to drink something to this effect happens). Anyway so as I walk in to the kitchen my sister and mother are both breaking down crying. Over the course of the next conversation I learn a few things:

1. They are both far more drunk than I had originally thought  
2. My sister was apparently raped/touched by my dad when we were younger and my mother wasn't around. (She disappeared for like 5 years when I was like 3)  
3. My dad has apparently beat my sister at some point  
4. After having that happen, my sister still goes to live with my dad whenever she comes back home. (She works abroad). When she has plenty of other options.  
5. My sister didn't want me specifically to know this.  


So at the end of that rather........ depressing conversation, my mother (who is finding this all out at the same time as me) decides she is gonna go get a taxi and go over to my dad's house to talk about all of this. My sister however decides she doesn't want any one speaking to my dad because she doesn't want him to find out she told us as she was staying with him at the time. At the end of the ensuing argument over they should do, my mother ends up storming out. My sister at this point in near hysterics starts begging me to believe what our dad did to her. At this point I kind of do as it's very hard not to believe someone who is that hysterical. After I told her I do she ended up chasing after my mother. I at this point decide to go back to my friends who were sat in my living room the entire time and continue drinking despite my friends advice. To their credit my friends did spend a lot of time trying to cheer me up until I excused myself to spend a bit of time to get myself to stop crying.  


About 30 minutes later when I finally start to stop crying my sister messages me asking for me to bring something she left at my flat over to her. I tell my friends I'll be right back and bring said item over to my sister.... When I finally meet her she sitting at a bar still drinking having a grand old time with my mother appearing to all spectators that she hadn't had what I would call a soul crushing conversation less than an hour beforehand. I spend like 10 minutes with her simply due to the fact I'm in disbelief someone who was that hysterical a little while ago can be so completely fine now.. After I deem she's completely fine and nothings wrong with either her or my mother I then proceed to leave still extremely upset about that entire night..  


It's been a few months since that night and I'm still extremely upset with everything and don't know what to do. My dad has noticed I've pretty much stopped speaking to him, and is worried about it. My mother hasn't brought up anything about that night part of me honestly think's she's forgotten about the whole thing entirely. She at least hasn't done anything about it. My sister hasn't brought up anything since that night and again I honestly believe she's forgotten she told me, in fact she's actively pushing me to speak and have a good relationship with our dad..... And the main reason I doubt everything is because she was so beyond drunk and every time someone in my family gets that drunk they start this shit and half the time it isn't true and is in fact made up.  


So here I am, literally no clue what to do... I don't know if my sister just made this up for the drama and my dad is as good a guy as I thought he was or my dad is a complete shit bag and my sister is fine with staying with my dad, overall having a far better relationship with him than I do and actively pushing for me to speak to him (her apparent rapist) properly again. I can't even ask for his side of the story as it will completely fuck with my sister's relationship with my dad.  


I love my dad and I love my sister, I really do.. And I know I'm being an asshole for making this situation about me. But I don't know who to believe.. One way or another I won't be able to deal with one of them.

401,"Me and my three roommates split the water bill. However one roommate (Roommate C we’ll call him) has all utility bills in his name, so he let’s us  know what we owe when the bill comes and we split it evenly 4 ways. The bill has gradually doubled over the past eight months due to worsening running toilets and plumbing issues. After each bill doubling from the previous months (water bill is every 2 months) , we now have a bill currently for $1100. Myself and the two roommates who don’t have the bill in our name have listened to roommate C (who does have the bill in his name) repeatedly say “he’s going to get the issue fixed” but he has failed to do so. With this most current bill we refuse to split it evenly. As a compromise we have offered to pay the same amount we paid when we got the last $550 bill (when he last said he’d FIX the toilet issue and didn’t) We finally got a plumber to fix the toilets and the Landlord actually picked up the bill for the plumbing work. However we’re stuck with the bill for the water and we think roomie C deserves to pay the majority of the bill. Roomie C is putting up a fight saying we agreed to split 4 ways and so we have to.

I have a 2015 Toyota Corolla S and owe $8000 on it. The bumper has been fucked ever since the accident but I'm signing a work order today to get it fixed at a garage which would be a $1000 deductible. There are a few other dents on both sides that I need to get fixed and there's a weird clanging sound coming from the undercarriage so that'd be more money I have to spend to get it to its best condition. Other than that the car runs great and no problems with the engine. I'm going to estimate that the other repairs would cost upwards of $2k.

My dad was pretty great growing up, yeah a few anger issues but honestly he was always stressed about work and being laid off i think i understood even as a child. However he took a job that had him move to california (we are in TX) and long story short after a few years we found out he had a long term girlfriend out there. He also told us he had been having an affair with a family friend for 10 ish years now.

It was a year of complete chaos, huge crazy toxic family blow up fights, my sister took an axe to his door , he showed no remorse only tried to explain why. We begged him to re consider but to no avail. The woman he’s with is AWFUL. He brought her to texas against me and my siblings will for us to meet her just 2 weeks after my parents divorce was final. She’s unstable, bossy , and flat out disrespectful in regards to me and honestly my dad.
We all have tried to talk to him countless times, asking just for a phone call a week when he used to call nightly. a trip every 3 months when he used to come out every weekend. I offered him 900 dollars for flights/hotels so he would come for my brother and he told me he didn’t have the time. 

He lacks in communication , missed my brothers birthday and also my sisters for a trip to the Caribbean with his girlfriend. i’m an adult so as much as it sucks having your dad ignore your calls and kind of exist your life for no reason sucks, however i have 2 younger brothers who have no been subjected to a father leaving. He hasn’t come home in 6+ months, quit his job (he is looking for another one) but is working at sprouts and sounds more miserable than ever.

410,"So I’ve been married for almost 9 years now and things have been good up until the last couple of years. My husband is a great guy, but I feel like he’s just stopped trying. I have to beg him for attention, beg him to spend time with me and stuff like that. He doesn’t go to the doctor ever and I think that stuff might be wrong. At night he gets in this tired state and just acts completely different. 

I’ve told him how I feel, how I’m not happy, how things need to change and his answer is always “I’m working on it.” Well he’s been working on it for the last 3-4 years and nothing has changed. I’ve tried therapy with him and he went a few times then he wouldn’t go anymore. I tried to just let things slide and not get on his case about things but I just can’t handle it anymore. 

So a couple months back I found out that he was sexting with an ex-girlfriend, I’m not completely innocent in this either because I was sexting with a friend of mine. I confronted him about his ex and told him about what I had done too. He didn’t seem to care that I was even doing it, but I was furious that he was. I told him to stop. I’ve stopped also.   

After that I found out they were still talking a few times and I took his phone and texted her back saying “please stop texting my husband.” I’ve tried to be good and not check his phone but I have a lot of trust issues since I work nights and I’m not home a lot. So the other night I checked his phone and there were no texts or anything (he could have deleted them) but in his recently deleted photos there were a few dick pics (his). 

So do I confront him again and tell him I know, do I let it go? I just feel like such an idiot and I know I don’t deserve to be treated like this. The whole thing makes me sick and I can’t get my brain to stop and I just worry. 

TLDR: husband has sexted his ex before, I sexted a friend too before. We both stopped, but I found he had dick pics (his own) on his phone and I feel like he might be talking to her again.",07May2019,2

(Ex, eating any bagged food in any cupboard, chewing and scratching everything and anything, moving rugs across the room for no apparent reason, eating my cat's food CONSTANTLY, pouncing on my sleeping cat CONSTANTLY and then pestering him for HOURS, no exaggeration, hours of stalking, pouncing, and batting at from the new cat and hour of my cat just growling and running away from the new cat in an attempt to find any level of peace in his home. I can't do it anymore. I am about to start a new job and can't be home with them all the time. I am very worried about them being alone. Not to mention I could probably let the maturity difference slide for awhile, as I was before anyway, but every second I'm with this cat, I hate his original owner more. It's all just piled up to this point but I am no one's mother and don't feel like I should have to keep this cat at the risk of my cat getting tormented every day for months. Said friend is set to move somewhere in a couple months but I am skeptical at this point about any true reliability from this friend.


There's plenty more detail about this friend I left out to preserve her repuation so please don't assume the cat is the only real issue. Also, please understand I have been looking up every training technique I could find for dealing with the cat's behavior, it has been 2 months, with 2 more to go if I wait it out, with maybe a 5% improvement in overall behavior. 

Reddit, I want to send this cat back to the shelter because no one should or wants to take him. It may officially end my friendship but I don't care at anymore anyway. Is that wrong? Am I a shitty friend for being fed up or is it okay to want to just be done with all this?

TLDR: Resuced my friend's kitten for her after her breakup only to realize both her and the kitten are bad company. How do I proceed?",07May2019,2
414,"I don't know what to do. I live in a homophobic country. Being gay is legal but highly frowned upon. Gay people can not adopt, marry or have kids in any other way. I have no way of finding other gay people since there are no bars and clubs and guys on apps are looking for sex and sex only. Having kids is really important to me.







I also can't move abroad because my diploma is not recognised so I won't be able to work what I have studied hard 7 years for, I am also very shy and going to a new country where I know no one, have no friends and I am all alone and so so far from all the people I love and my home is terribly horrifying for me.

415,"I follow a routine most nights- I either study or watch tv, then wash my face, and brush my teeth. I also put on acne medication- it's a topical bottle that comes in a pump. I leave the pump on my nightstand and use it daily. Last night I was studying for an exam until about 3 am then decided to fall asleep. I went to put on my acne medication and I could not find it for the life of me. I searched my bedroom and bathroom multiple times each.

I looked for so long because this stuff is expensive and my acne can come back if I don't apply it every night.

&amp;#x200B;

When I came back from my exam at 9 am this morning it was sitting on my nightstand in plain sight. What is interesting is I threw away a couple of water bottles and wrappers from there and searched inside the drawers several times. So I highly doubt that I overlooked that spot.

She was at her worst during my childhood but has calmed down quite a bit after quitting the drugs.

It's unhealthy and I hate it, I don't know what to do about it.

Today was my last day, so there’s no way I can talk to another teacher, his parents, etc. I need to know what I should do in the future, as I will DEFINITELY encounter this situation (or similar) again. Next year I will be a first year elementary school teacher.

Trigger warning for r*pe

I will never understand kids’ fascination with r*pe jokes! This boy today (who I saw was messing with these three girls but I have never met them before, everything looked friendly, all were in 4th-5th grade probably) comes up to me (even though the main teacher was right there too) and slings his arm around me (barely containing a smile) and goes “MISS? Those girls over there- they R*PED ME!” And then he starts laughing and runs back over to them.

I said something stupid like “that’s not good” because I didn’t know what to say to him. Then I saw him try to hug all of them and they all jumped out of his way. The bell rang and they all scattered so I couldn’t do anything more about it. I told the main teacher what happened, but she shrugged and said “I’ll talk to his teacher” (meaning no she won’t)
Idk what I should do in this situation again? Like I know I should talk to the student, and say “hey that’s not a joke” or whatever, but I have no idea the words to even say that! How do I explain to a 10-12 y/o how SERIOUS this “joke” is? What would the right punishment be? Not only to punish them, but to make sure it doesn’t happen again?

I took the course 3 times dropped it the first time and failed it twice. After my second time i decided to change my major just to avoid this class. I truly believe it’s my kryptonite. But when i finally found what i wanted to major in i had to take it again. I took it and failed last semester. I got so mad that i decided to study it in the past couple of weeks so i could pass it in a community college (cheaper and probably easier) and i finally understood it. Unfortunately it might be too late. The problem is my college has a rule that after three attempts at any course i have to send the dean a letter on why i should be able to take it again and of course with a shit ton of paper work. I really have no idea what to write in it and i’ve thought of everything from faking the death of family members overseas (im not from here) to talking about my depression but i failed it TWICE and dropped it once.

442,"This is a throwaway account because most of my friends know my main account.

So, a group of 6 friends and myself are a really close knit group and we always pull crazy pranks on one another. 4 of us in the group are in the midst of developing a plan to scare the piss out of our one friend. We plan to kidnap him after he gets off of work one night. We want to wear ski masks and all black and take him to a secluded area for the big reveal.

We have multiple different theories about how this could work. One was that we do it when he gets home, but he lives in the middle of the city in a rural area so if someone sees it or he screams  then either the cops get called or someone comes out with a gun and shoots us. Another one was that we have a friend who lives in the outskirts text him asking him to meet up and then on his way out we block the road with cars and trap him, but then I feel like he might get scared and ram the cars or even damage his own car trying to go around us. A lot of things can go wrong. We need advice on how we should go about doing this without getting in serious trouble. 

My question for advice is: what is the safest way we can go about this and how can we really scare the piss out of him with this? Another thing is, is this a bad idea or should we do something else? If so, what and how? 

Just for clarification we are all seniors in high school and graduating this June so we plan to do this in the summer time. We have been a close group of friends for years now. We are being real quiet about this and keeping it a secret until last minute for some of our other close friends.

444,"I'm a 21 year old male. I went to University for three consecutive years right out of high school. I was studying Biology. I didn't finish. I didn't return for my 4th year. I wouldn't have graduated on time anyway because I was failing classes in my major.

I did very well in high school. I maintained a 3.9 GPA. I had two scholarships before going off to University. Because I was unable to maintain the GPA requirements to keep my scholarships, I lost them after my second year.

I should've never returned for a third year knowing that I lost my scholarships, but I was too set on finishing my Biology degree. I kept screwing up in my classes, and I decided Biology isn't for me.

I also realized I didn't have a passion for it. I never wanted to go to medical school to become a Doctor, or a PA, Pharmacist, etc. I was unsure what I should study, but just picked Biology since I was always kind of good in science.

That was a big mistake. I wasted three years of University on a degree that I've come to realize I don't have an interest in. I still don't know what I want to do with my life. I decided it would be best for me to leave University altogether and come back at a later date when I finally know what I would like to do as a career. People were telling me, ""You're three years into a Biology degree, just finish!"" However, I don't want to be stuck with a degree that I don't want and isn't very marketable.

I can honestly say I was forced to go to college. My mother pressured me. At the time, I saw no other option besides going to college. I was the first person from my immediate family to go to University right out of high school. I had no one to guide me through the college process.

After graduating from high school, I wish I would've done one of three things: Take time off before going to college, go to community college, or go into university undecided.

I'm in community college right now working to obtain an Associate of Arts degree. I thought it would be a good idea to have something to show for the schooling I've completed so far. Once I earn my AA, I plan to just work full-time and get myself together. I do have plans to go back to school in the future. But, school is not the place for me to be in right now.

I also struggle with bad Social Anxiety. Being in public and around other people makes me nervous. This also really affects my life. It's the reason why I have no friends and have never had a job before. It's also the reason why I wasn't having any fun in university. I wasn't making any friends or socializing. I believe it's important to get my mental health in order before anything else. I want to start attending therapy soon to get this problem treated.

I'm 22k in debt because of wasting time in University. However, my plan is to live frugally with my parents. My parents said they will allow me to live with them rent-free so I can pay off my debt. I will work full-time and pay as much as I can toward my student loans.

450,"I feel so bad for writing this because in many ways I see my parents as the best parents ever. However, we had our fights as most parents and teenagers has, but somehow I have a hard time forgetting some things that happened. 

My mum would always yell at me for not cleaning up after myself and denying me to do seemingly normal activities. During my early teens I felt as they just saw me as their child, not an own individual with her own things and struggles going on at school and with friends. I recently found my diary from when I was around 11 years old where I wrote that this was the worst summer ever. I was so bored and really did nothing all week. Then one day I am so excited because my sister asked me to see Harry Potter with her and her friends at the movies. I draw a ton of hearts and praised the summer is finally saved (lol), but the next day I write about how my mum just had said no and given me no reason for it at all. Then I keep writing about how I do nothing again. I know it seems petty of me to still be upset about this, but I think it's because I had completely forgotten about it and finding my diary again opened so many wounds that stuck so much deeper. It was a pattern. 

They continued denying me to see certain friends and go to certain events for teenagers my age. They would give me no reason for it and as much as I tried explaining them why I should be allowed to go (literally none of my friends were forced to stay home) they wouldn't hear it. When I was 13 they even threatened to call the police because I had gone off to an event for 12-15 year olds at a church (!) one evening. Just writing about it over ten years later makes me remember the feelings of hopelessness so clearly. The feelings of anger rise up randomly from time to time and I sometimes feel like I'm about to have a heart attack. My mum would run upstairs to my room whenever I had ""made a mess"" and yell at me for it. The problem is that ""the mess"" would often be a single glass of water misplaced or a blanket I had left unfolded. I still unwillingly shrink when I visit home and hear her steps at the stairs. I was too proud to silently get up, go downstairs and tidy when I felt like I had nothing to tidy up, so we mostly fought every single day. When I was only 6 years old I remember her threatening to leave the family because I had forgotten to put on a new roll of toilet paper after I had used the last of the last one. She never did that again though, but this makes me believe she might have had some issues as well. 

The worst was still the constant feeling of being stupid and small. I felt like they always had an opinion about my life and I so often felt like a friendless loser because of their comments on why I am sitting alone at home when the weather is so nice etc. I no longer enjoyed being with my few childhood friends, but then again, it was so hard to make new friends when I wasn't allowed to do and go to the same things as they did. 

They would always ask me about things and complain that I never told them anything about myself. But when I did share my thoughts on things and told them about something that happened at school, they would often not respond at all. I remember countless of ""conversations"" where I share and share from my life, increasingly telling them more and more shocking things and using more extreme language just in order to get a response, but they would simply look away and ignore me. At its worst I just wanted to disappear or really go anywhere else. I felt like I had no voice for so many years and the contrast was so huge with my life at school where the adults always listened and would compliment me all the time.

We have a good relationship now, they are very supportive and I know I am so lucky to have them as parents. This doesn't prevent seemingly irrational extreme emotions that sometimes gets triggered in me though. Seeing my eight year younger brother doing the exact same things that I did his age but completely getting away with it makes me so confused. He sees me as a monster because he witnessed all of the fighting with my parents and despite my best efforts we do not really have a good relationship today. I am happy that they are so obviously proud of him, but I can't get over the fact that they never seemed proud of me. Considering that he might be treated differently because he's a boy and I was a girl makes me especially upset. 

When I was 14 I needed professional help and medications for depression. I won't go into detail about it, but it was really bad. Of course my parents are not to blame for this, but I try to see if it can somehow explain the way I felt they were treating me. 

It is odd that I suffered from depression at such an early age. I am healthy and live a normal life as an adult, but I do have some symptoms that could be explained by abuse. This is part of the reason why I really want to talk to them about all that happened in my early teens. I want the broader picture and I want to know if they know something that they are reluctant to tell me. Even though I am happy my brother doesn't go through the same situation as me, I want to know why they are treating him so differently. However, my parents handle criticism very badly and keep avoiding confrontations. I confronted them with the time they threatened me to call the police for going to that church-event when my brother went to the same event eight years later with no objections from my parents, but they just said they couldn't remember and started talking about other things. My dad tend to just shut down and my mum becomes overly defensive and avoidant if I say anything that could be interpreted as criticism. Should I bring it all up again and demand answers or maybe an apology, or should I just appreciate that we have a good relationship now and let it go?

TL;DR: My parents continuously forced me to stay home from normal teenager-happenings, they never listened to a thing I said  and we would fight all the time. I don't understand why I was treated so differently than my brother and suspect their version of the story is different. I want an explanation or apology, but don't know whether it's worth to bring it up again as we have a good relationship today.",07May2019,1

452,"There’s an elderly woman, Polly, who works the register at the cafeteria where I work. She is beloved by hundreds of staff who work in the complex—she somehow remembers everyone’s names and has a wicked sense of humor.

Polly has shared with me on several occasions that money is always tight. It breaks my heart she has to work at her age, I know she wants to retire so badly. She deserves to retire, and I often think about the fact that if all the staff who love her so much gave a few bucks a month she probably could.

Awhile back I started asking Polly questions that aren’t “how are you?” because she gets sick of answering that one question hundreds of times a day. I’ve asked her what her favorite movie is, where she was born, her favorite place to eat etc. Months ago I asked her what her birthday was and saved it in my phone. 

Her birthday is next week and I want to splurge on Polly. I want to get her something she can actually use, not just a gesture like flowers. I’m thinking a $150 target gift card but cash would give her the most options. But would cash be offensive since I know she’s struggling financially?

I don’t spend a lot of time around men because I go to an all girls college so it’s been awhile since I’ve made guy friends myself. 

There’s a guy at my new job who works there as well, let’s call him Chase. Chase is like super hot and I think he knows it. He’s very confident in the way he speaks and holds himself. 

The very first time I met him he was very friendly and at one point he put his foot up and leaned in to talk to me idk how to describe it. I’m at the cashier counter and he’s on the other side if that helps. And overall being super charming. 

But the past few times I’d be working I’d see him more and more and we’d make small talk but I’ve been trying to keep my distance from him because he intimidates me because of how handsome and confident he is. 

Like I don’t think I could talk to him without looking like an idiot. I’m not very social as it is and I’m trying to work on that. My face gets easily red over anything and if we start talking it’s gonna get obvious my face is red and I don’t want him to think anything of it.

I think he noticed that I’ve been kind of cold lately to him because he doesn’t really look at me as much when he says hi and we don’t interact as much anymore.

The other day he gave one of our coworkers a high five and still had his hand up waiting for me to high five him also and my dumbass brain took forever to process and I’m like “OH” and high fives him back but he didn’t even look at me when I did so it’s all awkward and I hate it

454,"I was betrayed by two of them recently. They began attempting  to cut me off and tell everyone else out of the group to do likewise.

Everyone was with it except two of my friends who wanted to stay neutral. Evantually the traitors were talked into letting me stay in the group since I was a longstanding and influential member of our group. 

Things have been different though. We're all supposed to be friends again but the conversation feels so forced, so fake. We can't talk about the same things anymore it just feels so strange. Even the two that stood by me are siding with everyone else execpt for me.

I was even excluded from an event they all went to. Which kinda stung. Anyways I was basically betrayed and lost all my power in the group, and they're currently doing things without me. So I either want two things now. Be friends again or get them back.

i keep calm but he keeps shouting at me.

459,"So this involves a bit of internet drama. 

I have a friend who I used to always talk to but he's a bit abrasive and is hard to get along with. He has paranoia, when people make jokes, he's quick to get super overly defensive. He barely has friends. 

We both know this other guy on the internet, fairly popular guy most notable for his racism and anti-SJW tirades. He's transphobic (""you're not a man, if you don't know how to change a tire"") and sexist and a bunch of other really dumb shit, but his followers eat it up. 

I despise him, but my friend ***worships*** him. Calling him by his first name, sending him porn and completely being awestruck by the guy. 

Anyways, that guy was in our group chat and we have a transgender person there as well. They both got into it about what it means to be transgender. Myself and a few other people started to speak up about it, and we all ended up going at him about it. But of course, and I *knew* this would happen, he singled me out and made me the reason why he left. Even though other people were arguing with him as well. 

So he made his own group chat.

A few months down the road, he's got a bunch of people in the group chat, including my friend.

Another friend of mine is also in there, but just to see what it's like. 

Queue the bullshit: the guy starts talking about the incident, saying ""that one girl got all mama bear and was a real bitch about it"". (Lol okay asshole...)

Anyways, my """"friend"""" didn't even defend me, he just said ""She hasn't talked to me in a while and to be honest I'm too afraid to know why"". And the guy started talking more shit about me. 

And he was also wrong! I talked to him just a couple of days before he said that!!

I just feel so fucking betrayed. I've always defended him, even when he wasn't around and proper were talking shit about him! It just feels so shitty for him to absolutely provide more shit talking to a guy that was already a cunt, and a racist (called my black friend a n*gger in front of everyone).

460,"I’ll start this off with saying that I never was really too paranoid just walking around my town and/or out in the world until about a year and a half ago. I had my phone stolen right out of my hand while out and about. It sucked, but it wasn’t the end of the world. I’ve noticed that ever since then, my anxiety being outside is getting more unbearable and I’m getting more and more paranoid that people are going to “get me”. Even during the day, I’m constantly looking over my shoulder, my heart feels like it’s going to beat out of my chest, and I can’t ever shake the feeling that I’m being watched and they’re close to taking me. When I’m out shopping, I’m always so scared that something bad is going to happen. 
I don’t know what “bad things” are going to happen and I don’t know who is going to “get me”, but I know that the feeling is there and very real. I don’t know what to do or how to handle being a person in the world again. I don’t want to end up this recluse who never leaves their house ever.

When I graduated high school I sat in the front row and my parents and girlfriend were in the stands. I was the only person who got up that entire graduation to use the restroom. To make matters worse I had to be escorted by a teacher which took a very well liked teacher away from the ceremony as well. I never heard the end of it from my family.

Fast forward to next month. I'm walking the college stage, sitting next to friends, and worried about the scenario repeating itself. Anyone got any tips? Adult diaper success stories? Let me know. Thank you.

469,"I play for a college lacrosse team, we’re traveling to nationals this week, and our coach has given us our roommate partners two days before we were going to fly. *We are now at Nationals*

I got roomed with a girl who, I thought, was my friend 

While we, as a team, discussed the traveling itinerary, I noticed that she was looking across the group to another girl (mouthing) about the roommate situation. I very distinctly hear her saying, “I asked to room with you...” when looking at the other girl and then making really disgusted facial expressions. More non-verbal mouthing ensues, rather than flat out saying, “I’m going get to kill myself” - rolling her eyes and all.

That’s when she notices I’m looking straight at her, then she tries to play it off like she was making conversation about something completely different and sort of laughs like what was just going on wasn’t serious. 

I’ve been in like a 3 day shock, normally I’m a very confrontational person in approaching these situations, but usually I do it with people who aren’t my (supposed) close friends. I feel betrayed and like it’s definitely not worth pursuing because clearly I’m being lied to about how she really feels until I accidentally intercepted that conversation. 

I just want advice on how to act around her, I’m not a spiteful person but I feel like I deserve to give her the cold shoulder? I don’t really want an explanation, that kind of disingenuousness doesn’t really deserve a reasoning, in my opinion.

472,"I am 19 and have been working an apprenticeship job at a tech company for about 2.5 years. The whole apprenticeship is 4 years with a permanent job offered at the end. I attend university once every week as sponsored by my company and will also receive a degree at the end of my apprenticeship. Sounds good right?

Except I hate it. I don’t know why but I feel like my job is making me depressed. I am an extremely underused resource within my organisation. I’ve expressed these feelings to my manager with little to no result so I spend a lot of my time without work, just having to ‘make myself busy’, as my manager would tell me to. As well as this, I don’t get along with anyone in the office. Being an apprentice and only 19, most other workers are 35+ except for one other apprentice who I have issues with on a personal level (although I never let this affect my work or theirs, when there is any)

I get no sense of fulfilment from my job at all and have lost interest in working in this particular field. When I come home at night I’ll just ‘decompress’ which basically means I’ll do nothing until I go to sleep. I think this is because as soon as I leave work I feel this dark cloud engulfing me just knowing that I have to be back there the very next day.

On top of this, the university side of stuff is stressful (understandably) but as I’ve no passion or even like for this job it’s making wonder why I’m bother to keep putting myself through the pain. 

I have around $1,000 of credit card debt that was gained through pre-approvals and bad decisions (this was fucking dumb, believe me I know now)

I’m rambling. I guess my point is I feel stuck. In a job that I hate. With no exit. At 19. I know this really sounds dramatic but I already feel like my life is over. Like is this it?

474,"I’m going on a date with a dude that is a whole decade older than me, this Saturday. We have talked about a month and the emotions have been crazy.

We started off as just friends.. and he was looking for a relationship
But i’m pregnant with a dudes kid who isn’t claiming the kid...
and so now my sensitive ass is heartbroken and doesn’t want to rush into anything rightnow..

So i told the guy, I just wanted to be friends.
But in my mind, I thought he understood “for right now.”

Well anyways, I’ve gone back and forth between telling him that “I wanna be friends,” to “I won’t have you as a friend with benefit because I want a serious relationship now...” to “I think we should just be friends,” to “I think we should stop talking...” to “I wanna fall in love with you.”

LMFAO pregnancy hormones are wilddddd, but this guy thinks I’m special.
And i don’t know why..
I think he is special...
Because he’s literally 29 and doesn’t have meaningless sex...
He is very old fashioned...
I feel like guys are not like that at all anymore..
Hell, I’m not even like that and i’m not even a guy..

I use to be a slut. Like I wanted no part in any type of relationship...
Until I met a guy who told me “to have his babies”
and then he left me.. because “he just isn’t ready yet”

He’s not ready to get into another relationship because the last one (two years ago) “wrecked him”

He caught a case with her... they stole money from her dead aunt and both went to prison (I know.. prince charming right)

Well, me being a dumb slut. I didn’t care who he was, I just wanted to have sex. Lmfao and the dude came in me!!!!!


My entire life. All about to change all because I was a careless bitch.


Well anyways, I met this guy, 10 years older than me. 
(age means nothing to me, i’ve already been with a guy a decade older than me as well)

And he has gone back and forth between “you’re like my little sister” and “you turn me on, i want to pump my dick inside your mouth)

LMFAOAOOAOA super explicit... i know.

But i’m asking for advice. Because I want to meet him.. I need to meet him.

I’m not into online dating (forgot to mention: we met on tinder)

Literally that is not my thing.. I do not do that... I do not search for people to love me lol (because I never wanted love, I just wanted sex, but I’d have sex with guys that I knew in real life)

But I made a tinder in spite of my baby daddy. I was just trying to hurt him.
But I actually met someone.. and I met a lot of people as well, but none of them that I actually talk to anymore.

I want this guy to be in my life.. But i’m scared that I’m too immature and mentally unstable to be with him...
I know that when I give birth.. I can go back on my medication and that will kind help “balance me out.”

But all my past relationships have been toxic.. Because i’m manic depressive and nothing is ever stable in my head..

I’ve never been in a relationship while on medication, so I’m not really sure what that will look like..
Hopefully... better? 

Relationships are hard enough, let alone, add a baby that isn’t yours and a mental health disorder on top... and that’s just the ideal “couples goals...”

Lmfao i’m just kidding.
I’m not “too” worried about it..
I mean I am extremely scared of being played like the last guy..
Literally nothing has ever hurt more than someone changing their mind about you... 
but what makes my situation “worse”
is the fact, a baby cannot be undone.

I can’t “get rid of it.”
It’s going to be a part of my life forever .

I am extremely excited to have this baby already. 
I’m not going to lie, I have been super hormonal and have had mixed emotions of fear, anxiousness, and excitement!

But that is allllll 100% normal.
Rightnow, I have FOUR WEEKS left until i’m full term. And i am feeling “super ready.”

I lowkey want the baby to come out a little bit early. Not premature, but not necessarily full term.

I just miss my old body. 
I am scared that I will hate my body afterwards... because of stretch marks and milks titties...

Pray for me please.
Pray that all works out for me... in the end, I know it will.

But I just want to feel happy...
I just want to be the best mother that I can be.

Thank you for letting me vent.

I'm anxious for my finals and I feel a strong urge to repeat this school year, which isn't a very motivating thought. Plus, I'm ashamed of myself because this whole mess was my own doing.   
I'm doing sciences but for a while now the thought of studying history has plagued my mind. However, even though I love history I can't be sure if this indecision is due to the fact sciences have lost their charm to me, or I'm considering a easier path solely because it leaves me with more free time.   
I feel like this attitude is cyclical and typical of me: after a while of investing myself to something, the smallest flaws get me very unmotivated to keep going. I think the dumb, lazy, irresponsible philosophy I've unconsciously been employing is: if I'm deliberately not giving my all then I can't know how badly I'd have done and I can't be held responsable for how bad I end up doing. I just can't believe how far into the clouds my head has been, how carefree I've been...

483,"I think I might be overreacting. I know the title sounds weird but he's into really rough sex and can't cum otherwise. He always wants to have sex even though I don't feel like it or I give off a not feeling it vibe and he keeps pushing it. Certain situations are starting to not have me enjoy sex with him at all anymore. There was a time though I was playing on my switch and he started pulling down my pants and just stuck his dick in me. I told him I was trying to play the game and he kept going I guess he didn't get the idea I'm uninterested. I guess I don't make clear either by saying no but what happen was he took it out and I thought he was stopping but instead he decided to stick it my anus instead. I was so unprepared for that I literally tried to push him off and had to yell out stop that hurts and doesn't feel good before he actually ""stopped."" He just slowed down and thrusted few more times before stopping and asking if I wanted him to keep going...and he wanted to see if I could win with his dick in me and I said no and I got up walked away after that. That situation and others makes me not want to have sex with him because I'm starting to get afraid of what he's going to do. He also will randomly wake me up with his dick near my mouth. I tell him I'm trying to sleep and he starts fondling my boobs and trying to wake me in other ways. There was a time where he was going rough and came out and tried to go back in fast and miss and got outside my vagina and I started bleeding for two days afterward. He still wanted to continue even after that. I don't know how to bring this up to him. I starting to hate myself for not making it clear and assuming he knows I'm uninterested. I'm really dreading having sex now. I'm trying to avoid it at all cost. I don't know how to bring this up to him at all. I never been in a situation like this with any other guy.

485,"Hi, around a month ago I decided to write a negative review on Google about something that happened 5 years ago. Long story short, I went to the vets as my dog was very sick and had to be put down. Not only did they berate me for not taking him in sooner as he was suffering so much, they also asked me insensitive and slightly racist questions whilst my dog was lying there dying. Till this day, 5 years later, this memory still flashes through my mind and I am filled with anger that they did that. Which is why I decided to post now, as 5 years ago I wasn't really old enough and writing online reviews wasn't as big yet.

Flash forward to now. I got a call from the owner/ manger of the vet basically asking me to remove the review as those vets are no longer working there and there is nothing they can do about it any more. I considered it for a bit and even when on the review but as soon as i re read my review I was angry and hurt again.",07May2019,1
487,"It seems like when I disagree with people (specifically my girlfriend or a particular friend), they seem to think that I think that I don’t think I could ever be wrong, simply because I don’t agree. I will give reasons that I think are logical or that experts in whatever field I am talking about think but it usually doesn’t seem to be enough. 

I don’t know if this is my fault because I like to think I do a lot of research on topics I engage with, so I generally like to think that I know what I’m talking about. If I don’t know about something, I will say I don’t know because I haven’t done enough research. 

I don’t think I know everything. If someone gives me a good reason to not believe in something that I do, I will change my opinions. I just don’t know how to tell people that I think their reasoning is bad without seeming stubborn or seeming like I’d never change my opinion.

494,"I can really not talk to anyone about this so I'm ranting to all of you out there. For some backround, I am a women's rights activist working with victims of domestic violence for quite a while. I am too embarrassed to share this with my friends and family, because I am afraid no one will hear me out and everyone will tell me to leave him right away.

I have been with my boyfriend for 5 months. We have been practically living together since the first month, as he spends most nights at my place or I at his. He is the most thoughtful, kind, sweet, and loving person I have ever met in my life, there has been no violence whatsoever and he has no history of domestic/partnership violence either. We were ridiculously happy throughout the 5 months we've been together.

However, we both love to party and have been doing it together as well. We drink and we take the occasional drug when we go out. It's nothing too heavy, just some stuff to unwind. Last Sunday, we went to a festival and had the greatest time ever. We drank A LOT, and took a lot of cocaine. 

At the festival he became a bit angry at \*nothing\* and when we came home it escalated. He beat me with his fists and his hands, and throw a broomstick at me. He got on top of me and slapped me in the face until I started bleeding. At this point I had ABSOLUTELY no clue what was going on so he started accusing me of cheating and talking to my ex at the festival. He choked me 2-3 times until I almost passed out, and threw beer on my head. I live on the 10th floor, so at some point he climbed on the balcony ledge and almost fell if I hadn't pulled him down. It was INSANE, and I was afraid for my life. After he calmed down he started saying terrible offensive things. 

We both got tired at some point and passed out in different rooms. The next morning when he realised what had happened, he started crying, sobbing, apologizing, swearing he doe snot remember 90% of the things that had happened. Luckily I took pictures of my blood and my face, and the stuff he threw at me the night before. He confessed that he didn't even see me talking to my ex, and that it was a completely made up excuse to justify his violence.He swears it must have been the drugs, swears that something like this could never happen again. He has been crying for 2 days straight now, begging me to forgive him. He has accepted the fact that I have to break up with him, but guarantees me 100% that this could NEVER happen again, especially since he is vowing to quit all drugs. Again, he has been the sweetest, kindest, most loving person I have met in my entire life so I am inclined to believe him that it was the drugs and that. 

I have no idea what to do.

Tl'dr: My loving, sweet, kind boyfriend with no history of violence beat me up while on coke. He swears he will never do smth like this again. I have no idea what to do.",07May2019,0

she politely said no, and that she just wants to keep our conversations at work.. even after knowing i just wanted to get to know her casually,
not really a date at this point in time.

about a week later i cleared this up to her, and she politely declined.. i was very conscious to let her know respect is important to me, and she said she never thought i was disrespectful.

One night I was a bit hurt, because Jm super guarded and it took 7 months or so for me to even open up to her and have a conversation with her unrelated to work, just getting to know her.

she seemed to be interested in me on some level, during these 7 months, and the conversation went well, and so i just texted her one day indicating i was hurt, but that i respect her decision.

she sent a long text and said how i was only making this worse, and to stop texting her.. she however also stated how she has never felt disrespected by me.

i apologized for making her uncomfortable, and ever since have been very conscious to make sure she feels safe/comfortable and respected by me.. which has led to some awkward texts about me just clearing up potential misunderstandings etc..

things were awkward at work for a few days, then quickly went back to normal, she’d ask me questions (we work in different departments).

she still comes up to me and approaches me casually, things are normal.

does any of this sound like harassment, or just me being annoying?

502,"\*throwaway account

Sara has been my sister in law for over a decade, she is a few years older and married to the older brother of my husband. we met when I was still a teenager while I was dating my husband and a few months before she married hers. She's always been very judgmental toward me, and treated me like she was smarter and just better in general. She is a know-it-all and a one-upper, and in the beginning when I was basically still a child, I was very careful to respect her ""place"" in the family, even though I saw those traits in her. Every LOVES her, but she always came off as very phony to me, super sweet to the in-laws, but talks about how much she hates them behind their backs. I'm a very blunt person and it takes certain people longer to warm up to me, because I'm so forward with my thoughts. Sara really changed that in me when it came to interacting with her and that side of the family. Pretty early on she would tell me about how her entire family hated me and how our father-in-law  (extreme misogynist) would talk to her about convincing my then boyfriend now husband to dump me. She would often correct me, tell me how I should behave, what I could and couldn't say, etc. It was so stressful to be around her and I was young and dumb so I kept trying to get on her good side. What is it about certain dynamics where it's just assumed that one party is responsible for appeasing the other? Anyway.

When I was pregnant with my first child, and it was still private, my husband told my father in law in private, but she worked with them and eavesdropped. She told her entire family and at a funeral we attended, I was congratulated for the pregnancy I didn't know anyone knew about. She confronted me for lying to her grandmother and lying right to her face. At a funeral. When I thought an old lady I didn't know was confused about something. It was terrifying. She later called me and told me she thought we were closer than that and everyone knew because my belly had gotten fat anyway.

It was shit like this all the time, I try so hard to be close because they have 2 children and we have 2 children and I LOVE their kids like my own and I love how close the cousins are. But she continues being a know-it-all and continues one-upping. She still works with my husband and even though he is her boss she treats him similarly. She often reminds me of how much she gets paid to work for father-in-law and how important she is to the company and how it just can't go on without her very important presence. She does light bookkeeping.  My father-in-law thinks she is heaven sent so nobody can do anything about it. I worked there when I was first pregnant but he fired me because he didn't want to find me a position that didn't have me working with lead solder. I invite them to spend time with us and usually they act like they hate every second of it. I asked her once why they never invite us to do anything with them and she said that ""because I don't want someone to say yes even if they mean no or don't want to"" and I guess that told me why they seemed so miserable around us all the time. I guess some people just know how to say no when they mean no.

I keep trying to have a bond with her. If I ask her to go to lunch, or get pedicures, she says it will hurt her friends feelings if they find out (friends she often tells me she hates and only spends time with them because she feels too guilty to say no) so she can just join me and sit there while I shop or get my toes done, etc. Our husbands have really drifted apart and my husband has noticed that his brother is more and more like Sara all the time. He used to be so easy going and good spirited. Recently I noticed an upgrade they made in their powder room and she said I saw it before and said the same thing. I said I didn't remember that I'm pretty sure that's the first time I saw it. And she started yelling at me and telling me how ridiculous it was that I couldn't remember and I was wrong, god she made me feel so stupid and he just stood there and watched his wife berate me over something ridiculous. Later she made a joke about my hair but I was sensitive at that point and she asked me why she's not allowed to kid around with me.

They adopted 2 dogs over 7 years ago, and didn't like the name of one of them so they shortened it to the second half of the name. But the second half of the name is the very nickname we use for our daughter. I of course tried to suggest maybe other names that sounded similar to not confuse the dog (at this point I was still terrified of her and couldn't share my feelings), but no they decided to go with it. They think it's cute so they decided to change the dogs name to what we call our human child. Now the dog is all but dying and I constantly have to see updates and it just feels like a knife in the gut all the time.

I've tried talking to her about it but she always turns it around and makes me feel wrong and like I didn't understand, she was just helping me, etc.

Am I overthinking this? Have I spent well over a decade feeling sick to my stomach and walking on eggshells for nothing? I still love their kids and my husband still works with them. I feel so pathetic and alone and isolated from the family. My husband is really sweet and supportive of me. He has stuck up for me plenty of times. I just wanted a close extended family, aside from this stuff we really all have so much in common and if she didn't treat me this way she would be so great and we could be so close.

514,"Hey guys.

My life continues to spiral downwards. Here’s the story.

I have been going through a lot lately. Like a lot. Let me tell you about my previous assault story first. So a while ago my girlfriend dumped me very harshly. Honestly I’m still not over it and it’s been months. All of this stuff is in my post history if you guys want proof. Anyways so basically after we broke up she was blackmailing me and I had to give her money every month. So one time when I was there her new boyfriend was saying stuff to me so I tackled him. He easily threw me off and punched me a few times. I grabbed his leg and he hit his head on the table and busted it open. I jumped up and punched him as many times as I could but it wasn’t really doing much and as he was trying to get up my ex girlfriend ran up and kicked me in the nuts. Then he punched me until I was basically passed out. We all got arrested and are waiting for court dates. On top of that there’s just been so much more going on.

So yesterday I was at work at my job at a grocery store I will not name. I was on break and a customer was trying to ask me a question but I couldn’t hear him because I had headphones in. So he grabbed my arm as I was walking by and yanked me towards him. Now I had no idea what was going on I just thought someone was attacking me so I whipped around and grabbed his shirt collar and slammed him against the shelf while ripping out my headphones. He pushed me back and slammed me against the other shelf across the isle and then we got into kinda a pushing match until he put me into a headlock and body slammed me into the ground and followed it up with an elbow to my nose. He then lost his shit screaming at me telling me that he should call the cops for me attacking him. 

My manager knows that I’ve been going through a lot and he watched the security footage with the man and told the man that if he would like him to call the cops on him for attacking his employee he is fine with that. The man finally decided that he wasn’t going to get police involved. My manager said even though it wasn’t exactly my fault and that he knows what I’m going through that I’m on very thin ice and that I’m lucky no one else was in the isle cause I would’ve been fired if another customer saw. He said I need to pay more attention to my surroundings. 

I don’t see how any of that is my fault? AITA?",07May2019,1

524,"I’ll try tldr this at the bottom and am on mobile so ignore any mistakes. 

Also ain’t really a reddit guy so if I screw up any reddiquette advanced apologies.

So I started a band with this guy a few years ago when i got out of college and immediately things went sour when someone pressed charges against him concerning an alleged rape. However I did know that the day that it supposedly happened that he was with me so I found it very hard to believe. Turns out it was fake which was good for us but I think something flipped in his head at that point. 

He started convincing me to hire and fire people in the band on a wim putting off gigs and recording sessions if he didn’t wanna do it but would call me lazy to everyone he knew if I didn’t wanna do a 12 hour shift followed by an 8 hour session followed by another 12 shift within like 48 hours. 

Eventually while doing a string of shows he lied to some of the other bands saying he had to leave because we were making him. He left straight after our opening set. The bassist and I stayed for the next few bands but left before the headliners due to us being knackered. Next thing we know we’re getting blasted on social media for various reasons including leaving early and dragging their sound tech away from the gig. (I realise these bands were lied to by this guy so hold no grudges against them.) 

After this I have been told that I am; physically abusive towards people, Have threatened to sue people and even have links to organised crime all of which I am pretty sure aren’t true (I work in a kitchen where everyone is pretty physical towards each other but have never raised a fist in anger, I know my way around contract law and have called some people’s bluff when they threatened legal action against me but do not have the money to even try sue someone and I know a dealer or two but everyone does at my age) also two ex band mates have had to defend me on several occasions (apparently this guy has accused these other guys to) 

I know I have to get rid of this guy but he has his claws in every part of the music industry and probably could destroy my credibility beyond repair. So what do I do

I am now in my second year of algebra while the rest of my class (besides two other ap students who don't seem to mind) is in geometry. I have recently found out that due to the fact that I took a high school class in junior high, it did not count as a credit, and I now have to take pre-calculus my junior year. This class is usually optional, but I am required to take it or I cannot graduate. I have also been informed that due to the fact that it is a junior high course, I can't simply take the class that I skipped to get the credit. So, basically, a high school class can count as a junior high class, but a junior high class can't count as a high school class. I have been struggling in math lately, and don't want to take an incredibly difficult class that is usually completely optional. I especially will not be able to pursue my other interests, ones which I may actually use, if I take this very taxing class and also wish to maintain both my sanity and a good sleep schedule. I am in dire need of advice for what to do in this situation, as I am afraid that my future may be crippled by the fact that I will have all my time eaten up by this class.

535," I'm a junior in high school. So I've been playing the trumpet since the 5th grade through my school and it's been a passion of mine since. I am involved with pretty much everything band-related. I do marching band, pep band, and I'm in both of our jazz bands, and I earned the spot of next years marching band section leader. All of this is on top of symphonic band (the band class) which I had to audition to get into. I've always loved making music, but now I'm facing a scheduling dilemma. So for next year, my school is offering one single AP Physics class, and as my shitty luck would have it it's the same period as band. I'm planning on going to college to study marine engineering and naval architecture without a music minor, so the class largely doesn't benefit me per se. AP Physics on the other hand, lines up perfectly with my desired major, and since I'm trying to earn the NROTC scholarship, I wouldn't have time to do band stuff in college assuming I get it. So for my future, I recognize that AP Physics is the more academically benefitting class, but I've been looking forward to finally being section leader, and up to this point I've put in countless of hours of work into actually getting good at the instrument, I've never taken private lessons most of my ability comes from my own advancement and work. I dont want to make it feel like all of this work would be for nothing, just so I can take some science class in place of it. I have the option to scrap AP Physics and do AP Chem instead, although I'm not certain if chemistry would be that beneficial. I also could drop down and take regular physics with a bunch of freshmen, but I'm not exactly ready to just cut out a weighted class. I've been giving more thought to AP Chem, but shit that's a hell of a lot of work for just one class. I also need the science credit to get into the college I want to (although i do have the science credits to graduate).

&amp;#x200B;

Our father taught us the work/earn something the hard way with hustling and working as a way of instilling work ethic and reward system. It works for me as I still struggle but I know it is earned, whereas just given is bullshit. Which leads me to this advice subreddit.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So one day I am working at a job site get a random visit from my brother during lunch he has some shit to talk about. We chew the fat about his kid's graduation and he mentions he is going to break off his son an Iphone X whatever the fuck?! newest joint. I said sure man kid seems like he has good head on his shoulders. For graduation that would be a great ideal gift.  As I am going to go back to work and take down a few phone numbers he mentions hey man your phone looks busted and I am like yea work related issue and screen is cracked but still works, **he asked me hey you want this old Iphone 7+ I have?**  Now mind you I don't like asking for shit unless offered or I say hey let me buy it from you......?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So the offer came to me a few weeks ago and my phone is taking a shit hence why some grammatical errors and english isn't my 1st language.  I tried to ask my brother really subtly like hey man you go that phone?  I could really use it and I have cash money right now..... He ignored me at first then as I was leaving his house he started acting like a bitch when I pressed the issue like hey you offered it to me and I could really need that now! He said we'll talk about it.......

When I finally get to the storage shed my shit is either gone possibly sold on Ebay or given to his friends kids.  Which I have muscled from them and explained that it was mine in the first place.

543,"I'm 22 and from India. I have been working at an MNC for over an year. Last month, a fair &amp; tall girl joined one of the teams on a different floor but was on my floor for a few days (probably while she got the required accesses). I saw her and felt she was really cute. (&amp; I'm quite tall, so instantly attracted to tall girls). Her dressing sense was exquisite and I planned to strike a convo by complimenting her on that.

Last week, I had the chance to talk to her while she was leaving in the evening. I introduced myself, complimented her and said if we she was looking for new friends, we could catch up over a cup of coffee. She smiled, said thanks and sure &amp; asked me which floor I was on. I told her and we said bye to each other &amp; left. She was away for a few days after that happened.

Today, I saw her when I was having lunch but couldn't find her anywhere after I was done with lunch. So, a little later, I went to my desk, opened skype, found her name (pretty unique name, found just one) and texted her, ""Hey, Rahul here. We spoke last week!"" (Probably a bad first message but I couldn't think of anything else. Thanks to my lack of experience in approaching/speaking with stranger girls.) She immediately went away and was away for 20+ minutes when I had to go somewhere. And unfortunately, got no reply since.

The most probable reason: she ignored me

The second most probable reason:  (This one is just to keep optimistic side alive) Skype for business sometimes does weird things when you receive a message just when you go away. It happened to me a few times and saw it happen to others as well.)

546,"If you were to have asked me a couple of weeks ago I would have said my life was doing great.  I recognize now I was in complete denial and it took me losing my job for stupid corporate politics, which I suck at, to really see it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 42 years old, divorced five years, with three teenage kids.  I have an enormous child support payment, a mortgage payment on a house I bought fifteen years ago, and student loans I did not forsee until my ex demanded the divorce only a few weeks before I finished grad school and vastly increasing my financial burden beyond what I had expected.

&amp;#x200B;

The good:  I have a really solid career behind me.  I have good relationships with my kids, whose mother bought a house down the street.  I even have a decent relationship with my ex.

&amp;#x200B;

The bad:

Financial:  I have done nothing but work extremely long hours for the last five years to try to pay all my debts.  And any new debts are getting neglected.  The ex took most of the little savings we used to have and I haven't been able to build any more.  I have multiple six figures of debt between child support, college, and house.

Career:  I lost my job quite unexpectedly two weeks ago.  Since I was doing job functions waay above where my career had been before, the only things that show on my resume for the last year or two are things that (a) I'd rather not do anymore, and (b) show me as unqualified to do anything else.  Even in the hottest economy in fifty years, I'm having a hard time getting companies to call me back.  If things go poorly, I am able to support myself for the next two months only.

Family:  My kids are all depressed for different reasons and need counseling.  My recently widowed mother is depressed and needs counseling.  Hell, my ex is depressed and needs counseling.  And at this point, so am I.  I feel like I've been carrying this whole crowd financially and emotionally for years and I cannot and will not abandon my kids.  The only person I never had to carry was my dad ... until he got ill, and had to take care of him for his last two months before he died, and he died really hard.

Health:  I've dealt with chronic illness since a major medical disaster ten years ago.  That plus me getting older equals a guy who just can't work like he used to.  My doctor says I'm starting to develop heart problems.  Due to other medical issues it's hard for me to exercise.  I try to stay healthy by eating a good diet that works well for me but that's all I can do ... and that's not cheap.

Relationships outside family:  Yeah, right.  I haven't had any time for friends or girlfriends or anything.  As a kid my dad did everything in his power to alienate me from my mom's family, and simultaneously my mom did everything in her power to do the same with my dad's family.  I barely know any of my relatives and live hundreds of miles from them in any case.  I have no siblings.  My wife hated my friends and so over time I lost them all.  My support network hovers at zero.  My ex has literally become my best friend, which is crazy weird and kind of depressing for both of us since friends is the most either of us want.

The ugly:

My house, after years of focusing on work and little else, has turned into a pile of crap.  I don't have the resources or the energy or the help to keep it up to date.  I basically live in my master bedroom suite.

&amp;#x200B;

My dilemma:  I am thinking about selling my house.  I have enough equity at this point to pay off a lot of my student debt, maybe even all of it if I'm lucky.  It would take a tremendous amount of financial pressure off me as well as jettisoning this huge house that I only really need when my kids are here.  And then I could either (a) go live with my mother for a year, (b) go get an apartment, (c) hope for the best, find a high paying job in the same range I left really fast (unlikely), and then do side work on top of that.

Problems with the first two options:  (a) I don't want to live with my mother at my age.  There are reasons I moved out when I was 17.  Moving back there feels like ultimate failure (even if she'd be thrilled).  But it gives the best financial option.

(b) I don't want to move away from my kids.  Right now I'm down the street.  If I move to my mother's or get an apartment I would lose the easy access I have now.  This is the worst pain point of any option I have.  My kids are everything to me and I can't remotely understand fathers who abandon their kids.  Even if I'm only moving an hour away, how would they stay with me?  Their schools are here and I wouldn't have bedrooms for them anymore.

The problem with the third option (c) is that it sounds like death.  I spent over two decades on my career working my ass off and even working harder every year, especially after the divorce.  In the last six months I had to take care of my ailing father on top of insane hours, bury him, and then immediately jump back into work projects 12-14 hours a day including weekends.  I'm exhausted.  I think if I take option (c) I will die young.

I'm trying to find other creative solutions including (d) starting a side business (which will take too long to pay off in order to pay my bills) or (e) even moving in with my ex, renting her spare room for a year as a purely for-the-kids relationship.  That would have solved a lot of my logistical and emotional pain points but she shot it down and she's probably right, it would be a disaster.

I know I've made some bad choices in life but those are all behind me and there's no point in me thinking about what might have been if I'd made better decisions along the way.  I just want to do what's best for my kids and for me.

I don't know if anyone has any thoughts or advice or if anybody even bothered to read this thing.  I've tried to do everything right in my life, living clean and virtuously, and I'm left with not a lot to show for it but three depressed kids.  I'm not suicidal.

Me and my daughters mother have been apart since almost my daughters birth due to infidelity on my behalf. We had a rough relationship then as I had a rough childhood that she was apart of. I lost my parents and lived in friends growing up.  She was there for me but I wasn’t for her. Since the beginning of my daughters life I have tried to be involved as much as possible. Till I lost my house in a hurricane an decided to join the military. The military enables me to support her on a constant basis the only issue is the distance. I live in Germany, and to be honest as selfish as this might sound the break from the toxicity I grew up around was the healthiest thing I have ever done. I am legit in a position to make 6 figures when I get home and became a beautiful adult with discipline and compassion. I financially support my daughter and whenever her mother needs extra money including $1000 here or there for help that they need I am happy to do so. 

 The problem lies with her attitude to me. She is very emotional and has a very stressful life. I can always tell when she decides to start huge fights dictating how available my daughter is to me and brings up the past constantly. It’s been 9 years. She’s married with two more kids. She constantly makes me feel like shit for being so distant. The big one now is I met a German girl three years ago and we got married through the court so we can start the paper work on her citizenship. We announced are engagement but left out the court stuff because we didn’t want to disrespect anyone on both sides of the family. She found out through mail and kept me from talking to my daughter for a month. My wife is extremely excited to be part of her life and when we Skype is involved even to the point where she talks to my daughters mother. As far as how my daughter is being raised I would say it’s mediocre. Poor diet, spoiled but is taken care. I do not criticize or try to discipline because I’m not in a position to do so I respect her mother so much and her husband for what they do. I am however prepared to fight in court when I get out of the service to see my daughter. Im going through some rough times emotionally here atm due to some military stuff and she just started again and with the marriage stuff. I’m heartbroken because I love her and her family and just want to be a blessing to them like they are me (sometimes).  She won’t let my daughter. One to my marriage (which I won’t fight) and constantly forgets the times she cries to me about how hard her life is.

550,"If not enough info I will provide more if asked. 
My best friend called me late last night telling me she had something to tell me. She seemed excited but she was making me nervous. After a brief back and forth she sent me an ultrasound- and I immediately started crying. 

She has PCOS and has suffered through afew miscarriages. Her and her husband have been trying for a while to get pregnant and it just hasnt been happening. I was overjoyed obviously, and immediately started talking about all the things I wanted to get her and wanting to know how far along she was and when she was going to tell her husband etc. 

She wasn't reacting... Normally. I guess. As we got deeper into the conversation she started to seem a little too dismissive about it. Didnt want me to send her gifts, didnt want to talk about it too much, wasnt gushing about it. Just off. 

That made me look at the ultrasound again and it just looked fake, for a better lack of words. It didnt have a hospital listed, the font and color of the text were a little off where her name and the date were. I didnt want to doubt her but I needed to be sure. I reverse image searched it and there it was, an ultrasound of a 9 week old puppy. 

I was in shock. This woman is the aunt of my kids. She was there for me when I discovered that I was pregnant with twins, and when I ended up losing one. I suffered an extreme mental and emotional break while I was pregnant due to this and she was there for me. 
I'm honestly really disturbed that she would do this but I dont know what to do about it. 

As far as I know she has never lied to me about anything before, this is genuinely out of character for her. I don't know if shes going through something and using this as a way to cope, if she wants attention or what. 

Am I supposed to confront her? Am I supposed to keep quiet and pretend I don't know? Should I ask her if she's okay and let her know that I'm here for her if she needs to talk? Her mom messaged me telling me the news and I just couldn't bring myself to respond. What do I do? I don't want to lose her but this seems extreme to me.

551,"Hi all,

Hoping for some guidance, but I think writing this all down will be a useful exercise in itself. I’m absolutely miserable at my job that is objectively pretty ideal in a lot of ways. Honestly, it’s tough to say whether this job is making me unhappy, or whether I’m just depressed and would view any job through the same distorted lens. This is going to be a very long post, but if anyone is willing to weigh in on any of my thoughts, I’d be so grateful. 

For background, I have Economics and Spanish degrees from a top 10 university (decent GPA, but not outstanding -3.76). I participated in a number of extracurriculars (music director of various performance groups, debate team, received research grants that funded summer economic research in Latin America, etc.). 

I spent the summer before my senior year interning at a large asset management firm. I accepted a return offer and went to work for a department where I essentially entered trade orders for mutual funds all day. I LOVED my team but did not find this highly transactional work rewarding, so I moved offices and departments after about a year to become a client facing associate in our ultra high net worth area. This move has been positive in some ways, but not in others.

Pros:
-Well-compensated for work that is fairly easy (75k base + bonuses + overtime. I’m working a ton of overtime this year and will likely clear six figures. This is in SF, though, so I’m not rolling in it by any means). I also get automatic bumps each year that tend to keep pace with inflation. 

-Good benefits

-Very solid company. Just about the best name you can get in the industry (not a ton of name recognition outside the industry, though). No debt whatsoever and layoffs are almost unheard of.

-I enjoy the client facing part of my role. I get to directly interact with some of the most interesting and influential people out there.

Cons:
-The company overall has a great culture. My current team does not. I was bullied by a few peers when I first onboarded to the point that I had daily panic attacks in the bathroom. The bullying has mostly stopped, but the same few people constantly shout me down in meetings and take every opportunity to remind me that I’m young and therefore inferior (I’m 24, most in my role are early 30s). The nicer teammates are still self-important and change-averse. This is a stark contrast to my last team that fostered a highly collaborative culture. 

-Most of the work is not intellectually engaging and involves a lot of admin work which I do not enjoy. No individual task is challenging or really makes me think. All difficulty derives from the amount of tasks we are expected to balance. Unfortunately, it’s hard for me to say whether more challenging work will make me feel more engaged, as I have a sneaking suspicion that I might just be impossible to satisfy. 

-We are currently working on a massive project that has us working nights and weekends through September or October. I’m enjoying the overtime pay, but my life has basically become eat/sleep/work. I have no energy to devote to building skills or thinking about what I want out of my career. I also have a chronic illness that is worsened by stress which has landed me in the hospital twice this year. Despite being aware of my situation, managers still expect me to work nights and weekends to help other teams who are not pulling their weight even though I’m ahead on my own workload. I would do just about anything for my old team, but sacrificing my well-being for people who are unkind to me is a tough pill to swallow. Theoretically work/life balance will be good again after this project is over. 

-I am in a small satellite office and cannot move away from SF any time soon for personal reasons, so growth opportunities are limited.

-No work from home. A major downside given my chronic illness. I’m often unable to leave the house without access to a bathroom and am forced to use up 100% of my sick days when I could easily fully contribute from home if not for this policy. 

Am I an idiot to desperately want out of this fairly cushy job? I feel I’m smart and trainable, but my skills and experience are limited (i.e no SQL, python, data modeling, or management consulting experience which just about every job in the bay seems to require). I have a few half-baked ideas, but I’m genuinely terrified that leaving this job will be a huge mistake. A few things I’ve thought about:

-Law School. My dad is an attorney so I have a decent sense that I’d like the work. However, I’m concerned I wouldn’t be able to handle the lack of work/life balance given my physical and mental health issues. I’m also told this likely won’t be a robust job market in the future due to advances in AI.

-Take a few months off of work to work on my mental/physical health and skill gaps. Would ideally invest time in thinking about what I want to do next and take some basic data analysis courses so I’m at least minimally literate in SQL, python, etc. However, quitting a job while paying Bay Area rent seems unwise. I thankfully have no debt, so this option isn’t entirely off the table. 

-Try to find an entry level non-engineer role at a tech company. I love the idea of being somewhere where I can learn at a faster pace. I don’t have a lot of experience with data analytics which seems to be required for most interesting jobs in the area. I do learn quantitative skills fairly easily (econometrics was my favorite class in undergrad and I’ve always enjoyed math), but I don’t have any work experience to back that up. I’m also worried I’m not suited to a high growth world that demands all of my time given my health issues. With a recession likely in the next few years, I also worry about losing health insurance as many companies in the area have unsustainable levels of debt and will fold when funding isn’t as readily available. I would also likely work more hours for less to start. Is this a worthy tradeoff for growth potential given I’m young and can take more risk? 

-MBA - Expensive, but might give me the reset and network I need. Would ideally like to have an idea of my end game before I invest six figures, though. 

-Literally anything else that sounds interesting. 

Anyone with more experience or wherewithal than me have any thoughts? I’m truly so overwhelmed with finding my path forward.",07May2019,1
553,"Ok so my wife and I live in Vietnam, and we recently borrowed a load of money to build a house. The architect (the thief) we contracted had basically hoarded our money instead of giving it to the builders; lying to our faces saying the builders had been paid whilst telling the builders a pack of lies to keep them on the job.
Fastforward to now, the house is built, the thief has been exposed and we got some money back (not inc. the $10,000.) Regardless, the builders are still owed about $2500 and they're hounding my wife and I to pay.
We sat down with them and the theif a few months ago and made an agreement for the thief to pay gradually over 6 months. 4 months later... nothing. 

So what should I do?
1) Pay the builders myself and let the thief off the hook.
2) Go to court.*
3) Organise relations and hired goons, and go f*ck him up.
4) Something I haven't thought of.

*Law enforcement in Vietnam is notoriously useless for foreigners; especially in matters like this. If we took him to court, we'd likely just lose more paying corrupt officials who can't do a lot anyway (try and change my mind.)

2 months ago we decided we should break up, in those 2 months we kept being exactly the same as before we just weren't officially together, we still talked everyday and had sex every time we saw each other. 
Last week she met at work someone she says she fell in love with in a second, when they met she already started to go after him. I had my birthday in a few days ago and she didn't talk to me on my birthday besides sending a messege and the next day she didn't talk to me at all. So I gave her a day to think because I didn't know what was going on and she said she wants to stop meeting and talking and for me to leave her life. I was instantly heart broken, my world was shattered to bits and I just can't describe this feeling, feels like the world is ending and I really just want to die. She and I couldn't really stop talking and I don't want to stop talking but she was already on a date with him and she says she had fun and loved being with him.
Today we talked again and she told me she loves him, I understand her feeling and I understand what she wants but I can't bring my self to let her go and live her alone, Im desperatley in love with her and she is still in love with me too.
I understand she must discover for herself what is being with someone else and also the excitement of being with a new person that she says she loves, still I can't bring my self to be mature and just leave, it distracts me from studying for my degree and Im just depressed all day.

556,"We got a new employee recently at my work. Admittedly, she's difficult to work with. She doesn't have much of a filter, so things she says can come off as rude at times. Regardless, me and my coworkers have been training her and trying to do the best we can. Yesterday, my coworker, A went to the higher-ups and I believe she was trying to be honest about how hard it has been to work with new employee recently. At one point she mentioned to the higher ups she was talking with someone that said the reason she was hired was because the new employee and higher ups previously knew each other. She stated to higher ups she could not remember who, but that maybe it was me and coworker B that mentioned it. 

Well, the higher ups pulled me and coworker B as well as new employee into the office and talked about how it's not ok to spread gossip in the office. However, the first time I even heard this gossip was yesterday in the office. I didn't do it, and I told them I did not do that and that it was actually the first time hearing it. That was the same for coworker B as well. Higher ups believed we did it and talked with us for thirty minutes. Coworker A later apologized and said she mixed us up with someone from a different shift since she spends so much time with us. 

Admittedly, I'm not completely innocent in the fact I have complained about New employee to close coworkers of mine after shifts, however, I have never said or even heard anything about that gossip, though.

What do I do? New employee left early yesterday because she was upset. And I'm angry at higher-ups, coworker A, and as well as myself for complaining in the first place. Should I leave it alone? I talked to new employee yesterday and apologized for everything. Coworker A has apologized to me, but I'm still upset for getting pulled into something I was never a part of in the first place.

Last week we decided to have a break which lasted only 4 days and things were going great until we had another problem. I tried talking to her about it but she's been ghosting me since. I was talking to one of our mutual friends and I saw her run across my campus and go to the restroom. She texted her sister and her sister texted me saying to let our friend talk to her because I'm giving her anxiety. The way she's been acting makes me feel like she doesn't want to keep being friends. Or she's overwhelmed with the problem and doesn't know how to deal with it.

561,"I’m 15 and from a very traditional and conservative Asian family, relationships are seen as disgraceful and tarnishing of the reputation of the entire family and especially at my young age too it’s seen as a very bad thing. I met a boy just a bit over two years ago and we’ve been on a relationship for almost a year and a half now. He’s come to be not only my boyfriend but my best friend too and I’m afraid that if I tell my parents or if they find out anyway they’ll break all our communications and I’ll lose a lot of my freedom. My parents keep a very close eye on me and regularly go through my phone, I’m honestly really surprised we haven’t been caught out yet and frankly, I’m tired of keeping it a secret.

I have enough money to cover my bills for this gap, granted it will be very tight but it’s doable. I’m not sure about getting another small job (like waitressing) in this time frame only because it only amounts to 4 weeks and at the start date of my new job, I’d have to quit whatever small job I had started.

567,"Hi guys! I’m in a bit of a situation here and not sure how to handle it. I (m 25) recently moved from Romania to U.K. for studies. I did 3 years of uni in wales and now I moved to England. Due to moving, me and my girl of 3 years had to break up (mutually, we’re still friends) and now I’m all alone in a city I don’t know anyone. I work with disabled people atm and my only conversations are with co-workers and mostly related to job. I used to call my 3 friends from wales and talk to them (3 romanian girls) but they have their own life and I can’t bother them all the time. My family is split in other countries as well. I do talk to my parents almost daily but it’s not the same with friends. I am anxious about clubbing and never really enjoyed drinking. I’ve been taking some pills for depression which worked for a bit until the effects faded away and resulted in anhedonia, so I stopped taking pills. I’m hooked on weed and it’s kinda the only thing that I still enjoy doing. I lost the notion of time as I work almost daily so it makes no difference for me if its weekend or not. I did some stupid things in my first year of uni which resulted in my friends from Romania ignoring me and making fun of me so I forgot about them. I have no friends and I don’t know how to make some friends. I feel like I’m at that age where if you don’t have friends already you’re kinda fked. 
I’ve never been so lonely before and it hurts really bad. I have nobody with who I can talk about my feelings as my folks don’t understand depression/anxiety. These things I would’ve talked with my ex girl but now she’s gone... I might sound childish but please keep in mind that I’m in this boat all alone and I support myself independently. To add another drop in the glass, I have a baby face and can’t grow any facial hair at all and this makes me look 18 at most.

She decided to raise rent for a single bedroom, shared bathroom from $850 to $1,000 a month (Bay area, expensive, blah blah blah) and I just can't afford that considering what I'm receiving. But that isn't so much the issue as her cleanliness. 

She's disgusting as a person. She doesn't clean, has old moldy dishes stacked in the fridge making it entirely unusable for me. Like, months old food with no cover or anything that she just tossed into the fridge and it rots away. She CONSTANTLY uses my bathroom (she has her own, it wasn't supposed to be a shared bathroom) but she CONSTANTLY leaves shit stains. LITERAL SHIT STAINS. On fucking EVERYTHING. Toilet, toilet paper, bath tub (????), etc.

I wanted to move out this month and I've been looking for places. It's month to month, rent was supposed to be due on 15th but now she's pressuring me to pay it today. I can't afford the $1,000 for a place and then a security deposit plus rent for another place. It's not plausible for me.

I really don't know what to do in this sort of situation because my health has been declining both physically and mentally while living with her. But I just can't afford a deposit anywhere because, again, Bay area. There's no way in hell I can afford $1,400 down upfront and then $1,400 immediately for my move in PLUS the grand for rent.

571,"HIGHSCHOOL DRAMA

Okay so for some back story, I'm in highschool (senior) and I've been dealing with mental health issues like depression for the past 3 or 4 years. It's not the easiest thing for me to trust people and I overthink alot. I'd like anyone's advice on what to do here because its honestly tearing me up. 

I have a friend, we will call him Tom. Tom had this girlfriend, we'll call her Molly. Shes really chill and I eventually became friends with her as well. For a while I was the third wheel in the relationship, theyd both confide in me and talk to me about their probelms.. as you can imagine that got super stressful for me. But I did what I could cause I felt it was right and I cared about them. 

I secretly grew feelings for Molly, we grew closer and for a good while we'd go for long late night drives and hangout like every other day. I kept my feelings to myself though.

Skipping over a lot of drama and important stuff, Tom and Molly broke up and over most of last summer I didnt talk or hang with Molly because my overthinking got the best of me, I felt like she was only my friend cause she felt bad for me cause I'm so depressed and lonely.

I cant remember when but I think it was a few months ago I told her I had real feelings for her and she said she didnt. But she was drunk or high I think so idk if that's a real answer.

 Fast forward from last summer to now, I'm friends once again with them both but they arent together. Lately Molly and I have gotten closer. We've said that we love eachother and shes sent me paragraphs saying how much she cares about me and loves me and thanks me for all ive done for her. I'm a loner. Her being so kind and loving has made me fall for her, like it hurts to not be with her and shes been on my mind constantly. We have alot of history and so much in common it almost feels like my soul mate has been in plain sight this whole time. 

But come to find out from Tom, about a month ago him and Molly slept together again and hang out occasionally now. But still arent together and both say they never will be. Molly doesnt know that I know. That was before before we got really close again I think, but she still hasn't told me shes been hangin out with Tom. Like no one knows I dont think. 

But when we hang out she has also been doing stuff like sitting against me and the other night we were watching game of thrones with another friend and she was like so close to cuddling me, I wanted to so bad. Maybe I'm just mis interpreting, I dont have much experience with relationships. Having someone do stuff like this and say they love me and hug me is out of this world for me. It's unusual for someone so beautiful to have any interest in me so it's hard for me to believe.

I really dont know what's going on, part of me feels like we actually have something, part of me thinks she is only staying stuff like that cause I'm depressed and she wants to keep me from ending it or wants to brighten my day, part of me thinks I'm just buried in the friend zone. 

I want to tell her how I feel again, but I'm worried if she says yes it will be out of pitty. Us being together would also cause issues between me and Tom, hes one of like my only friends. 

Part of me kinda feels in the wrong for catching feelings. Like I feel like I'll annoy her if I ask to hang more often or if I tell her how I feel.. idrk why. 

This is the first time I've ever written a buncha this out so I skipped alot of stuff and its not the best organized, so I apologize.",07May2019,1

Basically, a few months ago I was in a really awful depression pit and was drinking a lot and using a fake ID I had acquired to fuel my alcohol habit. I used my fake to buy a can of something alcoholic, can't really remember what it was, and they said it was fake and took it from me. They didn't call the cops or anything.

I don't really drink anymore or do any illegal shit like that since I'm in a better place but my anxiety brain has had me freaking the fuck out about this recently.

580,"Roughly 2 years ago a relative of mine got involved with the chat function on an 18+ rated browser based game (some prison sim) he had been playing genuinely for years. They met some other users and as communication went on, it evolved into much more adult themes. All instances were consentual, with the other users claiming to be of age and with profiles and content that matched. This was all purely text based and reciprocated. He then saw a documentary on TV about sexting. He had no idea there was even a name for what he had been doing besides dirty talking and was from that point filled with the fear that any one of these users may not be who they say they were. His final communication to the users in question was to check again who they claimed to be and what age, that everything said was consentual and there was no ill feeling. He subsequently arranged for his account to be deleted and doesn't go near the internet even to google a word. Since then he has been convinced that flashing lights are coming from him. He has a history of depression, anxiety and cannabis usage, however he has also been completely clean for the past 2 years since. This man has so much potential, serious hard earned savings under his belt with which he could afford himself the very dreams he also worked for, but he is trapped, unwilling to leave the house, picking up occasional work. He lives with his elderly mother who recently suffered a stroke so there is a degree of responsibility to him staying put. None of us know what to say or how to help him, he struck up a rapport with his gp that has now left service and is reluctant to attempt any further counselling for fear that he may let slip something that would flag suspicion. Noone in our family knows what to do or how to help him understand that he has done no wrong and is not at risk. It has been 2 years, if any of these users (all based in other countries) were not who they say they were and any complaint raised, he would know by now surely. Please help, what do?",07May2019,1

585,"Recently, my mom started cleaning out her basement, and asked my BF and I if we wanted a metal shelving unit for our utility room. (Think basic, industrial style unit you might find in your dad's garage to hold tool boxes and extension cords.) I said sure, because the room is quite small, and wanted some vertical storage. 

As soon as we get the shelving unit reassembled, we immediately notice something is very wrong. The whole shelf is warped, as if a giant twisted it in his hands. Even with nothing on it, it leans heavily. I thought, since we didn't have too much stuff to put on it, if we just put the heavy stuff on the bottom-most shelf, it might counter balance it. No luck. 

At this point, I'm bummed, but not surprised. That shelf had been in my mom's basement since the early 90s and knowing her, she probably bought something shitty just because it was cheap. I doubt very much she paid any attention to the weight limits. She's a hoarder and I know that particular shelf was crammed full of stuff before she finally gave it to me. But there was stuff four feet deep on the floor in front of the shelf - boxes, and boxes of shit - that I never knew it leaned so much or I would never have accepted her ""gift."" so at this point, I'm bummed that a free shelf didn't work out, but I don't want to have it crash one day, especially because we have cats and while they've never bothered it, I would feel awful if something happened. There's only a few boxes on the shelf, so I figured, I'll just leave it where it is for now and put it out to the curb next trash day and the metal scrappers can have it. 

A few days later, my mom calls and asks how I like the shelf. I'm honest with her: I'm annoyed that I spent my whole saturday transporting it and reassembling it (btw, the metal was so shitty that we had to hammer it in places to be able to screw in the bolts to attach the shelves to the legs) only to discover that it was a safety hazard. I told her I appreciated her thinking of me, but it's just not safe. Normally, I would donate something I can't use, but I wouldn't feel right donating this knowing how unsafe it is. SHE. FLIPS. OUT. She get so upset because it cost her $100 when she bought it and there's nothing wrong with it - it worked perfectly for her - and if I'm not going to use it, I MUST give it back to her. 

I guess I shouldn't be surprised by this behavior. My mom has always been a bit of a hoarder, having grown up poor. She'll donate shoes that are falling apart or VHS tapes that are unwatchable (missing sound and faded colors) just because ""someone might want them."" Normally, I just roll my eyes and shake my head, but this is different. This shelf is not safe. Now, I realize the simple answer might be: why not just put the shelf to the curb anyway? The thing is: I will NEVER hear the end of it. I debated just not telling her. She rarely comes over anyway. I usually am the one to go visit her. But when she does come over, she is nosy. She'll say things like ""Do you wear that shirt I got you? do you ever use the thing I got you? I guarantee she'd noticed a replacement shelf immediately and demand to know what happened to the other one. 

So my question is: does anyone have any advice as to how to fix this situation quietly? Or is my only option to bite the bullet and deal with her whining?",07May2019,0

588,"Holy hell Reddit, I need a lot of help.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; My gf just told me that she is asexual and I don't really know how to feel about it.

&amp;#x200B;

So for those of you interested, here is some background. My gf (18) and I (20, male) have been dating for almost a month.  When it comes to romance, I am a very touchy feely person. I love it when a girl really shows me that she loves me by choosing to be with me in a physical way. My gf hasn't been the best about this but I've still managed to completely fall head over my heels in love with her. Like I really really love her. I want to show that love back. My gf really likes to be complimented. So I just say a lot of cutesy stuff and that makes her super happy, which is really good. But I've also been attempting to SHOW that love by kissing her. I've tried her neck. Her back. Her breasts. She won't let me down below her belt, maybe not ever at this point idk, but nothing to this point has worked. She doesn't react at ALL when I kiss her ANYWHERE. Even when I kiss her lips, she almost stiffens up and it's probably the worst kissing I've ever had in a relationship. But I still love her. When she kisses me, there are certain spots she'll kiss, that'll make me gasp and whimper. There's one on the back of my neck, I believe that's her favorite spot to kiss because boy it gets a reaction out of me. She did tell me, ""I actually kinda like hearing you get all excited, and doing the exciting."" But the fact that I can't give that back to her is honestly one of the most frustrating things I've ever dealt with. I voiced that frustration to her last night while we were in my car kinda making out like teenagers, which bless her heart she still does even though it doesn't do anything for her. She took a sexuality quiz last night apparently and told me this morning that she is asexual. I will never be able to give her what she gives me. I will never be able to please her, and I don't think she's ever going to want to be with me in the way that I want to be with her. Had I known this before I fell for her, this would've been easy. But now... it's difficult. I really love her. She loves me. I don't want to lose that. She doesn't want to lose that either.

&amp;#x200B;

In a string of texts this morning my gf said, ""I'm not suggesting that you leave AT ALL. I would HATE THAT. However, you deserve more (a lot more) validation from a girl in intimacy than I can give you, so it's okay if you want to see someone while seeing me. I know discounted things aren't always the best/most satisfying investment. But hey, if you stay with me and find another girl to do sexual things with, you can get two girls for the price of one! I wouldn't stay with you for hours cuddling if I didn't get SOMETHING from that. I guess it's just that I a) love you and B) just love how you make me feel like way, way, way, way, WAY more than enough. But I know I can't do the same for you in all aspects of life like you do for me, so the buy-1-get-1-free girl offer is out there. I just want you to be happy, and I don't think happiness for you is going to be fulfilled by me just not reacting to anything. So. The offer is out there.""

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really lost on what to do. I don't know if I could be someone physically without also being emotionally involved with them. Those two things have been tied for me....since I first realized girls don't really have cooties. I'm a virgin and don't really have much experience with girls. When I lose that, I want to lose it someone that I love. I was hoping that I'd lose it to my current gf but the way she said some other things that I don't want to share/spend time writing, it doesn't sound like I ever will. I don't want to break up with my gf. But...I don't know if I have a future worth investing in with someone who is asexual. If I do break up with her, I will do it face to face. She doesn't want me to leave her but understands that I might. I just...I need your help Reddit. What can I do here?

I definitely have anxiety, especially social anxiety, and I've been depressed for over a year now. Ive never been able to hold a job for more than 5 months which is a real issue in my shoes. I'm the second oldest sibling in a family of 7. We live in a 4 bedroom 1 bath house which isn't anything new really, its always been like this. My dad is a programmer and is supposed to be making ""100k+ a year"" but with 5 kids that isnt much. My father lost his job about a month ago and he doesnt think he will be getting another IT job because he's already been through like 5 of them. That leaves all of the expenses on my mothers shoulders, and she has an interview for another job that allows her to work 7 days a week instead of 5. Shes been seeing a doctor for possible cancerous tumors. Both parents are early 40's with rapidly declining health due to ciggarettes and stress raising a ton of kids. I feel horrible, almost guilty for this. 

My sister is 1 year older than me, she's going to school to be a nurse or something, and has a kid who just turned 1. I have another sister who is one year younger who works fast food and gives my parents 60-70 bucks here and there to help out. My other 2 siblings are still very young.

I have no debt, I have my high school diploma, and a decent car that runs I paid cash for a year and a half ago. I do realize I am in a position a lot of people wish they could be in, but I have no clue what to do with my situation. I cant stand the thought of working some 9-5 but I'm sure my mom doesn't either :/ The only jobs around me are fast food, and I have been dealing with cystic acne since a freshman in high school, so the greasy environment just doesn't work for me. I know I'm a smart dude, i have a lot of empathy and sympathy for other people and the world but I'm stuck in a rut of just thinking of stupid thoughts that are cool to think about, but have no real impact on my life. I've had deep talks with my dad about life and his friends always think he's some very intelligent being because of the way him and I think, but him and i both agree its pretty useless knowledge.

I know I should just ""go out and get a job"" and I've tried too but something in my head is just holdong me back telling me I'm scared to talk to co-workers and having to do shit work that nobody wants to do. I'm a fast learner and I feel like I'm capable of doing most jobs, but I don't know what I love so much to the point I want to spend my life doing it. I don't know how my work ethic ended up so bad but I want to fix it. I want to help pay the bills and feed my brothers and sisters. I've been sleeping on the thought of joining the air force or navy but I don't want to regret joining after being in for like a year. I've been unemployed for 6 months and somehow I still have a girlfriend who loves me but I know she dislikes how anxious I've been. She understands I'm ""stuck"" but doesnt understand the anxious thoughts I have as she has 0 anxieties. Who knows.

598,"Growing up I was the black sheep of my family. I had medical issues and that caused me to be treated differently by my parents. However due to my medical issues I had to be careful of my weight gain. I was never fat as a child but I was a bit chubbier if that. I remember in grade 2 class line up my mom told me I was the fattest one of my class. I recently found that line up and when I look back, I look fine, normal not fat. I was never good enough in school, I was never pretty enough, and always compared with my younger healthy sister. This caused me to literally date the first guy who said I was pretty in high school. That relationship was toxic as well but we never had a chance because my parents did everything they could to break us up. We eventually did break up but the emotions of that first relationship are still raw 10 years later as I never really had closure. Around that time 10 years ago I met my now husband. My parents liked my husband because he was quiet and honestly he doesn’t get involved. He comes from his own messed up family. At 20 years old I could not take the toxic relationship with my parents anymore. So my husband and I moved across the country to attend University but we stayed in our current city after. I find this distance produces the most healthy relationship with my parents I had ever had. Though toxic comments were still made by them I could do what I wanted and eat what I wanted.  I was happy. Yes I gain some weight but I got it under control. Anyways fast forward to last week. My husband and I welcomed our baby boy. My parents flew into town to help. And around our apartment with Reno’s they helped a lot. My mom cooked. It was going okay. Day 2 postpartum in the hospital my dad and mom go off on me that the reason my baby was born small was because I was to fat. My husband is lazy for taking 2 weeks off to be with me. That my husband needs a better job. On and on they went. I having had a C-section under general anesthesia was having a hard time anyways. I’ve been secretly crying in the bathroom and whenever I’m alone because I’m so hurt. I can’t do this toxic judgement stuff anymore. Luckily my dad flew home already but my moms still here. My husband tried to buy my favourite chocolate as a treat postpartum the other day but my mom stopped him and told him I’m too fat to eat those. I only gained 38lbs this pregnancy. My husband didn’t want to start somthing so he dropped the conversation. Now my concern my moms been asking all my doctors when I can go travel back to my hometown. Honestly it would be nice to see my friends and introduce my baby. But I don’t want be near that toxic environment. My moms also told some family friends I’ll be moving back. I’m not planning on it.

600,"There's quite a bit of backstory so this might end up being a long post. There will be a TL;DR at the bottom. For the sake of privacy, I'll be labeling all the characters with letters. My SO will be Q. My friend from middle school will be Y.

&amp;#x200B;

So, this past November I began talking to someone that goes to my college. She had just ended a 2 year long abusive relationship. Because of that, we took our time getting to know each other and making sure she was comfortable with another guy (me). Over time, our relationship had developed into something fantastic. Our talks are unparalleled to anything else I've ever had in my life. The physical stuff is fantastic. There wasn't a single negative thing about our relationship, until February. 

&amp;#x200B;

She lives about 2 hours away from where we go to college at. There was a family event one weekend in February, so she decided to go home over that weekend. Unfortunately, I commute to college and don't have the freedom to go 2 hours away with a significant other, so that was off the table. 

&amp;#x200B;

Y and I were good friends in middle school. He went to a different high school so we lost touch, but now we go to the same college. We reconnected became friends again. He wanted grab a ride with Q to the city she lives in (he was going to meet someone else while there), so he asked her for a ride home with her. She agreed for two main reasons. One, he would have taken the train, so she might as well save him some money. Two, she had just recently gotten out of a long, abusive relationship. In that relationship, she didn't have much freedom. The ability to take him home was kind of a signifier of that freedom. While this may not be overly relevant, I do think it's important to note that Y is homosexual, and like I said we are good friends. It's not like she was bringing some random guy home over the weekend.

&amp;#x200B;

So Q brings Y home over the weekend. This is very selfish, but I am bummed that I am unable to go. It's frustrating to see all the other college students have so much freedom while I'm expected to be home by supper. That's besides the point though. Once they get to Q's house, they begin to drink some. I suppose I should have expected this, but it still was a bit of a bummer seeing my SO drinking with another guy (while I was trapped at home unable to drink). We do these things called ""progress pictures"" (because we work out together, we take pics of the results and send them to each other). Perhaps it was the alcohol, but Q showed Y a progress picture of her mostly nakey. She told me that she showed him, but then didn't show me for a few minutes because she was too ""shy"" (she did end up sending it to me a few minutes later). She was also acting very drunk (she later said she was doing this to ""show off"" to me to look cooler). 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I'm bummed. Q was very drunk with another guy, he got to see a mostly nakey pic of her before I did, and I was stuck at home this entire time. Then, out of nowhere, she says they're smoking together. I ask what they're smoking (because there are various things that can be smoked). She ignores my question. I ask again and again, each time ignored (she later revealed she thought I was being ""coy""). She sends snaps of her smoking before finally answering with ""weed."" If I thought I was bummed before, it was magnified so much.

&amp;#x200B;

For context, we do live in an illegal state. Throughout the course of our relationship, we had talked about smoking weed together several times (I smoked a bit in high school, she's only smoked once or twice). Each time I brought it up, she was very hesitant, mainly because it was illegal and she was concerned about getting in trouble. That is a very valid reason to not want to smoke, and I respected it. I would bring up the idea of smoking but never pushed it. In fact, her and Y smoked together on a Friday evening. We had just talked about it the Tuesday before, and agreed then to wait together until it was legal.

&amp;#x200B;

So the two of them smoked, even though Q and I had agreed to wait together. This stung quite a bit. Even though it's been over two months, it still stings to think about. She chose to smoke with another guy over me. It probably sounds selfish but I just can't seem to get over it. Plus, sometimes when my mind wonders about how we agreed to something on a Tuesday and she backed out of it that Friday, can I truly trust her? How long does it take for that trust to come back? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My SO brings a friend home over the weekend. She drinks and smokes weed with him, even though we had agreed to wait until weed is legal in our state. It stung quite a bit, and it feels like the trust isn't fully there anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

602,"Usually, if this sort of thing happened, I'd just brush it off and go about my business, especially since, in the past, my ex has had the tendency to rile up his friends - to the point where I've received threats to burn down my house with me and my child inside. I have had to move after he figured out my address and sent people to leave notes on my cars.

But I've been left alone for *five years*. There has been no contact between us whatsoever since December of 2014 - a court date for child support where I requested that he *not* be held accountable for child support. 

In the past few years, he had been arrested, sentenced, and thrown in jail for a sexual crime involving a minor child. 

 I have happily kept my distance and thought that that chapter of my life was behind me.

So imagine my surprise when I woke up to a message from who I assume is a new, or newly upset, girlfriend. She's full of righteous fury over the following:

- he has no money because he's paying a ridiculous amount of child support. I need to have the child support amended because he can't afford hundreds of dollars a week. [Obviously untrue, I have never received child support from him. This can be proven with court documents that I can send over to her.]

- that I'm obviously misappropriating these funds because my child is constantly in dirty and ripped clothes. [This is the most concerning accusation, in my opinion. I do not know where she, or he, might have seen my daughter. My social media is locked down and, as stated, he has not seen her since before she was one year old. But this accusation is partially true; my daughter is six years old. She's obviously constantly dirty, she's six! She has school uniforms and play clothes, with a couple of nice dresses. Her play clothes are in rough shape and get replaced almost every three months. *She's six.*]

- that he has PTSD from being sent to prison for unpaid child support. [This one grinds my fuckin' gears. He went to jail for something completely unrelated and a quick Google search would have proven him wrong.]

- he spends so much time/money on court dates. [I'm sure he's spending time and money on court dates, but it's definitely not on courts dates that I'm aware of. I took a peak at his court documents online, and he has court dates associated with his recent legal troubles. Again, easily proven incorrect.]

- she threatened to hire a lawyer for him to take my daughter away. [This is the least concerning aspect of this message. I have custody pretty much under wraps.]

There were other ramblings, very aggressive language and name calling, but no real threats. I know that they don't know where I live because she accused me of living in the ghetto. I used to live in a low income town but now I live in a super rich area of a major city for my daughter's school.

 She sounds like a disgruntled girlfriend trying to defend her boyfriend from a high conflict, unreasonable baby mama. Except, well, that isn't the case. Like I said, usually I'd ignore it, but... With everything she's accusing me of, I could easily prove her misinformed. And it's kinda really pissing me off that he's *still* trying to blame his crappy choices on me! Like, c'mon, man.

I'm very tempted to send her back a message:

 ""Hey there, [name], I understand your concerns, but I think there might be a miscommunication between you and [ex].

Our last court date was [date]. [Ex] wasn't ordered to pay support. [link]

I'm not sure why he was sent to prison, but you can check that at [link]

I wish you the best of luck.""

603,What to do,07May2019,0
606,I’m a student currently using my father’s GI Bill since he never went to college. I am also receiving a chapter 35 benefit that allows me to get a small allowance for the time I’m in school. I have been using this for 3 years and I will be entering my last year of school next year. Recently we had a really bad fallout that prompted me to stop talking to him. I have to go through the process of setting up all my documents for the next school year but has changed all the passwords where I can access his veteran documents (had to set all of his profile stuff up myself since he wouldn’t. This is why I knew his login information). He has changed the passwords and security questions for everything and I’m afraid that my funding won’t be able to go through because I cannot access those documents. I literally only need one more year of school and I’m starting to panic I won’t be able to afford it if this falls through.,07May2019,1
607,"So, I'm a bit of an outcast, I don't go to school because of (minor) health problems, nobody in my age group likes me except a small group with the same music interests and hobbies with me, and I talk daily to only one of those ""friends"". So we had a bit of an argument some time back, which was all sorted out on the spot. For the last few days she has started to completely ignore everything I say, and when she says something it's usually a very dry, uninterested comment like ""ok"" or ""yay"". I have no idea what to do because she's the only person outside of my family I count to be close to me, and she is the almost only reason I'm not sad all the time anymore.

So can anyone help me? I have no idea if it's something that's happening in her life because she won't answer to anything. Or is it just that she is no longer interested in being my friend. I'm really overwhelmed with emotions and can't function properly because I'm just thinking about losing my only real close friend all the time. Please help if you can!",07May2019,1

611,Greetings people sorting by new. I'm on mobile and that cool fun stuff. Anyhow I have this friend that I met about a year and a half ago and we really became good friends. All my other friends treated me like shit a lot of the time and didn't really care so it was good to have someone who was the opposite. She really helped me through a lot of shit. I really thank her for that. Anyway the problem started around January. She had some separate issues and was a little less active in talking and stuff. I don't blame her for this and understand and tried to help. This paired with the fact that our schedules for school have not allowed at all has made us a little distant. This really sucks and I really love her and want her to be around. Anyway we still don't talk as much and I spend a lot of the day just having anxiety and feeling alone just waiting and seeing if she comes on. I know this isn't healthy but it's whatever. So the real problem is that because of our schedules we only have about five minutes a day to talk in person and I've been through a very bad depression thing and am very low energy. Especially in the morning she tries to talk to me and I'm really trying to communicate but it's too much for me. I end up saying a few responses and she leaves and talks to someone else and I just kinda stand there. She always tells me this bothers her and I try to tell her I'm trying but I know it just come along as me being an asshole. This and the fact I think she's taking it as I don't want to talk to her. Which is one hundred percent the opposite case. I don't know how to fix this how friendship I'm really trying but it's just falling apart and she's the one person who cares about me and I care about her. Tl;Dr I'm fucking up my friendship and have no idea how to fix it.,07May2019,2

613,"I know the obvious answer would be Germany but hear me out. I’m 18 currently on exchange here in Germany. I want to study Mechanical Engineering. I originally came to learn German and then be able to enter a German university. But after living deeply involved in the German culture I don’t really love it. Yes, it has perks (they’re obvious, safer, cleaner, higher standard of living, etc) but it’s way too different to Mexican culture. Especially in tiny details. But summarized, Mexico is a warm, open, and friendly culture, the German one is cold, and mostly reserved. I did manage to make friends here in Germany but they’re still not so open as in Mexico, it’s hard to explain but in Mexico people are like generally always happy about something and really portray it. We know how to see the good in life, and always find the funny and beautiful parts in (almost) every situation. People here in Germany are like dead serious about everything and I really don’t like it that much, I prefer how easygoing us Mexicans are. I generally am a lot happier in Mexico than I’m here in Germany, not that I haven’t been but Mexico is better on this point.

On the other hand, a German university would look a lot better on my C.V. than a Mexican one. Of course German universities are better than Mexican ones. That would definitely make me stand out in job applications. I would have to live in Germany for around 4-5 years until I’m completely done and then I would most likely return to Mexico city, where I’m from. Having studied in Germany would also sound better if I ever wanted to move to another country, for example, the US or Canada, or Australia. The German university would sound a lot better than the Mexican one, because Germany is a much more respected country in terms of academics, especially engineering, which is what I want to study. 

It all boils down to, 
Mexico, happier, better social life, being with family, staying in my culture, etc. Weather
Germany, better education, better diploma, would make me stand out when applying to jobs, dominating a third language.

I know the sensible decision would be to study in Germany, but it’s not like if I study in Mexico I wouldn’t have a future, but maybe less chances. 


I really need advice on this because it has been worrying me for almost the whole time I’ve been here. It would almost seem as if I was forcing and convincing myself to like Germany.",07May2019,1
614,"So I'm a department head for a grocery chain in a store that gets a lot of upper corporate attention and I've done very well for the past 2 years where my predecessor had struggled for 6+ years to get it to the level I've set as the new standard. Just recently I saw a posting for the same position in a store slightly closer to my house and in a much less stressful environment. Not just that but looking into the numbers for the store it had shown steady growth over the past 1.5-2 years and seems to be trending upward for the considerable future. This store is seen as ""smaller"" than mine by company eyes but it does 4-6k more a week in total sales and had a much higher ceiling for growth where as my current store hit its ceiling 10 years ago and all we can do now is ""maintain"" the status quo. 

I put in for the transfer and notified all involved parties and did everything as professional as I could. I recently caught wind that the Division head of my department is not happy I'm trying to leave my store because I have done so well and he see's it as a step down. I know I'm one of only 3 people that applied for the position and I'm by a very large margin the only qualified candidate. I am afraid he is going to attempt to find a way to stop me from going because my current shoes are harder to fill that the ones for the opening I applied for.

I'm trying to prepare for the inevitable discussion with him or his subordinates regarding my situation. My goal is not to showcase my anger or frustration with their stance on the transfer but to express my interest and insight as to why it is a good choice for me personally and professionally. My kids are getting to the age where they will start sports or other extra curricular activities and we as a family will start attempting to do more outdoors like camping, hiking and such this summer. If I stay where I am I wont have the flexibility to take longer weekends or extra days to enjoy time with my family. I also fear if they force me to stay where I am it will destroy all motivation to remain a hard working employee, that feeling might just be the frustration i feel right now but I'm hoping to not have to walk down that road if at all possible.

616,"On a throwaway account so my friends don't see this.

I feel abandoned by my 3 (21f, 26f, and 28f) best friends. I know everyone is busy with their lives, but I haven't seen or heard from 2 of them in about a month. When my best friend K dated this awful guy she pushed me far away and it's never been the same. Even after their break up we seem to be distant. Everyone used to text each other and make plans, now I feel like no one ever wants to talk to me unless something bad is happening. The 2 make an effort with K when she is in town, but they have pretty much ghosted me since then. The last time I was in constant contact with them was when K was dating her ex-boyfriend and we were keeping each other in the loop.

One of my friends is graduating from MA school and I am so proud, but they've been planning a party and no one has said anything to me except K. i didn't even realize they were moving house last weekend until someone else told me.

I've always worked an office job while they've worked in restaurants and so they've all gone on these spontaneous trips and I always had to see the pictures and hear the stories. I've planned a camping trip to SD and I heard one of my friends is going to bail at the last minute. 

I know I shouldn't complain about stuff like this when I have a great boyfriend and a wonderful family, but I feel so pushed aside.  I love my boyfriend and family, but it's nice sometimes to get together with your girlfriends and do something fun.  I feel as if I never am good enough for my friends. Like I am weighing them down when I am around.

I feel so annoying and stupid for being upset. I am probably making a bigger deal out of it then I should be.....but I can't stop crying about it. I am too afraid to talk to anyone about it, because I feel they will just brush off my feelings and nothing will change.

I'm dividing them into four categories, each letter will have the category it'd from written on the envelope. The catagories are:

* Things I Love About You

* Things I Love About Us

* Memories

* The Future  

So if she opens one labeled ""you"", it will be a letter about a specific thing that I love about her (her laugh, her music taste, her sleepy morning texts, etc...). Things about us will be the same, but things that I like about us as a couple (reading books together, etc). Memories is favorite dates and things we've done together, and I'll included a photo in each if I can. Future is things I look forward to when I see her or when long distance is over. 


So my questions are:

1. Is this a good or bad idea?

2. What sorts of things would you want to read? Would you want specific physical compliments? Funny things I notice? Stuff about missing you so much? I'm just looking for more ideas on what to write about so she can have as many as possible to open!",07May2019,1

627,"So a little background, me and him have been together for almost 7 years, we had never had a mayor fight, in december i asked him for some time cause i had some issues with myself to work out and we recently moved in together (feb) cause i really think he's the love of my life and he thinks the same about me, he helps around the house, he thanks me everyday when i cook or just do something to him i'm very open minded about porn and masturbation.

2 weeks ago i starter having nightmares about him cheating on me, i had the same dream for about a week, one night i woke up super freaked out, it was 4 am and I thought to myself ""okey.... so you're gonna break his privacy but i just need to assure myself its only a dream and nothing else"" (i have never until that day grabbed his phone and digged around, never) and i clicked on the first app that showed in his home screen ""whatsapp"" i see some convos of people we know, some of work, some of his girl friends and i scrolled a bit down and i see a picture of a very sexy lady and i dont quite remember the name of her but it had a ❤ in the name, i clicked and to my surprise yes in deed it was a hooker from tamaulipas (we live in gdl mexico) i scrolled up and he started the convo with ""hey, you're very pretty oh and btw you have a rocking body 😍"" the lady didnt answer, but he kept insisting, then he sends her a screenshot of a bank transfer he make for her for around $500 pesos and in return ahe send him a pack of videos and photos of her masturbating and being fucked, then he proceeds to tell her ""i hope one day you can come over here 😍"" ""im in gdl"" the lady never answered back (catfish of course) y went back to all the conversations and i see another one, this one was actually from my city and activelly answering, he asked por prices and what included and him saying the zone where we live.
I just took a photo of the number of gir #1 cause it was more recent they started talking on feb and he paid her by the last days of march. I was heartbroken.
To me he was the guys that will never do that kind of stuff to me cause he preaches that cheating even through text is soooooo wrong.
I did confront him yesterday cause i kept it to myself for almost a week until i couldn'tdnt hold it anymore.
His reasoning?
He told me that lurking for porn somehow the number popped and out of curiosity he clicked the link (cause supposedly the name and ❤ was al ready there when he added her)
and also before we even met he tried texting some other hookers but noone answered)
he told me that we should go to couple therapy and i agree we should, he even told me that i can check his phone whenever i wanted but this morning i was gonna do some errands and i wanted to look up for some prices, iwent to his computer cause was the nearest and is in our bedroom but he changed the password, i was beyond mad, i texted him telling him that i know he doesn't trust me cause he's afraid of me finding more whores and hookers on his pc, he told me that he felt violated but it was an impulse changing his password, he was gonna give me the password but I refused completely and told him to have a great day at work.

I think i forgot i confronted him at 3 am when i was having suicidal thoughts and the next day he didnt spoke a word to me other than, how are your knuckles doing? (Cause i punched the wall due to how furious i was and they started bleeding) he went somewhere and when he returned (7pm) that's when he decided that we needed to talk.

I dont know what to do, everytime i see him i get so angry, when he goes out with his friends i got super paranoic but i didnt nagged him.

I wish I was privileged enough not to do this, but considering the fact that my mother is middle-class in NYC, I don’t have that luxury I wish I had.

At this same time, my period did not come. However, I was not and am still not pregnant. The pain didn't go away after the removal of the IUD. So I go to another OBGYN, and the moment he probes me it was the most uncomfortable feeling in the world. I got nauseous immediatly and the pain was very weird; I felt full and it felt like my body wanted to push when there was nothing to push. This isn't my first rodeo; I've had two kids and am accustomed to being examined in this way, so I don't understand why my body reacted this way. 

He tells me he thinks I have endometriosis and that I have cysts but they may go away over time. He suspects I may have a hernia so he sends me to a general surgeon to get his opinon. He says he doesn't think it's a hernia. I go back to work and I could not do ANYTHING. I work in a warehouse that is physically demanding; if you're not picking items at a rapid pace, you could be lifting totes around, a lot of walking, or standing for extended periods of time. I was in so much pain and discomfort, and no matter the pain medication I took, the pain didn't falter. 

I go in today ( it has been three weeks at this point) and I tell the OBGYN that I am in pain and its uncomfortable just to sit for an extended period of time. It literally feels like I'm sitting with something inside me when there is nothing there. I've lost my appetite but haven't lost a significant amount of weight, I can't sleep. I just overrall feel like shit. He probes me again and apparently now he doesn't see cysts and he doesn't think I have endometriosis. I haven't had my period in two months. 

I took another leave of absence of work because of this; and they need documentation to confirm all the information I could provide them.

I just found out he is married and even lied to me about where he is from.  Now it seems like every thing about him was just a lie. I haven't confronted him because I don't want to lose him. I feel like I bought him to treat me so nice.  I don't if I should continue helping him and enjoying him even though I already clearly know he is married and I know he is only with me for my money.",07May2019,2

640,"So here’s the thing. I would looove to work in an Apple Store. Every time I go there there is this atmosphere that seduce me and the employees (or specialist as they call them) are always nice.
This made me want to work for them as a part time to finance my study.

I applied there about a month ago and got through one phone interview. They seemed to have liked me cause I got through second phase, the group interview, which will take place on the 16th May. 
However, I’m almost positive that after that there will be an individual interview. Apple has been known to be slow with its recruiting process.

In the meantime, I’ve got another job offer for a month and half in an tourism office, that will last from May 20th to June 30th. 

The problem lies in the fact that I don’t want to be unavailable if Apple offers me a job during June... 

On the other hand, the office job would allow me to buy furniture for my new found apartment.

So idk what to do. I’m split between waiting for an offer from Apple or taking the office job for once month but risking not being available until end of June..",07May2019,2

I wanted to go to college for either nursing or Dental Hygiene but my parents were never supportive of that and always insisted I worked remedial jobs instead.

648,"Hi guys,

So, my godmother is having a special birthday this year and wants to mark it by going on a special holiday. It was brought up to me that they'd like me to join them since her daughter will also be going and would love me to be there for company (me and her daughter are very close childhood friends).

When I was 'asked' I didn't confirm yes or no simply because I didn't have a job and was kind of under the impression if I did go they'd pay for me since they knew I wasn't working (talks about paying half or not worrying about paying were floating around).

One evening, my godmother called my house and asked to speak to me - she wanted to confirm my DOB and name as it appeared on my passport and said they're booking now and they really wanted me to come. I gave it to her and she texted me to tell me it was done and that when I got a job I could tell them that I've booked a holiday.

I am now employed and I'm wondering if I should offer to pay for this holiday out of courtesy since I can actually afford it (even though its expensive!!!) and because they might actually expect me to pay?

My thoughts are:

1. Even though i'm now working and I can afford it, I probably wouldn't have spent the money to go  
 
2. Technically I was kinda 'forced' into going and didn't have much choice because I was booked and told they really want me to come.  
 
3. Do I mention costs/money at all and if I do how do I mention it to avoid having to pay lol?  
 

Advice would be appreciated!",07May2019,1

656,"So, I've been staying with my grandmother and her two sisters since February and I'll be leaving in June. 

Recently, anytime I have a conversation with my grandmother and aunt, it usually ends up with them talking down to me as if I don't know what I'm talking about. Usually, the topic has something to do with LGBT+ information and facts and things to do with myself such as my hair and my skincare.

I'm a 19, going on 20, black girl. This year I've begun a skincare routine and have started to take care of my hair more ***(I didn't care anything about this kind of stuff while growing up).*** So I've bought a fair amount of products that could work for me. I've also gotten more into makeup towards the end of high school.

However, my grandmother always says something along the line of ""You putting all that crap in your hair is gonna ruin it"" or ""Your gonna ruin your face with all that stuff"" ***(I've been trying 1 or 2 different products sometimes to find what works for me.)*** 

As for the LGBT+ stuff, I try to not argue with her about it now, so I avoid it. (She doesn't believe in Bisexuality. Either you're fully gay or you're not, in her head.)

Just today, I asked my grandmother to buy me a face scrub, St. Ives Blackhead scrubs, for me while we had been out. I had put some on my hand and asked my grandmother and aunt to smell it since it smelled nice to me. My aunt asked me if it was a face scrub, and I was like ""yeah"". 

I told her it was for blackheads and stuff since I get blackheads around my nose a lot. She asked me why I get different new products when what I was using was working for me. Before I was using a different scrub of the same brand, but since the new one was specifically for blackheads, I wanted to give it a try.

I explained that to her, and she went on about how I could ruin my skin, and how would I know if these product work and such. I said that I do my research ***(others of a similar skin type using the product, ingredients, etc.)*** 

She then starts going off on how I shouldn't believe everything on the internet and not everyone had the same skin type as me (which I'm aware of). And when I tell her that, she gave me this condescending laugh and basically says the same things as before. She adds on that my blackheads are probably popping up because I've started wearing makeup. 

***(I doubt this since I don't do a full face every day, majority of the time I only do my eyebrows, eyeliner, and lip balm/gloss. Plus I've had blackheads a lot for the majority of my teenage years, and I've only started wearing makeup in my senior year. And at the start, it was only lipstick I used.*** 

***Another thing is that before the whole makeup thing, I barely did any type of skincare, so my skin was terrible).***

At this point, I walk off. The way they talked to me was as if they knew more about my body than I did. (My grandma and aunt are both white btw. Got that mixed family lol.)

My aunt comes in a few minutes later and tells me she wasn't trying to tell me I was wrong, just that I shouldn't believe everything and stuff. And when I tried to tell her that I don't, it didn't do me much good. 

It's such stupid stuff to argue about, but it gets on my nerves none the less. Apparently, I'm very disrespectful when I defend myself and stuff. I get that you should respect your elders and all that, but I feel like I should receive some of the same respect at least. Respect goes both ways and all that.

I'm at the point where I'm going to treat them as I do my parents. Just avoid anything ""controversial"", if you can call these arguments that. Every time, they're like ""You're young, you'll learn the hard way or when you're older"".

Any advice on how to deal with these kinds of adults?

657,"For as long as I(18F) can remember, every time I've talked with someone online (and by online I mean people from places like Reddit, where no one knows who you are), there has always been this creeping voice that says that the person who I'm talking to, is someone I know irl that's just wanting to make fun of me. Which in return, completely alters my responses, so ""they"" can't use what I'm saying to mock me. 

There's also that absolute fear of saying that I like someone in return, because in my head, they only said it first, to get me to admit that I like them, so they can later make fun of me. This, along with the fact that I'm terrified of showing any emotions besides the basic ones. Which are, happiness and indifererence. I've always just considered myself to not be a warm person, but now I'm wondering if there's an underlying problem there.

And lastly, I have an irrational fear of hidden cameras throughout my house. But let me explain this one a bit better. It's not exactly a fear. I'm not in afraid of said ""cameras"". It's more like if I was in TV Reality Show, and there are hidden cameras in *every* room of my house. And I just act on it. I do change some of my actions because ""someone"" is watching me, so I gotta behave. The person watching constantly changes to the most random people.

658,"I really don't know how to describe this without seeming self-centered, but I'll try. There's a TLDR at the end.

For context, I'm a straight female in high school. I have no desire whatsoever to enter a relationship any time soon, but I've noticed that I tend to be very friendly with some of my guy friends. Some of my female friends tell me that my interactions with [Guy] were ""cute."" I act flirtatious with my female friends, knowing that we don't actually like each other (at least to *my* knowledge), but I feel like I'm carrying out those flirtatious behavior with my male friends, too.

A year ago, I had one friend, who I'll call John. It's a really long story, but to be concise, we would always play-flirt with each other, even to the point where he'd pick me up and carry me around bridal style. Later, I found out that he actually did like me, but I continued play-flirting because that was what I was used to. John admitted that he felt I was leading him on, and now (due to semi-unrelated issues) we're no longer speaking to each other. If you want the whole story, you could see my other post.

I have this other friend, ""Jack."" I actually really love his company, but I don't see him as anything more than a friend. However, a lot of my friends, and even some of my classmates, think that he likes me. We actually don't know if he *does* like me, but it seems very likely. According to one friend, Jack supposedly goes out of his way to talk to me and displays other crush-related behavior. 

This morning, I was given a Hershey Kiss, but I didn't want it. So, I went up to Jack and jokingly asked, ""Hey, you want a kiss?"" while holding up the chocolate. I do that joke to all of my friends, regardless of their gender, so I didn't think much of it. However, some of my friends told me that he might have taken that joke differently. They did the standard ""Ooooh, I think he likes you,"" but I want to believe otherwise. I don't want him to think that I like him back, because I don't, but I can't exactly ask him about it without being awkward.

I want to make it clear that I don't actually care if guys like me, but I don't want to seem like I'm reciprocating their feelings when really I have no interest in dating. This is actually really bothering me because I'm scared that one day I'll hurt someone's feelings. I'm not deliberately trying to flirt with anyone. On the contrary, I'm unable to form words in front of people that I *do* like. Regardless, I'm afraid that one day it will negatively affect some of my relationships again. It's already happened once, but I don't know if that was a one-time thing, or if it could repeat. I hate hurting people's feelings, and I struggle with confrontation. Am I being too flirty, or am I just really friendly ~~(and dense)~~?

TLDR: I feel like I act too friendly with my guy friends to the point where it appears that I like them. I've already had one friend tell me that he felt led on by me, and I don't want to repeat that same experience with another friend.",07May2019,8

663,"Hi all. I am on summer break from college; it started about a week ago and my out-of-state internship doesn't start until June 2nd, so for a month I'm just at home on a normal break. Most people love summer break and not having to do anything, but I guess its a different story for me.

I've been home barely a week and I'm bored out of my mind. I have like 3 friends I would usually hang out with, but they're either out of town or still in school for the next week or two, so I can't hang out with them too much. My boyfriend lives close to me but he works 5 days a week 9am-6pm and I'm already hanging out with him a lot when he is free (going to dinner, spending the day together on his days off, etc), but he is at work most of the time. My family (me and my parents) has 3 vehicles but one is basically broken down so most of the time I don't have a car to go somewhere. As such I am stuck at home alone most days of the week while my parents and my boyfriend are at work. Even if I did have a car, I don't know where I would go because i really don't want to spend money right now.

I have nothing to do at home. I have video games I used to be super into, but when I try to make myself play them I get bored after 10 minutes. I don't really care for watching TV and I'm just tired of watching things in general as I usually resort to youtube and netflix all day. I've started sleeping in until noon or even 1pm because I wouldn't be doing anything anyway. It's difficult for me to work out because it's already started getting hot here (I live in the southern US) and I couldn't work out all day even if I wanted to. I like to watercolor paint and draw sometimes but I packed all my art supplies with my college dorm stuff for the summer and its 2000 miles away. Sometimes I even write fanfiction for fun but that only happens when I have an idea on what to write about (if I don't have a specific idea, sitting down to write is pointless as I won't get anywhere). 

Given all of this, I really miss being in school, having a schedule that gets me out of my room, having things to do that stimulate my mind, having more consistent access to friends, etc. Thankfully this will be remedied in a month-ish when I go to my internship (10 weeks long), but right now most of my days are spent just sitting around doing nothing and feeling pathetic. What can I do within a month to start improving my situation? I feel like there are no options. I just feel so bored and pathetic sitting here and doing nothing while others must be having a blast and doing stuff on summer break. Another potential factor is, even though I've never been diagnosed with anything, in the summers I have always had more anxiety and depression-like symptoms. I get more mini-anxiety attacks in the summers, I'm more likely to spend a day just not being able to get out of bed, just wanting to cry a lot, etc. I feel like this is exacerbated by not having a lot of brain stimulation and a lower amount of physical activity during the summer.

What are some things I could do alone and at home with little to no resources for developing new hobbies? Any and all advice is appreciated. Thank you.",07May2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

Need advice. I feel like I already know what most will say but it's incredibly hard to handle and I feel overwhelmed. I found out last week that I was pregnant. I've been with my boyfriend for a year and we just got back from a trip to celebrate our anniversary. While we were away I felt the symptoms of pregnancy. He was joking about getting me killed and I joking about running away to Sweden and naming the baby after him. He returned back from our trip and did a test right away. Two positive results. He cuddled that night and made love and it was a very lovely night. The next day he came with me to the doctors and was very supportive alluding to being happy about us having a baby. We don't live together, I spent the next two days alone. I told him over the phone we needed to talk about this seriously and he agreed and picked me up. At his place he told him he wanted me to have an abortion. I told him I didn't want that and I was prepared to break up with him and leave to my home town in Sweden to raise the child with my family. He got very angry at this, to the point where it scared me. I got up and walked towards the door, I said he wasn't in the right state to keep talking and that it was best I go home so we could think. He then ran at me grabbed me by the neck and threw me to the ground as he repeated that he ""had a lot of money and could get me killed"". I yelled for him to stop, he didn't, he grabbed my neck again and continued to choke me on the ground, I pulled my phone out of my pocket and dialed 911, hoping they would hear me I yelled ""I'm pregnant and my boyfriend is beating me"". He grabbed my phone and then he pushed his large mirror and it fell and shattered on top of me. I thought he would use the glass to kill me. I ran into a corner and asked him to please let me go home. He denied me to go home and denied me my phone. He said he would never let me leave to Sweden and never let me have his baby. I had to calm him down and then we laid together on the couch and watched TV to calm him down. The next day he demanded I get an abortion. He won't leave my side. It's now two days later and I am still here. My family wants me to leave and go back to Sweden. My boyfriend apologized for hurting me and said he was very stressed with no sleep. I am unsure who to trust and what to do. I do not want an abortion, but I am afraid of him :(",07May2019,1
665,"Hi r/advice

Long time lurker first time poster. 

I recently started “dating” this girl. It’s a weird start because I started out as side dude, while she was still with her SO. We both had feelings for each other, and I was hoping that it would just work. 

I decided drunkenly one day, that since it wasn’t working, I was going to tell her man that shes been cheating. They end up breaking up, which I honestly feel terrible about, but it is what it is. 

Surprisingly, her and I’s relationship improves, we start seeing each other (to my thoughts) exclusively. One day she comes over and asks to take a shower, comes out and says that theres another guy other than the original dude that she had slept with the night before. Obviously I am upset, but I still love this girl and want to work through it. 

She says she’s not going to see him again and that its over with him. Obviously, she still talks to him, and one night at the bar, this new dude starts a fight with me (wrong place wrong time). Now she truly is done with this guy (I assume, maybe Im placing my trust in the wrong spot). 

However, this week has been rough for me. My uncle unfortunately passed away, and due to that I had attempted to overdose. That same night, she spent the night up at her exs house. She told me about it beforehand and all, but it obviously still fucking hurt. 

r/advice, I love this girl. Even though we have both done wrong, I want it to work. What do I do to make this all work out? How do I get her to choose, because right now shes in this weird state where it seems like she just wants everything, but doesn’t want to commit to anything.

667,"I'm 27 and currently learning how to drive I'm a very nervous driver which is largely due to the fact I was in a very serious car accident as a back seat passenger about 8 years ago, the car went through a wall and flipped a number of times, I woke up with blood and smoke everywhere an absolutely harrowing experience. Luckily I don't have any permanent serious injuries. I've been taking lessons for a while now and practicing on the weekends in my boyfriend's car but I don't seem to be making much progress and everyone around me seems to getting frustrated including my driving instructor. 

I tend to drive slow and I have difficultly taking opportunities due to fear. I gained a little confidence a while back and then while out practicing so many other drivers became impatient with me and overtaking me in dangerous situations etc which destroyed my confidence. Now I find the experience of learning is becoming more difficult as opposed to easier! I have tried to explain to my instructor and my boyfriend the crippling fear I have of getting into or causing an accident but I don't think they fully understand. They just say stop worrying or stop caring about what other people are doing or thinking (I tend to get extremely nervous if I'm in someone's way or taking too long to do something which leads to more mistakes)  but it's not that simple. 

Today my driving instructor told me he thought I wasn't taking the whole thing seriously, which I was pretty insulted by I take driving really seriously because I know what it's like to be in an accident. He told me that I need to have a serious conversation with myself because of my lack of progress. He gave me 3 options;

1. Do more lessons and practice constantly. (Lessons are expensive and I'm already doing as many as I can realistically afford and I can only practice on the weekends)

2. Try an automatic. (which is awkward because automatic lessons cost more and I don't have access to an automatic to practice in) 

3. Give up. 

I left the lesson is tears. I was able to hold it in until I got out of the car and I wouldn't be someone who cries easily especially in front someone! I'm not sure if this is a tough love approach or what but to be honest I feel like giving up.

668,"I (19) have a handful of mental illnesses which keep me from working, but I really badly want to make money and move away from my parents. I have no idea what I can do or where to start.
Context below:

I have been diagnosed with general anxiety (really bad social anxiety is part of that) and depression and I have been struggling through this for a long time. I’ve passed screening tests for ADHD (not sure if its really ADHD or just shared symptoms with the other stuff), and my psychiatrist thinks I may be on the autism spectrum. Only, he was unable to get a specialist’s opinion because my town is in the middle of nowhere.

All of that ^^ has made it extremely difficult to do normal people things. I used to do well in school but I dropped out, even after trying homeschooling and alternate programs. Going even 2 days in a row drained the life out of me and I constantly choke up around people. I also cry a lot, something my counsellors have pointed out to me. How can I get a job like that? I’ve tried to apply for jobs before, but worry just keeps me awake at night and I’ve never made it to an interview. I’ve even had one scheduled, but I skipped it because panic and just never showed my face again.
I couldn’t do school, and there’s no way I can get a real job like this. But living between two houses back and forth with separated parents is not helping. I don’t have a fantastic relationship with either of them. They are both very career oriented and ask me about school/work constantly. When he was my age, my older brother had already moved out and they expect the same of me. Honestly, I think having my own place would help me mentally as well. I want this the most in the world right now.

I’m trying to apply for disability, but I’m worried I won’t be accepted because I don’t need help with basic functions, home living, and things like that. I just can’t work. I know getting officially diagnosed with autism might help with this, but I don’t know how to do that.
I’ve also thought about making an etsy shop or doing art commissions, but I have next to no online presence/following and I’m not super confident so I don’t know if this is a viable option. I sincerely doubt I will be able to make much more than pocket money, if anything. Also don’t know where to start.

This is getting kind of long winded but hopefully it’s not hard to follow. Any advice about what I can try is greatly appreciated, whether it’s how to get started on any of this or something I haven’t thought of yet.

tl;dr: can’t get a regular job but wish to make money so that i can live on my own asap. what are my options?",07May2019,2

We do a lot more than we should for a company of our size, but it's mainly due to the fact it's just us two running it. My conflict is this, I want to move on and leave my job, but I'm so integrated in to it, and I manage so many aspects of the work we do that I know my colleague won't be able to manage it all (he's overworked as it is).

I wish I could say that I'm taking care of my body, my health and how I look because I want to look good for my own sake but it's not true. If I could be 300 pounds and be liked by the girls I want to be attracted to me I would be. The thing is, the cold hard truth of life is it's not the case.

I'm doing efforts right now to eat healthy, lose weight and stay fit by working out and all that stuff and if somebody would ask me why I'm doing it, if I would be completely honest, I would answer is to be as attractive as I can possibly be and be able to get attention and attraction from girls. The 2nd reason is so far behind that reason that it's almost irrelevant. This realization is destroying my will to continue my journey of losing weight and taking care of my body. I feel like a complete shallow dude. 

How can I change my view on this? Should I even change my view? Is it the view of most men currently in our society?

671,"I was in a car accident sometime in late 2017 and it was an extremely minor accident. So I was at a stop light where you are able to turn right. There was a car in front of me and I didn't notice she had not moved even though the lane was clear. So I let go of my brakes...probably going like 2-3mph and I hit her vehicle in the back. There was a tiny scratch smaller than an inch. This scratch was caused from my front license plate. Now we both did the usual but I didn't complete my part which was to get her DL Number and insurance. But I gave her my DL # only because I thought the incident was not worth mentioning to my insurance. I told her I would pay for it but then the coming day she sent me a photo of how much was the repair it was around $400. I thought to myself that was total BS because the paper showed rear bumper repaint. So I was like hell nah. You don't have to repaint the bumper for a scratch you can't even see unless you told em. So I text her that I'll let my insurance handle it instead but she wouldn't give me her insurance.  
So i ignored her since she was being a pain in the ass for being unnegotiable. 2 years later my insurance called my mother and told her I had -2 points on my record. Now I'm sorta fked until it's cleared. Not just that but all the data I had on the person was on my previous phone that I traded in a long time ago. Now I have no evidence to protect myself or clear the false report of ""damaging her vehicle and injuring her of $3000 medically."" From this point I feel like I just have to wait this out, but I can rebuttal her argument by asking if the air bags were deployed since the accident was that bad y'know.

676,"Hello everyone, I've been smoking cannabis now for the past 10+ years. About a year and a half ago i made the decision to stop all leafy green and switch to the concentrated oil you'd smoke in the vape pen. Match1 is the brand i prefer to smoke. With that being said, towards the end of january (26th to be exact) i stopped smoking the pen and HAVE NOT used any cannabis products. Not even CBD products. With that being said, i administer self testing (dip stick) drug tests and seem to fail. Its been over my 90 day peroid and still am positive for THC. Weather its the dollar store drug test (dip stick) or the 5 level spectrum cups that you peel the sticker back to view results (after you urinate in the cup) it's always positive for THC. This is very frustrating. Ive spent time in the sauna at a local YMCA to try to ""sweat it out"" and have even went to measures of taking 2000mg of niacin for 10days to help with this sticking to ""fat cells"" so ive read, it seem to only make me look like a lobster for the first few hours after i took it while making my skin itchy. Along with this ive tried a liver flush (milk thistle) which someone suggested @ a local nature tyme store. I lost about 100lbs in the past year (i was 280lbs and am now 190lbs to 200lbs) all ive done is stopped deinking mt dew and replaced it with Poland Spring water WHAT AM I DOING WRONG?

679,"Hello everyone, I hope you're all having a great day, it would be lovely if you listened to my story and gave me help, thank you in advance.  


I'm 19 and I currently am studying for my high school exams which I failed to pass in last year, which was the first time taking that class, my family and friends and my parents especially have pushed me every hour every day to study (even though I was studying hard), I was also going through severe depression during that time, I put up with everyone pushing me into a corner for a long time, my parents would lie to everyone I know telling them how bad I am and how bad I study and everyone believed them without hesitation, everyone turned against me so fast, they also put me in a school I didn't want to be in despite me telling them for weeks not to put me in that school because I knew this was gonna happen. So at some point I cracked and gave up completely and was focused on committing suicide to end the crap, so I failed on purpose because what's the point in passing if I was going to die anyway? My family would casually yell and give me crap every single day literally every single time they see me. One time they gave me crap and I snapped and was going to legitimately kill myself but they sent my classmate to find me which he did, he and his friend put me in a submission lock and brought me back to my dad to talk, which funny enough, he spent 3 hours lying to them about how terrible I am.  
That was the backstory needed and I apologize if it's lengthy.  


This year I am retaking the exams to supposedly pass, 2 months ago I defeated depression and quite proud of that but they were still giving me a hard time but less frequent now (honestly I'm surprised myself I didn't fall into drugs and alcohol and all that bad stuff considering I'm still here alive), normally before every time I am sad I would put my emotions into paper which is hip hop, I thought about not passing and work to make a living with my music with the knowledge and skills I've accumulated to do so this year, my question and the advice I seek is as follows:

1.Should I stay to pass and go to college despite the fact I have to interest in the given majors whatsoever and just live miserably to be honest.

2.Stand my ground and follow my dream to make a living as a musician, work hard , get a job and support myself towards that dream, so even if music didn't work out then I can support myself considering I am a minimalist.

Please note that standing my ground and not going through the exams means I will have to deal with them being the most toxic they will ever be, and that on it's own just bothers me, I don't hate them but I don't want to hate them either, I don't want to spend my life with toxic and abusive people and work a job I truly despise and hate, I just want to be happy doing what I do, if I die chasing being a musician as a poor man then so be it, at least I'll be happy.

My grades however are beyond average. I've been passing my NCEA with the highest endorsements possible which confuses my teachers, parents, and school mates because usually, low attendence means low grades.

It was shocking that YouTube even allowed these videos, but if YouTube didn’t ban them are they even considered child porn?

I've been an aupair in europe with this family for around 5 months now. Everything has been going really well with them in regards to myself, except for a couple of moments where I felt uncomfortable with the way the mom puts a lot of pressure on her son (the one I'm taking care of) to be very perfect and do really well at school. She's quite severe with him sometimes but I did think that it was just typical being a little hard on him because she wants him to do well situation.

However, he told me tonight that tonight she slapped him in the face when she was angry, and that she does it a lot. He's only a child, this is obviously very wrong. I feel quite helpless, because I know he told me this in confidence (since he only just told me and I have been here for a while but we have quite a strong relationship now).

Basically, I want to do something to help, or just something?? But I'm not sure what the right course of action would be. I did consider bringing it up with his parents but I am worried about some form of retribution that will be given to him if I do that. I thought about talking to their father about it but honestly I dont see how this kind of thing could have been going on for years without him knowing. Basically, I just feel stuck.

Because of the flagging I have to submit a photo of my ID. This is a problem because I am techniquely not allowed to have a PayPal account because I am not 18 yet. I know it was stupid of me to do but without PayPal it is really hard to sell things on eBay.  Anyway because I have a good amount of money in the PayPal account I dont want to lose, what should I do? If anybody has any experience in this situation it could save me alot of money.

704,"First reddit post! I’ve been living with my current roommates for a year now and none of us talk to each other/don’t really like one another. When we first moved in, one of the roommates supplied her
Tupperware and never said I or my other roommate couldn’t use it (for instance, she uses my plates/bowls/silverware). Throughout the year, I’ve done the most cooking by far and have been using her Tupperware to store leftovers in. I cook a lot of curry and red sauce dishes and it has stained the plastic of some of them. I’ve tried multiple ways to get it out but the stain refused to budge. So the question for you guys, should I replace the Tupperware that is stained? My boyfriend says I don’t need to but I’ve found exact replacements for it online that I could buy. We’re all moving out in about a month and when she’s packing up her stuff she’s definitely going to notice the stains. On one hand it’s like, if you’re putting them out for general use then you run the risk they might get messed up but on the other these are hers. Just for reference these are Snapware plastic ones and about three have stains.",07May2019,1

I am a typical student who takes regular classes (Band,Honors English,Bio,etc...) and i'm wondering what should I do with my algebra issue. In my first semester, I had a teacher who didn't actually teach and ridiculed others for asking questions instead of asking teammates. Now I switched teachers but this class i'm in advanced farther than the other algebra 1 classes and i'm panicking as it's screwing my gpa up. Can anyone PLEASE give me advice on what should I do including sites that could even help me?",07May2019,2

This concerns my life and the possibility of it ending. Sorry about the big mess, I am in a very emotional state right now.

Here we go. I am a 16 year old transgender person, AMAB. Since I was born I have had abusive parents. My mother stopped beating me when I turned 6, she didn't know better and it was how she was brought up. My dad has been abusive since I remember. 

In summer 2 years ago I indirectly mentioned suicide to my family and they got me admitted to a psychiatric hospital after a few days. The last day was tough. I was asleep in the late afternoon/early evening and a doctor ripped me out of bed and pinned me to the floor, while I was in my underwear, and angrily told me I'd comply with the police's orders or I'd get forcibly removed. A few minutes later the police arrived and I was to leave to go to the psychiatric hospital. 

It was hell. Literal hell. That place made me more suicidal than I had ever been and had I had the ability to, I'd have outed myself. Well, in february after that I came out to my family about being trans. They seemed to take it well and was supportive. Bad news was/is that in Denmark (my home country), it's not easy to get access to hormones. I fell into a depression and I dropped out of school. This whole trans thing also made me feel shameful and made the anxiety I had a lot worse. After many months of locking myself in my room and not going outside, I decided I had enough and wanted to pursue hormone therapy. 

So my dad and I went to our doctor many times to get him to get us an appointment with this 'Special Clinic', which I'll call SClinic from now on. He said he'd do that, but he didn't. We then went back and he did it, and we got rejected. We tried again and got rejected and found out we had to get me mentally evaluated. I wasn't able to do this because of my anxiety, which was way too bad. So nothing happened and I spent more and more time in my room. A therapist was also to come once a week to talk to me about my anxiety, which only made it way worse. Often, she'd just come into my room without knocking or any warning and I'd be sitting in my chair, frozen and sweating from anxiety. I'd tense up so much I'd nearly pass out. It was horrible and nobody seemed to care. 

Then in December 2018, my dad claimed I had thought of and threatened to kill someone, which immediately made him call our doctor to get me back in the psychiatric hospital. This was way too much for me. I had PTSD from last time and I spent a few hours crying and yelling at my dad that it'd be the downfall of me and I wouldn't be able to take it, and that I'd only turn suicidal. All of this backfired and he said that all of this showed how unstable I was and only reinforced that I had to be taken away. So I got taken away. 

This was made even worse by the fact that I had invested a lot of my time in a video game called Destiny 2. This was minutes before a highly anticipated DLC for the game, one that I had already spent a lot of time preparing for. It all got torn away from me that evening.

So on Dec. 4th, I got admitted to the psychiatric hospital. It was so so so tough for me to be there again. You see, I'm an extremely emotional person and associate emotions to everything. This was literal hell. I cried for hours on the floor wrapped in a blanket because of my anxiety. Eventually I fell asleep. I woke up later, still on the floor. I crawled into bed and fell asleep again crying. There was no privacy either as a nurse came in every 15 minutes to check that I wasn't ""dead"", their literal words. I hid under the blanket every time they'd come in or whenever I thought they'd come in. It was horrible because I never knew when they'd come in, so I spent a great amount of time under the blankets. It was hot, very hot. I'd be lying under the blankets, sweaty, anxious, and frozen with fear. I have a terrible tolerance to heat, and I always had a headache because of this. They'd also often tell me I had to move or show myself because they ""thought I was dead"". I couldn't do that because of my anxiety and because I was just frozen with fear, so they would come over and slowly lift up the blanket, which I'd immediately pull down, and then they'd leave. 

I was told I likely had autism. Which was apparently one of the reasons I was still there. Nothing else seemed to matter to them other than trying to prove I had autism. I don't. I do not have autism and have never showed signs of it. And of course none of my words had any power behind them since I was ""just a child"". Suicidal thoughts were also a daily thing. I had constant suicidal thoughts because of being there, and if I as much as mentioned it, my dad would get angry and tell me I was unstable and that was the reason I was there. Even though that hospital was the reason for it. It was one big circle of sh\*t. 

I did not eat anything for 15 days of being there. I lived on water and chocolate milk. I was never hungry and even if I was, I'd be unable to eat. It was a truly horrible experience being there. I spent hours and hours staring at the ceiling because I had nothing better to do. On the 20th of Dec, I was told I'd be forcefed if I didn't eat. I was horrified by this. I decided it was enough and I asked if I was allowed to go home from Dec, 24-27th. I was. I decided to spend 2 days playing Destiny 2 again, then on the night of the 27th, I ran away from home. I ran away to another country and lived with a friend. 

About a week later google notified me of a new device logging into my email. It was the police or my father. I immediately locked them out and deleted everything on it. Luckily nothing there could tell them where I was. Later that day I received an email from my father. (I'll make this part short as we have sent many emails back and forth). I got him to blow off the search for me. However, now if I decide to stop communicating with him, he'll of course get the search started again. 

I have been living with this friend for 4.5 months now and we live just fine. I am unable to get HRT (Hormones cuz I'm trans), which is one of the only issues right now. It's easier where I am now, than back at home though. 

So, earlier today I received an email stating that I have 3 offers from the government back at home, and if we do not come to an agreement, I will be brought back home. I am not going back home under any circumstances AT ALL. I don't care if I'm starving on the streets or not, I will not go back to Denmark. Now, the government knows where I live right now, and it's likely that they will soon come to get me if nothing happens, which will force me on to the streets and possibly make me flee to another country. I'd be a 16 year old child without a home, battling starvation on the streets and in the wilderness; in some of the most developed countries on earth as well. That is crazy to me. All of this happened because I wanted HRT.

&amp;#x200B;

So now I am asking you, what can I do? 

\- I am not going back to Denmark under any circumstance, whatsoever.

\- I want to eliminate or reduce the risk of being sent back as much as possible.

\- I have to move out of my current home.

\- I do not have money.

\- I do have a passport.

&amp;#x200B;

Please don't ask what the governments offers were, they are unacceptable to me.",07May2019,1
707,"I recently emerged from a treatment center for issues I had prior to going. My mom was with me through my entire recovery. About midway through, she suggested the military. I ended up just going with it, thinking it was pretty much my only option for a secured future. It took a lot of hard work to get in due to the fact that I was in treatment, but things after went differently from what I expected.

I figured upon leaving treatment I would be on my own until I left for the military. Not so. I reconnected back with a few old good friends and now we are closer than ever. We all want to go move out together and attend Universal Technical Institute in California while simultaneously working our respective jobs and working on building an auto detailing business. It's fun, risky, spontaneous, and it's the kind of stuff I live for. It is what I want to do.

I have not told my mom of my plans yet. I am extremely worried of her reaction. Yes, I know, it doesn't really affect things logically, but I love her and want her to be behind me on this. I'm worried that if I tell her she will get extremely disappointed and upset, and even worse, become paranoid and worried that I'm sinking back into an old life pattern.

How can I go forth with my plan and also keep my mother reassured that I am confident in my plans, and also try to help her see that even though financially and such it is not as good of an idea as going to the military, it's how I want to live my life. For example: my older brother is an actor living in North Hollywood. He loves what he does and is very happy despite being financially unstable. I don't want to just make myself get through five years of military service for money because I need it; that is not my idea of ""living"". I want to put myself out there despite the risk of failure(s).

709,"I'm posting on behalf of a friend, so I'm going to keep it as vague as possible.

My friend was a victim of sexual battery by her ex and there's a high possibility that she's now pregnant. She told me that she's not in any shape to carry this child to term, so I recommended she look into planned parenthood, but she cannot pay for the abortion herself. Does Planned Parenthood offer any financial assistance?

She also has a child from a prior marriage, but she's up to her neck in bills. I cannot offer her financial assistance, beyond a meal or so whenever we hang out, so I'm trying to come up with ideas to help her stabilize her financial situation. She has her own business and I'm going to try to brainstorm with her to help her total revenue and income. But are there any other non profits in Texas that we could reach out to?

She also has no health insurance, but needs medication for several pre-existing conditions. I'm at a complete loss where to go for this. I'm not sure if there is any low income health insurance assistance in Texas.

Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated.

She's a sweet and genuine person. Between a handful of bad decisions and a terrible string of luck, she's found herself between a rock and a hard place. I'm just looking for ways to help her out.

She ran away this morning after the neighbor's dog escaped and ran over to our lawn, sending our puppy running from our house. My mom was right there when it happened, but she was too busy stoping the neighbor's dog to notice when the puppy bolted. Our dog doesn't have a chip and wasn't wearing a collar at the time.

717,"Let me premise this by saying I come from a very strict and very conservative family. I’ve moved out, but my sister is 16 so she still lives with my parents.
She’s been dating a boy a grade ahead of her since she was 15. I’ve never really disliked this kid, but they’d been caught sneaking around together a couple times and every time he was the one pressuring her into it. His parents are very nice, but the majority of their kids are pretty wild in one way or another, including him. 
Prom was the other day and my mom found out that he and my sister were planning on going back to his house after prom because his parents weren’t home to do things my mom described as ‘inappropriate’ by looking at her Apple Watch. I’m assuming they were planning sex or something of the sort. (Also, yes I know going through her phone is terrible and controlling. My mom used to do it to me too but that’s a whole other story). Anyways, what bothers me isn’t that they were sneaking out, but based on what my mom told me he was manipulating and pressuring her into it. 
He said things like “you must not love me” and “you never show me affection” and “I’ve been very patient this past year” and other things to manipulate her. 
She’d respond with things like  “I’ve been trying to change for you” and the like. 

I care a lot about my sister, and I don’t want her to do anything she’ll regret or end up pregnant or something like that. She’s very naive, has no proper sex education, and this is her first ‘real relationship”. I know what I want to say, which is “you need to dump him immediately because he’s a piece of crap” but she’s 16, bullheaded, and doesn’t care what anyone else thinks. So far my mom hasn’t done anything that’s done much other than make my sister mad and she’s just hoping they’ll break up soon.

718,"A friend of mine lost her virginity at 13 to a 20 year old guy. She says it was completely consensual and does not consider what happened wrong in anyway today (She is 22 now). I wanted to argue that a child of 13 can’t consent but she was very standoffish and I didn’t want to preach to her about her personal business so I said nothing. Recently we were watching a tv show where a similar situation happened with a 13 year old girl sleeping with an older partner and I mentioned it being wrong/fucking creepy , forgetting her situation when i said this, and she got a angry. She went on to argue that 13 is definitely old enough to have sex even with an older partner and wouldn’t hear any arguments to the contrary. Didn’t want to hear that they weren’t ready for that psychological because she feels she was when she lost her virginity. The argument for them not being ready for the responsibility and risks of having sex she didn’t want to hear because she thought the same could be said of 18 year olds. At this point I could feel I wasn’t going to do any good saying anything else with how angry she was getting so we dropped it.

721,"This is going to be a long story, so please bear with me. Thanks for reading! 

So a little backstory, I work in a classroom as a therapist and there are other aides as well as the teacher present. There is this child (who is a twin), he has low-functioning autism and I am not sure if I should file a report for child abuse/neglect. He and his twin (I worked with him previously last year) are both on the spectrum. They always come to school in dirty clothes, and they smell horrible. The teacher found out that they have dogs in their house, so this may be contributing to the odor, although there are other signs of neglect. Their skin is always very dirty - so bad, that if we take a tissue and wipe it across their neck, it turns black. This includes their nails and feet, which are never washed (I work in the classroom 2 days/week but have confirmation from the aides that they always look like this). They are aggressive and this is just one of their behaviors, but one twin’s face is scratched up pretty badly (and we have confirmation from the mother that the other twin attacked him). The thing is, it seems like the mom doesn’t watch her sons because in the classroom he has a 1:1 aide and has attempted to attack some students in the past, but we stopped him before he could. We were obviously watching him so nothing happened. I understand the mother has two sons with low functioning autism but it really seems like she doesn’t keep an eye on them. Even at drop off in the morning, we have to get him from a corner or in a tree because the mom isn’t watching him and is on her phone. 

So as far the aggressive behaviors go, they are way more aggressive at home than at school (most likely because we attend to him) and at home, he bites both parents and they don’t do anything about it. In my field, the proper thing to do is remove the child and block them from any other attempts and don’t provide attention because otherwise, they will become reinforced from your reprimands (if the behavior is attention seeking). But the mother just laughs about it. 

Yesterday, the twin in our class came to school with bruises on his back and on his elbow. It looks like someone grabbed him (probably his mom) and he was nursing it in the classroom. He is also non-verbal so we can’t ask him how he’s feeling and we are still working on communication skills. When his mom picked him up yesterday, she started saying, “oh it’s okay, don’t worry, mommy’s here” like something was wrong and he didn’t want to go home with her. She doesn’t usually say things like that and hardly ever seems to care in the first place, so it was a bit odd. The teacher discussed things and said she knows the family  lives in a tiny apartment, so maybe they are just low income and can’t afford to shower their kids or clean them. She doesn’t want to report anything because she taught a similar kid who was just very poor. 

Another thing I forgot to add is that both children, are very very sick. They have a ridiculous cough, that sounds like bronchitis and this sounds unbelievable, but for the time I’ve known both boys (2 years) they have ALWAYS been sick with a bad wet cough. The mom said she was going to take them to the doctor but I think she was lying because we just brought it up, and both boys are still sick. It just raises a lot of red flags and I want to file a report, but wasn’t sure if I should because the family could just be insanely poor and can’t afford health care or dental care/whatever (their teeth have holes, too). I don’t want to wrongly file and have a huge ordeal. Just need advice on what to do because the other staff members don’t think it’s a big deal. 

TL;DR - I work with two aggressive kids who have low functioning autism, who are always dirty, sick, and have bruises or scratches on their bodies. It seems like the parents are neglectful but we know the family doesn’t have a lot of money so I don’t want to wrongly accuse them of child abuse.",07May2019,1

724,"To be 23 years of age before the fall hits again, should I try for year #6 of university? After high school graduation I was told straight up that I was going to university, I find just about everything interesting since being introduced to the atmosphere of academia. I've been bouncing around on topics for the last 5 years (mainly within the arts/humanities) and mentally it has been a wild ride, entering adulthood always is though isn't it?

On and off different antidepressants I'm finally tapering off my last ""happy pill"", within the next few weeks to a month I'm hoping to finally try a different ADHD medication to see if it aids me better than my current one. Due to 4ish years of bouncing around on antidepressants and reciving an ADD/ADHD-PI only a year ago, I have been relatively unsuccessful in university as a whole- however in saying that I totally appreciate the fact that my coping mechanisms haven't been great and that's more or less the reason for my own personal failures. Paxil being much harder to taper from than my previous meds, from about October until the end of March I did a taper that sent me into much deeper of a depression than I had anticipated, along with a few other hard hitting life events I've only since began feeling a little better. Said period of depression will probably lead to a letter from the university telling me not to come back in the fall, if that is the case I'll probably sign up for a program at the community college (it's pretty reputable) and if I do follow that path I will probably finish one or two programs before either branching off into a career or going back to university and picking up where I left off... though I could do both I suppose. The uncertainty I feel in my current state however makes me more and more anxious with each passing day, and the depressive episode I am still to fully peer out of, I didn't really inform many people close to me of so they have no idea what state my grades or mental health may be in and that alone gives me a higher bpm than normal.

Can I salvage my spot in my current university program? I personally doubt it but could certainly inquire, I don't know if my nerves are up for it though. If I decide to sway and go to the college then I am in a different environment almost entirely and instead of 7 total scattered classes through the weekdays it is a 8-4 Monday to Friday thing.

For some time now I’ve been unable to make my mind stop obsessing about certain things to do with gay issues. 

The avoiding of thinking about it makes it just a constant looming threat, and that it’s gay pride month just means rainbows and the words are everywhere.

It really grinds me into the ground, I can’t eat or sleep. I feel sick. 

It’s not totally new but, I can hear voices and I think people are whispering about me, like in the next room or behind my back. 

The only way I stop the thoughts is to really hurt my leg so I punch it, and I have bruises (but I’ve never self harmed properly). 

When I drive home from work I cry in the car so my wife doesn’t see. I’m not really sure what I can do to stop all this.",07May2019,1
730,"I (M 17) was sitting behind the girls in my classroom (17-19) and I always hear them talk about stuff, like at what hour they will go to the bar, the series that they watch, etc. I never paid any attention to what they ever said, I'm usually working with my asignments alone or in groups with my friends, when I work alone I do it with my headphones so I don't hear that much.
I don't know why but today I didn't feel like listening to music, and I could hear what they were talking about, they were having a conversation about the boys they liked. After hearing that I started to be self concious about how I look, how I wear clothes, how my hair looks, how fat I look, how fat I am and suddenly I felt a rush of sadness in me, like if nothing ever matters if I don't have someone to love. I've never felt like this, I've never cared about having sex nor having a girlfriend, I don't like boys either, it was like I had defined what I wanted to do and relationships weren't in my plan, but after hearing how much they loved how this person looks, I'm going to repeat myself, I felt sadness. I'm in High School, last year, and I wanted to know if I'm capable of pulling this off, start a diet and shit, am I in time? Should I just not pay any attention? Does this even cares at all?

I don't really play anymore but there are some things I'm fond of and want to hold onto if I want to jump back on at any point.  One thing I won in a reddit raffle but don't really have much attachment to is now worth around 15 to 20 dollars on the steam market place.  The other things I'd be willing to sell would probably get me 3 to 5 dollars total and there's a bunch of stuff that I can't sell for steam credit but will probably give away instead.

Should I:

* Sell the 15-20 dollar item and give away the rest in good faith?
* Sell the small items and raffle away the big item as a big thank you to the community?

744,"When I was 5 my family thinks I was molested by my cousin (lets call him B) because I told my mom “B touched me in my no no place”.  Of course there was a huge family blow up but that was 14 years ago and it gets brought up and fought about every now and then. My cousin is a little messed up in the head and my mother said he’s done something like this before to another girl but we just all ignored it because I apparently wouldn’t talk to anyone about it and I pretended like it didn’t happen. 

Now I went to therapy around the age of 13 for it because my previous therapist said I was showing signs of sexual abuse. I went to the new therapist for a good 6 months before we gave up, but that therapist was convinced something bad happened just because I was showing signs when we were in session. She said that my memories must be blocked or repressed. 

Here’s where it’s starting to effect my life ( I THINK ) even after 14 years. I’m 19 (F) years old now and I cannot have sex without being extremely drunk. Like the stage right before blackout drunk otherwise I get full blown panic attack. When I started getting intimate with my boyfriend after dating for about 6 months I would getting panicked, like extremely panicked. I would try and ignore it but I couldn’t. Eventually we broke up but that’s for another reason. Now every time I try to have sex with someone I literally can’t get past making out with getting freaked and having a panic attack.

745,"Dear person, 
    Hello. How has your day been so far? I’m really hoping your answer is a “good”, or even better, an “amazing.” A “bad’ is unexceptable. Cheer up! Whatever it is, it will all end in due time. I’m going to get to the point. this note serves as a reminder of your beauty, and to never give up. 
    So, you always hear things like, “be yourself,” or “your amazing.” Well, sorry to break it to you but it's true. Everyone has their good sides and their bad sides. You have to embrace every aspect of yourself, no matter your background or past. Every single human being makes mistakes. It's normal. Heck, it would be weird if you never made them. Every human is imperfect. We all have our life's difficulties and struggles. But the thing is, hope is something you have to cling onto for as long as you can. Hold onto the hope that everything will be okay, and things will pass eventually. Nothing, no scandal or gossip lasts forever. 
    Most people care for what other people think. Some people don't even realize it. Even if you don't want to admit it, everyone cares. But if you really think about it, that is a figment of someone's imagination. A person judging you for something they know nothing about. They may not even know you! Think of it this way, in a few years from now, will it really matter? Everyone is going to go their separate ways after school, and most people will probably forget about whatever their opinion on you was. 
Alright, moving on from that, let's talk about self love and acceptance. You have no idea how important it is to love yourself. That is something you have to do before really loving someone else. You may think you aren’t good looking. But, I feel like the person that has to see themselves in the mirror everyday, and to live with themselves everyday is the person that notices all their flaws. Sometimes, this person doesn't notice all the amazing parts to them. Everyone has flaws, but whats a key factor is to accept those flaws. Live with yourself, and be happy with what you were given. Being uncomfortable in your own skin suit is terrible. But, stressing over how you can change yourself is a total waste of time. Your wasting precious time thinking about these bad things. 
    Next thing I want to discuss is people. Some people can be awful, and hurt you a lot. I want to be real with you here. Toxic people, no matter who it may be, should be removed from your life. I didn’t want to be personal here, but I have had toxic friends. We tried repairing our friendship, but it would just be a whole cycle. They bring bad into your life, and even if you care for them, it will not work. Yes, maybe it is a possibility that something may change. However, life will be so much better and clearer without this person. Everyone deserves someone that gives them as much effort as you give them. People will try to bring you down, use you, bring negative energy around you. Some will try to cause you pain. You will meet a person like this in your lifetime. It's an experience no one wants to go through, but it will happen. However, you will also meet wonderful people that love you so much. Pay attention to those. The ones that really truly care. 
There will be days that you feel like you have nothing left, or that you don't want to go on. That you have nothing to live for. That it is so hard to just be here. You have to know, that everything will die down. I really get how hard life might be some days. But you cannot give up. Think about everyone that cares for you. You are loved. Talk to people you trust when you feel down. It helps more than you may think. 
So, Just breathe. Clear your head, take a deep breath and relax. Your future consists of great happiness and success. You will find your way. So, make sure you know that you and your health comes before anything else. I  hope that at least one person has read my words. So many people have malicious intentions, and want to bring negativity into the world. Spreading positivity is something more people have to do. I hope my words had even a small impact. To conclude this, I hope that you have a spectacular day. Whoever you are, know that you are awesome, beautiful, and that you matter. 
                                            
  
p.s. sorry i got really deep here. i felt really motivational today, and so i hope you took these words in. didn't mean to get so cheesy but i'm going to stop now so have a lovely day :)

748,"Hello,


I’m (24 F) and I live an amazing life I guess 

I have graduated from college with honors degree, I had a job and I just accepted at my dream grad school 

My problem is when I was 17, I took this test that determines your whole life, it was governmental and basically if you get X in it. You’ll go to private school, which means if you graduate you’ll go to a good college and then get a job etc.

The thing is I failed, but all siblings passed 

And my parents ignored me for a long time
And this is my fear, being ignored like that

So I worked so hard on myself and look where I’m now, I don’t need that governmental test, I should forget about it right? I can’t! It left with anxiety and fear of mistakes, so that’s why I don’t take steps, I don’t act. And I run out of situations. I’m not responsible, I can’t take steps I can’t make decisions I always ask stupid questions because I don’t want to make mistakes 

I make mistakes at work, I’ve been there only for 2 months. My direct manager was in leave most of these 2 months so I was lost, I asked for help but everyone seemed so busy, it was a crazy period in our organization because of my DM left, when she got back one of the team leaders left so she has to take over everything, as I said it was a crazy period, but now everything back to normal and my DM is back in her position and she found out that I don’t know some things and I make mistakes all the time and most of them are stupid mistakes 

I’m thinking about quitting, but I don’t think it’s a fair decision: A) I have been there for only two months and they were crazy, the organization was facing problems and I’m new! B) Running away is not a solution! Maybe I can run away from but I can’t run away every time I don’t like the situation, that’s not how life works

I want to be initiative! I want to lead my life without worrying about mistakes, I want to be human, a normal human. I want to stop blaming myself for my mistakes, I want to accept that things sometimes don’t work they way we want them to work. I want to forget about the past!
I want to talk without worrying that what I say might be wrong

I don’t want to run away, how can I face life like I never have taken that test

I’m a 24yo guy and currently living with my parents. I’m extremely lonely and depressed, because my town is very small and the nearest city is hours away. I haven’t pursued college yet, but do intend to within the next year. I’ll ideally move somewhere with a college close.

My isolation in life is beginning to become way too much to bear, and it’s impacting my mental health greatly. I want to up and go somewhere new, but I’m extremely nervous to. I’ve brought up moving out to my parents, but they are extremely against it because they don’t want me to leave.

I think it’d help my mental health, and I would ideally go somewhere where it’s more populated with people my age and I could potentially meet friends and maybe a romantic partner. Because where I currently live, friends/girlfriends aren’t an option.

Currently I have about 35k saved up, probably more by the time I actually go through with moving. I hope to move within the year. I’m just nervous about the entire situation, as it’s way out of my comfort zone but it’s something I need to do.

I’m a student at one of the better schools in my state. All of my peers are incredibly smart, kind, and overall just really great people. 

Here we go, I don’t fit in at all. By pretty much everyone’s standards, I’m like... kinda mediocre compared to them. I struggle to focus in class, I never study, I don’t read the books assigned to me, etc. I just have zero passion for any of it. In honors math classes we do all sorts of different things at a really fast pace, and I struggle to keep up. In my English classes we read books (duh lol). I read the first page then just quit. Everyone tells me these books are so deep and amazing to read, but when I try to read them, I just get bored and end up reading through sparknotes 7 times right before the test. It sucks. I watch my classmates enjoy school and learning, and it just makes me jealous. I want to enjoy this stuff, I just don’t for whatever reason. 

Due to the fast paced nature of my school, teachers place a large emphasis on college and career planning, which is another problem for me because, you guessed it, I have no clue where I wanna go and what I wanna do. I go to guidance counseling only to get bummed out because all these careers they think I’d be good in sound boring. My basic outlook on life at this point is I’m gonna spend the rest of my pre-adult life doing things just to satisfy a requirement on a job application, just to spend my adult life doing some boring job I hate.

I tried going back to school recently, and had to drop out in the first semester because of financing and a fasfa screw up. I'm still in extreme debt because of that, and I know that this job won't pay that off. I'm barely able to afford my bills now.

If I wait another year to even think about going back I can be considered independent and maybe get more in financial aid. Even if I did start classes, I can't afford to not work full time so I'd have to take night classes or start online.

If I bring this up to my family they will never stop judging and waiting for me to fail, and tell me that I'll fail again. But I don't want to be stuck in the future with a degree that is worth nothing and a job that physically hurts me some days.

762," Hey guys, this is a long story. I dated a guy for two months that I met through okcupid. We went on four dates in total, he was the first guy I ever dated. I didn't prioritize dating when in college, however, after I completed my AS degree, I decided to start dating and that's when I met him. I never kissed or been intimate with a guy before. After our third date, which was his birthday and I got to spend time with him and his fiends, we spent around one month not seeing each other, because he said he was busy. On our fourth date, He invited me last minute (a couple of hours prior) to watch a movie with him. He got kind of sexual with me, such as, he was breathing hard against my back, feeling my upper thighs, hips and stuff with his hands. I felt a bit uncomfortable, but I didn't mind what he was doing. He did lower his head, I believe to try to kiss me, However, because I never kissed anyone, I was very nervous and I didn't look at him. He seemed a bit annoyed, and took his arms off of me. I felt because he asked me kind of last minute to hangout with him, I thought he might be only looking for a hookup so I didn't was to kiss him to lead him on, because I was looking for a relationship. I put my head on his shoulder to show I was still interested, However, his body language showed he was not interesting, such as, he had his arms crossed, so I lifted my head up. I wanted to tell him after the movies, that I liked him and to apologize for not show much interest at the moment. I wanted to explain I don't have much dating experience and we needed to Move slower physically, because I'm not ready for sex. But since hes aid he was tired after we exited the movies, I never got to tell him this part and wanted to save it for the next time we met. I texted him the next day, that had fun and apologized for being shy and akward lol. He never replied back, and two days later, I saw him post an Instagram story with him on a date with another girl, I was hurt by this. I felt the month he didn't see me was due to him talking to someone else. However, he stills follows me on instagram. Six months after the ghosting, he saw me on campus and complimented me on my outfit though Instagram. I replied by with a thank you and tried to initiate a conversation, such as, asking him about his trip over the summer. He never replied back, and I felt kind of annoyed, since he started the convo and then never replied.. Now fast forward to another six months, I just graduated with my Bachelor's degree. He was also at the gradation and graduated with his AS degree. The Bachelor students exit the arena first, and he saw me, I avoided eye contact with him and pretended that I didn't see him. It was my special day, and I didn't want to deal with exes and I felt shocked I saw him lol. He texted me afterwards congratulating me and I congratulated him too, we conversed for a bit and left it at that. However, the issue is I still have feelings for him, and I'm also hurt by the ghosting that happened. I'm not that hurt anymore, since time has passed. I'm not sure if he is interested in me or not?

My dog has never been trained, and has a habit of looking at us when we eat at the table (I just ignore it and he sits down) my sibling doesn't like it and they (sibling) always push away my dog with their knee/foot in a really mean manner and they yell at him. They never want me to give him treats when he is being nice because ""he doesn't deserve it"" and they ALWAYS yell at him for no actual reason. It's annoying because I understand that my dog can be clingy sometimes but you have to be nice for him to leave you!

So now my dog is terrified of them and growls when they enter my room. When he growls, my sibling just yells at him and pushes him away really bad AGAIN. 

Sorry for the long story but my sibling doesn't understand the concept that is: my dog never had training and has separation anxiety, just be nice to him and he will leave you alone. How do I make them understand it? Because it genuinely annoys me when someone is mean to my dog because I know that he is scared. Anyways any advice is good and again sorry for the long ass post 😎😎",07May2019,1
764,"Ok i was talking to my closest friend and he mentioned the fact that this guy is his best friend. I'm good friends with that guy but it just hurt to know that my best friend's best friend isn't me?

&amp;#x200B;

I know that may sound really petty. I'm really not anyone's best friend. I feel like the stupid forgettable side characters on ensemble tv shows. 

&amp;#x200B;

Context if it matters: im 16, grade 10.

&amp;#x200B;

And it's not like im particularly anti social or anything. Lots of people know me and they seem to be fond of me, i try to be nice.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess the main reason I feel shitty about this is I don't feel like I'm one of them. I moved here in the middle of grade 7. I'd never even been in the country before that. So while I was meeting everyone for the first time, they'd known each other for years already. It's like I never had the opportunity to become best friends with someone.

&amp;#x200B;

Even in the country I lived in before I moved, I'd move schools often (by my standards), about once every 2 or 3 years. So my group of friends would always change and I just fucking hate how I dont stand a chance. These people grew up with each other. They've known each other since elementary - a lot of them at least. The others have known each other since middle school which I arrived in the middle in. idk man idek why im posting this",07May2019,0

772,"A little background, my GF and I have been dating for around 8 months now. We both have met/spent a good amount of time around each-others parents. Both my mom and dad really like her. This summer, we are going on a family vacation to Florida for Disney World. My GF really loves Disney world, and naturally, I wanted to bring her along with us. 

Both my GF and I agreed that we would pay for our flight, tickets to Disney, and hotel room (so everything would come from our pockets).

My parents are both completely down with this.  
Here's the problem...

My dad doesn't want us to share a hotel room.

He called me today saying he was going to book the flight and the hotel, but he had the condition that boys would sleep with boys (me and my dad), and girls with girls (my mom, two sisters, and girlfriend).

Remember, me and my girlfriend are both over the age of 18, are going to pay for our own room, and are not irresponsible people.

I understand the mind of the parent, and how it may be kind of weird to get used to (the idea of my GF and I sleeping together).

However, both parents know that we are sexually active, and only care that we use protection. So that doesn't make sense to get upset about.

I am quite frustrated about this because he is in no position to budge on this, and is ""putting his foot down"".

What makes me mad and want to push back is that he isn't interested in having an ""open"" conversation (one that would consider my view on the matter).

How should I handle this in an appropriate and respectful matter? Because this seems a little unnecessary IMO.",07May2019,3

The problem is, I have been to a few job interviews but they all knocked me back because of my availability; they all needed me to work weekends.

775,"I am a 19 year old guy living at home with my Dad(divorced), and younger brother.  I have no job, and no driver licence.  I graduated high school from an online school(2 years) after I was bullied out of brick and mortar school.  I am just getting sick of how I am living right now.  My Dad make roughly 63k a year but at least 20k of that is getting sucked out of him by my mother because of mistakes in the past.  

&amp;#x200B;

I've been suffering from depression since my parents divorced when I was 7 years old and it has negativity affected my mental health since than.  I attempted to take my own life twice, first in 2015 and second in 2016 due to being bullied at school and just a general shitty home life.  I am no longer suicidal but my depression hasn't ever really gone away.   

I originally planned to get my licenses at 18 and start college soon after but I never really realized how fucked I was until after the hype from graduation wore off.  Both of my parents won't be able to help me with college due to both of them living paycheck to paycheck and I'll need to take massive loans out in order to even go to a 2 year tech school or community college. 

I took Drivers Ed when I was 15 like most kids do but I never went for my licences because I went to online school and had no real reason for it because I had extreme anxiety, plus I was more focused on graduating with good grades.  Now here I am at 19, I ask my Dad at least 3 times a week to go out driving with me so I can get some practice behind the wheel so I am able to take the driving test.  But he is always to tired after work to do that, even on weekends.  I can't really ask my mother to help me with it either because she doesn't have a very good vehicle.  No working dash, she uses her phone to gauge her speed; my Dad has a truck that my younger brother uses to drive, but when I've asked him if my mother and I could drive and practice in it he always says no.  I don't have any friends above the age of 21 to drive with either.  

I want to go get a job but the few I have been interviewed for always turn me down because I don't have a licence and I guess I am not reliable because of that.

I am pretty much lost on what to do at this point.  I haven't felt the urge to just leave everything I know more than I do now, but I can't even do that because I am stuck.  I live in rural Northern Wisconsin, basically the boonies so not having a licences makes everything I do difficult.  

Any advice would be awesome because I have no clue on what to do anymore.  If you have any questions about my life that'll make giving advice easier feel free to ask them.  Thanks ahead of time :)  (This is a throwaway account.)",07May2019,1
776,"I’ve known this girl for about 4 years now, and we were quote “best friends” for about two years. We are both in our twenties and go to college together, which is how we met. 

Our friendship started strong but deteriorated quickly. She became VERY toxic and would constantly use me for things: I would drive her everywhere, pay for her food constantly, and was basically her free personal therapist. Eventually it got to be too much and I called her out on it. I told her I didn’t like constantly being used and that something needed to change. 

Well, she didn’t take to kindly to that at all. She proceed to cut me off immediately and blocked me on all social media with no warning whatsoever. 

Keep in mind, this happened a few months ago. I was heartbroken at first, but slowly started to recover. I started going to therapy and started to make new college friends. 

Well, turns out she’s been bad mouthing me to everyone and anyone she knows. The only reason I know this is cause my current friends have heard the rumors. She’s saying I was toxic, emotionally abusive, that I used her, that I’m a terrible person, and on and on. I’ve been trying to let it go but the rumors have been going on for months now and it’s starting to affect my reputation. Multiple people who I was fine with, and even friends with, have now blocked me on social media because of what she’s saying. (Keep in mind, even after our friendship ended I never once said anything bad about her to anyone. I chalked it up as a loss and wanted to move on.) We go to a smaller, private college and have the same major. Therefore, the community is very tight-knit and we know a lot of the same people. I’m getting so anxious, these rumors have been going on for months now and I’m scared that it will eventually effect my future endeavors.

- Diet. Still want to lose 15 pounds and could have been at my goal right now, but kept eating like shit instead.

- Fitness. Used to work out 4 times a week (lifting weights + some cardio). Haven’t been to the gym in ~6 weeks. 

- Bad habits. Currently sleep from like 4 am to 2 pm. Do nothing all day besides playing videogames and watching netflix. 

- Friends. Lost contact with people due to me not going out at all anymore.

- Still dont have a drivers license (was supposed to get it last year, didnt do it.)

- videogames: i was in an amazing spot making money through gaming and was gonna be a pro player, but stopped putting in any effort and wasted my spot on the team.

- Life currently feels pointless because the road back to a ‘normal’ life seems really long and draining.

783,"I'm 19 years old, male. I met this girl earlier this year and she seemed like a very nice girl to me, spiritual and religious but not to the extreme just like me, family orientated, caring, loving, and her future goals about having a family and working and everything just seemed so perfect. Mind you, I've never been in a relationship ever because I always thought that there was no point because it wouldn't lead anywhere since highschool relationships rarely ever work out. Anyways, first year University came along and I had no intentions of getting into a relationship at all whatsoever. But it happened, it just happened, she told me she liked and I told her I liked her too but I told her I'm a very committed person when it comes to a relationship, i told her I get into relationships only with the idea of getting married in the end, it's just how I am. And it's just how she was too, she seemed so excited, she told me she was completely on bored and 100% committed, she told me nothing would be a problem except that she wanted to know if I really was as committed. And I was. 

I told my mother about her, I told her how serious I was, I told her I actually think she's the one, and I told her everything. My then girlfriend was so calmed and relieved but felt guilty that her mom didn't know about me so she ended up telling her. I'm guessing after she told her, her mom sat her down and said a few things that hit her. She told her that if she's really serious about this she wants the families to formally meet and just have a little talk you know, to get to know each other etc, not an engagement by any means. This freaked her out and she began questioning her commitment, she came to me with doubts and second thoughts and here I was sitting with just me and my heart and thinking about how it's exactly what my friends said would happen, that she won't be committed I then began to think if there's ever anyone who's committed in relationships these days. Anyways, I was really really upset for a couple days and today she sent me a message saying how she can't put me through this considering she has doubts. I tell her I'm happy with whatever brings her comfort and now she's asking me if I'm gonna cut her out.

Knowing me, I know it's not going to be easy for me to get over her if I don't cut her out. We share the same friend group so I don't want it falling apart, I want to see her, I want to talk to her, I want to do it but I know it's going to be bad for me.

784,"I'm in my last year of high school and I just don't have the energy to care about anything anymore. I've always felt like I've not fulfilled other people's expectations and that I need to get the best grades possible or I'll be a failure, and when I do get good grades I can't show pride for it because my family always shuns showing pride because ""pride comes before the fall"". If I get good grades it's because God is good and answered their prayers, if I get anything below that it's because I was clearly slacking off even though I barely have any free time from doing assignments and studying.

This school year I've just been too tired to give a shit. My predicted grades have gone from As and Bs to Cs and Ds and my work quality has gone completely and everyone is on my ass for it all the time. I can't get through an hour without someone lecturing me about how silly it is for me to be slacking off and not studying even if I'm literally doing assignments while they're talking to me. Since the new year all of my assignments have been piss poor and late and I just couldn't care less. When I get shouted at I don't feel ashamed or embarrassed like I used to, I'm just bored and waiting for them to leave me be.

Now I have a-level exams coming up in 2 weeks and I've done no revision. When I've tried it feels like someone's pressing into my school and I've had panic attacks which has never happened before, I usually just end up staring at the work until that happens or I give up and go watch TV. I don't find enjoyment out of anything I used to do. I feel empty and exhausted all of the time and don't want to move, nevermind do work and I all I want to leave, whether that be my household or being alive in general I'm conflicted between. The only thing stopping me from topping myself off is the sadness it would cause my friends when they need to focus on exams and the possibility of going to hell.

787,"This is my first ever post on Reddit, so please be kind! 

If i am being honest, I don't really know how Reddit works apart from it can give good impartial advice, which is what I am after. 

Let me start by first saying that this is not a post for you to feel sorry for me, in any way, my head is all over the place and I think I just need to get my feelings out and clearly share them with strangers on the internet

I met my ex in July 2017, I had never been one for thinking that I would turn to the world of internet dating, but after a few friends telling me to give it a go, I thought I would see what it was about. I spoke to a couple of people and was about to give up, then Daniel sent me a message, It makes me a little sad that I cant even remember what our first messages were about, but as silly as it sounds I felt an instant connection, even over a dating app. We messaged for a few days none stop then exchanged numbers and spent all day and night texting each other about anything any everything. We spoke on the phone for hours and after like 5/6 weeks we arranged to finally meet in person. To say I was nervous and scared was an understatement. I had strong feelings for someone I had never met in person, I was scared he was going to be a cafish or a serial killer (you read all sorts of horror stories). 

I very nearly cancelled our first meeting, I kept thinking to myself what was I doing, meeting a random person I met online, but he reassured and we even were speaking on the phone as we walked along the street to each other. I knew the moment I seen him I was going to fall in love with him and I did, I feel head over heels in love with him, he was everything that I wanted in a partner. 

It scared me though, that I was feeling so strongly for him and he seemed reluctant to make things official or serious, he said his past relationship had f**ked him up and he wanted to take things slowly, I was OK with this as I too had a difficult past relationship, so we took things slow, we dated for 6 months when he told me that he loved me and we made our relationship official.  Maybe looking back this should have been my first red flag, was he a commitment phobe? did he want all the benefits of a relationship but not the label of it. He would never want me to tag him in facebook and in our whole 18 months he never once tagged me in facebook or mentioned me in comments on any sort of post, again maybe this should have been a red flag, not that facebook is a massive thing in my life or even his life, I just found it a little strange. I did not even get to meet any of his friends, not one not even once! 

We were together for 18 months, I would love to say we had a perfect easy relationship, but in reality who has those? We did things that got on each others nerves, nothing major I thought, he would leave the toilet roll in the window and it get wet and soggy (still not sure why anyone would do this?) so small silly things, that caused annoyance with each other. I often told him I thought he was handsome and that I thought he was amazing, I find this a perfectly normal thing to want to say and feel about your partner, however apparently this was an issue for him, he thought I was putting him on a peddle stool and that I thought he was perfect (which I didn't). 

I should say that I am insecure person, and I did worry that he was with me until he found someone better, for instance he was still on the dating app after we got together, I had my friend tell me he was showing as online and his photo had been updated to a recent picture of him, he told me he had it linked to facebook and that when he updated his picture on facebook it must have changed it on the dating app, I did not believe this as I not heard of this before, but he deleted his profile and I choose to forget about it.  He would often talk about girls who were his friends, different girls names would crop up and I would question who they were and he would just say they were friends, I was worried they could have been something more, he lived 40 miles away from me so I did not know what he was doing during the week, only what he told me and as stupid as I may have been I trusted him. 

Then something seemed to change in our relationship in October/November time, he was constantly on his phone, I mean he was always on his phone anyway, and was always a little secretive with it, but then he was constantly on it and if he was sitting beside me he would tilt it so the side so I couldn't see it, I don't know if he was aware I knew he was trying to hide his phone, but he was on it so much I started asking who he was speaking to, he said some girls name (which I cant remember) and how she was a friend, again he had given me no reason not to trust him so I had to take his word. Then a few weeks later he went away with work for the week,  when he got back a couple of weeks later, he was again on his phone and I asked what the girl whose name I cant remember was saying and he told me that they were not friends anymore, as she told him that she wanted to be more than friends with him and he told her that he had a girlfriend and that if that's what she wanted, he couldn't be friends with her anymore. This happened while he was away with work apparently, I felt a little hurt that he hadn't told me about this, but he said he hadn't want to hurt my feelings....although I am not sure why this would have hurt my feelings if nothing had happened on his side? 

Anyway, if he wasn't speaking to her, who was he talking to?? So I asked him, this new girl was called Laura, again just a friend! he had 'met' her in an online forum about an author that he likes and they spoke about the books he wrote, I was a little put out that he had given his number to a stranger from a forum, but I didn't really say anything as I didn't want to seem like a crazy girlfriend. 

One night when we were coming back from the cinema, I was driving and he was on his phone, once again and I seen he got a photo of a girl (he obviously hadn't tilted it far enough). This had caused an argument, I was saying why was girls sending him photos of themselves, he was like oh she is going out on a date and wanted my opinion....of what her face?? I totally did not understand and from then on I had it in my head that something was going on. He would say I was crazy and that it was in my head that he loved me and that nothing was going on and the crazy part was I started to believe that, that i was paranoid and that I was imaging it all. 

Then one night he didn't come to bed with me, that was the first time in our whole relationship that we hadn't gone to bed at the same time, even when we didn't go to sleep at the same time, we would always still get into bed at the same time, but he stayed downstairs to apparently play on his PS4, I woke up around 2am and he still was not in bed, he was still downstairs! The next morning, I was awake really early, so went downstairs and watched some TV, he came down around 9 and said he was going to go back to sleep, he finally came back down at around 11, changed and ready to go to town, I went upstairs to get ready and I noticed his laptop open and still on, I thought I would switch it off while we went to town and when I picked it up I could see it was open on facebook messenger.

I knew I shouldn't look, I'm not the type of girl to snoop but I just thought I wanted to see what he was talking to Laura about, what I seen was not what I wanted to see! He was pretending to be asleep to me while he was upstairs in my bed talking to her, he was saying that he loved her and that it was awkward with me, that he couldn't wait to see her, the more I scrolled the more and more messages I seen, with the telling each other they couldn't wait to see each other and that he wanted to spend NYE with her (this was 2 days before Christmas) after telling me that he always spent NYE with friends, he was sexting her telling her all the things he wanted to do with her and that he didn't want to touch me, even though he still did!! It was like a dagger to my heart, all the things that I thought were in my head, because that's what he told me time and time again, were actually true. I couldn't breathe, but I couldn't stop reading what they were saying to each other, how they left each other voicemail messages so they could hear each others voices when he was 'stuck' with me. 

I got ready and went downstairs and calmly said to him, that I wanted him to pack up all of his sh*t and get out of my house, he was like what? so I told him again to get his stuff and go, he says what have you been doing upstairs, and I said what do you think I have been doing, and he had the cheek to say why have you been on my laptop, yes I know I should not have looked, but I really do not think that was the biggest issue!

I felt sick to look at him, so I got up to go in the kitchen, he followed me and when I turned round he was on his phone, the balls on him!!! He was texting her to tell her that I knew, as if that was the first thing he was doing rather than trying to explain things, I was beyond furious. He told me that it didn't mean anything that it didn't mean anything that he was just doing it for attention and that he wanted to be with me, and that she meant nothing. i didn't know what to think or what to feel, I told him that if we stood a chance of even starting to work things out, I wanted him to block her and phone her and tell her that he was not speaking to her anymore, which he did, she then text him saying she thought he was a prick and he showed me this  (which is how I knew what he had text her when he followed me to the kitchen) and he was actually annoyed that she was saying that, I was like are you f**king serious, you have lead her on, what else is she going to think, plus you are a prick, so don't be upset with the label! 

We had a long talk, when I told him to be honest and to tell me everything, he told me that they did not actually meet online, she was meant to be a friend of the girl who wanted to be with him and he said no, that they bumped into each other in town and Laura was with her, and they got talking, now I'm not sure at what point you would think, oh I have a girlfriend and not to exchange numbers, but that clearly didn't happen as after that they were texting all the time. He told me that they had met up once more after that but nothing had happened, he looked me in the eye and sworn that nothing had happened, that they had not even kissed. 

I was clearly upset and the next day (Christmas eve) I was crying and he says why are you crying now, as if I should got over him cheating, in just a few hours, which annoyed me! We spent a very awkward Christmas with my parents, I didn't want them to know what had happened, so I spent Christmas feeling miserable thinking about all of the horrible things he had said about me behind my back while telling me he loved me.

On Christmas night he was packing his things to go home, as he was working on boxing day and he was taking things he didn't normally take, and I remember saying it feels like you are taking everything because you know you are not coming back, and he said I was being silly and that he was coming back in a few days, what could I say, don't take your stuff?? 

I drove him home on boxing day, and while he was putting his stuff in the house, I was crying again, and when he got back in the car he was annoyed that I was crying, he said again, what are you crying for again, I was like because I am sad, you have made me sad, of course I am going to be upset. I dropped him off at work and he kissed me goodbye and I had this feeling that was the last time I was going to see him. 

I sat and cried for a solid 15 minutes before I started to drive home, when I got back all I could think about was what he had done, I did not want to tell my friends as I felt embarrassed about what had happened, so I stewed all day thinking about things over and over again. 

He had promised me that he would not speak to her, but as soon as he had finished work, I couldn't get through to him on the phone, it was constantly engaged, he was clearly on the phone to her, saying whatever he was saying to her. I had sent him a massive message that day saying how he had made me feel, that he lied to me, disrespected me and he had made me feel worthless, he read this and did not even acknowledge it let alone respond, I clearly meant that much to him! 

The next day he finally called and he said that he had something to tell me, that Laura had called him (surprise surprise) and that he had lied to me when he said that nothing had happened that he had slept with her and that she had told him that she had an STI and it was likely that she had passed it to him, and then he had passed it to me! I found it hard to believe someone finds out they have an STI on boxing day, but that's what I was being told.

Not only did I have to deal with the fact he had cheated on me, but had also given me an STI, I was mad and heartbroken, he told me over the phone that he loved her, how much they got on like a  house on fire and how much it had killed him to tell her that she meant nothing to her on the phone at mine, that he did not enjoy being with me, that I was not fun and how he was going to see what it was like at Christmas before deciding to end things with me! I couldn't believe what I was hearing, I told him he was a coward and that he had no balls, as this is something he should be telling me to my face, and that it was unacceptable to tell me all of this over the phone! 

So that's the story of how he broke my heart... 

A few days later I went to give him his stuff back, he said we should wait but I just wanted it to be done with, so me and my friend drove up to his to give him his stuff back. I wanted him to look at me and feel ashamed and like shit, I wanted him to feel like the arsehole that he was. I didn't shout at him, or cry, I was calm and told him to sort his shit out and that he could not treat people the way he had done 

In February we agreed to meet up to give each more stuff back, well for him to collect things that was still at mine, he came round and I wanted him to know I was more than fine, that my life was good, that I had moved on, I had infact been on a couple of dates at that time, but I didn't want him to have the satisfaction of thinking that I was miserable because of him, so I faked how happy I was, maybe a little childish, but I was still heartbroken, but that was not his business to know that. 

I took him to the train station, and I realised that I was never going to see him ever again, we didn't live in the same town, so were not going to just bump into each other one day, this was final and I could not help but cry, I may even think I was sobbing, he hugged me and I know I shouldn't have, but I leaned in for a kiss, we ended up back in the car (in the train station car park) kissing, I hated what I was doing but I couldn't stop my self, we ended up back at mine, and sleeping together. He even made the comment in the middle of a blow job, saying that he wanted to record me saying take this Laura, like what the actual hell!! 

I should say that he had already told me earlier in the night, that him and Laura had got together, I gathered that, after his phone went off every other minute with a message from her, apparently she was jealous of me!! not sure why, when she had stole my boyfriend!! 

I took him back to the station and we said goodbye, I knew that was it and I had to come to terms with it. 

2 months later.... I had text him the month before asking him if he had a backpack of mine, he didnt reply, but then I got a random text saying that he had my backpack and that he was single again. Laura had split up with him and blocked him and was heartbroken, I knew that feeling! He suggested that he came round and we hooked up, I thought to myself he cant be being serious, turns out he was, and mainly just because I was horny, I wanted the satisfaction of sleeping with him then telling to get lost, so I said he could come round, and a couple of hours later he was at mine, I don't really know how it happened but somehow we were talking about how we would become friends with benefits.  

When I think about it, Its stupid to even think how I can bare to be around him after what he did and what he said, but even after everything I still enjoy being around him. When Im with him, I forget everything that went on and for that short time its just us having fun.

I know this cant end well and maybe I am choosing to not think about that yet, but I need advice, can you actually be friends with benefits with your ex when he broke your heart? Does good sex outweigh all of the past history between us?

794,"I'm not really sure how to present this, but here goes.

I am currently 19m. I have 3 half sisters, everyone one of them is several years older than me, and I've never known any of them all that well. We have the same mother, and she is the big problem here. She was absolutely terrible to me as a child. I won't get into the details (if I did, this would be a wildly long post) but the gist is that she emotionally, and on a couple occasions physically, abused me for a long time until I was about 13 and spoke out about it to my dad. She had primary custody, I only saw him on wednesdays and every other weekend. from then on, I was moving little bits of my stuff over to his house until my room was almost empty at my mom's, and then I just didn't go back. Months, literal months passed by before she ever said A WORD about my disappearance, and the first thing she jumped to after all that time was threatening legal action against my dad if I didn't go back. 

so we all three talked. and to 13 year old me's credit, I almost predicted the future. I had flatly told her that the next time she gets how she was before, that she'd never see me again. what do you think happened? a few months later I had to have my dad pick me up at 3am with my mother chasing his car into a busy street on foot, high/drunk up on God knows what. I meant what I said. the only time I've seen her since then was a custody hearing, and only for a split second.

all that being said, a preface - she disgusts me, and I refuse to rebuild my relationship with her (or my grandmother for that sake, who still continues to harass me through the mail after all this time.) but I cut off that entire half of the family so completely that I lost even my sisters. like I said, we've never been that close but they never did anything wrong. my one worry is that if I reach out to any of them, I'm just poking the hornet's nest. I made it out of that place. she's gone, and I'm better for it. 

is it even worth reaching out to my sisters in the hopes of even being friends?

Even though I always am the top performer in our team, my teammates seem to dislike me. Once in our group conference, I asked a work-related question and NOBODY answered or even cared to at least notice the message. But when someone said, ""do you smell food"" in the discussion, everyone engaged in it. Also, I had one incident where my bag zipped loudly, making it sound like a fart almost. I think that my teammates thought it was me who farted. Although it may sound funny, it had a big impact on my self-confidence, as I became highly conscious of what people around me think of me since then.

&amp;#x200B;

These experiences added up, and I became more unmotivated coming to the office. Back to my slippery incident, when I slipped and everyone shouted in surprise while looking at me, I cried when I got home because aside from embarrassment, the sound of people shouting and them looking towards me is just scary.

800," (TRIGGER WARNING: self harm is discussed here) Okay so when I was 16 I had my first girlfriend, she was absolutely crazy and thinking back on it the only reason we dated was because I didn’t know what having someone interested in me was like. Let’s call her Sarah. Sarah would frequently talk to people that weren’t there and as strange as I found this I let it go at first, (keep in mind the entire relationship lasted about 10 days) so one day she asks me to meet her at a field near her house, Sarah is wearing a long sleeved top and she starts making out with me, Me being the absolute epitome of social grace I decide to try taking off her top, for whatever reason I look at her arms and realise they basically looked like she was using them as knife sharpeners, this naturally scared the ever loving socks off of me. I get her to tell me all about the cuts and it turns out that Sarah self harmed due to being in the foster care system and basically being just as much of a social outcast as me. So I let her get up and we go our separate ways until I get to the edge of the field and I notice some pencil sharpener blades strewn across the floor but at the time it didn’t click what they actually were. Fast forward to AFTER she breaks up with me (I don’t remember the reason). Sarah asks me to go to the field again and this time I ask her about the blades as I take notice of what they are at this point, At this point she snaps, she starts screaming about how I’m prying into her business and about how I shouldn’t care since we already broke up and how I “failed the test” (never got context for that one). I noticed her arms were far worse than the first time I saw them and
When she walked away I decided to follow her just to make sure she went home instead of hurting herself more, (there’s no way the people she lived with would’ve allowed it) Sarah noticed me and told the people she lived with that I was a stalker, please keep in mind she only lived maybe a 5 minute walk from where we met up, I tried telling them what happened and because they didn’t know me they didn’t believe me and threatened to call the police, so I didn’t find out what she called me out for, I nearly got the cops called on me and I never got to stop her doing that...am I a bad person?

801,"Using a throwaway so SO doesn’t see. 

My SO (18M) and I (17F) have been together for over a year now. We’ve been through a lot together and I wouldn’t change anything about what we’ve gone through because it made us better. Currently, we’re both seniors in high school and are looking forward with great anticipation to graduating next month. 

The things that are happening now, though, are really stressing me out even though they should just be fun senior year activities. You see, SO and myself attend different high schools. This year, our proms are on the same night, at the same time, at venues that are not near to each other in the slightest. This is causing us a lot of arguing and stressing. 

We knew about this months ago. I said in no uncertain terms that regardless of whether he wanted to go with me or not, I would be attending my prom. I believe that it’s a really special event, and it is kind of the last hurrah for the seniors. He fought me on that and said he wanted to take me to his, and I have been staunchly refusing (though we haven’t really discussed it much up until very recently). I know this makes me seem like an asshole, but my class has around 100 people in the senior class, and another 100 in the junior class. Most of them attend prom, and I want to enjoy the night with my friends who are in both grades. 

My SO has a very different view on things. He really, really wants to go to his prom, but he’s refusing to go unless I come with. So he’s resigned himself to coming to my prom with me. I keep telling him he should go alone, but he keeps refusing to even consider that as a possibility, whereas I would be totally comfortable going to my prom by myself or with my friends. His class is very small, only about 30 students, and most of them he would say he is not friends with. 

His other point is that we went to my prom last year, and that we should go to his prom this year. But last year, his school didn’t have a junior prom, and I feel that it’s even more important for me to go this time around. 

I feel like I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place. I don’t feel like it’s fair of him to refuse to go to his own prom alone, because I feel like I’m robbing him of an important coming-of-age experience. At the same time, I can’t imagine missing out on that fun night with my friends that would also be an important coming-of-age experience for myself.

802,"I’m 18M, about to graduate high school, and was hired a couple months ago for a camp counselor position for the entire summer. I know camp counselor might not seem like a dream job to many people, but, as a high school senior, it’s something I have literally dreamt of since I started going to the camp in 7th grade or so.

• starts early June, ends mid August 
• two week sessions throughout the entire summer with one day off and one night off every week
• the camp is ages 6-16, but I do not know what age group I will get
• classic summer camp, beautiful location, amazing memories
• extremely difficult to get a position at the camp and I am quite surprised I was chosen (being that most are in college or older)

Every day I’m becoming increasingly nervous and decreasingly excited. It feels like some extreme form of FOMO (fear of missing out), and I have no clue what to do. I start college less than 2 weeks after I finish my job and I’m even more nervous for that. How do I control this and become more excited for it? How do I stop thinking of every possible bad situation? How do I convince myself that it’s okay to not hang out with my friends all summer? Should I reject the position last minute (most likely not but sometimes it goes to that extreme in my mind)? What do I do?

806," 

Last night I was drunk and arrested with a weapon. I have a girlfriend and we have a very volatile relationship. Ontop of that, ive always been a weed addict and an alcoholic for the last 2 years. Ive also been addicted to self harm before.

I went to rehab and left this girl, because after meeting her I lost my ex partner and started a cocaine addiction as well.

During each cocaine rampage I was awake 5 or so days. After rehab I relapsedand was awake 7 days, fucked up, ruined everything, then relapsed againa 3 rd time. I shouldve died the 2nd and 3rd time but didnt.

Now Ive just been trying to get detox medication for the alcohol withdrawls. Every time I try to stop I get such bad withdrawls I end up in hospital.

I told my girlfriend that I need 2 weeks to relax whilst I get these meds and that I may get slightly drunk and unstable as I have been, yet she accused me of stealing 2 pounds.. She literally said 2 days ago that she was going to move in here and have a family with me, and then YESTERDAY I used 2 quid of hers and said id give it back, was agreed, but then she forgot, and it was the last straw for me and I was drunk. She was threatening to leave over 2 quid, I couldnt wrap my head around it.

I was so drunk and irrational that I was worse than her. I went and swallowed around 12 or so paracetomals, i thought it would make me pass out or die, but I dont know why I did that. In that moment I didnt care about my mum, my dad, my dog, anything, I was just selfishly and patheticly trying to prove to her that I loved her that much I was willing to die for it. Over 2 pound.

I went straight to the hospital, and she took her stuff and left. I then ran away from the hosptial and went to her house to try and apologise, and she wouldnt even speak to me. Then she blocked me on face book and blocked my number.

My dad called me at 12am and said that hed called the police, as my mum had been calling him about it all, and because I had clearly tried to commit suicide, I had also cut my self again! I hadnt done it for so long, and I did it really badly quite a few times. I needed stitches in the end.

My dad tried to plead with me, why dont I care about my whole family ect, but I was drunk out of my mind, I didnt care, I didnt mean to do it. Ive been begging doctors for detox meds and ive been begging the NHS and raid teams to lock me away as Im a danger to my self, but they wont.

I said one final thing to my dad, let me come live with you, take me away, and that will stop me, and he said no chance in hell, so I hung up and went down to the big park, before the police came.

I slept in the bushes for a little while and threw away my phone. I took my fishing knife just incase as ut was late and im a paranoid person.

After about half hour I started hearing noises ect, so I came back home. As I got in the police were standing there talking to my mum, and I had my fishing knife in my pocket. It was a straight arrest.

I then spent until 3 am at the hospital getting checked out and stitched up, and actually wathing GoT with the police officer, which was really comforting, and then was taken to the station and left in a cell until 3 pm the following day. Today.

The nurse at the police stationm told me I have to wait now and continue drinking until I get detox meds through Spectrum (NHS). I said this to my dad when he picked me up, given that im broke and jobless and cant afford alcohol, and he didnt believe it. He made me call spectrum and he questioned them and interrogated them, he said to them ""my son tries to kill himself when he gets drunk, but your saying If he doesnt get drunk then he will likely die?"". They tiold him yes Ill almost definately have a alcohol related seizure and probably die with the amount I drink.

He asked if there was any other way and they said its up to him to drink as little as he needs to get through, but even I know, after all this time and all these relapses, I cant just drink a little, I cant, I need to just stop, and I want to. I actually referred myself for these meds 2 weeks ago now and ive been chasing it every second day as I get sicker and sicker from drinking alone.

Anyway, now Im home, I was sober earlier, and shaking and sweating and convulsing, but ive had a few beers now and feel quite tipsy, and not sick anymore, but naturally now Im just worried. I still dont know what the fuck im doing. Ive told the raid team muiltiple teams that if you let me go Im probably going to end up killing mjyself through drugs and alcohol, and I keep doing it. I feel like ive been let down, and I just dont quite have the courage to section myself.

I also know that the reason they wont section me is because when Im sober Im not crazy, so its just a waiting game. But at this point its also a ticking clock for me clearly. I almost got sent to prison last night for 2 years over 2 pound, why would I let myself be so irrational, I dont even understand. Ontop of that I almost and actually tried to die. I dont understand why I do these things when Im drunk and I just want to drop drinking but every doctor and nurse is telling me I cant. I need to wait atleast another whole week of this, and its getting worse and worse, and im worried.",07May2019,1
809,"Me and a friend want to meet up, and he would be travelling across the country, but we're struggling with expenses and want advice on how to either earn money, or get our money's worth on what we're buying. We need to buy train tickets, two night hotel stay, food, and transport for getting around in general. This is for a three day visit.

After checking train ticket prices for early - mid August (when we're planning the visit), it doesn't seem to get any cheaper than £80 one way, £160 minimum in total for trains.

We don't know whether airbnb or a hotel stay is more worth it, would appreciate general advice on that. 

Then we also need to buy food for three days, and just general entertainment. 

Just briefly looking over it, it looks like it might come to around £300 between us, which we may (big emphasis on may) be able to get. 

Is there any way we could earn at least a little money in three months? Neither of us can work (we live in England, and aren't 18). Our parents won't pay anything towards us meeting up, so that's out of the question. We will have birthday money (both of us) which is maybe £200 already, as well as money from a refund on a jacket I was bought (maybe £360 if I'm allowed to keep the money). But the likelihood of me being able to keep that £360 is unlikely, so:

811,"So for about five-six years now I've been out to some degree as nonbinary. But for the first time I'm questioning how I want to transition.

I've generally had this idea of transition--top surgery and low-dose testosterone. But I've seen mixed experiences on low-dose T. Some people take a low dose and have a massive change, others remain at that androgynous in-between state that I've always wanted. If I start on a stupid low dose is it possible I could work up to where I want to be, just in case I react strongly to testosterone? 

Now that I have a partner however, I'm liking some aspects of my body--but only in the bedroom. I enjoy my chest in bed, but as soon as I'm dressed again and going out, I hate the lumps under my shirt. Hips I don't mind, when I was a young teen and I would draw myself, I had this vision of myself as flat chested but with curved hips and always hoped I would be that someday. 

I just don't know what to do. I have the rest of my life to decide, but I worry. I feel uncomfortable looking like a girl in public, I feel so much better androgynous/male leaning, I hate my high voice amd my chest. But once the clothes come off I enjoy myself (but I know that binding my chest will make my breasts sag quicker than usual). I also read that once starting T sex is less of a whole body experience and more genital-focused--that sounds awful and boring to me. But the thought of actually being able to pass as anything other than a girl just fills me with hope. Why am I so conflicted??! Does anyone have any advice or experience here?? I'm desperate, this is making me so anxious.

Been pretty close friends with this girl at my school but I’ve recently been coming to realize that she does a lot of little things that I really (REALLY) disagree with/dislike but I’ve been excusing her behavior because she’s really super nice to me and most people.

Things she’ll do that I hate:

-say (or write most of the time) the n word (she is not being remotely black), like it’s nothing (did this to me once but I shrugged it off, she does it a lot even tho she’ll defend to the grave that she’s not racist)

- flirt with guys/ lead them on CONSTANTLY, I’m talking like, almost every single guy she’s known she does this, she will completely lead them on then act totally oblivious when they make advances back on her (she likes male attention I think...which is whatever but you’re also fucking with peoples emotions which is shitty imo) she completely admitted to doing this btw- TO A GUY THAT ENDED UP PROM-POSING TO HER

- really friendly/flirty with this one guy that just gives me low-key neo-nazi vibes, it’s hella obvious (he’s kind of a tr*mp supporter, says the n word TO HER despite being paper white, really ableist, creepy in general) but he’s cute and funny so it’s ok right?

All this stuff combined just makes for these weird but indirectly VERY uncomfortable situations for me to be in but it’s not like she’s ever done anything mean to me, I just don’t wanna associate with her anymore.

817,"For context, I (f18) have been dealing with medically diagnosed depression and extreme anxiety from a young age. 
I'm on medication and go to therapy. Lately I've hit a bit of a rough patch and it is starting to effect relationships with family and friends and even with my boyfriend. My job and grades are also showing effects. My physical health is declining in front of my eyes. I've discussed this with a professional and I'm looking for ways to help get out of this hole I'm in. I want so badly to do in school and work. I was recently in a car accident that totaled my car leaving me with no money (though it was the others persons fault, insurance only covers so much and the car is beyond repair which only gave me so much money and buying a used car in godo condition soaked up everything I had) I also had to pay for my summer class. 
I try to surround myself with things like but I need something to help. Some kind of distraction. 
What do you guys do or recommend I try?

821,"Hi, I'm a 20 year old college freshman studying computer science, and I've lost touch with my high school friends (haven't talked to them in like half a year) and don't really have any close friends anymore. I've also never been in a relationship before (I'm a bi guy if that matters). I kinda want to fix both of these things, but if I could do either it'd be great since I think I just need someone to talk to and hang out with as I'm kinda alone and sometimes cry myself to sleep.

I get the impression from most people I interact with that they don't dislike me, but I'm mildly autistic so I might not be the best at reading social cues. I also have a bit of social anxiety so I'm kinda scared of talking to people.

So, what am I supposed to do? My current hobbies are playing board games, video games, and I'm learning to draw, none of which are too effective at broadening the range of people I meet since I mostly do them at home by myself or with my parents who I live with in the case of board games (unfortunately I couldn't really find any regular board game meetups in my city). I did just start playing yugioh with other people in the city though, so hopefully I can make some friends that way.

Do you have any tips on how I could meet more people and make some friends without it feeling awkward? Also, how do people get into dating? I know about online dating but I'm pretty sure people tend to use it for hookups, and I'd prefer a long-term relationship. Do they just ask out random people at like, bars or something? That seems kinda creepy to be honest. Are you supposed to do nothing and hope for the best?",07May2019,3

823,"Brief background: I applied for many different positions at many different companies. Needed a job or a source of income before May. Accepted an offer at a fixed pay rate at a certain company two weeks ago because I hadn’t heard back from anyone else. My start date is the 13th and today is the 7th, which means I start in less than a week. 

Over the past three days, however, I’ve now been getting responses from a lot of the companies I originally didn’t hear back from. A few offered higher pay rates. 

Is it too late to negotiate pay at this point?",07May2019,1
824,"I'm new to reddit, so just a warning I don't really know entirely how this works. Also, this problem isn't the most serious of things, but regardless I fucked up and would love some advice. 

 To set up the problem I should give some background. I've been dating this guy for 5 months now, let's call him Greg. We are both in high school, so we are very young. I live about 30 minutes from the town everyone lives in, and my group of friends aren't necessarily ""partiers"" but we do drink occasionally. My parents set my curfew at 11:30 and I'm not allowed to stay the night anywhere (this is one of their only strict rules and if I broke it they would be really upset with me), so whenever we drink I am usually DD, or I start early enough so that I am sober by the time I need to drive home. My boyfriend is not much into drinking or anything, so when we first started dating he was uncomfortable with the fact that I would wait to come down before driving (he wished that I wouldn't drive at all), which is understandable. We talked it out and as out relationship has progressed it hasn't been a problem. Greg also offers to be DD for me all the time when I drink, but since I live so far out of town I rarely take up his offer. 

The problem started last Friday when Greg and I had plans to hang out, but he wanted to reschedule since an opportunity came up for him to drink with some friends. I said it was no problem and I really didn't mind because he never is able to have fun and I thought it would be good for him. That night while he was out with friends, I decided to meet up with my friend Sarah to drive around and hang out since I didn't have anything to do. As I'm driving into town, I get a call from Greg, and he wants me to stop by his friend's house to talk to him for a little bit. Since I'm going into town anyway, I decided to stop by before meeting up with Sarah.

When Greg gets into my car he is definitely drunk and we talked for 30 minutes before I told him that I should leave since I made plans to be with Sarah. He got upset that I was leaving him and stormed out of my car. I didn't think anything of it because he was drunk and he didn't seem to be genuinely mad. 

Anyways, I meet up with Sarah and she's with a group of people. Everyone there seems to be drunk instead of the driver, and the plan was to just hang out and drive around. As we were driving around, we decided to stop at another guy's house to get more alcohol for everyone. When we get there it's 10:00 and everyone was trying to get me to take shots. At first I declined because in an hour I had to drive home, but it didn't take much convincing for me to take two shots of whiskey. By the time 10:20 rolled around I was definitely feeling it, but I wasn't drunk. While I'm with my friends, Greg is texting me things like ""I can't believe you left me"" etc., and I was apologizing but not taking it very seriously.

Eventually 11:00 comes around and it's time for me to drive home. I wasn't sober, but I was barely feeling the effects of the whiskey anymore so I decided it would be okay for me to drive home. I make it home safe, and as soon as I get into my room I decided it would be good to call Greg to make sure everything is okay. He was more upset than I thought about me leaving him, but after talking it was clear that everything was okay. When he asked me what I did with Sarah and the others, I told him the truth, including that I drove home when I wasn't completely sober. He freaks out and hangs up on me and I text him an apology but he ignores me and we both go to bed. 

The next morning, I wake up to a text that says ""I was thinking about it last night and I was actually feeling bad about being drunk and needy about you leaving me last night, but then I realized what you left me for."" We talk, and he explains that he was really upset about the fact that I drove and that I could've gotten into a really bad wreck. I completely understand why he is mad about that and honestly, I would be mad at me too. I made a really dumb decision to drive and it was reckless and dangerous, there are way too many risks for me to be doing that. I explained that to him, apologized, and told him it would never happen again and that I hoped he could trust me in that. After a long time of talking, he said that our relationship was really important to him and he doesn't ever want to have to worry about me like he has been. He also said if it happened again it would be a deal-breaker. Again, I told him that I completely understood where he was coming from and that I was sorry and I hope he could forgive me. I really feel so bad about what I did and ashamed that I ever let myself do it. 

I thought it would take a couple of days for our issue to calm down, but now it's been five days and we haven't seen each other and when we text it's pretty obvious there is a disconnect. I wish there was something I could say that I haven't already said to make things better, because us not talking like we used to has taken a bigger toll on me mentally than I imagined. Now that time has passed, I almost feel that he is trying to punish me for what I did and hold it over my head. I decided that if a week passes and nothing has changed, I am going to break up with him, since it might save us both a lot of pain. Am I being irrational by not giving him more time to be upset and should I just wait it out? I understand that he is upset because he doesn't want to see anything bad happen to me, and his reaction is warranted, but I can't take him being mad at me for so long. I love him a lot, and either way I choose will not be easy at all. 

Also, I just wanted to add that I'm not taking my decision to drive that night lightly. I'm very ashamed of myself and I can honestly say it won't happen again.

826,"I hooked up with my first guy ever here in college. He’s a junior and I’m a freshman. I never had any type of sexual relationship with guys before, but because of him, I’ve found out that I might be bisexual. Around two weeks ago, soon after we hooked up the first time, I met him at a party. He was kind of drunk and I was not. I started dancing with him as soon as I saw him. Our dance was very sexual (twerking in one another, making out and rubbing our bodies against the other’s). Then he took me to the restroom and started kissing me. I kissed him back and was a bit uncomfortable about being in the bathroom. I did told him that I was not comfortable, but he insisted on staying there. Then all of the sudden, he started unzipping my pants and asked me if I wanted to receive head. I told him no, but he kept on insisting. I told him that I did not want to do it since he’s drunk, but he just went and started giving me head. I kind of enjoyed it at first and was participating in the action. But then I stopped him and got out of the bathroom. When the time came for us to leave, we got in his car and he asked me to make out with him. I said sure, we got in the back of the minivan and started making out. He was rubbing my crotch and but while I was not comfortable touching him. He constantly asked me to have sex with him, but I told him no since I did not want to take advantage of his drunk ness. Now I feel terrible about the whole situation. Was I in the wrong or was he in the wrong?

I forgot to mention that he constantly touched me sexually while we were at the party and I kept on moving his arm and telling him to stop.

827,"I (20M) recently got a bf (20M) and have been staying at his place for the week since I locked myself out of my apartment. He lives with 3 other guys and whenever one of them gets drunk (which is every day basically), the guy (we'll just call him H) barges into my bf's room and threatens to beat him up. Today alone H has come in 3 times while my bf is working and threatened to fight my bf. This might not be such a big issue if H wasnt tall and very muscular whereas my bf is tall and skinny. H can easily take both me and my bf if I were to get involved bc we're both just built really thin (I do want to get involved and yell back at this guy but I know it wont help any). Usually bf can get H out of his room, or one of the sober-ish roommates can if they're home, but today has been especially difficult. This past break-in involved H calling my bf a faggot, which isn't physical violence but I feel he may hurt my bf based on his sexuality alone. He's living with these guys for the next 2 semesters bc he has no one else to sign a lease with and I'm honestly scared for his life and well being. H is usually fine and fun to be around when not super fucked up but he's fucked up a lot.. Is there anything i can do to stop this or should i just let my bf handle it like he has been so far ?

830,"I'm pretty socially isolated, I'm terrible socially so to find people I connect with is rare - the problem is I can interpret feelings of affection for a new friend as something more. 

My ex is an example of this; I had zero romantic or sexual interest in him and completely ruled him out as a romantic partner because he wasn't what I was looking for at all. We were talking regularly, hanging out regularly, and connected in a way I very rarely experience...so feelings developed and a romantic relationship came about. Although this is a normal organic way to get into a relationship, I knew he wasn't suitable as a partner but rose tinted glasses took over. 

I've a friend who's an ex from around a decade ago, he's a great person and I'm very fond of him, but he's not romantically interested in me and I know he's not suitable as a partner (been there, done that!)...yet I'm finding myself hoping he'll make a move, jealous when he's dating, etc. 

There's a barista at my local café who I get on well with, again not my type at all but the fact we get on so well is stirring up feelings. 

I'm too old to be chasing after my heart's ridiculous whims, I need to make wise choices when it comes to partners and I need to make friends, but if I develop feelings over any meaningful social relationships with a guy it's a problem.

I have definitely found them attractive in the past but had stopped anything from happening before that. 
Before we cut contact officially i told my ex and she wasn't overly hurt by it, due to some sexual issues we have had in the past where i definitely had a higher libido i was constantly restraining.
We both talked about the possibility of reconnecting in the future, but decided to go no contact for a period of time, which could last from months to never. I definitely would like a future with her, however obviously it is complicated. 
On the other hand, i am definitely attracted to my coworker physically, and i know she is down for a NSA type of situation. If my goal is to eventually get back together with my ex, would it be a very stupid idea to sleep with my coworker again?.

Fast forward to last March and suzanne's husband develops terminal cancer and dies in December. She relies a lot on my dad during this time and calls him a lot for advice (some of it medical as my dad is a doctor).

Back home I have this big friend group that still stays in contact during school, and I haven’t told any of them yet. One of them is my really good friend, we were really close in high school and still text nearly every day. The problem is that she’s always had feelings for me.

I’d hear from a friend in the past that she liked me every so often, and at the end of senior year she confessed that she used to have a crush on me.

835,"Hello everyone, it may just be my mood right now but this has been on my mind for the majority of my school year. I’ve always been an academic person and it was definitely my strongest aspect but coming into college and receiving pretty mediocre grades have scared me to death.

Now, before you say what’s the big deal of getting a few bad grades here and there? Know that I’m not the average college student who has strong suits in other fields. The thing is I’m doing bad in my own major which is stats and my worst classes have been math and stats which absolutely kills me because these were my best subjects. It’s like a musician not getting a good concert chair, a singer who failed to qualify for something, etc. basically, I’m failing at my strongest suit. I have absolutely no other talent and the one talent I did have is taken away from me. 

I finished up finals and one of the finals I needed a 95 to get an A for the class I thought I managed it until the grades were released where I missed two more Questions shattering my hopes. Basically my deduction is that if I’m struggling in “easy” classes, how tf am I gonna continue? What’s even the point of me attending college? I feel like a damn failure and again, I can’t do anything else for shit and this one thing I was always confident in (academics and grades) are disappearing before my eyes. Plus my fucking finances depend on this for scholarships. It’s not quite below the threshold yet but if this trend continues I may be off scholarships next year. Fuck me.

It was relatively ok for the school year until grades get released and then I feel like an actual failure and don’t have any future. I can’t draw, sing, create things, or have any other useful talents. This sucks. I cant even enjoy the fact that finals aren’t over. Just dreading for more bad news.

843," 

Well, Firstly introduce myself, I am a UN officer at his early 30's with a respectful position and good money and a good life.

I normally don't use any escort service because I was married for 3 years but got divorced and before that, I was able to make decent dates with decent girls.

Recently, The Organization has sent me to Bulgaria for a job and I finished my work there in 2 days and I decided to stay 3-4 more days to see around and have some fun. The first day I went to a Casino and met this hot escort where she came with me to my hotel and we had sex. I liked her service but I wanted to try some other ladies next days.

Next day I checked some Internet site and found a 21 years old. I decided to book her because her pictures were HOT. I can post photos of her body if it is not against the Reddit rules.

We talked on WhatsApp and agreed on a price for just a standard service. I gave her address of my apartment and she said that she was gonna be there in 15 minutes. I went downstairs and met her in person. Immediately noticed that she was 3 inches taller than me which I did not know before booking. she had a decent body but she was poorly dressed, her tattoos were okay. She was kinda cold and wary at first but as she gets out of the cab she saw how dressed I am. In the elevator, I looked her up and down. To be honest, I did not like her face that much as it was less attractive than her body. For a moment It felt like she could be using drugs.

Once we got into the apartment, I asked her if she wanted to drink wine or beer, she didn't want to. I asked her if it was okay for me to have a drink before we have sex, she said ''of course''. While we sit on the balcony I asked her personal questions. She was from some small city or village in Bulgaria and came to burgas to work as a prostitute. She said she saved some good money to buy a house this summer in Bulgaria. When I asked her if she went to university, she felt ashamed and she said no. I was astonished that she gave me many details including her real name.

I invited her to the bedroom where we both undressed and got into the bed. She put the condom on and started to suck.

Her legs were long and her body was soft. I started to kiss her legs and went up to kiss her vagina where she refused. I started to kiss her nipples and then neck. After I got enough sedition and erected, I started to \*\*\*\* her and pushed myself as deep as into her. she was a taller big girl, I was worried at first I could not handle it but I am athletic with muscles so I was pumping up her like a man. Suddenly, I felt that Her cheap condom was broken and my penis was being exposed to her vagina. It felt so good to feel inside of her so I did not tell this and continue. After a minute or so I thought It could be risky to do this so I told her that condom was broken. She asked if I deposited any load in her and I said '' she would know in a couple of months and call me to get the baby'. Obviously, I was joking but she was like ''NO!''.

I confronted her and she changed the condom and we pick up where we left off. I begin to like her as she was a weird lady and I wanted to kiss her on her lips. ''No, my face is my private part'', She said. The moment I was refused to kiss her, I felt fucking bad and my erection went half way down. It took 10 minutes for me to concentrate again and finish the job. While we do it, I kissed her lips again as a reflex and she said ''No again'' and turned her face. she said I could kiss her nipples and neck which I did. Finally, I was so hard inside her so I felt with my penis that she had 2 real orgasms where she was so wet and shook for a second. We both sweated.

After we both had an orgasm I kissed her in the neck and told her to go and take a shower. She was afraid that should could get pregnant so she runs to the bath.

The next day, I decided to book her again and we met again and we had great sex. After the sex, I asked her if she was hungry and she asked what food do I have.. lol (hungry poor girl, I felt sorry :(

I cooked her some fish and she ate and we chat while I drink my wine. She stayed longer than she was supposed to stay. After finishing the meal and chat we left the apartment where I walked with her until she gets into a cab.

last day, I asked her how her day was and she said that she was cleaning her new house because her landlord kicked her and friend out as landlord found out that they were whoring. She told me that She could come to me around 8.30pm. I said that: ''okay, Do you wanna eat something outside before?''. She said ''Okay sure''.

She came like 9 p.m I gave her money, she did not count it this time just put it in her bag and told me that she trusts me. she stayed until 10.10 because some guys called her for a group sex at their new house... she said she has to leave. I was kinda disappointed as I expected to eat something together after we had sex. She told me that, If I stay tomorrow, we can meet earlier and eat something. I said I had to go.

She told me to go outside with her and wait for the cab which I did. The taxi did not come up and I offered her for a ride where she said okay. She was astonished to see my foreign plate luxury car and she advised me to park it in a safe spot because the city was dangerous. I drop off her at her apartment.

That was the last time I saw her. Now I have another job in Bulgaria again in June. I plan to call her again. I just cannot spend a moment without thinking her. I should have never bee her regular, I should have book other escorts.

Me coming from a classy family, my dad is rich and I am very well educated so it is obvious that She is out of my league as she is a village girl with poor education But I don't like to think that way. I feel sorry for her life and I want to help her, maybe even marry her. I might be losing my mind or I am just in depression and just search for a random love. I know she is after money, it is her job at the end but I don't understand why she refuses to kiss me? I am not that bad looking guy. Doesn't she know that I will take care of her well?",07May2019,2
844,"My favorite sports team just bottled a huge lead and got eliminated, all while the other team was missing their two best players due to injury. For the second fucking year in a row. I try to act like it’s no big deal like I do other times when I fail at something in order to focus on what’s coming next and I start to believe it until I catch myself talking more harshly to people or catch myself scowling for no reason at all and I realize that I care way too much about some guys being paid millions to kick a ball dressed like fucking highlighters to just dismiss this. This is the first time that I have cared so much about something that I couldn’t just ignore it and move on when something bad happens. I just got SSBU fir the Nintendo Switch a day ago and I don’t even want to play that, I have an AP final tomorrow and I can’t study because I’m so pissed off/sad. One of the things that took my mind off anything is playing soccer but practice got canceled today because it’s raining. I can’t browse any social media because fans of the rival team are all talking shit all over my feeds with what I imagine to be the biggest shit-eating grins on their faces, and reading through that shit would 100% make this worse. As I’m writing this, my friends who support the team that beat mine are spamming me with shitty memes and Facetime requests. How do I get out of this funk?",07May2019,1
845,"a persons life is a long and complicated thing, and can not really be summarized easily so I will omit a summary......

I felt like I was loosing myself, or rather, had lost myself, my core, who I was..... So I slowly walked away from everything. 

I don't use social media anymore, I don't talk too people on the phone, I don't talk to anyone really at all, even people I see at work or my new two room mates....

&amp;#x200B;

I succeeded in cutting off all the fat in my life..... but.... now I just feel completely unrelated to society... and as though I can't really understand people.. this hasn't been a short term problem, I have spent a lot of time on my own, years of isolation, yes it did lead me to be sad from time to time, but I just focused on trying to become better at a lot of things, and now I find I am well versed in multiple subjects and I am in great shape, I go hiking, I do anything I really want, but people just perplex me.. I guess my fear is that even if i did want too, I couldn't interact with people the same way they all naturally interact with each-other.... I also need too finish my academics, I have been going too college for a long time and taking classes slowly, and I grow concerned about that as well, as I can't exactly easily understand human interactions at this point I fear that my age may be a limiting factor in the career path I wish to pursue (I have been going too school for software engineering, i started out as a chemistry student but switched off, I am now 27)..... I currently work in costumer service.... ironically..... I understand what needs to be done for my job, and I understand that people feel particular ways, I just fail too understand the how or the why they feel those ways......

&amp;#x200B;

I am rather detached I guess, but I honestly can't even believe that people behave the way they appear too.... like... most social interactions just seem rehearsed and meaningless, and like the lack any form of ""honesty"". people don't really talk about what they actually want too is the vibe i get, but i don't understand why.... and I also don't understand why its strange that I not only don't care about social norms, but people react so perplexed by what I would call normal behavior.... take for example just being honest all the time (not rude, not pointing out flaws in others, but pointing out your own flaws, or stating how you honestly feel about a certain topic). 

&amp;#x200B;

so i guess the advice i am seeking here would be a form of direction on how I can build a bridge that would help me better understand people... or at least people in public or society. I don't have people, I wouldn't call myself apathetic..... I just can't relate to the general scope of things... most problems just seem small, and getting upset doesn't help fix them so I don't. Success is nice but it isn't anything too loose your head over.... I am just kind of calm.... sometimes I get excited, sometimes I get mad, or sad, I still have those feelings, but they are usually unrelated too others as particular people. I can get sad over the pain people feel though, especially if its something that could otherwise be fixed, etc etc. I guess thats it...",07May2019,1
