0,"I feel like I can do better. I feel like for some reason I can’t stop my self throwing my life away at my shit job doing the same thing every week. For some reason I know I need to change but I can’t ever stop my self or try something new. I don’t know what I want from life or where to go or what to do. I have been thinking about therapy like talking to a professional, but I’m not sure if I’d be wasting there’s and my time? Any one felt like this and had counselling?",27Nov2019,1
1,"My girlfriend is sick of me not doing anything around the house, and I'm not arguing about her point. It's true, I'm very lazy and procrastinate a lot. Doesn't help either that I have been diagnosed with depression and sometimes it's hard to even take care of my hygiene and such. I fear everyday she will leave me because of this, she already once nearly did but in the end we stayed together, not sure why she stayed.

 I don't want her being my 2nd mom and I'm ready to kick my own ass to help around the house. But it's very hard for me, sometimes a week goes by and I don't even realize I literally haven't helped her in anything. I need some help motivating myself into doing it, and getting a routine of it. Any advice from some fine folks?",27Nov2019,1
2,"I keep embarrassing myself because of drinking and I keep messing my life up and I’m only 23.
I’ve done so many bad things in my life due to drinking, at this point, you’d think I’d learn my lesson and not drink. I’m losing friends and I don’t want to become “that guy” in town to gets too wasted. 

I feel terrible rn because I’m pretty sure I just lost some friends from last night. I’m at the point we’re I deleted my Facebook due to the humiliation I felt last night when my friends (or if i should call them that) kicked me out out of their house. I’m about to get my AA-T in psych so I’m on the right path; alcohol is my only concern. 

So here’s my question(s): 
1. I feel shame right now, but should I hold on to it and use it as tool to help me quit drinking?
2. Is this a huge concern I should be even focused on?
3. Does this happen to everyone?
4. Should I care how others view when I HAVE changed and they still remember me as “that guy”?
5. Do I have a chance to redeem myself?

Sorry for all the questions, but I feel this is the first time in my life when I feel the seriousness alcoholism. It’s doing damage to my health and to my life, so I believe I am ready for change.",27Nov2019,1
3,"So I've ranted about this situation last year in another sub, but it has gotten worse since then. I have this co-worker, I'll call him Sam again. Sam was never helpful from the beginning. He is extremely lazy, arrogant and I don't care for him much as a co-worker or even as a person overall. I try not to let certain things bother me and I ignore him and do my work. My manager notices my hard work and that's all that ever really mattered to me. But here lately, I cant take it any more. 

Sam DOES NOT WORK AT ALL. We are the last two left, besides my manager, I'll call him Will, in our department. We sit next to each other, but it never feels like we actually work together. I officially do 90% of the work. Sam is on his phone all day. Don't get me wrong, everyone including myself, takes a couple of peeks at their phone at work, especially during downtime. But he goes beyond that and watches full movies, videos, and shows on his phone. His work phone rings and he will purposely not answer it, then of course, those angry folks on the other line call my extension next when they can't reach him. We work for a non-profit government agency and pretty much every phone call is crucial. He also disappears for 20-30 minutes at a time throughout the day and I'll find him casually chatting with other colleagues in their offices. He even slipped up once and told me that he takes naps in the storage room sometimes (on the clock).

Will gives us time-sensitive, GROUP tasks that we should be able to finish in time if both of us put in 100% , but we've been falling behind because I'm actually working on these things alone, while Sam sits with a bunch of files and papers on his desk to make himself ""look busy"" but he is actually doing nothing or catching up on one of his shows. We are not heavily supervised and there are no cameras where we sit, so I am literally the only person who can see what he does all day. I'm sure Will is aware that Sam is a lazy sack of shit and doesn't care about the job at all. I have had brief conversations with my manager regarding this but I didn't go into much detail because its not my intentions to get someone in trouble or to seem like a tattle-tale or a problematic employee. The backstory that I've gotten from Will and others at the office is this:

Sam started working years ago, before Will. They had a different supervisor that Sam actually had a crush on and did everything for. Sam trained Will on most things but Will took what he learned, and mastered it, and when the supervisor was leaving the company, she chose Will to take her place instead of Sam. Sam became salty, and over the years, his work ethic just went to shit. 

Will is very mild-mannered, compassionate, and sympathetic. So Will feels bad, like he owes Sam something. He could never fire him. He doesn't even like addressing issues with Sam. Sam shows Will no respect as a manager. Will is a great manager overall.  He is younger than us but I still respect him as a manager and a friend. He has looked out for me in tough situations too. I actually think I would've lost my job a long time ago if he wasn't my manager. I definitely wouldn't want to hinder our relationship by stepping above him and reporting these things to upper management.

So my dilemma is that I don't know if I should bring these issues up with my manager because I don't think anything will be done about it. I feel like he might just have a talk with Sam basically letting him know that I am the one complaining and if anything, that's going to make our work environment even more awkward and uncomfortable. These guys are buddies. But our department is starting to be noticed for our shortcomings and Will is ready to hire someone else to help us. The company is already taking large budget cuts and its hard as hell to get a raise, so to hire another person is going to hurt my chances even more. I want him to know its not that we are short-staffed its just that we have a bad seed in our group who is dragging us down. I also don't want to keep going along without saying anything because I feel it will blow up in my face later if it is somehow found out that Sam isn't working and I didn't say anything about it. Also I know my patience will run out eventually and I will just explode on him one day and end up losing my job because I kept it bottled in for so long.

What would you guys do in this situation? Say something and risk an uncomfortable situation, or don't say anything and risk your sanity?

TL;DR:
My co-worker is lazy and leaves me to do all of the work. I'm afraid to tell my manager because they are friends and I don't know what the outcome would be.",27Nov2019,1
4," 

Hey guys, I know this will seem silly or dumb, but it is really affecting me. I'm a senior in high school now, but in the 9th grade I, like many people, said some embarrassing things. And this group that I used to be a part of kinda bullied me about things I said back then, understandably so. But they still talk and laugh about me to this day. And it's pretty maliceful. But I can not move on from my past. And it eats me up inside. not even just embarrassing things I have said, Its everything from any point in time from my past. I'm hyper-critical of my past actions and it makes life really hard to enjoy now. Is there anything I can do?

Thank you.",27Nov2019,1
5,"I M(13) was at school when some guy squirts yogurt onto my jacket. I got kinda pissed so I told him to piss of them wiped the yogurt onto his back.  He looked at me angrily but didn’t do anything so I walked away. Next thing I know he pushes me down from behind when I’m not looking and I’m on my back. Before I can stand up he is over me, punching down. We were outside and nobody really witnessed it so there wasn’t a crowd or any yelling to alert the teachers, but if it kept going someone would see. So as this kid is punching at me I hold up my hand and it keeps hitting my palm, stopping him from hitting my stomach or face. Some how I keep my calm and just tell him I don’t want to get in trouble and to stop.When he realized nothing was connecting properly he stand up and tells me 
“Don’t fuck with me” 
I stand up and look at my hand. My fucking pinky finger is bent outwards unnaturally. This got me REALLY mad. I thought about whether or not to beat the shit out of him because I am physically bigger, but decided against it because I don’t want to get in trouble or mess up my finger any more. I call him a pussy for not fighting me like a man and walk to the teacher and tell him I slipped and bent my finger. He send me to the nurse and they call my parents to take me to the hospital. Of course my finger is broken and now I regret not fighting back and for actually covering up for him. I feel pathetic. Should I have fought back?

8,"I am wondering if anyone has any insight regarding genetics. I have bipolar 2 disorder. Being treated, seeing a therapist, ect. 
I have been dating a man who is wonderful, has his life together and has plans for the future. He has a son from a previous relationship and is a great and attentive father. He does have a past of drug use however. He is in recovery and attends meetings and is committed to a positive and healthy life. He also wants another child.
My concern is that my therapist said that I should not have a child with this man because of his drug addiction and my bipolar disorder.  She basically told me our child will end up a bipolar drug addict. Which was a little tough to hear. 

I'm just wondering if anyone has any knowledge or expertise in this area and can give me some insight. 

I am only looking for information, statistics, ect. Not personal opinions or negativity.

11,"I have broken up with my ex for various reasons a month ago. I discovered that he wasnt who he portrayed himself to be, and saw felt he is a little off. He has shown me that he thinks violence is a solution to a lot of things, and even blamed me for his temper tantrums when he couldnt get things to go like he wanted. He pushed and pushed and even wanted to get engage in less than 6 months of knowing each other. 

There is a lot but I broke up with him becasue I didnt tolerate that he was so immature and generally acting like a low life. We luckily live in two different countries, me in scandinavia and him in south europe. But his behaviour and how he has actually gone around saying that we will end up together to people we know actually worries me that whenever I go to south of europe to visit family, he will full out stalk and probably assault me too. 

Recently, like a few weeks ago, I discovered a page on instagram had been watching all of my stories, which to me looked really suspicious. The name of the user looked really similarly written to how my ex had his name written. So if his name was Johnny it was written johnny.25. The username to the suspicious account was hustleboyz.25. Looks really similar right, only he would have something like that. The suspicious account also had 0 follower, 0 following and 0 posts. So just nails it to being him stalking me. 

It really pisses me off, like it makes me absolutely mad that he in his sick head thinks I wont notice him stalking me, and that he still obsesses over me like I am a prized possesion when we just dated shy of 3 months before I broke it off. He dont think he ever did anything wrong and when pointed out on his behaviour he would say things like I wouldnt have done this and this if you didnt say that and that. He even had a lot of family members try and call my own parents so that they could lecture me and teach me to go back to him. It happened several times and praise my mother for telling them to back off and question their reality for not realising that I am independent and dont need a man. 

Its all a shitshow that really boils my blood and I really wanted to do something about it. I really wanted to make it known to him by tagging that fake account on quotes that berates people that stalk. But I got stopped by a good friend who just said to block. I feel like I should have at least made it known I knew that he was stalking me, because he will probably just create new accounts to stalk me again. 

And the stalking might even go from cyber stalking to actually stalking me in real life. For that reason I dont dare to go and visit my family in south europe, and actually might never return. Any advice on what I can do except anything legally, since I dont think that country actually has laws against stalking and harassement.",27Nov2019,1
12,"I've been having a LOT of lost memory recently and it's starting to interfere with my daily activities.

So I can't pay attention very well, and on top of that, now I'm starting to forget a lot of things, big or small. For example, I've started to forget stuff like whether or not I have school work, What shirt I was wearing today, What someone said 2 minutes ago, It's all a blur. HELP!

I’m in the process of transferring the stocks to my name only.

Anyways. I come across some messages with a girl and my husband... this girl gave me bad feelings back in 2015 because I knew she was interested in my guy... the message was basically them talking about how when my husband was single (we took a break in 2015 for a couple months, his choice) that my husband wanted to have something with her and said she just didn’t give him the chance.. she said “I would have given you the ride of your life” which he responded with “I believe it”... they change the conversation to something more friend like and he leaves her on read in August... 

obviously this wrecks me. I talked to him.. not about what I found because I knew he’d get upset I went into his phone... but I asked him if he ever regretted getting back together.. if he was happy being married to me.. just things that would help me feel reassured that this was just a stupid conversation that didn’t mean anything and of course he said all the things I wanted to hear.. he even mentioned how yeah there was a chance he could get with the 2015 girl when we weren’t together but he never fully went through with it because he “wasn’t in the mood”

My question is... do I drop it? We’ve been together for 7 years.. married for 2... he is an amazing husband.. has had his iffy moments for sure but I’ve always thought our relationship is worth fighting for and growing with him has been great...

I am just sick of having to restrict my self from dressing the way I wanna dress, cause I have a berry curvy body so when i just wanna wear a top and jeans it looks to provocative.

23,"I live in a duplex, and nextdoor to us is an older couple - a white lady and an older black man. At first we got along with them really well. The guy would always ask me for cigarettes and I would give them to him. But recently he has been going out of his way to stir up shit with the landlord. He has complained about us parking over his side of the property (we share a parking space - it's not 'his property), he has called the landlord telling on us for arguing. He once tried to tell the landlord that we introduced his grandson to racism because of a conversation I was having with a friend (I had showed my friend a Dave Chappelle bit about voter turnout at the 2012 election vs. the 2p16 election.) Not once has he ever just tried to talk to me about his issues he has with us. And now, regardless of whether or not these complaints are valid - I can tell my landlord is becoming irritated simply because of the finger pointing.

I have kept calm and (thanks to my girlfriend's voice of reason) have not snapped on him or tried to get back in any way. 

Earlier today my father came over, and when he got out of his car my neighbor (the black guy) stared my father down as he walked towards my front door. My dad is a little less agreeable than I am - he said to my neighbor ""Excuse me, is there something you have to say to me?"" And my neighbor said ""I don't know CRACKER, do you have something to say?"" And what followed was me having to separate my Dad from the situation because he was livid and would not stand to be disrespected like that - he wanted to throttle him. I successfully abaded this, but then later in the day my landlord calls me, and tells me my father is not allowed on the property anymore.

I am fucking fed up with this shit.

I happen to know that my neighbor is a felon. And I happen to know that he owns a gun. I want to report him because I think that it is exactly the punishment to fit what he's done to us. My girlfriend is entirely opposed to this and says I shouldn't add fuel to the fire. 

What is the right thing to do here?",27Nov2019,1
24,"So, a precursor to my dilemma, I am and have always been a perfectionist and I have been diagnosed, medically, with moderate to a severe case of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ever since I was in elementary school. Even to this day, I have trouble couping with half baked and incomplete things and I prefer to follow a laid out plain than randomly do something out of the blue. Additionally, I dislike allowing this condition to define me but today, I was called into a manager's office to discuss a complaint they received concerning me. For a little bit more context, this is my first retail job ever and I have only been working at this job for approx. seven days. Personally, I classify myself as a hard worker who rarely slacks off but the complaint was of me slacking off, not doing my job and not staying with my coworkers...   


Concerning this specific job, there are multiple areas for one to work in but during the past two days, I have essentially been cleaning. With the first day, I had no idea what I was doing and was essentially doing what my coworkers were doing and so I was a little bit slower than them but from what I had gathered we were responsible for cleaning two distinct areas, I will call them A and B. Concerning area A, there are multiple areas to clean and we were on a timer to clean each area which had multiple nooks to clean. Concerning area B, we were not on a timer for this and we were supposed to clean this area between our area A cleaning. With this in mind, I attempted to follow the schedule as best as I possibly could and try to clean these areas as best as I could. Throughout days 1 and 2, I mainly focused on Area A and attempt to make it as spotless as possible and checking underneath seats for trash, however, that has caused me to lag behind my coworkers as I have a tendency to check around and make sure even the tiniest speck does not exist. Moreover, some of our other duties include taking out the trash and making sure area B was free of trash and so I tried my best to attempt to keep to the schedule but a variety of different factors have caused me to get separated from my coworkers. For instance, one of my managers asked me to check the men's bathroom, or there was vomit which needed to be cleaned up in an area of high traffic, or there were wet floors, or the carpet was littered with specks of trash. One of the managers even told me in particular that it doesn't matter if we were on time, what matters most is that the area is clean and so I attempted to follow that to the best of my ability. For instance, the vomit was a biological hazard or a wet floor could cause someone to slip if not properly cleaned and such.  
 

Of course, there is more to the situation then what I have listed and there is always the complainer's/complainers' side so please take what I stated with a grain of salt but I could really use some advice. I really dislike using my OCD as an excuse but I also really dislike having a complaint on my record (I really have no idea if this goes on my record or not) but should I go talk to the managers and ask not to clean anymore... in all honesty, I really (as arrogant as this sounds) don't need this job... I just wanted experience in a field outside of technology... should I just put in my two weeks' notice... any advice would help... Thanks for reading.",27Nov2019,1

My father lives across the state (Florida) with my step mother. They’ve been married 20 years, and he is in his late 60s. He was diagnosed with frontal lobal dementia last year. 

My parents were divorced when I was young. My father also has a daughter and another son. My sister never speaks with them, and other brother is unreliable and rarely in touch with them. 

Last week, my step mother called and spoke with me at length about some issues she has been having with  my father. She revealed that he has been scammed out of money multiple times - in excess of $1,000. They’ve had to cancel multiple credit cards due to the spending. And then last week, he had pawned his jewelry to give to another scammer. 

All these scammers have a common thread that he continually falls for: they are younger, rich, beautiful women who have fallen in love with him. His delusions about this are tied to his dementia, as he believes he at some point created a huge dating database app that someone “stole out from underneath him” but that these women all are chasing him due to his “past fame.”

When he was in his 20s, he did some minor tours with popular acts as a backup bassist, even appearing in the background of some concert tour footage, and he is under the belief he has some renown. 

The first instance of this happening was apparently a story of how he believed the real Ariana Grande was wanting to flip houses with him and loved him. 

He apparently has been staying up late into the night as she sleeps, talking on different apps and websites with these people. It always ends up the same way. He’s asked for a divorce multiple times with her, only to completely forget in the morning and act his normal self with no or little recollection. Only to fall back into the cycle the next evening / night. 

Tonight we just spoke and she had me on the phone with him. I tried asking him many questions about his idea for divorce to gauge his mental state. He had issues answering questions, or would randomly interject by repeating TV ads he just saw to me, among other inconsistencies with the logic or time or place. 

We spoke for some time, then I spoke with my step mother again, who was obviously distraught. She knows it’s not his ‘normal’ self, but said she can’t stay with him. 

I’m looking for advice on how to proceed. I’m not very close with my father— he was very absent my entire life, but I’ve always kept in touch. I live about 3/4 hours away from them. His family is mostly in New York otherwise, except for a Brother of his who lives a similar distance away. 

I want to help her however I can, and I’ve reached out to his brother to talk, but haven’t heard back from him yet. I know my father will likely forget about everything, but I want to know what the best steps are for him and his mental health / state. 

I wasn’t even sure what to write here, and it feels like I’m rambling a bit. I live in a small apartment with a roommate, and do enough financially to get by. So I’m not sure what I can provide to the situation except that I’m apparently the only closest family member that cares to try to help. I’ve just no idea how to proceed or navigate this. Any advice would be appreciated.",27Nov2019,1
34,"I’ll try to make this as short as possible (TLDR at the bottom.) I looked nothing like my mother, father or brother growing up. They all had fair skin, lanky builds, straight blonde hair and green or blue eyes. I, however, have much darker skin, curly, auburn, kinky hair, tall, athletic curvy build, brown eyes, etc. I always asked my mom starting at a very young age why I looked so different. I always got a snide comment or excuse like, “that’s because I’m Sicilian and those genes are stronger.” None of it ever made any sense to me. 

All of a sudden my dad was out of the house (she told me she caught him cheating on her with her bff) and we were barely able to see him. He had a new family after a while and moved from NY to Florida. I only saw him once more. I loved him and never got along with my mother or brother as they abused me. Over time, she was able to convince me that my dad left us and didn’t care about me. I blocked all contact with him when I was about 10 per her request. He tried to reach out to me a few times but I was stubborn, dismissive and rude. 

Last year, my husband took it upon himself to reach out to him. After seeing what my dad looked like, he decided to get me an AncestryDNA test. My results came back that I was 40% from places like Senegal, Cameroon and Nigeria. This caused me to be beyond confused. I contacted a few people that shared dna with me to no avail. Most were distant cousins who barely knew their family either. I reached out to my dad and kind of freaked out. 

Turns out, he isn’t my biological father as I thought. She slept around a lot after my now half brother was born and out came a black baby girl. My dad took it upon himself to treat me as if I were his anyway, until she forced him away. He had no idea that I didn’t know any of this. She swore to him for years that I knew, so he never thought to bring it up to me in case it’d upset me. That all was almost a year ago and I have no idea what to do. The curiosity is driving me insane. I didn’t look at him as my dad since I was a small child and now that I know he isn’t, it’s hard to look at him as anything other than the other person in the world that knows how crazy my mom is. 

He has literally no idea who she slept around with and has no way of knowing who my biological father is. I haven’t talked to my mother in over a decade for good reason and I know she’d lie if I did try. I found some of her friends from back then on social media and they either dodged the questions or outright lied. At this point, I just want to know what he looks like. What his name is, or what he does. I’m not trying to find myself a father I guess, I just want to know where my traits came from. I’m the black sheep of the family and I just want some closure I guess. He might not even know he had a kid. I just don’t know what to do.

TLDR: My family is made up of blonde hair and blue eyes. I’ve always thought I was black. My mom cheated on my “dad” with a black man and had me. Dad tried to raise me as his own with my brother but was kicked out soon after. She made excuses forever, and told me he was my father. Took a dna test, found out I was indeed half black. Reached out to my “dad” after over a decade of having no contact. He thought I knew. All dna relatives were distant cousins and such and gave no clues to who my biological father is.",27Nov2019,1

38,Basically in front of large groups of people my legs start to shake. Last year when I was presenting one of my projects in front of the class my legs were shaking and I'm pretty sure my voice sounded a little shaky but thank God the teacher didn't notice that or I would have gotten points off. Another instance was this year when I had the highest GPA of 7th grade so the principal and all my teachers called me up congratulating me and my legs were shaking the most ever in front of a group if people. I mean I was in front of my whole school (kinda small 100 in 7th grade and 100 in it grade). Somehow nobody noticed and I'm kind of glad. How can I stop this from happening,27Nov2019,1

41,"So I'm down from college rn and my best friend wanted me to hang out and go shopping with her today. I've known her for awhile and she even admitted to having a crush on me before she started dating her bf 2 years ago. I view her as my sister at this point since that's how close we are but I'm starting to feel that she still likes me even while dating her bf. She dressed up all cute with tight black leggings and etc then rode over to my house today to pick me up. Well we rode over to the mall to go shopping and I was looking at some clothes. She got my attention and brought me over to the sexiest crop tops I've ever seen. She started holding them up to her and was like ""oh I used to wear these all the time and I loveeee them"". Then she went over to some bikinis and brought me while she was looking through a bunch of sexy ones to. At this point I was starting to get a boner not gonna lie. I tried to cover it the best I could but she looked down and gave me a sly smile when she looked back up to me. Well we kept on shopping and we got to a part of the mall where they had bed mattresses. Next thing I know she jumps down on the one beside of me and lays on her stomach so her ass is basically right up at me. Boner number 2 starts at this point. She told me to sit down beside of her and feel how soft the mattress is. I did but I kept on saying ""oh god oh god"" in my mind lol. We eventually leave the beds and she comes up to these big stuffed animal things standing up. Well she basically leans far into them and sticks her ass far out at me again to start up boner number 3 for me. Long story short I'm positive she still has feelings for me which is kinda awkward because she has a bf. I dont know how to respond to all of this since I don't feel like him coming to beat me up if he feels like me and her have feelings for each other....",27Nov2019,1

I have class with her and I make small talk with her on the way to our next classes (we take the same route). I usually initiate conversation and she doesn’t say much so I do most of the talking. I’ve heard that I should ask open ended questions, but it’s hard to fit them into conversation smoothly, so I just talk about whatever is related (Usually SAT/music club related).

43,"Title says it all- 

Basically I ordered a package that was set to be delivered by DHL. They were unable to deliver it and sent it to a USPS facility. USPS delivered it to our apartment complex's parcel lockers. 

Only problem is that I did not get a notification and have checked every day. It was delivered on the 19th this month. So that means USPS delivered my package to someone else's parcel locker. 

This package contained over $100 of cute clothes, whoever received my package definitely just kept it and didn't return it to the leasing office. 

So I filed a claim with USPS for this but I'm asking for advice on if I should do anything else? Has anyone even gotten a resolution through doing something like this?

46,"Hi, I'm terrible with words. I talk too much. I'll try to do my best and keep it short though. 

I moved around a lot, never had many friends. In high school freshmen year I managed to fall in with two dudes and on the outside we became fast friends. We hung out constantly and had some great times. However I never felt like I belonged with the group since we only shared two interests, anime and video games. 

After high school graduation we started talking less and spent next to no times together. I also introduced one of my other friends to them in college and he became way better friends with the original two than I ever was in no time. 

I was gradually phased out of the group- but I can't blame anyone here except myself because I'm a terrible person. I was competitive over everything and was terrible at group functions, I'd always assume I had to carry the night and be the center when in reality I hated the focus being on me. So I was kind of a psychopath that more or less ruined that whole friendship and hurt the two original guys at the end of it because I more or less blew up on them then bailed. 

All of this went down years ago though and because of some stuff that has happened recently, I reached out to one of them. Or rather, I did the absolute minimum to what you could call a ""reach"". I followed him on social media. Then I see a message in my inbox the next day that says ""Lets talk.""

Now I'm scared. I've done this in the past with different friends because I have a tradition of abandoning people before I think they'll abandon me. Then, years later when I'm really depressed I contact them again and they ALWAYS immediately ask to get together with me ASAP. But WHY!? I'm terrible! I always leave the 'relationship' on bad terms. Also I was no prize back in the day. With what little recordings of our hangouts/conversations I have, I'm... I don't know, just not a fun guy to be around. Yet they always want to see me again, usually just a handful of times before we never talk again for real this time. And that's what sucks, you'd think I would have changed with age, but no, I'm still an asshole. That's why I try to spend all my time alone so I stop ruining things. 

Because of all this, this is why I'm scared to talk to him again. I don't want him to see that I'm still the same piece of shit I've always been... Yet at the same time I feel like I need people I can call friends...",27Nov2019,1

51,"You can look at my previous posts on Reddit to get a flavor for the ABSOLUTE EPIC shitshow of my life.  Basically, I am cognitively impaired and getting worse.  I have no insurance of any kind.  Wife\* (domestic partner) argued with me when I panicked about health insurance recently since she doesn't believe in mainstream medicine...

My income is decreasing in 2020 by 1/3 and I have realized far too late my wife is WAY bipolar and has absolutely ruined us financially.  We have been fighting for months about money and she has berated me for thinking we won't have enough money.  (We won't - we have no savings NOW.)  Due to my health I turned everything over to her - banking, bills, spending -  and in hindsight I simply trusted her and did not exercise any oversight.  When I did stick my nose in I got responses along the lines of ""I'll handle it"".   With my head the way it is I just sort of shelved the issue assuming she was on top of it.  

The past few months is like waking up from a long coma.  I have started to raise concerns about the spending/debts (far too late) and she has savaged me, saying I'm stupid and don't understand the budget or money (which I confess is true), I'm faithless, I don't trust her, I am too negative because everything is no, etc.  It seems like she's on a long, manic bender with no end in sight and it's getting worse.  I walk around like a zombie contemplating this doom, I have spent countless hours trying to figure out which means to use to kill myself (thanks /r/SuicideWatch/), etc.     

I don't see how this can end except in homelessness and ABSOLUTE ruin - I mean losing my job for good (a job I cannot replicate it), putting her and three kids (one in college, one in local community college, one in high school) on the street or in public housing, I have no idea where our stuff would go, they may not have a functioning car, etc.  She has no degree and is almost unemployable due to her unreliability (chronically tardy) and attitude, which I used to find charming.  Now, not so much.

So in sum this entire situation wildly exceeds my capacity to handle it.  It probably exceeds the capacity of a small law firm and a team of therapists to handle.   The question is: do I ask my elderly parents to bail me out to some degree?  Dad is 80+ and slowly dying of cancer.  Mom is upper 70s and still sharp.  

If I don't ask the result is that one day in the moderately close future I'm going to call them and tell them I am homeless and jobless and have literally lost everything.  

If I do ask it is going to add ENORMOUS stress to their lives :(  I might end up homeless anyway. 

I don't even know if I can save myself, to say nothing of her - I am up to my eyeballs in credit card and tax debt - quite possibly ruined for the rest of my life.  I have no idea how to fix my health issues.  

Anyway, I'm basically a shut in and I have no family to speak of so Reddit's collective perspective is GREATLY appreciated.",27Nov2019,1

55,"I had to mail some sensitive docs and had an overnight priority Fedex label. This was at work and we have two different places for USPS and Fedex mail. Unfortunately, in all my wisdom, I didn't pay attention to where I placed my mail and ended up putting it in the USPS bin. This was on November 15th.

It is now November 26th and my mail has still not shown up anywhere. Fedex has supposedly never received it because the barcode hasn't been scanned yet (so the tracking number tells me nothing).   
I have called both Fedex, USPS, and the location that the mail is supposed to be sent to. No one was able to verify or figure out a plan/solution. 

The ideal situation is where USPS contacts Fedex and Fedex picks up the package. I suspect that this hasn't taken place yet though since the barcode on the label hasn't been scanned. I don't know how often this contact happens or if there is a way to push for it...

Another situation would be where USPS sends my mail to the return address on the label, which is on the literal other side of the country (USA). I don't know how long it takes snail mail to make that trip though... but if it ends up taking more than 2 weeks then I'm gonna be pretty sad (and it's probably safe to assume it takes more than 2 weeks).

I have issued a 'missing mail' situation on the USPS website. They called me back and said that they would check for my mail at my location's distribution center - which is probably the best course of action right now. They were supposed to call me back after confirming it is there or not there and that hasn't happened. (Perhaps I'm being a little impatient because it's sensitive docs tho)

For years we went through the same struggles most people that have dealt with it go through, the lying, stealing, manipulation, etc.  After 7 or so years and multiple rehabs he finally made it after he left the state and went to another rehab out-of-state.  All went well for a while, about 8 years, he found a job, had a house, was coming for visits and for holidays and things recently went downhill.  It started when he lost his job, then he got evicted and things are basically back to square one with him, not exactly sure of his usage amount or what he's even using but I'm assuming an opiate of some sort.

60,"Hey everyone I’m pretty lost in life at the moment so just looking for some guidance. The basic gist is I have no friends, never had a girlfriend for an extended period(not a Virgin though), and spend almost every hour of every day by myself in my apartment. 
One of the biggest things for me is I do not look 19, I probably look more like 16 or 17 so I feel like women don’t find me attractive and men look down on me as if they are better. I have anxiety and live in a city, and sometimes I just can’t get outside even to get some food when I’m starving. A main reason for this is I am always walking alone and feel like I’m being watched or people are judging me for being so young and alone. I would like to start skating places again but can’t bring myself to go practice at the park because again I have no friends to go with and I’m worried I’ll be bullied there to.
I had opportunities in college this semester to make friends / it seemed like some people wanted to grow a relationship with me (mostly women too) However my mental health has declined since the start of the semester and I worried people would see that so I sort of shut them out a bit. I also was worried I’d get to know someone and then they’d want to meet my friends and I’d have to say I have none and then they too would leave me thinking I’m weird. The truth is I do have a few friends in my area but I don’t want to see them anymore because all they do is get high and it’s really boring and uneventful. I have aspirations, and I want a team with me!
The flip side of the coin in life right now is I have started an online clothing business. My designs are all one of a kind and in a short time I have made many friends who also design on Instagram. I worry these are inauthentic friendships centered around us growing our pages but atm I don’t care at least it’s something. 
I just want some creative people in my life who can introduce me to more creative and ambitious people. This way I can have a circle of people who I’ve actually met in person to support me and have fun with in ways I would like more then just getting high. I am really starting to lose hope since I turn 20 soon and have not had a social circle since before high school ended

69,"Hey r/advice posting this on a throwaway just in case. 
During the entirety of November I have been feeling down, hell even during most of October, because of this one girl and my own stupidity. We met 4 years ago accidentally in HS when we traveled together with a choir (We weren't from the same HS). Pretty soon we became good friends , and we texted basically everyday. Eventually I guess it got flirty and at my 18th birthday we were really touchy and feely and whatever (Mind you I never really got the signals that women sent me, ever.) . Fast forward to  2018, we have this conversation about how my birthday is coming up and she says ""Oh you should deffo invite me to your birthday party! You have to etc.."" I told her not to sweat it and if I did decide to celebrate the birthday she'd be at the top of my list. I never ended up celebrating it and we didnt talk much about it, I think. I guess I just wasnt feeling it then and I'd have rather spent the money my parents gave me on some clothes or a trip to another city or whatever. Some time before or after she told me that I had to invite her to my bp, she organized a party where she invited a small circle of her close friends including me. She got fairly drunk that night and kept sitting beside me paying attention exclusively to me, hugging me, carressing my hair and my arms. At that point I didnt think much of it haha. Fast forward two months her birthday comes up and I send her my best wishes and everything. Pretty sure she told me she would not organize a bp and i was fine with that after all I didnt make one and she was a year older than me so it made sense, guess I thought it was more mature. However curse you social media for existing since I saw a story of her in a bar l that could've been rented, with a friend from the choir singing dancing and having fun. Now me being my paranoid self assumed that she organized a bp without me which meant a lot to me since she was literally one of the only people I confided to. I talked to her about it and she cleared it up so i apologized for being so overly paranoid. But here's the kicker after a day or two she posted a story of her blowing out candles with most of her friends there (from the small gathering) and her receiving a gift etc. I was in absolute shock and just dmd her ""Wow..."". We didnt talk much after that and even if we had i was quite cold since she hurt me pretty bad. Recently tho i've wanted to link up again see how shes doing maybe take her out for a drink, but out of nowhere she posted that she moved to the UK?? Who just does that during their second year of univerisity, whatever i dmd her before knowing that she moved to London asking if we had an argument or something since she went silent for 4 months, and she told me i had an argument with myself. I've tried dming her two or three more times but I'd get the same dry replies every other dude gets. The problem is that i think I've fallen for this girl and I've come to realise it only recently. What should I do? I've been thinking of asking her to get a coffee with me when she's back here so that I can get all of this off of my chest just to ease the burden a little bit. I dont expect anything i just want to talk to her but it's proving to be rather difficult and I have problems expressing my emotions as it is.

73,"My ex (21M) and I (20F) broke up last year after 3 years, and I just got accepted to his university as a transfer student. It was a very kind break up and we stayed friends, there's no ill feelings at all between us and the last thing I want to do is get back together. However, I got accepted to my dream university, the same university he attends. I know his friends there, we've all hung out before and after our breakup. 

My fear is that my transferring there sounds, to be blunt, absolutely psychotic. All I want to do is give him space, but now I'm questioning whether I should even attend. To make matters more anxiety-inducing, he is still grieving the relationship while I have moved on. I only want to study there and make different friends, yet I'm afraid of being judged by his friends and his parents as a stalker or obsessive. Should I just give up going there? It's not a big university, it has around 2,000 students-- so we would see each other, and I would see his friends. I want to emphasize that there's no bad feelings between anyone, I'm just very conscious and careful about the situation because I know how it sounds. 

I've directly told him that there's no chance of getting back together even if I do transfer, and he is generally supportive despite still hurting. If I do accept the admission offer, I would plan to give him a lot of space for the first month or semester, and it would help me find different friends.

For some reason, the thing I'm most afraid of is being judged by his friends and having to explain hundreds of times why I have transferred (scholarship, best program for my psychology degree). 

Do you have any advice for how to handle this situation?  What's your view of this?",27Nov2019,1

75,"
I always get butterflies in my stomach when I see my crush. She is so incredibly beautiful, I don't care what my friends think. And her hugs make me feel like I'm in heaven. Her voice is also so beautiful it's like music to my ears. But she already has a boyfriend and whenever I see them holding hands I get super jealous. Her boyfriend is also seemlingly perfect, though he did lie to me a few weeks ago, and I became so sad then that I actually started crying. My crush also lied to me before that, and I had also started crying then. I cried because I thought I could always trust them (I still do, but I know that they can lie to me now).

I'm really bad at talking to girls my age, so bad I've never lost my virginity or even kissed a girl. Basically all the girls in my class are really sarcastic specifically when they're talking to me, because they know I'm pretty retarded. For an example, when they listened to my music, they told me it was great and I was going to become a top artist, while they were laughing. And I'm kinda upset because I thought I had put in some work into my music, and at least one of my best friends was honest when he said my music is terrible. There's only like one girl in my class who's not sarcastic when talking to me (she's really nice and I wish I had the courage to talk to her more).

I was usually not nervous around my crush, but since I got a crush on her I've started becoming really nervous, and it pisses me off because I want to start a conversation with her but I don't know what to say without it being just a really quick question that leads to nowhere.

But basically my question is, what should I do? Should I at least attempt to make my cousin like me or should I just give up? Or should I just wait and see if my cousin breaks up with her boyfriend (there is probably like a 1% of this ever happening though)?

TL;DR I have a huge crush on my cousin, who already has a boyfriend. I'm terrible at talking to girls my age, and trying to impress them. What should I do? Should I at least attempt to make my cousin like me or should I just give up?",27Nov2019,1
76,"I work in retail and an autistic customer came in very close to closing. He wasn’t being rude, but my coworker told me that last time he came in, he spent an hour having her pick out outfits for women he knew, and then disclosed that he didn’t intend to buy any of them because he had no money. She was really uncomfortable and didn’t want to talk to him, so I did. When he asked me to find an outfit for a woman he knew, I found an outfit based on the description he gave me, and then answered him when he asked me why it would be good for her. I then asked him if he intended to buy the clothes, and he said ""No, I just want to feel. I don’t have any money."" This went on for 30 minutes after closing, even after I informed him that we were close to closing time. He prefaced every request for me to find an outfit with ""This will be the last one,"" but it never was. My manager doesn’t let us tell customers to leave if they come in before we‘re officially closed, so I didn’t feel like I could ask him to leave, since he wasn’t doing anything wrong, but it made me really uncomfortable and I felt like I was wasting my time. I don’t want to be mean, but what do I do to avoid this happening if/when he comes back?",27Nov2019,1
77,I got her number from a group chat but I don’t know if that’s the best option.,27Nov2019,1
78,"Backstory. I had an 8 month relationship with a woman I find absolutely amazing. I 100% love this girl and would do anything for her. We met at a hard time in my life when my father had a massive heart attack and barely survived with the help of doctors. Well I developed extreme anxiety and what some people tell me is PTSD after seeing my dad in a coma for a week. Well this girl and I quickly developed a casual relationship but also completely fell for each other. We just clicked on every level. We get along so well and I could always come to her and confide in her and she always knew exactly what to do or say. She became my rock. From February this year all through the summer, my anxiety worsened. But she was very understanding. She would always be honest and tell me if it was too much for her so I could lay off and just tell my therapist the rest. Cause it’s not really fair to her to make that her job. But we always had an understanding and made it work. 

We only had one major issue. She’s polyamorous and I’m monogamous. So we stayed casual. We agreed to enjoy the time we had together while we had it. I came to an understanding I wouldn’t get to be with her forever because she would inevitably fall for other people and want other people. 

Well that day finally came. About two months ago I was having a panic attack. I got a hold of her to talk and she very abruptly just dumped me. She said she didn’t want to be romantically involved anymore because it was too much for her to handle and she wanted to remain friends. So I respected her and I tried. But it was too hard for me. I missed waking up by her side and having her as mine. It was killing me. I was losing a lot of sleep and having more frequent panic attacks. So I told her I just couldn’t do it right now and she understood and was very reasonable and told me to come back if I was ever ready to be friends. 

Fast forward to today. I’ve been seeing a new girl who absolutely hates my ex for the way/timing of her dumping me. This girl and I are nothing serious and I don’t see her as a good compatible partner. She has too many drug habits for me to be comfortable. Well today at 3 am she messaged my ex and called her “fucking trash”. 

I inevitably woke up to a message from my ex asking why this girl I’m friends with was calling her this. I didn’t have an explanation but I apologized to her and told her it wouldn’t happen again. 

She then proceeded to tell me she still loves me. And misses me. And regrets everything. She told me she has been working on herself to change for me and has been waiting for a good time to be able to prove to me she is better. She said she got a new full time job, stopped letting her ex pay her rent. Cut him off completely. Cut off other guys she had been talking to. Let her mom move in to help pay the rent. And even been talking to her therapist about it. Saying she has realized that even though she’s poly, she can be monogamous and can control herself and her actions. She says she wants a life partner and wants to commit because she doesn’t enjoy her solitude anymore and wants real love. She says since she loves me so much, she’s been hoping for the chance to prove herself to me. 

I was very hesitant at first. She honestly broke my heart when she ended things. But I haven’t stopped thinking about her at all. So I continued to hear her out. She apologized relentlessly for the way she ended things and treated me and really wants another chance. I told her we could meet next Thursday on my day off to talk to her and evaluate her and she even said I don’t need to make a decision now. I’m allowed to take my time and truly decide if she’s changed for the better. 

But in my past experience people don’t change. On the other end I want nothing more than to be with her. She makes me feel complete. 

So what I’m asking is, am I stupid for wanting to be back with her? Should I even consider this? Should I get back with her since we love each other so much? All of her friends have told me she’s always talking about me and wishing things didn’t end between us. And all my friends would tell you I’m the exact same way. 

TLDR: Should I forgive my ex for dumping me with poor and get back with her?",27Nov2019,1
79,"I started talking to a guy on Tinder in early October, he's in New York and I'm in Calgary. He said he goes to Calgary for business.

Now it's the last week of November and he said it will have to be December but ""definitely before Christmas.""

Also he is apparently wealthy so technically he could fly here anytime he wanted. But he said he needs a ""financial reason"" to come here, as in business-related (he's the COO of the company).

83,"I'm currently in a cross roads in my career. I've been an electrician for the last 10 years but realized my body may not be able to take more of it and need another career path. A lot of other jobs in the construction/commercial/industrial field I'm in require X amount of prior experience which I don't really have so moving into those types of jobs ie estimator, contract specialist, auditor have been out of reach. I may even find a random job to support myself and go back to school as I only have an AA for my trade. Even right now I'm not really sure what career to get into, as I don't want to get into something I absolutely hate. I like the electrical industry but after filling out my resume and going on interviews I feel like I'm lacking to really nail a job in anything but an electrician.

85,"Hi, all! So, I talk about this problem a lot with friends and stuff, but I'd like to hear some outside opinions on it too. By trade, I'm an aircraft mechanic for the military. Which is an awesome job and I like it, but it's not what I always wanted to do, y'know? It definitely set a solid foundation for me to pursue what I WOULD like, however. I'm nearing the end of my enlistment (7 years down, 1 to go), and I've found myself torn between two VERY different paths on where to go from here. 

The plan regardless immediately after the military was to work inside my current field for a bit (it's extremely easy for us to get hired by, say, Boeing or Bosch immediately after our enlistment) while also going to school to finish my degree. This is where the career divide is-- pursuing a job related to my passion, or something that I'm confident I would be very good at, but isn't necessarily my passion.

Ever since I was young, I have been an artist. Growing up it wasn't even a question that I wanted to be a professional illustrator and make it my full time job. Around highschool, however, times got extremely hard and I fell in with a very bad crowd. My grades tanked, I almost didn't graduate, and I stopped drawing because I lost interest in all my hobbies around that time. In order to get my shit back on track and not struggle after I graduated, I did what most of my immediate family had done right after HS-- join the military. 

I don't regret it, but it was a difficult adjustment for me. I was very rebellious, had issue with discipline and authority and was equipped with a smart ass mouth that's gotten me in trouble more times than I can humanly count. I did finally adjust though, and now I'm loving the life and fit in well with my unit; they're all very supportive and awesome individuals who have given me so many resources to improve. They showed me I was capable of much, much more than I thought possible. They reminded me of a pipe dream I had growing up, in which I wanted to join the military in a combat position, or even FBI Hostage Rescue Team, etc... but, at the time of me enlisting, women were not legally allowed to hold combat or front-line positions. I figured it would be nothing but a fantasy for me. 

So imagine my surprise when the exclusion policy was lifted! I was overjoyed and immediately began looking into it-- I know it's hard work, but I know it's also something I would excel in. I want to be out there making a direct impact, helping people, and I wholeheartedly believe I'm mentally and emotionally equipped for such a taxing field. (I've gotten comments all my life telling me I'm eerily calm during traumatic events, I work well under pressure, I don't lose my cool, etc.) 

So back to the problem at hand. I'm at a crossroads of ""where do I go from here?"" and I know it's mostly a personal decision, but I constantly waffle on what kind of life I want to lead after this. Art would come naturally to me, sure, but without much of the financial security, and I'm scared doing what I love for money will diminish my passion for it... But I love movies and video games, so it'd be cool to draw for them. I'm already in the military, however, so I feel like moving to a front-line position or even transitioning to the FBI or some other federal agency wouldn't be much of a gear-shift for me; and I know I'm good at this. Money wouldn't be an issue, and I don't mind a job with physical risk. It would be objectively harder, of course. 

When faced with a huge decision like this, what helped you choose? 

tl;dr I'm stuck deciding on what I want to do with my life career wise; between art, which is my passion and has been since I was a little girl, or getting into combat/front line positions for the military or other federal agencies, which I'm already somewhat adjusted to thanks to being active duty already. I'm also scared of losing the financial security that the military provides in the form of a steady paycheck and benefits, when working in a creative field seems to be much more volatile.",27Nov2019,1

[This is his missing poster.](http://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMC/1375277/1/screen) We've been in touch with the police, CPS, National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and National Runaway Safeline. This is the deal, my parents adopted him 5 years ago. He was in foster care for 5 years before that. His bio father is in prison and his bio mom lives in Oklahoma City. She is on probation. I have not personally talked to his probation officer, I can't get ahold of her. A little over 2 weeks ago Matthew, my missing little brother, stole my dad's medicine and replaced it with different medicine. Normally he is not home alone, but my dad was in the hospital with double pneumonia. He skipped school and partied at home. Mom came home to find my Dad's wheelchair outside and partially disassembled and the medication swapped. She called the police and Matthew ran away. He didn't realize that he was logged into Facebook Messenger on my Dad's phone so we found out he contacted his bio mother and she was on her way to Arlington, TX from Oklahoma City, OK to pick not only him but his older brother up. We intercepted him and called his older brother's guardian and prevented that as well. We reported this to the police and they said they couldn't do anything because nothing actually happened. His older brother's guardian said she was able to speak with bio mom's probation officer and was told that she already has a warrant out for her arrest because she has been noncompliant. On the 21st Matthew asked to borrow my dad's phone. Dad is not in the best shape, he had a stroke a couple of years ago, and doesn't always think everything through. So, my dad let him use his phone. He logged out of Facebook messenger and didn't call anyone. We are assuming that he contacted bio mother again because he vanished about 5:15 that evening.  The police are being useless and we just keep getting told we are doing everything right after being asked a million questions. What do we do? His bio mother can't get him into school or take him to the doctor. He is very troubled and is supposed to be on psychiatric medication, but of course he didn't even take any of that with him. Everyone that we know of who has contact with the bio mother is refusing to give us any information on her whereabouts. Any suggestions on what we can do?

We have been friends for 5 years, but only over the last year started to become closer and spend more time together in a group setting.

She dated a good friend of mine, and they broke up a little over a year ago. It was a rough breakup, but I believe they are both over it. He and I are not as close anymore but still talk regularly.

Some of my friends are trying to set her up with other guys, while also trying to set me up with other girls. I am almost certain she has a crush on someone else.

My friends had asked her how she felt about me about a year ago, but she said she wanted to just be friends. We have become closer friends during that time, but I doubt her opinion has changed.

I realize that a relationship at this point is probably not going to happen. I'm just getting sick of holding the feelings in as it's beginning to impact my sleep and other areas of my mental health. Telling her could jeopardize my friendship with her as well as my friendship with her ex. I don't see that ending well but at the same time don't know what else to do other than trying to forget about my feelings.

The answer may seem clear, we should tell the authorities. But, it gets a bit harder. H's father is very overprotective, and gets very angry. If H's father learns about what happened, he may hurt A. 

So we have no idea what to do. H feels horrible because of what happened but, if we tell authorities, H's father will learn and be very, very angry. H's father will hurt A if he finds out.

95,"   My (20F) partner (25M) and I have been together for 2 years now. The past year of it has been long distance until a little over a month ago when I drove myself and all of my belongings to his home state. I dropped out of college my second year because I wasn’t getting what I needed for a 40k a year art education. I moved here in hopes of making more time to do what I love, live in a new place, and be with the person I love. 

Since then I feel like my emotional interest and connection with him has been non-existent. Primarily because since I’ve moved here we are constantly arguing or on the edge of an argument. 
   
Prior to moving, I was so excited to be here and be with him. Now I often consider going home, even though it doesn’t feel like an option anymore since I have a job, we have two cats, and plans for traveling over the next few months. I don’t know what I would do if I went home or how I would even do it. 
   
We argue over things pretty consistently, and sometimes it feels like we’re both saying the same thing but hearing it differently. It is over very simple things that become extremely intense. Every time we argue I want to pack up and leave. I have severe anxiety which causes me to have panic attacks or get extremely emotional, as well as trauma of men raising their voices which means I cry every time we begin to argue. 
 
I tend to hold onto these arguments while he gets over them quickly, which I am trying to work on. The amount of arguing makes it hard for me to feel comfortable being loving or open with him. I have trouble letting go of resentment after an argument and also have a hard time not falling into extreme mental lows.

I don’t know if I am still adjusting to moving to a new place where I’m not in my element, or if my mental health if just affecting how I feel towards him (I’ve struggled with depression and severe social anxiety since middle school), or if I just simply made a mistake by moving here for him. And I have no idea how to bring any of this up to him without it causing a major argument and possibly leaving me on the street in a state far away from anyone that could help me. 

I would love to hear anyone experience moving across the country to be with a signifiant other and how that may have changed the relationship. Or really just any and all advice.

I have an opportunity to work in Hong Kong its a contract position in my field of study for 6 months. Pay isn't really good but as a student I wanted that international experience that could set me apart from the rest. I was looking for this role when the situation there wasn't too bad, but now its not looking very safe at all.

101,"Met this guy two years ago at a small party/friend gathering. We were both drunk and made out and that was about it. He asked what I was doing the next Friday night but I had an event I couldn’t miss. I asked him if he wanted to hang out Saturday and then he bailed. We snap chatted every day since we met and became best friends on Snapchat. He would also come study with me and we talked for hours. He studied abroad the following semester but we still snap chatted and texted pretty regularly and even call occasionally. Fast forward to beginning of next school year and he starts dating a girl until 3-4 weeks ago. Only thing is he never once mentioned her or a girlfriend at all to me and still snap chatted as usual. Now that they broke up, he texts more often and were best friends on snap again. He graduated last year so we don’t see each other as often. I’m just confused bc we talk a decent amount like every day and I don’t even keep up that kind of communication with my other friends so I just don’t even know what he thinks of me...like are we really good friends? Does he like me? Any thoughts on what the heck is going on? He’s usually the first to text/snap and then I’ll reply and the convo will go from there. We drunk snapped each other a lot in the beginning and occasionally since then but he never tried to hook up with me again since the night we met. He’s also just like complimented me and told me when I look good and two summers ago randomly said “I love you” a lot but clarified he was joking one of those times.

102,"Hey I've been really struggling socially, and I just wanted to know what you guys would do.

I've recently gotten to know a girl in my class that's exceptionally socially skilled. She knows how to ask the right questions, how to keep up a conversation, and how to keep you interested in whatever topic she's talking about.

She's shown clear signs that she's interested in me by: maintaining a lot of eye contact, flipping her hair, fidgeting, asking to meet up, talking about her family, asking me for help with stuff, trying to initiate touch, but the main problem is me. I struggle in showing emotions, I struggle in asking the right thing at the right time, and I struggle in remembering things.

Let's say she says something like ""My 18 year old sister just told me that her friend's been missing school a lot"" I know to ask something like ""Oh how long has her friend been missing school for?"" then possibly follow it up with ""Did your sister decide on a university program to apply to?"" But I can't think of such questions on the spot, or at least it's difficult for me for the most part. I'd just end up saying ""Oh wow I hope her friend's okay""

106,"So today a had an appointment with orthodontist and the gist of it, is that although I don’t necessarily have a serious underbite, my teeth are on top of each other. At first I thought it’d be for cosmetic reasons, but then she said that my teeth would eventually get worn down and I’d have complications later on with getting crowns (teeth wearing down) and all sorts of stuff.

I didn’t even realize it was this bad, (needing surgery is serious to me) and from looking on here Ive never even thought of myself as having an underbite, and it hasn’t affected me in any way as I can tell, and nobody has ever commented on it or anything. 

I don’t think it’s even noticeable and you’d have to look at when I bite down to actually realize it, but today I just felt really self conscious and just really sad. Like shit maybe my face is weird and all I can think about is like what if my face does weird or what if I’m ugly, and what if I do look super weird to other people. Maybe it’s more a mental thing but now I do feel self conscious about myself, and that was just like a zap of my confidence and self esteem. 

The whole thing was kind of like a punch in the gut bc I have a serious fear of surgeries and procedures, and it’s always been really hard on me mentally and physically. And she talked about it being this whole process and I would need to increase my underbite for some reason and she didn’t really specifically explain why exactly, and her whole spiel was really confusing and kind of unhelpful. And to be fair she said she said she isn’t really to informed on everything and said it would be better to ask the surgeon or the people who we would be seeing during the consultation.

I’m already thinking about a million things and I just didn’t really need this during finals week, and I’m like doing bad in two classes and now I need to worry about this whole thing. 

I mostly care about how my face is going to look after and what if they mess up or something and end worse or something. Also is this going to make me more symmetrical or make my jawline better, or might it make my face asymmetrically something.

If anyone would could shed light on anything and maybe talk about your experiences with jaw surgery or any type, I would appreciate it so much.",27Nov2019,1

Last night i woke up with my pillows strewn everywhere, one even laying on my back, as i was crying and strangling another one. I remember some details but i know that the end i was being attacked and was fighting back. 

I wasnt able to fall back asleep so i decided to clean up my bed and found a quarter laying underneath my pillow.

113,"First and foremost - this isn’t a “man be leader” macho post. This isn’t “woman be mom” post. This is our family dynamic.

I’m the main income for our family. My wife’s goal has always been to be home with our children so she could raise them and support them. I’ve always been behind that - it’s what she wants and I have no issue with that arrangement.

A couple of years ago, I took on a big responsibility increase that allowed for her to achieve this goal. It was so meaningful to me that I was able to do that with a 1 year old (and now a second child today).

However, with that came more stress personally. It’s a lot of work. I have gained 30 pounds in two years and it’s mainly related to stress eating and not working out as much as I use to. I just don’t have the time. I am up at 6am, I’m getting stuff ready for the kids (son is in preschool) and I leave to head to work. I get home around 530-6pm. When I get home it’s dinner, clean up from dinner, kids in bath, bed time. It’s now roughly 730-8 pm.

The problem is this - she isn’t doing anything around the house. I’m being kind when I say anything. Laundry isn’t done. The sink is loaded and food everywhere (not great with winter/mice), every room is a disaster. I get kids are a ton of work (weekends are romper room for the kids and me). But what happens is that 8pm I’m doing laundry. I’m doing dishes. I’m cleaning up, packing for tomorrow. Folding laundry that’s clean. Sometimes after work I’m buying 200 dollars worth of food, coming home, putting it away, etc. Most nights I don’t sleep until 11 at the earliest, most nights midnight.

All this and she’s out to the world, in bed, by 9 at the latest. Usually 8-830.

I mentioned to her like 8 months ago that I respect and understand her difficulty with having two kids around all day, but I felt slightly annoyed that just one of these things couldn’t be accomplished. Especially when she’s shopping with her mother twice a week.

After an initial reaction of annoyance and frustration with my comments, she felt bad and did work on it for like 2-3 weeks. But we are here again. And I know she won’t be as understanding this time around.

What do I do? I’ve grown resentful of her lately. I just want a teammate.",27Nov2019,1
114,"Hi everyone. I have had a horrible year and I feel very stuck and I'm not sure what to do. Long post, tl;dr at the bottom. 

So in April this year I found out my papa had stage 4 lung cancer. They suspected it before but couldn't tell because all the tests they needed to do to confirm it were going to be iffy since he was weak and had thin skin and such. So after they confirmed it I was really upset and scared because he was too weak to do chemo. They suggested he go on hospice. My nana and papa are my grandparents but they raised me in the same house with my parents. Our house is like a duplex and I live on my grandparents side. So I saw my nana and papa every single day for almost my whole life (I am 26). 

So anyway literally 3 days after I found out, a girl I considered one of my only 3 friends basically came out and told me I suck and I'm never going anywhere with my life. She told me I could totally afford a car and I could get more hours at work but I wasn't trying hard enough. I only had 700 dollars saved up at that time and I was still working 4 days a week. She just went on about how she doesn't agree with my life and whatever. So I just didn't reply anymore. Cut her out completely. She has been toxic for a while, but it doesn't stop me from missing her. We were friends since age 10. 

So now I'm dealing with the papa thing and losing one of my friends. I go into work and I'm a fucking mess mentally and they pull me into the office and tell me I'm late. I have neeeverrrr been late. I pride myself on time management. So I explained what my schedule said. It ended up being computer error but I started crying and my supervisor was so understanding and they were really great about not stressing me out. 

Well not long after that, one of the two cars I was borrowing crapped out. So I had to reduce my days at work to 3. They were fine with it but I felt bad. While all this is going on, I have a whole other story happening with my parents. My mom and step dad got divorced in 2011. He was with a couple people after a few years but he completely forgot about me. Hardly talked to me, forgot my birthday, and was OBSESSED with my mom. All he ever talked about was her and blaming people she was hanging out with for the divorce. For 8 fucking years lol. 

So this year he started talking to me more because I guess my mom and him planned to meet. He said he wanted to see me and so I took a day off work so we could hang out since he lives 8 hours away. Well he never messaged me, never showed up, never called. 3 days later he posted on Facebook so I message him like what the fuck??? And he said ""I did not come. God said it wasn't right"" etc etc.

Within the last 3 years he went from being a non believer to a 7th day Adventist because he ""drank enough to kill himself but he didn't die so that's god himself working"". Anyway.

So then soon it's the end of august. My birthday is September 2nd. My mom sat me down and told me my dad was moving back in. I was like uhhh what??? They had a toxic relationship where they yelled and hit each other. It was never ever a good relationship. So I'm trying to be supportive and I ask if she's gonna be happy? She said ""wellllll idk we will see ....it is what it is...this isn't ideal.."" so I'm like wow okay. We think she wanted him here to do house repairs and stuff, and to do heavy tasks since she has heart problems. 

So he comes right after my birthday. For 2 weeks he is up everyone's ass just being crazy. Coming into my room saying he hates his mom and starts crying because he's violating a commandment and he's going to hell now and how he should have quit music before my mom divorced him because maybe she wouldn't have if he had quit his band. Doing this every day to everyone for 2 whole weeks. All over my Facebook (before I blocked my posts from him) telling me all sorts of crazy bullshit.

So then it was my papas birthday on September 15. We celebrated. He turned 75!! So he's still on hospice but it's weird because this whole time he didn't seem sick enough to be on hospice. But then a nurse said he seemed better and it was good. But I have read enough about death to know that it gets better before people die. So things were good for a few days. Then one night I hear my nana screaming really loudly. So I rush out to the living room and she's screaming at my papa that she hates him and wants him to die and she's gonna call hospice to take him away. I asked her wtf happened and I followed her in her room. 

She says he cheated on her (she knew about this for at least 27 years she said) and I guess it got brought up in conversation that night and he said something horrible to her. They both hit each other and she was sobbing so hard and I didn't know what to do so I just hugged her while she talked about it. I told her if she wanted to move him to a home I could understand that. It was a really big mess and it was drama filled. She didn't end up moving him to a home, she calmed down a little. 

Meanwhile papa seems worse now, he can barely get up and when he did he fell and hurt himself a few times. He was sleeping a lot and barely eating and not coming out of the room hardly at all. So September 23 we asked if we could get hospice to bring in a hospital bed and a catheter for us. They bring it the 24th and it was hard to move him. He had barely been conscious the last few days. They ended up using a sheet to transfer him to the hospital bed. 

Well later that night I go in the room and he's breathing really badly (he was a chain smoker until he got on oxygen a few months back and had COPD and bad breathing in general.) Nana said she didn't think he would make it through the night. He sounded so bad. (May have been the death rattle) I had to say my goodbyes to my only good father figure. He died on the 25th. I have never lost anyone so I don't know how to deal with grief. 

My counselor cancelled on me a few days before he died and she never rescheduled. So I'm trying to deal with all these weird feelings because now I know papa was a cheater and also diagnosed a sociopath. But I never saw those sides of him so I'm trying to get my feelings right. 

Meanwhile my dad is up everyone's ass again about how my papa was his only good role model and now he's hurt that he was a bad man, etc etc...he's sobbing about how I never see him even though he lives here now, he's convincing me to be religious, telling me I should just go to college etc just really harping on me. Telling my bf he doesn't know how to cook and just really annoying the hell out of us. I am just so stressed with all the holidays coming and my papa won't be here but my dad will and it sucks. It just plain sucks. My nana is annoyed by my dad as well so we have bonded over that lol. 

And on top of it my job is getting to be worse by the day. I work at a grocery store and I get insulted and yelled at and treated like shit all the time. I hate it. So now I hate basically everything except my relationship and my nana and pets and it's getting really hard to go on. I'm not suicidal but I don't know what to do. I'm losing my hair because of stress and genetics and it doesn't help that my boyfriend and my 2 rabbits and I live in my small childhood bedroom. I try to do things I like, like painting, playing games, building with Legos, watching movies but it seems nothing is helping. I am so anxious and depressed and I feel stuck. Any and all advice is welcomed. Please please please help. 

TL;DR!!!!!
Since April, my papa got diagnosed with cancer. He raised me, I lived with him and my family. My divorced parents got back together after 8 years of being divorced after a toxic relationship. One of my best friends told me I'm not doing enough and I should try harder with my life. My dad moved in with us and was buzzing around everyone preaching religion and crying and being crazy. My nana came out and told us my papa was cheating on her and she knew for 27 years. Had a meltdown. My papa died. I have never lost anyone. My counselor cancelled on me the week of his death and did not reschedule. I am cramped in a tiny bedroom with 2 rabbits and my bf. I try to relax and do things I enjoy and it doesn't help. Please any and all advice will help. Thank you.

116,"Long story short, I met this girl (I am also female, both early 20s) a few months ago. We got really close, hooked up a few times, were hanging out outside of sex, talking with each other a lot, all that. I admitted I had feelings for her and I thought she was cool with that because she didn't reject me and was still hanging out with me and agreeing to go on a couple dates with me (all while knowing I liked her more than just a fuck buddy).

When I became a little more forward (as in told her I was interested in dating) she did reject me and say she wasn't looking for a relationship. I told her that it was okay and that I wasn't sure what I wanted either, but if she still wanted to hook up together in the future no strings attached I'd be okay with that. She said awesome and that she would definitely keep that in mind.

I was understandably hurt and disappointed. I was also recovering from an ex at the time, so I think that's why the rejected hit me so hard when now I know what I want. But anyways, after she rejected me, we didn't communicate on social media/text for over a month. We work in the same building and she waved to me one day, but still there was 0 happening on the social media/texting front besides viewing each others stories. I thought she was just gonna wipe her hands of me.

Then a few days ago. She starts sending me pictures through my DMs on instagram. The very first instance of her reaching out is her sending me a picture of her outfit. Then I sent her a selfie through snapchat with a caption, and we went back and forth through that until she sent me a selfie with no caption so I didn't respond. A day went by with no pictures, then I sent her a picture with a caption the following day and we went back and forth a little again until I opened her last picture and didn't respond back. Following day she sends me a few videos of her outfits with captions, and I send her a couple selfies back and forth. Next day after that I send her a selfie of my outfit and she sends one back. A day passes (so yesterday this happened), and then I sent her a selfie with no caption and she just opened it and didn't respond. This is the first time she left me on read but I'm assuming it's because like what I've done to her, if there's no caption then I don't send anything back and not because she thinks I'm desperate.

Everything related to her outfits was about some inside jokes we have with each other.

I told my coworker a few of the captions we were sending to each other, and she thinks it's flirting, but I don't know if it really is, or if I just want to convince myself it is.

The timing of this is just super random. And I don't know if this is maybe her way of testing the waters of us possibly hooking up again, or what. It's just strange to me, because I'm sure she was wearing clothing that match up with our inside jokes the whole month we weren't talking, but somehow something made her think of me to send me that selfie out of the blue. As well as any other time this week when she reached out to snapchat me or DM me first.

I've decided I'm not looking for a relationship right now, and would be fine with the fwb situation if it happened. Does anyone have advice or has been in this situation before if this could be a positive sign of potentially hooking up again?",27Nov2019,1
117,"Hi everyone! 

Just a quick side note before I start, every time I post here I always get awesome advice and I really appreciate it. 

On to the story, I was an environmental science major before I transferred to the school I’m currently in and I really enjoyed the major. However, financial aid gave me just two years to graduate before they stop helping me with tuition. I was failing one of my chemistry courses which I didn’t even like in the first place so instead of having to repeat it again, I decided I need to switch my major to something that feels more me. I switched to a business major because I see myself more as a business woman than a scientist. I don’t mean to offend anyone, I think any profession is important and worthy of respect! Well, today I was speaking with my advisor and he had me meet another professor who is in another department related to business. He asked me why I decided to change majors and I told him that science wasn’t for me. He told me that just because a major isn’t all science and math that it’s easier. I don’t know if I said something that indicated I switched because I thought this was easier but that’s not the case at all. I’m at a point where I feel like if I’m only going to go to college once it should be for something I’m actually interested in so I don’t end up in a dead end job that I hate with a degree I don’t see myself with. 

I was planning on sending him an email saying this in a more professional way that doesn’t make them feel like I’m shitting on their careers or saying that they chose the easy way. I feel like every major has its challenges but whether you are really interested or not determines whether you’ll pass. I intend on finishing my education with a BSBA and I already know I’m going to enjoy it. 

Thanks guys, I love all of you!",27Nov2019,1
118,"So, I should start by saying I don’t use reddit, and I simply created this account just to ask the Internet for an unbiased opinion because I don’t know how to comprehend my own feelings. I might need therapy but let’s save that for a later date. Let’s just get in to it. I come from a basically shitty family. We have never been close and my parents put me through some pretty fucked up traumatic shit as a child. I’m personally ok and so far (I’m still in my 20‘s) I don’t think it’s has any real affect in my mental health (other than detachment issues which this story relates to). My significant other, of 3 years, on the other hand comes from a very close-knit family who do everything and anything together. Throughout our entire relationship we have done things with their family and it’s gotten to the point where I’m sort of left as an outsider. It took me a while to get comfortable around my s/o’s family due to my personal issues with my own family and I can tell this bothered them for a while even though we never openly addressed it. I guess I’m here to ask am I crazy for disliking his parents because my s/o cares about them more than they care about me? It’s always been hard being with someone who will ignore you for their family but as time goes on I’ve noticed that this has been turning in to anger any time I need to be around them. Let me also state that my s/o has blown me off multiple times due to spending time with their parents as well as inviting them almost every time we go out on any sort of date.

124,"So I (M) have this friend (F) that I met at the beginning of this semester in a class that we have together. (We're college students and we have about a week of classes left before finals). Two days ago when we were in class, she seemed off and passive aggressive towards me. It was very hard to make conversation with her during class as we usually are able to talk about anything. 

After class when we were walking together, she was just on her phone but eventually put it down but didn't say a word. When I had to go another direction, I said bye and she didn't say anything nor did she look at me (she just looked straightforward). Usually she would say bye back so this interaction was very odd to me. Towards the end of the day, she usually would text me but that didn't happen so we went a day without texting each other. Again, it's quite usually that we do this. Fast forward to today, she sent me a text and I answered it followed by a question but she has left me on read and it's been few hours now. (I thought about turning my read receipts on but don't know if I should).

How do I go about this? Should I confront her about this and ask what's going on, if I did anything, or something of this sort? It's been bugging me quite a bit.",27Nov2019,1
125,"I worked and lived abroad for 6 years, as a strong, independent woman.

I was mentally, physically and financially sound with all the motivation in the world. I loved, valued myself and was always trying to achieve goals.

After a series of unfortunate events, I decided to move back home to Detroit, which I regret more than any other decision I’ve ever made. I lost several thousand dollars and everything I own which prompted me to come back home.  I went from waitressing the grave yard shifts at Coney Islands in Detroit to being a rising star at a multi million dollar company. After leaving that job and my life in that city, my world has collapsed. I have no sense of identity, happiness and have started destroying myself in different ways. I feel like I’m back where I started and I keep failing and having huge financial problems. I just found out today I owe about 6k to an organization. 

I’ve lost everything. The only thing I have is job opportunities. No family, significant other, friends, barely any possessions.

I have lost my motivation and feel hopeless and trapped. I grew up in Detroit but simply being back here after all these years (with nothing besides a cool resume) is draining my soul and affecting my ability to work and function as a human. I can barely get out of bed in the morning and my work quality is at its lowest.

I’ve seen mental health professionals, but it’s not helping.

I don’t want to be homeless, but I don’t know how much longer I can live here.

I don’t have that much money, but I do have a job I can work from anywhere as long as I’m not let go.

What should I do?",27Nov2019,1
126,So last semester of freshman year i developed a rare autoimmune disease that put me out of school until the summer when i was given treatment.(it gives me extreme muscle and joint pain and very itchy red skin. Also i get sick really easily). After i was treated i started sophomore year at another school where they told me i would need to make up the credits from the 2nd half of fresman year. I thought this was ok and i would just take summer school. Well i got sick again and i stopped getting the emergency insurance i had since i wasnt covered. So i am constantly in and out of school because of my condition and the semester ends in december and half my classes are failing because i can never keep up with being gone half the time. Im not sure if i will pass this semester and i also need to make up credits from freshman year. I also am going to be flying to my dads in texas to get treatment there (since thats where i have insurence) so im not sure if i will make it back before the semester ends to take finals and make up tests ive missed.

131,"  Didn’t really know where to post this without being immediately shot down, but I’m trying here.

  First of all, I’m in a perfectly calm, logical state of mind, and this idea is not new to me. 
  I have a multitude of physical health problems that I have tried to treat with every method available for years, but this new collection of “symptoms” are what have driven me to this point. I could live with literally anything else but this. 9 months ago I developed eye symptoms that are so excruciating I could barely hold them open (knife pains repeatedly that could be abated by nothing) and typing this right know is very difficult. My vision also deteriorated to being legally blind. The current assumption that several of my plethora of healthcare providers have come to is that it is due to systemic involvement from some of my health conditions, but regardless, after trying everything in my power to relieve it, nothing worked. 
  I’m 17, but my ‘life’ right now is literally lying in bed everyday all day wishing the pain to go and the vision to return, or to die. Unfortunately my mother is very caring, and wants me to continue in hopes that these things will magically disappear. I don’t think she would be surprised if I did it, and like I said, this is not the typical, temporary problem that people tend to irrationally act upon; I’ve had over 9 months to think about it, and I’m ready. I’m in tortured agony constantly, and there’s nothing I can do about it. Rationality and logic have been tried. I want it to end, and I want peace. 
  I need it to work, though. My ideal way would be an exit bag, but I don’t have access to that. I know ODing and slitting arteries has a pretty low lethality. If someone could please give an effective method that is accessible. Thanks.
(If more details are needed to understand my situation so that I don’t get reported or deleted, I can give them.)

134,"Just for the saving of time im sure there's alot more serious cases to reply to than this,im just a teenager that is a bit lost i think

Im 16 and all i can think about now is how i still cant talk to people,for the most part only my close family and friends.it really bothers me that im near a crossroads and i am for the most part clueless.(this is going to be probably a long,jumbled post as thinking at 2am brings this out)
In primary school i used to be known and liked by everybody i was the best at drawing and i could run fast and i was friends with the popular people but now over the 4 years of secondary school i am looked to as the wierd kid.in the first year i stayed by my sister as i didn't make conversation but one day i gave someone i talked to in history a bag of nachos i bought and we played minecraft later after school they introduced me to so me others and i seemed to have a group to go to ,later on i made a friend in art who taunted me and i made conversation and even exchanged Skype names with her although i didn't last that long through me losing touch.

That year sticks with me as it was arguably the best one where i had the most people that didn't care who i was ,it was just fun.i fell out with nearly all my friends going to and from them as they didn't like each other and im still very good friends with nacho guy,we play Xbox everyday and it feels like they understand me the most.

In between these years everyone else didn't even talk to me as i guess i didn't to them,they are all the popular outgoing type and it feels stupid that they cast me and my friends aside because i cant talk and i don't talk ,i just just sit there drawing my samurai and my characters.im decent in school and everyone even says im one of the smartest which is good to hear but they still think im wierd.

Im in year 11 now and since me and nacho man fell out two years ago for over 8 months and now me and the other 2 (fatty and thinny) are part of his group which is his girlfriend,her friend and two others who i don't know that well.i talk to the others but only a little bit as i have nothing to connect to other than Xbox and drawing or youtube.i don't know what to do after i leave and im scared that i will lose touch with the people i want to be friends with,im not going to leave satisfied and it feels like I've wasted my life.

To further explain my problem its that i want to talk to people like the ones that make conversation with me,they close fast but its nice to feel that they don't think about my looks or confidence,its usually how my drawings are good or that i know them pretty well,when i want to talk its like i really want to but my mind goes blank and its like im stuck to do nothing i get nervous like shaky and i get a fast heart and before i can even say what i want its already to late and i feel hopeless that i couldn't even reply.its got far enough now that one person called me a school shooter and another just denied my help in science, it hurt that someone could think of me as a that when im just a guy who draws and minds there own business.

I think to wrap up my rant i want to say i need to get this fixed or my life will go downhill ,i.excel at talking to my close friends as im normally the person they rely on to talk to but everyone else feels impossible to have a talk to.

139,"Hello all! Mom is kicking me out and I’m getting an apartment with my brother by February 1st. My biggest issue is how I will be commuting to work. 

I’m 24 years old and my credit is terrible (502). I am currently making $19/hr (estimating $2300 profit per month with $1800 expenses per month). I’m not sure how much I will have leftover to spend each month. 

Should I get a cheap car and hope it lasts or a motorcycle even though I have no experience riding one or something else?

I live in Phoenix, AZ and commute 21 miles to work and 21 miles back. There is never traffic. I could ride a bicycle but not only would it take me 1.5 hours to get to work but then I would be exhausted for my physically demanding job (ripping apart airplanes) and then I’d have to bike back home the 1.5 hours.

140,"Over the past 2 years my best mate has been going through some heavy mental health issues and I’ve been there for him through all of it, was there on the phone when he was crying, I was there for him when he was breaking down at school, received texts saying he is done with this world, a suicide note, texts saying he tried to kill himself, all of it. 

And without even knowing it until now, it has been affecting me mentally hugely, ever since I got that suicide note it was hell trying to worry about whether he was alive or not because he kept saying these things. I went and saw the school counsellor and she told me that I need to stop trying to help him because I’m not his therapist, and he shouldn’t be depending on me to give him guidance. 

Don’t get me wrong I want to be there for him and I don’t want to lose him, but I just can’t stand him talking to me about all his problems anymore because it makes me feel so shit and I need to carry all that weight.

I need to tell him that I can’t do it anymore, I still will be there for him but I can’t be his therapist.

144,"Today, I received a phone call from my manager telling me he was about to send me an email and that he needed to review it with me. I looked up the email, and it arrived as soon as he finished the sentence. I looked at the subject horrified ""Improvement plan for ErrorCodeTaken"", never in 5 years working for the company have I been put in an action plan. For clarification in the company I work for, an action plan means you are 1 step for being fired. 

My manager begins to explain what the document is about and what steps I will need to take in order to stay in the company. I am not paying attention to him as I am reading as fast as I can whatever the document says. 

The document pretty much says that I am being placed into a plan of action for affecting best practices for communication and good environment in the team. It then goes on to say that I make comments such as ""what a loser"" to teammates or comments such as "" I hate seating next to you"". I must say I have never said ""I hate seating next to you"" to anyone it is completely false. About the ""what a loser"" part I don't recall ever saying something like that to anyone but I think it is likely I must have said it in a jokingly manner, clearly something taken out of context for the purpose of getting me fired. 

Then it goes to say I don't pay attention during meetings and that I play on my phone during every meeting, I don't ever use my cellphone during meetings as a matter of fact I barely use it when I am in the office). It then says I sit on the floor during meetings just to disrupt the attention from the group (this only happened ONE time and it was during a lunch/meeting in a conference room and I was sitting on the floor because there were no chairs left for me). 

The document goes on to say I have been plotting with my team mates to report my manager to HR and to affect a daily survey where we are asked about the managers performance. (this one is true though it shouldn't be something I could be penalized for since we should have the right to report him to HR, I wanted to affect the survey to get HR's attention so they would step in, since everyone is too scared to talk). My manager has made very inappropriate comments to peers and had also harassed other teammates with comments about their weight and how big someone's breasts are. I even remember one time he showed us a very racist image while he laughed his ass off. He later apologized for the image cause he was scared someone could report him to HR. So, I wanted to report him for those things. A teammate switched teams a month ago because she could no longer stand the guy. If you call him out for the things he does, he would tell you are wrong he is right and he is the boss (I know this from first hand experiences this is the actual reason he wants to get me fired).   


The last part of the reasons explaining why they are putting me in a plan of action says I do not participate in projects additional to our regular work (we are not required to take on any projects outside of our scope) it also says I complain because I am not given any projects (I have never complained about this, this part was clearly added to the document to give some validity to it).   


Now the last part of the document explains what I need to do in order to stay in the company, the goals set on the document are entirely unachievable, like one specific point says my manager will send a survey to the entire team so I get rated on ""Peer Satisfaction"" if I don't get a perfect score of 5 I get fired. How am I to convince 15 people to vote ""5"" it is ridiculous. Also we all work from home so we barely interact with each other, we only meet once a month in the office.   


Another goal is that my manager will pick a ""random"" person biweekly to give feedback about me. Again I think this is outrageous because of what I said --we never meet in person. And what guarantees this person is not someone who secretly hates me and wants me fired?   


The last goal is that I have to create an agenda for a 1 hour meeting and give the meeting during the entire hour. Now this would sound normal to most people. But I have social anxiety and have never been able to speak in front of large groups of people, I would have a panic attack and start crying like a baby for hours. My boss is aware of this, I have discussed it with him several times. So in my opinion he just put this goal as part of the thing to humiliate me in front of my teammates, it feels that way and it makes me really sad to think someone could be that evil.   


So I don't know what to do, I could try to go to HR an appeal the action plan, but mind you, the document was revised and approved by HR. Is my word against my manager pretty much. And we all know how that ends. And going to HR will only support what he is saying that I am ""problematic"".   


I could negotiate the goals, I tried to do it during the call but he would not agree to any changes, and I don't know if getting HR involved could help somehow. I could ask my therapist for my file to support my claim but that only fixes the ""having to do the meeting"" part.   


I cannot say I am being harassed because I don't have much proof to my claim. Other than the plan of action, that's the only proof I have, my teammates will not go to HR to defend me. Am I being harassed or is there something I am not seeing? am I really as problematic as he claims?  


 It makes so sad, I love this job, I love it with all my heart, it's the best job I have ever had, I don't want to lose it. Please help.

155,"Before I write anything, this is only my side of the events with whatever I gathered from her after she got back. I will talk to her in the morning once she has slept on it and sobered up.

Context: I am 18M and currently visiting my younger brother and mother outside of my country of residence. My parents got divorced when I was 6 and I moved out to live with my father when I was 12 ½. I haven't been very close with my family here and this is partly why I am visiting. I flew over around 4 ½ months ago and plan on going back with my brother for the Christmas holidays a few days before Christmas for a week then return him and once again fly back home.

Context on my mother: She has a stable job and living in a slightly above average lifestyle for the country. Me moving out took a toll on her mental health and she sometimes gets very lonely as well due to a lack of a companion.

She drinks irregularly, sometimes during weekends and a few times after weekdays but it hasn't been a problem as she has gotten to work fine the next morning. Since I have been here she has been drunk around 7-8 times that I know of, she usually goes out by foot to where I don't know and gets back around midnight. She had brought a guy back once and they spent the night together but nothing alarming. Another occasion she tried to take me to a local bar / club and didn't stop insisting until I was outside and down the street with her, only then could I convince her to go back and sleep.

The first time she went out all 3 of us were watching a movie and she went down to get snacks. She was drinking but not blackout drunk. After a while I notice she went out and call her about her whereabout since she didn't even bother telling us she went out. The phone call didn't amount to anything and my brother told me it's not that unusual for her to go out unannounced. I made sure she didn't take the car and didn't think much of it after that. I concluded that she is a grown woman and can act accordingly without telling her kid what she is doing so fair enough. I didn't really question the behaviour and the one time I did was after she tried to take me to a bar but she just shut me off so I didn't pursue.

Fast forward to today: She gets back home a little later than normal as she went shopping, nothing unusual. Both my brother and mom where having bad days, (he gets home before her as he walks or cycles to school). I catch a part of their conversation about some bag I saw ripped, didn't recognize it but didn't think much about it as I went on with my business. Later I find out my brother ripped a kids bag by the handle or something and my mom got confronted by that kids dad at her work (dad was the security guard at work) with no heads up from my brother who had called earlier. My mother later tells me it was an accident and my mom now has to repair the bag after work. That was the last conversation we had around 8pm before she went out.

I didn't notice her being drunk or drinking at the time. After the conversation I didn't see either of them as we all retired to our rooms to wind down for the day. Around 10:30 I went to grab a drink and check if my brother has gone to sleep and noticed the porch light on downstairs. My mom normally likes to leave it on if somebody is out since it is also linked to a light with a movement sensor facing the entrance to the driveway and the garage door. I go upstairs and check if she is in her room in case someone left it on by accident when getting something from the garage. She wasn't.

Now normally, or at least as far as I know she has never driven the car while drunk and always walked somewhere when she leaves the house like this so no alarms were raised and I didn't think much of it at first. Around midnight I was wondering where she was and since it was a weekday she normally would have been back before midnight as she has to get up for work.

She gets home around 1:30am and goes to her room so I just let her be and rest ( I recall some car in neutral outside and didn't think anything of it, maybe she got a taxi or someone drove her).
The car sound doesn't fade and becomes background noise for me. 5 minutes pass and I hear the dog getting agitated and someone parking a car, oddly as the reverse sound was in bursts not what I usually hear when either her or the neighbors park.
My heart skipped a beat and I went to check if she was in the house, her room light was on and I went to check on her but she wasn't there. I went downstairs and the front door was open, I head outside and there she was, in the garage sitting at the wheel reversing at an angle onto the tools on the side and bikes at the back. I watch and process what the heck I am witnessing... I make sure she isnt about to hit the gas forwards pinning me to the wall and is still reversing back before I approach her and attempted to make her stop. At this point I had no idea what happened all I saw was the airbag had gone off inside the car and there want any major damage I could see at this time of night on the front or the driver's side of the car but that might also be because I wasn't looking for damage.

I open the door and this was the following dialogue:

Me: What happened?
Her: I was in an accident.
Me: What?! Are you ok? Where?
Her: I was in an accident.
Me: Are you ok?
She then said something along the lines of:
My life is ruined, I ruined it, I wanted to end it and I just made it worse, I'm going to lose my job.
During this I was attempting to calm her.
Her: What did I hit?
Me: Nothing... Some tools and a ladder.
She gets out to look at the damage in the garage while I was putting things away that have fallen.

She then talked about the accident and this is what I could gather:
She was driving to somewhere down the street from our house (not sure if that's accurate as she always understates distances), she hit a wall, a wall of a family house and sat in the car afterwards contemplating her life, police came to question her and took blood samples from her arm and struggled on her right arm so they took it from the left. She then told me they took her car? Then something about losing her license probably to the police. At this point I was extremely confused and these questions were in my head: how did she drive back if they took the car from her?? Did she steal it back?? Why the hell did they let her drive back if that's not the case?

I took her inside the house and gave her some water to drink, during this she talked about being a shitty mother, her life not meaning anything anymore and ending it. I then took her upstairs to her room and made sure she was in bed before saying goodnight.

I stood outside her door for a good five minutes thinking about what she said, what the hell was going to happen, what the consequences she was going to have to face and what will happen to me and my brother if the consequences are permanent loss of license, prison etc.

At this point I really don't know what will happen to her or us, I have nobody else to talk to that has a neutral view on this subject and I really had to just get this off my chest before I either forgot some details or go crazy thinking about shit.

As a conclusion I would just like to say that worst case scenario is not all that bad for my brother, my father just upscaled his rental from a room to a house as he plans on cutting commute hours as well as a choice for my brother if he wanted to make it. As for my mother I have no clue, I need a lot more info on the events to come to any conclusions on the events that happened in the past 8 hours or so.

160,"I know the title doesn’t sound important or sounds like a 8 yr old problem of a friend moving away. My friend has shitty parents and lived in a “crooked house” for 20 years. They kicked him out again (happens from now and then) and now is thinking about (and probably will) leave city for a few days/weeks without telling anyone. Im the only one who knows. 

Pretty simple answer right? “Tell his parents” for what? Causing more problems and get him probably beaten up by his father? Also making him not trust me. Rather not to. 

I don’t know where he is going but i know is nearby. Like a neighbor city or something like that. Should i let him go and make him face the consequences of his actions? Try to stop him or do i tell a mutual friends to see how we figure this out?

162,"*All names have been changed*

This is my first job I started with I was 17 (almost 18) and I will be turning 20 in Feburary. I have ADHD, and mild Asperger's Syndrome (I'm on the very high functioning side.) I am currently going to college to be a veterinarian which has been my dream job ever since I was about eight. I am very energetic, outgoing, and talkative, and if need be I could easily find a job somewhere else.

A couple months before my 18th birthday I got my first job working part time at a deli (as a deli clerk) making $9/hr. About 6 months later I got bumped up to $9.25/hr, and on my year anniversary I got bumped up to $9.48/hr.

I like the job for the most part, most of my coworkers are friendly, nice, and are fun to be around. Ryan, my boss is very flexible with my college schedule, and is also very easy to talk to. I really like my job, and am always willing to help even if it means covering someone's shift, coming in early, or staying late. (I know from other people that I am the first person they ask) I don't mind staying to help, because it really sucks to work when you are short a person, and because it's not like I have anything better to do with my time. That being said, I don't know if I should stay. 


•It can be very toxic place to work because people talk shit behind each other's backs all the time. 


•Lexy always works in the mornings and is very nasty to the coworkers she doesn't like, and friendly to the people she likes, and the people she needs to please. She acts like she owns the place, snitches on people for the pettitiest things, and will often leave us with her work to do because she purposely takes her time so we will have to help her. She has been up to HR so many times for being rude to us, ignoring customers, and countless other things, yet nothing happens. 


•My night manager George (he is a manager, but a step below Ryan) really doesn't like me. It is quite obvious, but over time he has been nicer to me and I can tell he is trying. 


•I work with another employee Zach (17) who has mild Asperger's Syndrome (he is right about at my mark on the high functioning side), ADHD, absolutely no filter, and can be kind of difficult to work with. However I also work with his mom, Sabrina who is extremely kind and caring (think like a second mom), and I will not hesitate to let her know her kid is saying something bad or not cooperating. That being said if Zach isn't misbehaving (I think a lot of it is boredom) I don't mind working with him, and we do stuff outside of work. 


•I have been here for almost 2 years and I have still not made any progress in moving up, I still am stuck working on the counter. I have asked Ryan a few times about moving up from working on the counter to something else like production, food prep, hot island, but still nothing. Even as I was asking about learning to work the hot island we got another person working there and not me. One time we were having a huge hot island sale and I got to try it for three days. I absolutely loved it, and really made sure to let Ryan know how much I liked it but I was never put on it again. 


•Almost all of the other jobs around the area start out at $12/hr and I've almost been there for 2 years and I'm not even making $9.50/hr. 


On the other hand there are plenty of pros as well. 


•They are very flexible with my college schedule. 


•The whole store knows me and is very friendly, and everyone always says hi to me, even some of the regulars will stop by to say hi to me as well. 


•When I talked to Ryan about reducing the amount of time I work the Weekend Slicer (basically you stand in a very small separate area all day, cutting cooked chicken, turkey, and ham for customers) and how much I don't like it, he drastically reduced my hours on it. 


•We are very close, kinda like a family. If someone has to go to the hospital we all sign the card. If someone forgot their lunch we all pitch in. If you are sick you don't usually have to worry about getting a point (those are bad) because we will find someone will take your shift for you.

163,"So I have a group project due for my sociology class and each of my group members(including myself) has a role in the project. My group members asked me if i wanted to do a specific part, I agreed. My group agreed and all was good up until they decided among themselves that THEY would do the part they asked me to do and give me a part that was basically meaningless. No discussing with me, nothing. They said its because I needed to put it in my own words which I said I would but they still started on my part on their own. With the part i have now I feel like I'm not contributing much at all. And all of this kinda pisses me off, I feel disrespected in a way, like I'm a lesser that didn't even need to be consulted with, just take my part and give me another smaller role. This is my final for the classs and i want to feel like I'm contributing which i dont. I feel like I've been ursurped and my group is just taking it upon themselves to dictate what I do when they have no power to do so. This is ALL of our final.

Growing up, he always treated my friends as his own daughters. That was fine when I was close with them, but I have grown a part from a good majority of them over the years. 

He's kind of gotten a reputation for always commenting or replying to posts by these people I went to high school with. I'm kind of tired of seeing it. None of the people actually respond to his comments.

What prompted this post is that I saw one of my old friends posted a string of tweets about her trip to Canada, and he replied to every single one with a joke or a gif.

I knew someone when I was younger and we never got close. They actually didn't like me that much but then years later they went back on my radar and I fell in love with them but they weren't really paying attention to me. We hung around the same people but she wasnt interested. I really feel like she doesnt know me well enough to turn me down but you cant force people to want to try and get to know you and I sont know how to move past it. I've never gotten like this with someone before. The past two years a lot of things happened that werent my fault and I think it ruined her image of me. Every time I try to get over it something comes up and makes it hard again.

I made an online dating account to try and move on but I could only bring myself to put it up for friends. I turned down a couple of people this year and I don't know how to move on.

If i felt she knew me really well i would be fine with the rejection but she hasnt even tried to see me that way. I've been feeling bad about myself because of the way I feel about being rejected.  I feel like a creepy guy who cant let go of her conclusion and I hate it.  I've never gotten like this with anyone before (I'm a girl by the way). Its a circumstantial thing I think.  I've never actually spoken to her about why I feel the way I do. She heard about it through the grape vine but weve never actually talked one on one about how I feel. 
She thinks I dont know her well enough to love her ironically enough and it just invalidates my feelings. I know her really well and I don't understand how she doesn think so.

Another issue is the brand I have used in the past will still pass the smell through to the mattress if it sits too long. 

Is there a good protector I can put over my blankets, that will prevent the smell from leaking, and keep my blankets actually dry? Also affordable and durable since I would swap and wash them immediately.

So today I was driving some friends of mine to one of their houses because it was on my way to work. One of them is making stupid jokes and I’m laughing away at it and put on my turn signal and get over in the right lane in town. I hear a horn and realize that I wasn’t paying attention and cut the guy off behind me. I tell myself that was stupid and move on. Nothing more I can do. We get past this red light and the guy speeds up and gets in front of me at the next light. My friend in the passenger seat sees a YouTube play button sticker on his bumper and screams out the window, “Yo you a YouTuber!?” and the passenger of the guys car, his girlfriend, sticks her head out back at us and yells, “Shut up fata**!” We all just laugh it off as if that was the end of it until the guy opens his door and comes back to my car yelling, “DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MY GIRLFRIEND!?” and before I can say anything he reaches into my car and wraps his hand very tightly around my neck and holds it there for about 10 seconds while my friends are screaming at him. I don’t say anything to him after that and the others are yelling at him to leave me alone and such as he walks back to his car. We all sit in silence at this red light as recoup from it.

170,"I work in an engineering research group and the quality of work that I have been delivering has been very disappointing so far. This is partly because I feel incompetent as I am only recently graduating from my Bachelor's degree and I feel like I lack the expertise of my more experienced colleagues. My supervisor expects a lot more from me and understandably so, given the reputation of my program. But I'm not officially a graduate student of hers, just an employee. It is not my goal to do ground-breaking research at this time, I just want to be useful to the group, explore my interests and hone some essential technical skills to serve me for future graduate studies (which I know for sure I will pursue).  If I gave my research all my attention, I'm sure I can be more useful to the group, however, I've been focusing on developing personal hobbies and treating my medical issues (dental, mostly. Just extracted an infected tooth and got braces. Have more extractions coming up!). I've also been trying to cultivate a social life in this city that I moved to 4 years ago, but never fully integrated into the community to. I really feel the need for a community after developing an overdependence on my boyfriends/exes for my social needs.

I hate disappointing my colleagues, especially my supervisor who has been very supportive despite my complicated administrative issues. At the same time, I really don't want to dedicate all my mental energy to this research. Am I just being lazy and not rising up to the challenge by making the excuse of prioritizing my personal life? I absolutely need to prioritize this work (which will last for another 6-7 months) and find work after that to stabilize my career.

171,"I'm a 17-year-old in rural Nebraska. I went to the local school district from kindergarten to 11th grade. The first 3 years of high school sucked. I'm quirky and I think most people at school generally liked me, though I was constantly being bullied by some assholes I was simultaneously convincing myself were my friends. I hung out with them because I was afraid of being lonely, and they hung out with me because I was easy to pick on. That was mostly through 9th and 10th grade. Hanging out with them was anything but fun, and it took me until the end of 10th grade to realize that.

By 11th grade my phone was pretty much always empty, and I didn't have a social life. Most days left me feeling deprived and unsatisfied. Because of that the prospect of laying down and closing my eyes just didn't feel right, and I usually would end up browsing Reddit or watching YouTube until 3-5 AM before inevitably being at least 2 hours late to school the next day. I've never been addicted to doing those things, but it was the only thing I could do during the week that didn't make me feel exhausted and bored and lonely.

I was missing a shit ton of class and my grades were plummeting. My dad was always yelling at me for failing grades and missing school. I felt like I'd lost whatever fun part of me had made me likable before. Thanks to the pity of my teachers I only failed two semester classes. For most of the days in the last months of my junior year, I'd drive home from school holding back tears. That summer I decided, fuck it, I'd just do the last year online. I had no friends and nothing to look forward to at school.

I can't say I regret my decision. But I underestimated the impact spending so much of my time alone would have on me. I get sad watching porn. I watch movies and then feel envious, because the characters have close relationships with people who aren't their immediate relatives. I mean I never have had any, but until late it'd never hurt so much to think about.

If I could go out and meet people I would. My town doesn't have public places sprawling with teenagers looking to make friends. Last I checked there are no knitting clubs in my area. I have an online business that would be foolish to give up. Even if I went to work at the local Burger King, how am I supposed to assume all my problems will be solved?

My life is just uneventful and I don't know if or how I should even approach trying to make things better for myself. I think it's a temporary problem--I'm going to university in a major city far from here next year. The loneliness is becoming unbearable however, and I don't want to accept the light at the end of the tunnel that seems so distant and uncertain. Not only do I fear the pain of the next 9 months waiting to be okay, but I'm scared of the consequences that might follow. In my best state I feel like I should be a motivated, outgoing dude. But it's been so long since I've been that way, what if I can't go back? Or what if I come off as clingy and unlikeable once I finally do have a chance to make some friends?

I tried to write this from a realistic perspective but some of it is probably irrational thinking. I really want friends and I want to be satisfied now. But I understand that's probably unrealistic. Didn't proofread, and I probably also have some contextual holes to fill in here, but I've spent long enough writing this out for now. Let me know and I'll fill in.",27Nov2019,1
172,"So. My spouse’s father was diagnosed with cancer. It came out of nowhere and the outcome looks pretty grim. I admire my spouses ability to put on a brave face and push through work, day to day life and time with family - seemingly unaffected.

176,"When I was a kid, one of my relatives was inappropriate with me. I'd always felt uncomfortable around him, but when I was maybe 12-13, I realized that his behavior toward me was creepy and wrong. I mentioned it to a couple of family members, and we decided I would never, ever be left alone with him. Now that I'm an adult, it's pretty clear that he was grooming me for years. On the upside, it never got past some inappropriate touching. I don't know exactly what he had planned for me, he never got the opportunity to follow through on his plans. No one ever confronted him. We just made sure he couldn't carry out whatever goals he had on mind.

Except now he has grandkids. The oldest is around the age I was when I started to realize what was going on. I have zero evidence that he's done anything inappropriate with her, or that he's tried any of the grooming tactics he tried with me. I'm not related to him by blood, but she is and some family members seem to think he would never take advantage of his grandchildren. He overcame his addiction (only because he would have died if he didn't, but as far as we know, he hasn't touched alcohol in years). He even got nicer to his family.

I want to ask his oldest grandchild (his granddaughter) if he's ever made her feel uncomfortable. Or part of me does. Another part of me doesn't want to ruin it if he really is the good grandfather everyone seems to think he is. I don't want to mess with her childhood and I don't want to ruin a good thing, but I'm afraid that this good thing is a lie. I'm afraid he's hurting her and that she doesn't think she has anyone to turn to. I really don't know what to do- I think any action on my part has the potential to hurt her, her parents and her siblings. I don't think her mom knows how much of a monster this person is (though I super hope she knows that her father wasn't a good parent or husband). I don't know if he's still a threat. I don't know if alcoholism was the only reason he followed through on whatever urges he had. 

This is all coming up for me now because the holidays are looming and I have to make it through multiple family reunions. I decided not to confront anything during the festivities- I don't want any of these kids to remember Christmas as the time that grandfather's dirty secrets came out- but I'm going to see him face to face more than once. I can't help but feel like I might be failing a vulnerable kid. 

Should I ask his granddaughter if he's hurt her, even without any evidence that he did? Is it worth potentially tearing this family apart? His wife wouldn't divorce him. The whole family is deeply religious in a way that I think means they'll forgive him any transgressions. Should I remain silent unless I see or hear real evidence that he's still a threat to young girls? Do I open this can of worms? Is there a third option here? I'm obviously not impartial, and I'm really struggling to see what the right thing is in this situation.

182,"I work for a Grocery Outlet that just recently opened up. I've been working in various grocery stores my whole life.. It's all I've ever done. I'm pretty confident in my work and job that I do. I am fairly confident I would succeed as a manager. However, after hearing that the owners hired an outside manager with no experience made me ask if they see me as management material. 

I was told that due to different ""quarrels"", I was not management material. My boss brought up a story from over a month ago when we were all in our tiny break room together, and a man took a loud phone call in this small room. I asked him respectfully to please take it outside and he apologized and did so. IMMEDIATELY after this woman who rubbed me the wrong way since we started together took her phone out and called her bf. When I stared at her and said ""Really?"" She said ""I'm not gonna get off."" I said it was really rude and apparently someone else sitting in there mentioned it to the boss that it was ""really uncomfortable"" caused by me. When I tried to defend myself saying that everyone was taking their break and didn't want to listen to someone's personal phone call, my boss defended her saying she was on her break too. I know that they are personal friends so it frustrates me that she took her side.

I've been told in previous jobs that I come off aggressive, rude, etc. and I really don't understand it. I view myself as a very passive person. I never want any opposition at work and I try to talk to and treat everyone the way I want to be treated. I want to be a manager so badly and just train people to do the job the right way. I really feel confident as a trainer but **every single job** I've worked has pretty much held me back due to these reasons. The upside to me finally having this talk with my boss was that I asked if I could be in charge of the frozen department now that the original person just quit. My boss agreed and I am excited to finally show them what I am personally capable of instead of working in a department touched by 10 different hands.

Please help me be successful. Even if this job doesn't pay me more than $15/hr I would still really enjoy the title of a manager.

183,"So I’m a guy and I’ve always considered myself straight. I am very much aroused by women and their lady parts but I have never found men particularly attractive. However, I’ve always secretly wanted to suck my best friend’s dick. It’s taken me years to truly admit this to myself but I am turned on by penises, especially big ones. 😅

What’s strange to me though is that I don’t find guys attractive, just their bits and only insofar as I want to put them in my mouth. I have no interest in kissing or anal or even necessarily receiving.

184,"(TL;DR at end) Obligatory on mobile so I apologize for any formatting issues. So anyway, I'm 18F, and I just started college this August. My luck with relationships has pretty much always been terrible. From elementary school to high school, no one ever paid any attention to me. This led me to believe that I wasn't attractive at all, and my self esteem has remained pretty low since then. So you can probably imagine my shock as pretty much as soon as I started college, it felt like all eyes were on me. I've had so many people compliment me on my appearance, people seem to be drawn to me when it comes to the simplest things like asking for directions or just wanting to talk to someone even if I've never talked to them before. I've even had people give me their number when I barely even said a word to them, asked to take a picture of me to draw me, etc etc etc. Not a week seems to go by without me getting some kind of attention that I didn't particularly want. Sure, it's nice to know that maybe I'm not ugly like I used to think I was but I still just don't know how to take it when I don't even try to get attention; I don't do my hair beyond brushing it, I don't wear makeup, and I don't wear anything all that attractive either so I just don't know how to take all of this. I guess it doesn't help that I'm super awkward due to having Asperger's so social situations are not my forte. I guess what I'm asking is, how am I supposed to respond to all of this, and how can I get used to it?

The funny thing is, I crave for people's company but am shy to interact with them. Now, I'm not blaming my parents or anything. It's just that I have an aunt and an uncle who asked their child, who is my cousin to perform a storytelling or just say some random things in front of our relatives everytime there are family gathering or stuffs.

196,"(I am 13 by the way.)

Enter stage left: It's a Saturday morning and I ask what we're doing. ""Stuff"". Okay, maybe it's something exciting or a surprise!

We're going to the Y to work out and go swimming in a pool where old sweaty, hairy dudes swim. It's also that time of the month for me. Automatic no. I'm pissed, because I asked him to go to an arcade and he says if we have time. So I sat there, hormones full b*tch-mode. I looked like I wanted to reenact the Boston Massacre. And yes, I did hang out in the bathroom for the majority of the time. 
See part of this problem that I haven't mentioned is that, he didn't talk to me or my mother about signing me up. Don't get me wrong, it's okay to sign me up, but he gave no notice.

Scene two: At first I can't open a bottle, and my dad's girlfriend, whom I will name D, makes a 'joke', ""You can't open that? Maybe you should've hit the gym with us."" This hurt my feelings, because while she considered it a joke, she's belittled me and make similar 'jokes' beforehand. This just melted the Arctic ice caps.

I go and rant to my mother about it, not expecting her to say anything to dad about it, but nah, she roasts them like a Thanksgiving turkey. (Thank you mom; I love you so much!) Now D is crying because she thinks I don't like her, which is correct, I just don't admit it because I don't want to hurt her feelings. (Even though she's hurt mine on multiple occasions.) 

They say nothing about it to me, but are talking about it upstairs, thinking I can't hear them. 

End scene.

So we eat dinner at her parents' house, both sides act as if nothing happened. Then it's time for father-dearest to drive me home to my mom's. Half of the ride goes fine, until 45 minutes in, he starts blaming all of this on me, saying stuff like ""You made us have a big fight"" ""You made D cry."" ""This all circles back to you."" Antagonizing me until we arrive back to my mom's.

He doesn't go inside, because he knows my mother will be seething with rage originating from the depths of hell. I pretty much roll my eyes to myself and say my goodbyes at the door. Okay, love ya, bye. 

I finally figure out after years that he favours his new little family over his own biologically related child.

Fan-f**king-tastic.

I sob uncontrollably, my cousin and my grandmother are also furious at my dad. I miss a day of school because I have a meltdown in the school parking lot.

Alrighty, day two. That would be... You guessed it!: Today!

I decide that I would rather jump into a shark tank than spend my Thanksgiving with my dad, so I text him very politely. 

""hey dad, with what happened over the weekend,, i think im just gonna stay home for thanksgiving. know that i love you but my feelings are very much hurt.""

He then says that there are going to be consequences and that I can't take a joke. This goes on to him borderline harassing me, destroying my relationship with my aunt and grandma by bringing them into this and trying to get my grandma to call me.

(She's not dumb, she never called.)

After five times of me asking him to leave me alone, he finally backs off.

207,"Sorry for the long read ahead of you.

To try and paint a picture for you, I have been working at my current job for well over a year now as a closer, roughly eight hours a day, five days a week.  Our operating hours are from 4:30 am to 6pm, but the peak busy time is from 4:30 am until 12:00 pm. I work the closing shift, so my literal job is to come in, finish whatever is done, work on any orders that come in, deliver any orders that are placed, and clean up everything that was left for the day. Since we’re not very busy by noon, it’s usually only me, an associate, and the manager left at work. 

My workplace is pretty small, with only about twenty people. All five of my managers really like me, and praise the work I do. I was even promoted from an associate to my current job a few weeks ago. Everyone else at work seems to like me, except one person.

We will call her H. H has been working there a year longer than I. When I first started, she seemed to really like me and even trained me to do my job. I never had an issue and just did my work. After about 6 months, she started complaining and gossiping about me and the other associate I close with. H works in the morning, 6 hours a day. She has never been around when we close. She takes any opportunity she can to say we do nothing, that we just stand around, and even started spreading a rumor that my manager and I “had something going on” which, by the way, isn’t happening. 

Now I could understand if I did nothing why she would be upset, but it isn’t true. I come in and do everything asked of me by my managers and whatever else needs to be done. I’ve never had a complaint and my reviews are always 100%. 

I’ve brought up the issues with H to my managers, they say they’ll talk to her but nothing has happened. It’s been almost a full year now of this. I’m confused, a little hurt, and feel like my managers have failed me. I work my hardest every day, I cover others’ shifts on my days off, and I just feel like if I’m such a good worker, they would want to keep me at my job.

I feel like my mental health is being affected by this. I have been so anxious lately, all I can think about is work, and how she keeps talking about me to my coworkers. Yesterday I had a panic attack and I still don’t feel right 24 hours later.

To put an end to this, what else can I do?

TLDR; coworker keeps critiquing my job despite my hardest efforts, have not had the assistance I have been promised, feeling betrayed.",27Nov2019,1

Also nothing against people with autism- or any mental disorder, I don’t judge

Im a 15 year old girl &amp; ive lived with my mom &amp; dad forever. My mom has always been amazing &amp; awesome. my dad however, is not. &amp; has never been. from just the age of three my first memory of him is him getting enraged at me because i asked my mom for help instead of him- mind you i was THREE- &amp; he had a maniac meltdown, screaming &amp; beating his head into walls. hes always done this at least once or twice a week for my whole life. it wasnt untill i was 8 years old &amp; we moved out an hour away, he started having more &amp; more &amp; trying to commit suicide, telling my mom he hates her. i was literally 8 years old when he took a knife from the kitchen wood block &amp; tried to stab himself with it. in front of his 8 year old daughter. of course i have always hated him. he now, all the time, chokes himself with dog chains, tries to jump off our deck, anything he can do to hurt or kill himself, he will do in these episodes which can last for 2 days. 

he was diagnosed with aspergers syndrome a few years ago. &amp; all these were meltdowns. the doc perscribed him medicine to keep his meltdowns from happening often, but he refused to take them because he doesnt “want to be loved because of a pill” &amp; that of course set off another huge fit. to this day he wont take medicine. 

the way he yells &amp; screams at my mom &amp; threatens to hurt himself, it makes me think its abuse- emotional abuse to both me &amp; my mom. &amp; no matter how much i try to tell her that this living space isnt healthy for me, she wont listen to me. she says “its a perfectly acceptable excuse, he is autistic”

keep in mind he is high functioning autistic, so i dont really think theres an excuse for abuse. correct me if i am wrong, i apologize.

but the thing i hate him most for- the thing that makes me suicidal &amp; want to kill myself for is that he tells me i am just like him. from day one i have always been the favorite child &amp; hes open about it &amp; i dont know why. he likes me more than my brother &amp; i hate it. i hate my father so i dont know why im his favorite. somehow it gives him comfort to think that i am autistic &amp; im gonna grow up to be “just like daddy” &amp; the thought of it makes me want to die. i have anxiety &amp; i think i have depression, but not sure on that one yet. i went to a psychologist &amp; he told me there is no way i have autism. my dad said to that “thats just a psychologist- they dont tell you your diagnosis &amp; usually, autism is harder to diagnose in girls. who are you gonna believe, your dad or some scummy psychologist?” 

he really thinks im autistic. its always been a lifelong dream of mine to have kids. but if i grow up to be anything like him, thats not gonna happen. i cant put another child through this. ill kill myself if i ever turn out like him.

this fear of him thinking im like him has caused me to bottle up all my anger &amp; sadness, because i feel like if i let out an ounce of negative emotion, he’ll go on another rampage or he’ll tell me im having a meltdown. i dont know what to do &amp; i hate bottling everything inside. i dont have friends i can talk to, my dad pushed them all away. i just need someone to help me

I live in a pretty remote town where the nearest place to get to decent work is a good 32 minutes away and I actually have to make that drive to get to the very call center I’m currently working at. I want to hand in my notice this Saturday. But I feel stuck in making the decision, I don’t have another job lined up at the moment, but this call center job is so stressful I’ve had to request support from HR for their mental health benefits. I’ve struggled with depression before and this job has brought me back to my lowest point, between getting yelled at constantly, the long hours, and the common occurrence of watching someone lose everything due to one mistake. The job has mentally exhausted me and every day I need to go on I honestly hope I don’t wake up or can’t make it to work because I’d anything. Even a car accident I’d accept at this point. I feel pathetic because the job isn’t particularly hard, it’s just exhausting and it’s wearing me down. Causing me to become more jaded and cynical. What should I do?

217,"So my GF was hanging around with a friend the other day and he got a bit too drunk and when she was in the bathroom, he busted it and tried to fuck her. It only touched her but it didn’t go inside and she had to push him away and control him. She’s had a late period and today she finally got it after 6 days but this all happened 2 days ago. She’s worried if she’s gonna be pregnant or not cause he didn’t even cum but there could’ve been some on the dick or not but we don’t know if she’s gonna be pregnant. He said sorry later but now we’re pissed off at him and he’s not even taking responsibility. Anyways when should she take a pregnancy test so we can know? I’m concerned for her because she has a lot of stress from school and work and I don’t want it to build up from having this baby. She says she has friends who can help take care of it since she can’t so that part shouldn’t be a problem and she doesn’t like abortion.",27Nov2019,1

I am currently finishing up my university degree (technically enrolled full-time), so I could explain a job gap as wanting to focus on my studies, since I quit at the start of my exam period. Or I could just say I wanted a holiday. I have a reference from the job I quit, who would be willing to back up any bullshit claim I make on that front - I left my previous job on really good terms.

225,"So I matched with this guy on okcupid last Wednesday and we've been talking on discord for a while. On the day that I met him we talked for almost 2 hours before I had to go to bed. Then the next day we talked some more and I subtlely asked him what he was doing for the weekend. Then he asked me and I said I was going to the shopping center to chill. So hes like ""ok cool do you want to meet? I understand if it's too early in chatting."" But i just said that yeah I'd like to meet up. So we set the day for saturday at a pizza place. 

Fast forward to Saturday and I take the campus shuttle to the shopping center (pizza place is close to there) and I walk to the pizza place. 

I'm messaging him during this and he says that hes inside so I message that I'm walking inside and I finally see him and we both say hey. Then we walk up to the counter and he asks me if I wanted him to pay amd I say I'm not sure. I dont mind either way so he offers to pay. We put our order in and sit down at a booth.

Him and I talk for a bit about pokemon, anime, college (I'm in college not him) etc and eat pizza at the same time. I start to get comfortable taking to him and I cant help but smile the whole time (not in a creepy way). But that goes one for a bit and it comes time for me to leave to catch the shuttle. He offers me a ride so I dont have to walk.

Once we make it back to where the shuttle is he says that he had fun and I say I had fun too. I thank him for the ride and get back to the shuttle while my heart is exploding from the happiness of my first date. 

A bit later I test him if he would want to do that again sometime and he said that he wouldnt mind. Since that day I've been thinking about him a lot.

He's pretty attractive and funny and smart and quite kind. The whole time he was polite and seemed genuinely interested in what I was saying. I'd love to see him again and maybe watch a movie next time but I'm not sure how to initiate it. 

I dont know if it's too early to meet again. (I'm currently on break at home and dont come back till sunday and so far I know he doesnt have work on Saturdays). 

Then theres also the issue of if we did watch a movie then would I go to his house? Would he come to my dorm room? Would we got the movie theater? I just want to see him again. 

Ps. I wonder if he's interested in me",27Nov2019,1
226,"I won't make this too long, but I need to vent this out somewhere anonymously.  I've had a VERY close friend for almost a decade now.  This is someone I would consider a best friend and someone I've confided in, and this person has confided in me.  
This person, we'll use an androgynous name, Avery, has gone to grad school and has been in very real financial difficulties here and there over their life since.  I know they've received aid from family friends, direct family, and friends in the past.  I've also helped out with small loans every once in a while to alleviate student debt, etc.  Up until about March of this year, those debts to me were ALWAYS paid back, in reasonably quick time-frames (we're talking weeks).  
This year, 2019 has been a particular hard year for Avery, with a lack of advancement at work coupled with INTENSE personal events which I won't disclose out of respect.  Essentially, Avery was in a really bad mental state, and with some financial burden, was coming apart at the seams.  
I am a young professional who recently got a promotion and have a decent savings built up.  I fucking hate that Money is an issue for loved ones, and I'm more than happy to forego some cash to immediately help a friend out of a tough situation.  Since Avery has always been so good at paying back, I had no problem with providing larger sums to help with debts and do my part to get this person out of the dark hole they were in.  I even went so far as to tell Avery that a portion of that money is officially a gift, not requiring any repayment.  
What i received in turn was an outpouring of love and recognition that the gesture was too kind, and would absolutely be repaid at first availability.  To not provide too much unnecessary detail and backstory, essentially fast-forward another 5 months and I'm in over $1,500 with no repayment in sight.  
Finding it really odd that no attempt at payment had come my way in that time-span, but knowing the fragile state Avery is in, I have yet to bluntly ask.  What I did do is contact a common friend to express concern.  What I got from that conversation was more than I could have imagined.  
It turns out that since some hard times early in the year, Avery had developed a gambling addiction, and it only makes sense given the timeline and asks for larger sums...  I was flattened, I mean absolutely fucking floored to learn this.  
I have gone through an entire range of emotions since learning this, and the biggest thing I'm settling on is honestly Anger, and I hate that.  It saddens me to know the personal struggles my friend went through, and it saddens me further to know they resorted to an addiction to cope, but it saddens me 1000x more than any of that to know I've been used and lied to throughout this time, when I would be JUST AS SUPPORTIVE IF NOT MORE if I'd known the truth.  
I don't know what to do, how to approach this person, or how to help.  The money is NOT the crux of the issue, I could see nothing of it and it would all be worth it if Avery would be able to heal from this.  Internally in my fragile mind now, my relationship with this person is a giant question mark, and that might be what makes me the saddest of all.

228,"I am in college and had a class with a girl my age. She laughed the hardest at stuff I say, smiles a lot at me and to stuff I say. She said hi when she saw me ask what's up. We had to do peer reviews and she came to my table sat next to me at my table. She sat between me and a woman Im friends with, talked to her she said something, smiled at me and looked deep into my eyes and didn't stop smiling and it felt awkward, if I didn't break the eye contact she probably would've continued. She was making forced eye contact and scratching her head while resting her head on her hand. One day I sat down waiting for class and sat with a woman I give a lot of attention to in class and she came in for class walked over and started waiting very close to me, hovering over standing in my personal space, she walked right in front of me and started getting close to me and I could smell her but she had her back to me. This was the closest she's been to me. There was a whole room not a lot of other people. When I talked about another girl that likes me that I don't like and asking for advice from a woman I talk to in college to not lead her on. She joined the conversation said that the other girl will continue pushing and I have to ignore all together and tell her I'm not interested. This was the biggest response I got from her and longest convrsation. She started this stuff after I asked for advice, . I told her someone said my hair looks like the clown from it and she said that's not nice. I saw her in the hall one day we stopped seeing each other in class. She saw me and stopped and asked me how my classes were this semester and she had the biggest smile on her face. I ask her stuff and it's like she has a hard time with conversation but has the biggest smile on her face talking to me. I said my advisor would kick me out bc he knows I smoke pot and she says ""awww"" I do get an awkward forced vibe from her. I asked her how her classes were and it went over her head. I crossed paths walking on a small walkway and she didn't look me in the eye was looking down and said hey very softly, unassertively. Most recently we had to go to a lecture in the biggest lecture hall on my campus. I was sitting in a spot in the front and in the middle and she came in saw me and she came in and sat 2 empty seats away from me. 


Soon I would like to go up to her and ask for her number bc I know where she has a class. Just tell her I miss seeing her in class and would like to talk to her more",27Nov2019,1
229,"I don’t know what’s been going on recently, but I’m going to try and explain it the best I can here. I’ve seen others discuss repressed memories on here so I thought I might as well.

Basically there’s about a two year gap in my childhood when I was 6-8. I remember bits and pieces about it but I forgot an entire person (my mom’s ex ex ex boyfriend) until about two years ago. He started coming around again and I just....get this really terrible feeling in my stomach every single time I see him. That intuition feeling if you get what I mean. My anxiety goes absolutely overboard and I start shaking until he leaves.

I don’t know what it is about him, but there’s something that really affects me and I just can’t remember what it is. I don’t know if it’s a repressed memory, or just me being stupid, or me thinking something happened that didn’t, but even just thinking about his name gives me that same feeling. I’m not very friendly around him and that’s not something I do with anyone. 

Do you guys have any idea what this could mean? I know this isn’t a lot to go off of, and I know you guys aren’t professionals, but I guess I just need a starting place. Or if anyone has had a similar experience, please tell me about it. Thank you so much",27Nov2019,1
230,"I am not someone who makes friends easily. At 22, almost 23 years old, the only friend I hang out with semi-regularly is my cousin. I started a new job a few months ago and became friendly with one of my coworkers. We quickly became each other's favorite person at work and started making plans to hang out when off the clock. However, so far ever plans we've made she's canceled on me, even a trip I made reservations for that we were looking forward to for almost a month. I've admitted to my cousin, who I regularly turn to for advice, that I've developed semi-romantic feelings for my friend, but that I'm choosing not to act on them for several reasons, the main reason being that I tend to become infatuated easily with women who show me kindness or act friendly for me, even though I know this is a bad habit. I want for us to move forward as just friends, which she seems open to, but doesn't seem committed to. 

She told me that she went on the trip we planned with another coworker who we both met a month or so ago this past weekend, and I figured out the reason she canceled on me for our trip a few weeks ago was because she was feeling hungover from hanging out with the same coworker the night before. What she told me also indicates she might be hooking up with him, at least in a casual way. The guy is really nice and I actually like working with him, but I've been feeling extremely jealous when I know I shouldn't be. She doesn't owe me anything and who she spends her time with or what she does with other people is none of my business. Yet I still feel hurt because any plans I do make with friends always end up being canceled, and it hurts most of all with her because she has told me time and time again how much she values me as a friend. 

I want to tell her I want to hang out more and have her actually stick to our plans, but I'm afraid any way I say it will ruin our friendship. Either by sounding like I'm in love with her and want to get together, or by coming off like she's a bad friend who should be hanging out with me more than other people.  I don't want to be possessive or controlling, and I don't want to cut ties with her because she's one of my only friends at the moment. I'm even more worried about losing her as a friend because she quit recently due to disagreeing with our boss about another employee. With us not having a reason to talk and be around each other on a regular basis, I'm afraid I'll come off as clingy and annoying, which will cause her to stop talking to me. 

TL;DR I have a friend who constantly breaks plans with me but is hanging out with other people that we've both known for less time, and I'm feeling jealous even though I know I shouldn't and I don't know how to address how I feel.",27Nov2019,1

234,"I did this program with this girl two years ago and aside from a few conversations we didn't really interact much so I don't consider her a friend. After we finished the program, she messaged me on Facebook asking if she could borrow $20 to buy books for her new course in uni. I was in no position to help her because I had no job, I was a 17 year old about to go into uni myself and I only had about $150 in the bank and I still had to buy my own books too so I said no. 

We didn't talk again until this June when she messaged me again asking to borrow $20. By now I had found a job and I felt guilty about not being able to help her back then so I lent her the money. She told me she would pay me back by the end of the month when she got her paycheck. 

Halfway through the month of July I had to pay bills and that was when I realized she never paid me back. I messaged her again and she apologized, saying she accidentally misspelled my email and that she will send the etransfer by the end of the week.

It's November now, and I found out she's been doing this multiple time, borrowing even up to $100 from other people. I confronted her and she told me she was going to pay me back on Friday and that I shouldn't start shit. I highly doubt she's gonna pay me back but I want to do something so she can't trick anyone like this anymore.

But he doesn't seem to want any of my or my siblings help.

He looks terrible. Hes in his late 50's, but walks and talks like hes in his late 90's, he struggles making full sentences, he only has one kidney now since the other was removed due to his alcoholism, and im pretty sure he still drinks...

The other day when I was over at my parents place I saw him take a basket of laundry upstairs, but he could only do it by putting the basket on each step and using it as a cane to push himself up... that almost killed me to see that (I had to help him with it obviously). When he does talk it sounds like he giving every bit of energy he has to say the most basic things, it absolutely kills me. I can't stand being around him and I'm not sure what to do. 

I love my dad but he is so depressed and unwilling to do anything about it, my mom is more or less like that; she has contributed to it I think in some ways by being not understanding and just expecting him to ""get it togetber"". She hasn't worded in over 10 years. She'll tell you its because of her chronic pain, but really it was just a minor injury she had that she ended up dealing with with extremely potent pain medication and became hooked on it. 

My parents have become completely ruined by alcohol and pain medication addiction, and the person I would turn to to help me deal with these heavy problems is now out of my life and I'm now having to deal with them alone.

241,"I’m 23F and I really feel like I’m going nowhere. I got my degree in business administration last year and it hasn’t really helped me at all. I went to several job interviews and it was only rejection after rejection. The only job offer I got was working at a movie theater, so of course I took it because at least I’d be getting a paycheck. I was able to move up and in under a year I was promoted to management. At the time of my big promotion I was pretty happy with myself, however now I just want a normal 9-5 job. Late nights, missed holidays and ever changing work schedules are getting the best of me. Dealing with guests who don’t get their way and tell you to “have fun at your dead end job” are making me hate myself and the potential I didn’t live up to. I can also see the disappointment with my family when I hear them talking about my job “yeah she’s still at the theater.... hopefully something else will come up soon”.  I know they don’t mean to sound critical but I don’t think they realize how difficult it was for me to even get that promotion much less finding a “real job”.  
I was always really hardworking in school, but it never came easy to me. I think by the time I got to college I was burnt out and only cared about getting out of there and not about planning for future careers. Now that I’m so unhappy with how things have turned out, I’ve started studying for the actuary exams on my own time. However, I’ve been looking at articles online and unless I go back to school and pursue a more math related degree, it looks like that wouldn’t be any more help. I would like to go back to school but I don’t have the money for it.

With the part i have now I feel like I'm not contributing much at all.

246,"Hey guys. 

Ok, so this is a new thing for me. i've struggled with fear of failure most of my life and was recently diagnosed with ADHD, which explained a lot of it. that was a different kind of fear. 

recently i got into an amazing relationship. i legitimately love this man, and i can't wait to spend my life with him. we're both very serious and want to get married as soon as we can without looking crazy to our friends and family. there's one problem, though. we live across the country from each other. i've seen him IRL a combined total of 17 days, give or take. and i don't get to see him again until January. I think that's where this fear is coming from. 

Since my most recent visit to see him, i've been freaked out about death and dying. i don't want to ride in the car with friends who are usually more reckless, i'm scared of any sign of illness, even stuff that i know is just a cold symptom freaks me out. i'm so terrified of dying before i get to do certain things in my life - getting married is the obvious big one, but i also don't want to leave my friends and family behind. i know this is a big one, and i know it's pretty irrational, but i don't know how to calm down. 

i tried stimming (which usually helped me calm down in college, and is a big help with my ADHD-based anxieties), tried to rationalize, tried to talk to my bf but none of those really helped me, this has been going on for a few weeks and i really don't want it to be constant until january. 

any advice on how to manage this fear would be really nice.",27Nov2019,1
247,"Hey everyone -

My life’s been a whirlwind and I need advice. (Disclaimer, I am seeing a therapist).

In a nutshell, this year has been the hardest year of my life. And the only good thing that’s come out of this year is a girl I met in January.

We hit it off immediately despite our differences in interests and things in common (I’m very artistic and emotional, she’s more analytical, not very artistic, and less emotional). We dated for nine months until I broke things off because of my mental health.

Since then, we’ve had an off-again, on-again relationship.

The first time we broke up, my mental health deteriorating day by day and I felt like I’d fallen out of love with her.

I didn’t experience the butterflies around her and started dreading seeing her.

I started getting annoyed by small things about her, I started wishing I was somewhere else then being with her, I didn’t want to cuddle with her, and I started thinking about what it would be like to date someone else. It bothered me that she wasn’t as emotional or artistic as me and I constantly kept worrying about what if the “grass is greener” on the other side and if I could find someone better and more like me.

Looking back on how I was feeling back then, I feel terrible because everything I felt was shallow and I feel like a terrible person for feeling that way. In a lot of ways, I don’t recognize that person who broke up with her because of how bad my mental health was at the time.

Several weeks after breaking up with her, my mental health quickly became worse and I began to realize how unhappy I was without her.

When I say that she is my biggest cheerleader, I mean it. I have never experienced unconditional love or unconditional support from anyone the way she does and it honestly leaves me speechless.

Her constant love and support throughout our relationship really helped keep my mental health from teetering over the edge and really helped me work through my self-esteem despite still having issues.

And so, without her support after we broke up, it wasn’t until I was left alone to deal with that on my own that I realized how important of a person I lost.

Her kindness and patience is unlike anything I’ve experienced in a relationship before and I didn’t realize that until it was over.

After several weeks went by without her, I found myself feeling completely lost.

One of the biggest reasons I broke up with her aside from falling out of love with her was because I believed I needed to be independent for once, apart from someone and from a relationship so I could find myself again and define myself without someone around.

I felt I needed to learn what it means to be “myself” after all of the trauma I went through following 2018 and now 2019 and needed experiences in order to do that.

I wanted to try dating new people, try going out and doing new things by myself, but I just find myself wanting to go back to her and I don’t know if that’s just me trying to run away from the uncomfortable or me really, truly missing her.

She’s an incredible person, through and through. She isn’t necessarily attractive, but she has a beautiful soul and is an incredibly kind person despite being extremely different from me.

I mean it when I say that it’s rare to find someone as compassionate, kind, and patient as she is.

She's told me time and time again that she'll be my rock through my ups and downs with my mental health, my eating disorder, etc.

I don’t know if maybe my expectations for relationships are too high or if I have this weird concept that love is this beautiful, messy high that never runs off and someone that you feel gets you as a person emotionally in every way, but, I don’t know what to do and I don’t know if that’s just some fantasy in movies and tv.

I don’t know and I don’t even know if I can trust myself with what I’m feeling about the situation because I don’t know if I can trust my feelings anymore.

I feel like I’m at a major roadblock at the moment because I either have two choices. I either be independent, be my own person, live my own life and move on without her and try to work through my mental health issues on my own and find someone more like me.

Or, I get back together with her, have her support, love, and kindness, and work on my personal issues and expectations on relationships and try to find/fall back in love with her despite our emotional/logical differences.

Has anyone dealt with this before? Do you have any advice from your personal experiences?

(Also, I apologize if any of this didn’t come out right, I’m still really struggling making complete thoughts/sentences since I’m in recovery from my eating disorder).",27Nov2019,1

Basically, my mom at age 56 had a heart attack which led to a buildup of fluid on her lungs, causing her to be unable to breathe which resulted in her entering the intensive care unit.

267,"(this is in CA, USA)

Our neighbor has a chimney which sits on the edge of the two properties (one of two chimneys; this one is a later addition to their home, and is about 15ft from our windows; the main chimney sits towards the center of their home, and we probably wouldn't have any issues with them operating that one), and during the winter months is constantly ( from around 9am-10pm ) billowing smoke towards and around our home. 

&amp;#x200B;

We've tried talking to them, only to more or less be told to go away. We've purchased a logging air quality meter for the exterior of our home (right next to our windows, for PM2.5 and PM10) and on days where the average AQI for the surrounding areas 8, the average for our home over the period of a full day is 150 with peaks of 700+. Based on the smoke coming out of the chimney, I believe that they don't have optimal combustion (either due to poorly/improperly selected wood, or a suboptimal configuration of their fireplace) and consequently put out a lot more smoke than a properly operated fireplace would. 

&amp;#x200B;

We've considered the community angle (as I know that we're not the only home this affects, we're just the closest victim), or looping the city in, but broadly we're wondering what our options are or how this issue could be addressed... we don't want to necessarily ruin relations with this neighbor (though they don't seem to be particularly good at this point, especially considering the severity of this issue for us), but would be open to law-related options as well.",27Nov2019,1
268,"Hi all, thanks for reading. I’m sorry for any mistakes, I’m writing this really fast because I’m freaking out.

Basically, my best friend Kelly is having a depressive episode. I noticed this last week when she didn’t show up to our workplace. (We work together.) She stayed home all week, just sleeping. In effort to get her out of bed, our mutual friend Amy went to go get her.  We’ve done this before when Kelly goes through these. I am always tagging along. This time I couldn’t.

So when Amy goes to Kelly’s house on Friday, they decide to go camping spontaneously for the weekend. I can’t join due to family plans. 

I don’t hear from them until Monday. I call them and they answer. We have a one minute conversation because they tell me they are still camping and I’m upset because 1) they haven’t been giving anyone updates and 2) Kelly decided to not show up not work again.

And that’s that. Kelly lives with her grandparents and they had no idea she left for camping. They’ve been calling me non stop to know if I know anything because she doesn’t have a phone. I just kept telling them that she’s camping and I’m sure she’s fine.

But then a few hours ago, Amy’s family reached out. She’s also not answering. I thought they weren’t talking to me because I felt that they were being irresponsible. But turns out, NO ONE HAS HEARD FROM THEM. 

I am really nervous right now. The campsite has signal so why aren’t they answering? Amy’s phone officially turned off about an hour ago. I had been calling her nonstop and now it’s just straight to voicemails.

I don’t know what to do. How serious is this? Am I overreacting? I try to calm myself by saying that they might just be trying to “escape reality” because they both have their mental health struggles so they are just ignoring everyone and having a chill time.

But at the same time, I swear my friends are not this stupid. They would say something to SOMEONE. And for their phone to die when they have their chargers and car? I don’t understand. Something is way off.

I don’t know how serious to take this. Her grandma has been waiting for an update. I haven’t told her that Amy’s family hasn’t had contact from Amy because I don’t want her to flip out. She’s already so old and sick. But maybe I should?

Then today I planned to tell her this morning when she gets to school but we had a two hr delay and I didn’t see her. Because of the two hr delay We didn’t have this class called advisory where I would usually see her so my last chance was after lunch. So after lunch I found her and confronted her. But because she had class at the other side of school and passing periods were shorter because of the delay when I tried talking to her she didn’t have time. I confronted her and asked if she had time to talk but she said she had to go to class so I said I understand and have a great thanksgiving and she replied with you as while and walked away.

My sister and him have been separated for almost about year and they have been trying to share time with my niece. This man will say he is picking her up for the weekend and after my sister has driven 30 miles to the meet up point he will make her wait for 3 hours while he does god knows what. He came down to my sister's house a few days ago and he was in one of his more reasonable moods so they had a good time and my niece got to spend time with both here parents. Long story short they got into an argument because he wanted to take my niece to his piece of land and camp over night. She is three years old and it is below freezing... obviously my sister said she didn't feel comfortable with that and he started yelling and threatening to call the cops cussing up a storm all in front of my niece and two other little kids. My sister told him to go for a walk and calm down because he was frightening the kids but he kept getting worse and worse until finely she locked him out of the house. Naturally the kids were pretty scared. they finely came to a compromise that he could take her for the day but not overnight. After I heard about this incident I decided to have a talk with him to tell him he can't be doing this in front of the kids (Bare in mind I wasn't threatening him or trying to start a fight I just needed to let him know it wasn't cool) he ended up screaming and yelling every type of foul language you can imagine telling me and my father that he would beat the shit ""ill fuck you up bitch"" etc. Bare in mind this was in the street at night in a neighborhood. 

So I'm not afraid of him because he is a pretty scrawny guy and a coward at heart but my question is where do I go from here? It might get physical and all though I'm prepared for that I don't want it to happen in front of the kiddies especially my niece.",27Nov2019,1
286,"I’m posting from a throwaway account.  I’m in my twenties and I’m so close with my mom but I resent my dad. He cheats on my mom and is constantly lying to her even though we know he’s lying. 

They are still married- it’s been 30 years— my mom doesn’t want a divorce because she says it only brings negatives into her life. We are immigrants and it would be so difficult and lonely if my mom really was alone. The normal family dynamic in our culture is just most tight knit than American culture— no privacy and we share everything and have all our money piled together— stuff like that.

My dad is a good dad but the worst husband. When it comes to going the extra mile doing dad stuff like taking me two and from work everyday before I got a car and sitting in traffic for two hour, he doesn’t complain. On the flip side I’m constantly finding clues of him lying and being unfaithful and it just pisses me off and all his good deeds get washed away. At this point my mom just sees him as a the guy who makes money and can do housework. Honestly I’m fine with that dynamic but this lying to my face pisses me off and I just don’t know how to get over it. My dad doesn’t care— in fact when I call him out he gets defensive and gets mad at me for not letting him have a private life (I do try to catch him lying and I look through his phone all the time.

I’m just so angry. It effects my everyday mood. I feel like I’m on the verge of a panic attack constantly and all this anger is just bubbling up and I hate it. Of course if it could change and suddenly he gets his morals back I would be happy but I know that won’t happen. I just don’t know what to do, I feel so bad for my mom— I moved close to home after college because I don’t want her to feel alone and I wanted to see if my presence would make the relationship better and it has they talk and laugh more but then he tell one lie and it’s back to me and my mom hating him for a while. I know I will move away in the future and I’m scared for her. I fear she will be lonely or sad and then I just get anxious and mad at my mom for causing all this. I’ve spoken to my mom and she told me not to worry about her and all that but I just can’t help it. 

How do I just accept this is my life and let go of this weight? Is it even possible? 

Tldr; my dad would be the best dad in the world except for the fact he lies and cheats. We gave up the idea of him changing, but I’m angry at him for lying and also constantly hurting my mom. Divorce isn’t an option— he will stick around I don’t know how to let go of anger towards him.",27Nov2019,1

**Is this behavior normal?**
My brother is married and has been for two years now. Him and his wife were in a tough situation a year ago and had to move in with my family and me. They slept inside of my room since there wasn’t a room in the house for them to sleep in but one and that was all the way downstairs. There wasn’t an issue with the room but the heat and no furniture. Well his wife convinced my brother that the room was “haunted” and they continued sleeping in my room, within my space. She then began eating 
my food, and my sisters food that my mom bought specifically for us, as every mother does. She then began taking my phone and putting it between her breast, bra and t-shirt while my brother laughed. She acted as if she was my mother. She didn’t want to work and purposely started arguments to my brother to get him to quit his job and leave the state (i wanted her gone at that time), she blamed her behavior on her “depression” (she was extremely disrespectful and depression was not an excuse).

There is a lot more sh*t she did to me and my family, but this post is already really long.

297,"Teenager here. 

My (a few tears short of being a boomer) mom has been unemployed for half a decade. I have a summer job and have saved a considerable amount for my future, however every year my mom has manipulated me into helping her take large amounts (triple digits) of money out of my bank account as “loans” which she almost never repays. Recently I have brought up my frustration about this to her and this has made her angry at me. 

Last summer I found some suspicious texts on her phone which heavily implied she was meeting someone for sex in a different city and cheating on my father (recently my mom leaves us for 4-6 days at a time to go to “interviews” in a city in a different state. She does not tell us ahead of time when she is doing this). I informed my older brother of this and he immediately told my mom and didn’t take it seriously. A week later my town was hit by a storm and the town was without electricity. My mother then told me “I have friends who say they would’ve killed you”, this was completely serious and not a joke. She then wouldn’t allow me to use the family’s emergency charger to charge my phone. Likely due to the fear that I would call the police over that statement.

Now for our main story. My brother has left candy wrappers and food in a room that we know is vulnerable to mice entering. Mice have now entered and will likely travel through the house. This shouldn’t be an issue for me considering my bedroom door is closed most of the time unless I am in the process of entering/exiting the room.

As punishment for something (bringing up her taking my money?) she has decided to open my door whenever possible. Primarily in an attempt to get the mice to enter my room. With the added effect of me literally not being able to sleep while my door is open due to safety concerns. I have told her multiple times that I am not comfortable with this and it is causing me sleep deprivation however she has ignored me. What should I do?

TLDR: I won’t let my unemployed mother have my money so she is attempting to release rodents into my bedroom and give me sleep deprivation.

Anyone have any advice for me?",27Nov2019,1
298,"
To start this off, this happened years ago when I was a freshman in high school. It was an awkward time in my life when I had a horrible self-image and no sense of identity. One day out of boredom and the desire to be someone else I guess, I set up two tinder accounts. One of myself and another of a pretty girl that I found on google or something, I wanted to gauge the responses of people from each account as some sort of weird and twisted experiment because teenage girls are PSYCHOTIC.

Anyways, I ended up matching with this guy on the FAKE account who seemed to have a lot of common interests, we exchanged numbers and texted constantly for a few days, maybe even a week. Obviously, I had a lot of guilt doing this but I wasn’t sure how to stop it at this point because I really enjoyed talking to him. Before I could even confess, he had figured it out and confronted me. I came clean and apologized and he FORGAVE me for whatever reason and we continued talking. He said he really appreciated my personality. Even then, I was mortified by the fact he had figured this out. It was like he saw this very ugly part of me so I tried cutting him off just to preserve some of my own pride, but still, nothing really came of it. 

5 years have past since then and I have changed a lot. Ive found my confidence and I’m a completely new person. Anyways, we have been following each other on social media, occasionally saying hey and catching up every now and then. But recently, we’ve been talking a lot more often and he said he wanted to make plans to hang out. (They have fallen through so far but mostly because I live an hour away). We’ve never met in person, I saw him at the mall once a few years ago but he was with his then-girlfriend and I felt very intimidated to go up and talk to him so it was just sort of a “hey” situation.  

I’m not sure how he feels about past events, or if he even remembers everything. But I still feel gross about it and I’m worried it will leave a permanent stain on our relationship if we decide to pursue anything. Do you think he’s just a reminder of my past life that I should let go of or is there potential there?",27Nov2019,1
300,"I'm her 14 yo son and, every month or two, she goes to the doctor for her back pain. I'm worried because the medication the doctor gives her seems to be affecting her a lot. She complains about headaches, takes naps for hours during the day, has a short temper, yells at me &amp; my dad a lot when she is awake (usually starting large yelling fights), and cries when we confront her about it. This lasts for a few days after she visits the doctor. afterwards, she is perfectly fine until she goes after another month. When I try to talk to her about it after the matter, she tries dodging the question, and gets pissy at me if I persist. Usually when this happens and gets to big, I call my grandma and stay at her place for a night. I've tried talking to my dad about it, but he's no help. I know Reddit can help people, so what could the doctor be giving her?

304,"To get straight to the point, I moved into this place a month ago, she moved into the house a couple of weeks ago. We had a housemate party, we got really drunk, went to a club and started making out intensely. Came back home, I fingered her and did some oral but I was too drunk to get hard so we didn't have sex, despite her best efforts. She was a really good sport about it and we fell asleep together afterwards. I am still a virgin when it comes to penetration, but I have a bit of experience with oral, foreplay and all that (had a gf for a year that was really scared of losing her virginity so we never did penetration, but we got intimate a lot and I got her to reach orgasm like 6-7 times so I can use my hands and mouth a bit, but idk about my dick). 

I don't know what to do. There is a paper-thin wall between our rooms and we literally sleep one meter apart which somehow makes it weird for me. She's 23, I'm 21 and I'm a bit intimidated about the whole situation cause I'm really out of my element. I don't really know her and I would be interested in trying to develop something. However, it usually takes me a while to be comfortable with someone and I am worried that if I make a move she might want to jump right into sex and being uncomfortable, I might not be able to get it up again, which would actually make me want to shoot myself. 

How do I try and get to know her, while making sure we take things slow? That is if she wants to develop anything at all, which I have no idea about. I usually have a pretty confident outlook (I was mostly the one leading what happened after the housemate party), but in certain situations I get awkward and indecisive and I worry she might get turned off if I get into that mode.

305,"Hello!  So, I’ve lurked for awhile, and I’d love to get advice on a major problem of mine.

Background:  I’m a minor, but old enough to be listened to.  I have pets that are chill with other animals.

I have some mental health issues that I would rather not get into.  In short—I believe I have depression, and am almost totally sure that I have general anxiety and social anxiety.  All of these become extremely debilitating (not all of the time, but a *lot*, it depends on the situation).  I do plan to see a mental health professional soon (my mother is one but does not specialize in what I think I need, this is part of the reason why I have not asked to do so already).  The anxiety attacks in particular can be about the most random things and are terrible (numbness, nausea, I feel like I’ll keel over and die, tightness of chest/difficulty breathing, struggle to speak, crying/on the verge of doing so).

I would like to see someone soon.  Recently, I have been thinking that a service animal might be a good option for me.  I have always been attached to animals, and when I have had access to animals during an anxiety attack, being with them has always helped calm me.  I obviously don’t have access to them when I’m out, which is most of the time, due to school and such.  That’s why I think having an animal trained for these situations would be extremely helpful.

We are 100% able to provide for said service animal.  Our house is equipped for this too.  Don’t worry about that part :)

I guess what I’m asking is whether a service animal might be good for me.  And, if so, what sort of animal?  As mentioned, I am still in school, so it would need to be able to go there (my school is chill about that sort of thing).  I would like an animal that I could spend time with and really create a bond with as well, if that’s possible (no, I am not doing this just to get a pet).

Thank you, kind Redditors :)",27Nov2019,1
308,"Hey guys.

Just incase anyone is wondering, I'm a guy, 17 years old, turning 18 relatively soon.

I've been the kind of person who never cared about how I looked, all throughout my really early life I was really fat and didn't really know what it meant to be fat, I was super naive, and I was always sad because people would make fun of me.

Fast forward a couple of years, I'm in college full time (duel enrolled, going for environmental science degree) I spent a few months a long while back going to the gym consistantly, working out, and eating well to lose around 55-60 pounds. I feel a lot better, people don't really make fun of me anymore, and I felt a lot more confident.

The issue comes in where I think I'm noticing that I'm balding. The hair at the top of my head is really thin, you can see my scalp in a decent bit of it, and I think my hairline is suddenly receding.

I've always had confidence issues, I've been more stressed last year and this year than I ever have been, and I really never have felt super happy for long periods of time.

I'm just going to be super transparent. I pretty much never go outside, I hate how I look even though I look better than before, I'm not good at taking showers that often (mostly because I never really go anywhere, I understand that it's gross, I'm working on it), and I have severe OCD that affects pretty much all of my life. Not the ""I like my crayons organized"" type OCD, like, actual ritualistic OCD. I pretty much have a headset on all day, as playing games is pretty much the only thing that makes me happy.

Recently my head has been itching for some reason even directly after showers where I focus on washing my hair well, and my mom said she noticed that my head is a bit red. Maybe that plays into it, but nothing is really confirmed, I haven't gotten looked at yet.

The truth is that I finally have started to care what I look like, I want to lose more weight and look better, and I kind of wish I had longer, thick hair because I actually kind of like the thought of having a lot of hair, like long enough that it could be played with, I don't really have too many decent examples, but with my life being extremely stressful for the past 2 years, I finally felt like things were getting a bit better, and then this has completely taken over my life to the point where I can't think about anything besides it. Like, literally, I haven't stopped thinking about it for the past week, from sun rise to sun down, I just can't.

This post felt so hard to write, I usually don't talk to anyone about anything personal or anything that bothers me, not even my parents, so saying this to random strangers on the internet doesn't feel right, but I really don't have anywhere else to go.

Thanks ahead of time.",27Nov2019,1

The other girl next to me looked surprised/mad and crossed it out and wrote her name. They when back and forth a couple more times until they stopped. So I was wondering what this means?

311,"If you're reading this, hello and thank you! I'm pretty desperate for advice and hoping that maybe I have more options than those that I currently know of.

I'm a 19 year old female. I currently work at a close-knit family office. Everyone that works at my office is family/distant family except for myself. The office is divided up into two sections. Four other people are in one section and myself and three others are in the second one and we share a supervisor that walks around and checks in on us.

Everyone has been beyond nice to me here. When I started working here, I did so with the intention of just making enough to save up and get out. However, it actually began to feel like something I could stay with. Up until about three weeks ago. 

The supervisor is a man in his 60's. He's always been nice to me and I've always enjoyed having him pop in a few times a day to take my papers and make sure I was alright. 

Then, about three weeks ago he was sort of standing at the doorway while I was up putting some papers in a filing cabinet and he came in and before I could even react, he wrapped his arms around me and hugged me. I awkwardly patted him on the back and began to pull away- he was talking at the time and I was only half listening. Then he pulled me close again and hugged me once more. He then told me in what I assume was meant to be a joke 'not to tell anyone' and only he could do that. 

That made me super uncomfortable and I was hoping it was an odd occurrence. But later that same day he gave me a quick hug before he left. The next week, he popped in and gave me another full on hug- this time he held me and was rubbing one hand up and down my side/stomach. Another time he came up behind me and was holding me around my waist. Another time he went to hug me and really grabbed at me with his fingers- it sort of hurt. Another incident, he made a grab at my butt and then went to pull on the bottom of my jacket- I guess to make it seem harmless. He's always suspicious about it too- looking around and making sure no one's watching. And he won't do it if people are around. So that alone makes me even more uneasy.

I had bad anxiety before this job and since I've been here it's improved, however this shit is making it take a huge step backwards. I'm so paranoid- always listening out for him and if I think I hear him coming I hurry and go out into the hallway where the water dispenser is since two offices face it and those two workers can see clearly. I try to hurry and grab things so my hands are full. A few times I just stayed seated and pretended to work but he puts his hand on my shoulder for several minutes or around my back. 

We have this week off work and I'm relieved that I don't have to go and face him but I'm dreading next week. We have an HR person but she's related to the supervisor. Everyone in the office loves him. The owner is a cousin of his. The co-owner is a friend of his as well and he's someone that I feel like I could talk to but I'm just so scared to rock the boat at this place. I'm so worried about the repercussions of this. Possibly being let go for some reason or just ending up on everyone's bad side. I literally need this job. In order to have enough to get what I need to get the hell out- I'll need to be here for about 6 more months but I just don't know how long I'll be able to keep this up. Any advice is welcome.",27Nov2019,1
312,"I'm stressed and it's past midnight so I need outside assistance to help before I give myself a panic attack or do something I'm going to regret as far as future jobs are concerned in the morning.

So I'm working two jobs, one retail and one service, generally it's manageable between the two but there are some conflicts. The primary is scheduling as Job A, which I treat as my main job, gets their schedule first but Job B has a weird work week, schedule starts in the middle of week, and while policy is to give them two week notice I can at best do one week.

Turn back to Monday, I come in to give the service job notice as the schedule, to my knowledge, is made on Tuesday evening. I accept fault in that this should have been on Sunday and I have the talk with the manager on duty about how I'm supposed to do it and all that. I recognize that I've messed up there, my context being that despite the few times in the past that I have done this I've had no issues as the manager on duty and the manager usually in charge of schedules are two different people. As you imagine retail job needs me for Black Friday. So the point of this section is saying that I'm scheduled at both jobs during that time. The service job is strict and refuses to give out employee numbers, which I understand, unless they've volunteered to be contacted for filling shifts and will not contact anyone on my behalf so even if I know someone who could take the shift I'm fucked unless they work within the next two days. I have maybe one opportunity to talk to one person about switching to something that MIGHT work in my favor and it's stressing me the fuck out with the possibility that I can't make it work. Adding to this is that I'm not sure if my request was even looked at or processed considering who took it and who made the schedule, not my usual manager but another supervisor and I've had previous incidents where someone had removed my name and contact information from the list of people to call to pick up shifts, several times I might add and I have no proof but suspicions that it may have been a manager/the manager that who talked to me about proper procedure.

To add to that stress my retail job recently had to shave hours for Black Friday, projections and all that corporate shit, and in my wisdom I deleted the original version of the schedule so I only have the vaguest idea of what I'm working beyond ""closing"" and ""opening"" which contributes to my possible swap only might working.

So we come here where I'm weighing the choice to walk in and quit on the spot because everything piling together at the same time created so much stress after working a week straight with no days off that I'm not sure I'm even thinking straight and I'm not sure if a majority of what I'm writing isn't just text vomit.",27Nov2019,1

319,"I have two businesses both intrinsically linked to my father via shared staff, investment, and the sharing of an office. the first business is officially mine and one that for many years I was able to run without his involvement. the second business we are equal shareholders however he is not active.   


recently, i've been spending more and more time trying to fix issues in the second business digging ourselves out a hole caused by the decision making of my father. he makes demands and has always been incredibly stubborn, but as he gets older it is getting progressively worse and coupled with mild sexism, arrogance and ego issues (which has been mentioned by others and not just me). it's becoming very very hard and not enjoyable to work with him. over the last year and a half he has opened a new side to his business, which he is using my first business for. in the last year, i've been spending more time on the second business to try grow it and get over the problems he caused. he cannot contribute to this second business because it is not in his skillset and I \*know\* he despises that, but still demands to make his decisions - though wrong- the one put forward which is why we are having these issues in the first place. it turns into arguments and im' always the one who just gives up because it is exhausting - you give proof, evidence, everything and he still won't budge. then when the mistake is made he puts it on everyone and never takes accountability or seems to learn from it. i don't make any money off this second business but it is where I've been spending all my time. now that he's using my first business more and I've been spending more time on the second business, he has taken to calling the first business his and controlling all aspects of it. i've tried to regain control but because every single project I've undertaken in the last year and half has had some issue or failed (though no part of the process or anything else has changed since previous years) it has been hard. there are some serious issues that have been identified, but he's too adamant and doesn't seem to want to get them solved. he acts very childish when they are raised. i'm trying to pick up my first business, but every project i bring in and every customer i onboard fails -- so now I'm wondering what I'm supposed to do?  to be honest, there are so many other things i could include here but this will turn into an essay! 

I feel really stuck and I don't know what to do. how do I regain control? how do I solve the identified issues in a business i hate but have to run because it is how I live? how do I do that under his ""power""? do i suck it up until I can survive off the second business? do i try to buy him out of the second business? (but it's so interlinked it's difficult) most of the time now i just want to run away and disappear. the foreign country that i live in doesn't make it easy to get a part time job. at the same time i've been out of the ""game"" and country for so long that i've lost any contacts to go back into salaried or part time work? i don't want to either - i'm so used to working for myself. and i know the second business will do well if given the chance and i'm not ready to give up.",27Nov2019,1
320,"He and I have a bit of an up and down history. Before we started anything physical, he thought I wanted to date him and he rejected me. While at the time I did find him attractive and kinda ~yearned~ for him, I never wanted anything romantic. It has been quite a journey getting over feeling rejected by him, but I made it!

Fast forward to now, we have had a physical relationship on and off for about a year now. We took a break for about 4 months because I was having trouble managing my feelings (fuckin oxytocin) but came out of it clear headed. 

I am very confident that he isnt someone I want to be with romantically, but I have some intimacy issues and so I'm not ready to put myself out there to date other guys. This is why the situation seems to work well.

We slept together last weekend for the first time in awhile. It was fun. He cuddled me the entire night after and I was ready to go back to being bros.

But his behaviour has started to change- he has started messaging me more throughout the day, sending more memes, he will pat my head/touch my hair, he bought me a little gift..

I'm trying not to be hypervigilant and overthink things- is he just feeling extra.. friendly? Is this how guys typically act when they just want more sex? The idea that he has romantic feelings for me makes me uncomfortable, but I'm not sure what to look out for.",27Nov2019,1

326,"A bit of background and pardon my english as it isn't my first language: My gf and I went through 1 year before we broke up for awhile because of a really bad argument. Few months later, we got back together again and we swore to correct what we did wrong and make ourselves better. The first time, her mom reluctantly accepted me yet still insisted on not leaving me and her alone in a room together and due to that, I felt like her family didn't trust me with their daughter even after we spent 1 year together. 

After the break up, me and my gf were still friends and she supposedly asked her mom, ""What would you think if we got back together?"" to which her mom replied with ""It's up to you"". We got back together and was happier than ever before. I promised that I would go to the same college as her and this is where the problem starts. 

At first, it was small things like her mom being pissed that she went with me on a study session in a McDonalds just directly outside the school premises then suddenly it grew until my gf asked if she and I could take the entrance exam together. The mom got pissed off, said that she was ""a failure of a daughter"" and that they were heading back to their hometown. My gf is currently in a bad position and said that she is having ""suicidal thoughts"" due to all the stress she received from over 2 months from both mother and father.

327,"     I am a 24 y/o female. I started college in 2017 at my local community college then transferred to a big state university this year. I loved pretty much everything about it but I wasn't 100% sold on my major just because I felt I was behind compared to my peers and I would be graduating in 3 years instead of the 2 years planned. 

       I was battling a lot of mental and emotional issues before but i felt as if everything was just in my head if that makes sense? I was able to make friends and focus on my studies, everything was ok. Up until 2 weeks into my classes I starting experiencing a strange health issue. Something I didn't understand nor doctors I have seen. I've been feeling hopeless and had no friends anymore. I tried my best to continue but I felt it was best to just drop out of college because I just wanted to end everything. 

       I dropped out of college with no plan what so ever. I have to move out by Dec 3 and I have no one to help me with that. I do not have a vehicle which makes this worse. I have a lot of credit card debt and now I owe the school more money plus loans that I have to pay up in 6 months. I was planning to go transfer to a different school but how stupid would that be if I had it all here and nothing will change. So my college career is over after 6 years of no work experience (after high school).
       
       I am depressed disappointed but I saw no other way. I tried seeking help at my college but no one seems helpful which is what encouraged me to leave. I have a bunch of stuff I would hat to get rid of and was planning on renting a car and stuffing all my stuff in there then rent an apartment. 
       
       I only have 7k to my name, some credit cards and a permit that says drivers license. Yea I never took my driver license test.
I feel as if I have been trying to escape my past and grow up but have been doing such a bad job at it, I feel like a failure because I don't have my shit together and never did. So many of my friends who even still live at home have a car/children/jobs/military experience and I have nothing to show for the wasted 6 years since I graduate high school.

        What would you do in my situation when you have no one to turn to? I have a friend who offered me to stay for a few weeks AFTER New Years. I pushed all my family away because honestly deep down I kind of blame them for leading me up to where I am now and I don't really want anything to do with them.",27Nov2019,1
328,"So last week I got a notification from my landlord that they would be coming to do a routine furnace inspection with the contractor that installed it. It dosen't seem out of the blue as I checked the label and the last time it was looked at was in 2018.

It's been two days and the heat has yet to come back on. I'm in Canada and the house is about 6 degrees C right now. I have tried looking at the furnace to figure out if I can turn it back on.

335,"Hi this is my first ever Reddit post and boy am I nervous about the response. I wasn’t even sure where to put this or if I even should.

I’ve recently gone through the loss of my best friend. I knew her since kindergarten. It was brain cancer that got her.

She went down hill quickly. She was expected to live 6 more months but tanked in a single weekend after she got put on hospice care. So there wasn’t much she could do to prepare. Not that one could ever really prepare.

One of the last things she asked of me was basically to get rid of any trace of her being lesbian. She wasn’t able to talk enough to explain her reasoning, but I assume it’s because she did not want her family to discover stuff about her that would hurt them after her death. Of course I told her I would do anything for her. That night I deleted many messages on her phone between us and other friends.

She died two days later and I’ve just gone through the process of deleting her Tumblr, Reddit, and alternate twitter account just in case her parents were to stumble across them.

I can’t explain the feeling. I hurt when she died but I don’t think I’ve never hurt more than when I deleted those accounts. My parents are also religious and so I’m a closeted gay male so it’s just something we bonded over. Something we have in common. I’ve gone back and forth between being angry and sad. I just don’t understand.

I’m partially venting here. But I’ve been determined, especially since leaving her funeral, that I don’t want anybody ever to stand over my body in a church, spewing things that I don’t believe. I want to come out either tomorrow or thanksgiving to my entire family and in a way I think it’s in honor of her. Though I have my reservations — Is this a purely emotional response? My friend and I never ever talked about coming out. I never wanted to put a rift between my family and I and I assume she felt the same. I’m a pretty amicable person generally and I’m worried that I’m making a rash decision. Is this awful circumstance the motivation I needed or is it clouding my judgement?",27Nov2019,1
336,"**No tld;dr: because I can't find the way to make this shorter.** 

He ignores me to hang out with other people in front of me, he tells me ""I'll be right back"" and he comes back two hours later to stay 10 minutes, he doesn't look for me to have fun toguether or to hang out anymore, he ignores my texts, he's not interested in me or in my life anymore...

**But the worst part is that he only reaches for me when he has problems.** When he needs a shoulder to cry on. He just did it actually, he ignored me for a couple of days which made me feel anxious and depressed, because we used to be actual best friends before he started acting like this, then he suddenly came back to me and he vented about his problems. We spent two hours talking about it, I supported him like I've always done and he's always done for me... And when he was finished he just left. And he's doing it again, he's ignoring me on purpouse... Again. He's just online in another social media, ignoring my texts.

I don't know what to do. I feel that the next time he comes to me, I'll let him vent about his problems and I'll unconditionally support him because that's what I want to do, because not doing it would make me feel like a piece of shit and because I still care for him. Everytime he ""comes back"" my mind gets tricked and I actually believe our friendship i going to be like it used to, again. He tells me he missed me so much, he hugs me, he talks so sweetly and softly, he uses me and he does it again.

**I don't know what to do. I'm tired of being a toy for him but I don't know how to act around him anymore.**

**First, we're in the same classroom.** We're always socializing in the same place and we have friends in common. I want to avoid him so badly but our school is very small and we're in many group chats toguether, also, I don't want to lose our friends in common. So I don't have any other option than socializing in front of him.

**Second, he knows something that can ruin my life.** He's a very manipulative person, he likes to spread rumours and if I get in his bad side or if I do something he didn't like, he could tell everyone that I cheated in a very important exam and that could get me expelled from school and lose my college schoolarship. Yes, I know it was wrong to cheat but I was afraid of ruining my grades and getting beaten by my parents.

**What's the best way to approach this situation? I want to ghost him and dissapear from his life so badly but that's not a solution. He's a bad person, a bad friend and I'm stupid for having feelings about him but I also don't want to be forced to be his shoulder to cry on in fear that he may ruin my life.**

First let me start off by saying I have an Associates Degree in Early Childhood; as well as a Bachelors in Communications. I never thought of having a career in Communications but with having to be out of work the past two months (car accident two months ago and now I had surgery) I want to start fresh in a career. 

From 2012 to August of 2019, I have only ever worked in a daycare facility mainly because I love kids; even though the pay was horrible. However to be honest I was still young so I didn’t really care much about money. I am currently a paraprofessional (1-1 aide) with a special needs kid. I love the kids and my coworkers, but I am used to working in a fast pace environment that the setting and atmosphere is not for me and more importantly the pay especially since I’ve been out of work for some time now.

345,"So right now I’m looking at 8 different colleges 4 out of state 4 in.  I Have my favorite one I want to go to chosen but I know my chances are super slim for actually getting in. so although I have a chance my hearts not set on it. With that said 5 of them I’m practically guaranteed  in and the other two I have a pretty good chance. So I need help choosing I’m not saying any school names but I’ll give general description of why I want to go to each and what they do good and then I’ll see what your think for each. These are not in any particular order 

School 1) this is the one that my chances are slim. It’s across the country and super exclusive but as someone who wants to major in political science to either be a lawyer or political scientist it’s location is perfect and I will for certain graduate with and amazing job. The school though is expensive and with me barely getting in financial aid will also be small. 

School 2) this is an amazing highly rated school with slightly lower exclusivity that I have a decent chance to get it. It’s further away from home that the last but it’s also in another great city for my job choice again financial aid will be slim. 

School 3) the first public school on this list. It’s political science major is amazing and undergraduate study is amazing but after that I’d either transfer or deal with a less “prestigious” graduate degree which normally wouldn’t matter but political scientists and lawyers have super competitive job openings so it does matter here. Also across the country. And the city isn’t the best for me. Financial aid and scholarships though I have a good chance. 

School 4) another public school. Unlike the last one I have the opposite problem. My undergrad degree won’t be as good but my graduate degree will be amazing. It’s out of state but it’s in a much closer state so it is much much closer. I love the city it will be good for me but not as good as the first two schools. Same as last I can get money here. 

School 5) my first in state school. It’s private but it’s god and I can get a lot of money there. My issue it doesn’t have a political science major only pre law so if I go there my job is certain I’m forced into lawyer. 

School 6) in state has law school and political science. Beautiful campus like really beautiful. I can get money as well but political scientists and lawyers aren’t as successful in my state and the degree won’t be as good out of state so that’s unfortunate as well but the school itself I love. 

School 7) does not have a law school but I can transfer. Probably the best in state school but lower chance to get in with less money and I would have to transfer due to a lack of a law school or further political science education. But again beautiful campus and I love the school.

The only public university I’m looking at in state. I have merch if this school and always root for their sports team. They don’t have law school but like the last college has the major I want I’d just have to transfer. This one I have the best chance for scholarships and money. But I’ll also have the hardest time being successful but I’ve dreamed of this school for a while and love it as well. 

Sorry if this is long I really am but I need help I don’t have my acceptance letters in yet but I’ve applied so that will help but right now I know most of these will accept me and give me money so it’ll become only the school I want. 🤷🏻‍♂️ I don’t know maybe it is way to early to ask but it’s really distracting me and I’d like to know I have some sort of organization instead of just wait and see what I get into.",27Nov2019,1

I really need some advice, I have been trying for years every method, I’ve tried doing face exercises, and eating certain foods but nothing is working and it’s driving me nuts! I’ve even considered getting liposuction, it pains me to say that. I need help, can anyone give me advice on how to get rid of it? I’m desperate for answers.

355,"So one day I found a couple packs of cigarettes in my sisters room when I was looking to steal some cash. My sister’s always been into drugs, drinking, that kind of thing. I hate it. I ended up leaving the cash and taking the packs. I hid them in my room and eventually forgot they were there. 
Months later I’m sorting through my old books, and I find the packs underneath everything.  

Now, I used to be friends with this guy who makes a lot of bad decisions. We stopped talking after a fight, I never really went out of my way to see him again. My first thought when I found the cigarettes was, ‘I need to get rid of them.’ So I thought about taking them to the dump or leaving them in a field, but then I thought ‘that would be a waste, I could try to sell them’. So I reached out to that friend of mine and asked him if he was still into that kinda shit. 

He hasn’t responded yet, and this feels kinda shitty. For all I know they’re laced with weed or something, I mean, they *look* tampered with, but I wouldn’t really know. There’s still time to cancel all this. Should I?",27Nov2019,1
357,"So i was in in a relationship with a girl and i think it was great, but about 2 weeks ago we kinda grew appart. We live 10 km away from each other , i am not in her class but we are in the same school. I only saw her in pauses and quickly we stopped hugging and al that stuff. For almost 2 weeks i new there was something wrong but last week i noticed it so bad i wanted to make an end to it, this monday i told her i wanted to talk but she didn't have time so i just sat with her in the cafeteria together with some of her girlfriends and just told her how i felt but didnt tell her i wanted to break up. Next day she wanted to talk and she didnt want to say it so i said it and we happily broke up, i thought.

I went to my friends and told them i did it and why, but nothing more. 1 hr later she text me and says. 
""Oh you're the kind of person that immediately talks shit about his ex when he breaks up"" 
At this point i was really confused cus i didn't say anything bad about her. I continued to tell that her being bullied wasn't my intention. And she just goes on about how she already got bullied and that i just made it worse by breaking up with her.
And no matter what i tell her she just tells me.
""I want to believe you but the way everybody talks about me now, makes it look you did it on purpose.""
She still wants to be friends but i think she wont forget easily.
I want some advice about how i might make it better for her.

362,"Hey all, gonna set up some background to get started:

In April of this year, I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, which put me out of work. Its been painful to deal with, but I am getting help with GI doctors. Even more recently, I was diagnosed with Bipolar Affective Disorder after a psychotic episode. This has complicated things quite a bit. It's hard for me to keep track of what memories are real, and which are delusions. I've been trying to work through things in my head, as the Veterans Affairs (US) is slow going with therapy. Ok, so now on to the advice part.

I have an unconventional family, as in girlfriend and adopted daughter (we call each other bonus dad/bonus daughter). They absolutely make my world go round. However, last Christmas, my grandmother made them feel very unwelcome. They arent going back this year and I dont blame them. My Dad is really pushing me to go. Even though I'm just now getting slightly stable (episode was Mania, I was very far out there). I don't want to. My grandmother refused to take pictures with them, and reminded us about how god felt about us living together unmarried (even though neither my grandma or dad would take me in sick and jobless) I have decided I'm going to stand up for myself to my Dad for the first time. 

Then theres my Dad: He has never been happy with anything I've done. When I joined the military, he informed me after I got out of basic training that he did not approve of my choice as I didn't consult with him. He and my mom were still married at the time, and mom spent a lot of money on care packages for me. When I got out of the military, he informed me that the money was the reason they split. He then added that the care packages are what caused them to go bankrupt and informed me I'm responsible for the divorce.

 Another marriage and divorce later, all he does is work, get high and drink. Doesnt see my sister and her family often, and never comes to see me. When I got sick it got much harder to get around, still wanted me to come to him because he's tired and worked all day. I've never been entitled to my dads money, but I'm having bills go into collections and he never spends, so he is just sitting on 6 figures. My debt is very small ($900) and it makes me sad that he doesnt want to pay it. Mind you, I never asked, I was just told. I know he worked hard for it, but I also know how he is, and hes only sitting on it to ""teach me a lesson"" and its been that way for 30 years. The idea of not jumping in to help your kid is insane to me. I dont wanna go off, because he does go with me to my appointments and I know he loves me, he just cant take the blame for anything. He completely denies my mental illness, and insists I should just get back to work and that will fix everything. 

I don't want to be this way about it, but talking to him is hard because even at my age he tries so hard to control me. The stress is causing me to backpedal and I find myself showing more signs of my illness when Im around him. I'm just not sure what to do at this point. Its become insufferable, and damaging. Can anyone help?

TLDR; Dad always tries to control me, and I've recently become very sick and hes ignoring it, suggesting I just act like its not there.",27Nov2019,1
364,"To start off my parents and I are pretty close. They know about almost everything that happens in my life granted I leave somethings out, I need to have some sort of privacy, but everything else I’m fine with sharing. So recently my boyfriend and I decided that it was better for us to spend some time apart (nice way of saying break up lol) but he’s still living with me because he doesn’t have anywhere else to go which is fine by me especially since we both still want to be friends for the time being. As far as I’m concerned everything’s fine, he’ll move out when he can and in the mean time I get to keep living with my sexy best friend. And then today while I was driving to visit my family it hit me. What am I going to tell my parents? I mean I want to tell them, his parents already know we’re not together anymore, but my parents are sooo much different than his. When it comes to relationship stuff they don’t know how to be soft and sympathetic. I know my mom would just say something like “ good you finally kicked that loser out” and my dad would say something like “you should have him pay all your rent for breaking up with you.” I mean I get that they joke around but there’s a tone of seriousness behind what they say and that stings. Plus he invited me to a family dinner in a couple days and it would be so much easier having my parents think that we’re together rather than have them judge me for having dinner with my ex’s family. I just feel so guilty not telling them partly because I know they’ll be hurt once they find out that I didn’t tell them right away but I mean my reasoning behind not telling them is reasonable, right?",27Nov2019,1

but i'm obsessed with someone. i have been obsessed with them for years. we have no relationship to speak of and i have not interacted with them for years. i think about them often but have been trying very hard to restrain myself from doing it and get over it. i found their social media and went through all of their followers photos looking for pictures that had them in it. i found their address and went to streetview on google maps so i could see what their house looked like. i found their phone number (well, possibly their phone number) online and had thoughts of calling it from a payphone just so i could hear their voice. i found pictures of them with other people and it made me want to cry because i hated the thought of them being with people other than me.

i'm very aware that i have serious issues and this isn't normal. i wish i could make it go away but nothing i do works. beyond this, my life is pretty normal and i have a healthy social life, but i know that if i reached out to any of my friends about this they would be disturbed and probably distance themselves from me. i am going to therapy, but it is for a specific issue in my life and i would have to find a new therapist to discuss this (which is not a possibility for me at the moment).

what am i supposed to do? are there things i can do on my own to make this go away? for the past year i thought it was getting better, but i woke up this week and all the emotions came back full force. it hurts so much to exist and all i can think of is suicide but I know that this is such a stupid thing to be hung up about and I don't understand why my mind can't let it go.",27Nov2019,1

The feeling didnt go away all day and I could barely function. I had to focus with all I had just to act normal and form sentences. I put it down to maybe just needing some sleep so I went to bed right after I finished work.

 I woke up the next morning and felt 'normal' again until about 9am and then it kicked in again. It was so unsettling this time I had to come home early from work. I was shaking, sweating, felt extremely nauseated, etc. I went to sleep again when I got home, put it down to maybe just being fatigued, but it was still there when I woke up. 

I took today off work as I'm still experiencing it, going on three days now. I keep questioning whether things are actually real. Its really uncomfortable. I cant keep my brain on one thing, I'll try to think about something and it's just blank. I'm struggling to make sense so sorry if this story is a bit muddled up.

371,"Ok so I’m a 20 yr old male and i got two issues here, but the first one kind of ties into the second one in a way.

So the first issue is that i used to be friends with this girl, we were friends for about 3 years or so, and we were pretty close, but one day out of nowhere, she deleted me off of all social media and hasn’t talked to me since. We were close, like we would talk a bunch and if something happened in our lives, we would meet up over dinner and talk it out. Hell, one day, she called me at work and i sat there on the phone for about a half an hour or so comforting her because she got out of her first serious relationship and the guy was her first love (im not too sure but i think they’re back together). I felt like everything was great, she was like the only person I felt like i was comfortable going to, and like i said about a month ago, she just deleted me off of everything without warning. And I know people are like “just forget about her, she aint worth it” or “its not that big of a deal” but its a huge deal for me, like its just eating at me, like I can’t stop thinking about it. Like what did i do? Why did this happen? Was it her boyfriend? I just really miss her. Not only were we close, but she was the only person I talked to. I wish i was exaggerating, but I literally have no friends. Maybe one person that texts me back once in a blue moon, but thats it. 

This ties into my other problem, my loneliness really really sucks. Like I said above, I don’t talk to anyone. I haven’t been out with friends or anything since maybe 6 months to a year. I haven’t had a relationship in about 2 years and ive only had one other girlfriend besides the last one. Last time i even talk to a girl was a year and a half ago. Before the loneliness used to be like relationship-wise, but its just im lonely in general. Like I just wanna talk to people, have good friends, hang out with people, have a girlfriend to give my love to, etc. And it also doesn’t help that my social anxiety and conversational skills are terrible. I never have the guts to go up and talk to people, let alone a girl. At this point, I see a girl thats nice and/or pretty and I just get upset, or if i see people having so much fun with friends and i wish I could have that. Now sometimes, i just get neutral with the loneliness, but i find more times than not, it kicks my ass. I just want to know whats so unappealing about me or why people don’t like me or why girls don’t like me or won’t give me a chance.

Sorry I know that was long, I just hope someone can help me out at least a little. And if case anyone was wondering, yes i do have anxiety and depression. Thank you to anyone in advance for feedback.",27Nov2019,1

I was upfront with him that I didn’t want a relationship, and when I moved we stayed in touch. When we would talk he would treat me like we were dating. “Where are you what are you doing who are you with why didn’t you respond.” It turned me off and I turned him down and told him to stop contacting me. Unfortunately we kept talking on and off and I was pretty fucked up and dismissive to him. To put it clearly I was a really mean bitch. There’s no other way to put it, I was in the wrong.

Fast forward to a few days ago. I hit him up on a whim to hang out with him. We hung out and he totally forgave me for everything and told me even if we don’t date that he just wanted to be my friend. We’ve been hanging out and I’ve been realizing I like him. I know it’s soon and I’m not going to try to date him or anything since it’s fresh. He has told me that he likes me but is weary because of everything that happened last year. I know I can’t break these walls down because they’re justified. I’m just wondering if there’s anything I can do to show that I am really sorry and sincere about what happened between us.

382,"I don't know. I just need to get this off my chest, because, i feel pretty awful and hopeless about what happened just 3 hours before. I am in this company that I work at since 4 months that I was placed by, by a job agency. In my country we have this concept of time workers. Where you can use workers whenever you want with low pay. It's like modern slavery. So today was my f/28 last working day. Because I am planning since a year to move abroad. And this company was just one stepping stone to earning money on the way. I did this for the first time, so was pretty naive with many things. And did some tiny mistakes of course. But that are not relevant. I had an alright relationship with my Co workers. I knew that some of the older woman like to to do some bad gossiping about some time workers and younger people. It's really disgusting and childish I think. But I am the type that avoids gossiping people and stress and when they want me to participate in it I decline or just ignore them. I must admit that around the end I distanced myself from some women because someone told me they were gossiping about me ""being often sick"" too. During those 4 months I was sick once a month. Yes it's a lot. And I feel sorry for it. But I was genuinely sorry. As long as I can attest it, I don't have to justify why I was absent! And if you don't clarify it to those woman why and how, they get cold to you and gossip about you. Some gossips were about ""she doesn't wanna come to work. She is always having a bad mood and having this face at work and distancing herself from us blabla"". So today I went to work as usual. I even  baked a farewell cake for all. But forgot that at home sadly. Don't get me wrong. I am fine with 70% of the women there but there are just 4 women out of 15 that are gossiping chickens. So I was getting myself ready to start work and one of my Co workers f/49  turns to me and says ""oh you there! I still have to settle a score with you! Need to say my opinion to you! I said are you sure you wanna do it now? It's 6 am in the morning and I didn't even start working. Can't we do that later? She then started hysterically shouting and screaming at me infront of 10 women. ""why did you have to mention my name. Its not my fault you couldn't come on Sunday. I didn't say that we don't have to work on Sundays anymore. Why do you say my name? I could lose my job!"" 
I apologized and said that I am really sorry, and that I shouldn't have done that, that it was my fault and I just misunderstood her words. That I didn't say that she definetly said. It was all a misunderstanding. But she continued shouting and screaming that I am an snake and a gossip loving person that takes wrong names into her mouth and loves to drag down reputations. I was so shocked. There were two more bad accusations that weren't true at all and I don't even know where and how she got those. I apologized like 10 times in 20 mins but it got all so heated up. She didn't want an apology she just wanted to bully me infront of all. And at the end I said that she isn't right in her head and I lost all respect for her. And she told me to shut tf up. Those women that all just watched dissapointed me heavily. Later on one of those women tried to keep us apart and told us to calm down. I said I want to go home now. That's it. This was my last working day. I am not even 10 mins at work and she starts shouting at me and accusing me of things it's horrible. I went to other Co workers that didn't hear the fight and they were so shocked and supported me. They helped me contact the shift manager and I told everything. Her name and all. I didn't have to lose anything anyways. It was my last day. He said ""I recommend you to work until the end today and make a clean cut with the company. But if you don't want to that will be running away. Your decision. I chose to run away and go home.
I felt so awful during those 2 hours. Cried like a child infront of all. I was too exhausted to continue working.

Yes i knew the whole time and i still stayed, he left me home to go spend time w his little “gf”, had sex with her and they basically did what they wanted while i was home crying my eyes out begging for him back or if i wasn’t begging for him back i would try to find somewhere to go &amp; i couldn’t so i was stuck. i had our baby &amp; he ended things with her so we can all bond w our newborn. since he cheated on me i lost everything for him. once my baby was here, he made me open my eyes and know my worth. now that i have my baby some old family members finally opened their doors for me which means i have places i can go. i’ve been wanting to leave for idk how long, i don’t wanna be with him no more. i feel as in a relationship i shouldn’t have went thru the things i went thru with him, i should’ve left a long time ago. i just don’t want things to get worse, he dropped his girls he used to talk to to try to fix things but i don’t wanna work things out no more, i’m tired of him and i’m tired of everything. i begged and begged him in this relationship to try to fix things and he never did, i begged for 5 years &amp; im finally tired. i’m not in love with him anymore, i’ve told him several times on how i feel but he just takes everything as a joke because he never seen me or hear me say anything like this. how do i get it thru his head that i don’t wanna be with him or i’m not in love with him anymore? 

i know it’s not good for the baby for us to be separated but i’d rather us be separated then my baby witness me getting beat every now and then. I told my bf i will never keep the baby away from him but he still never allows me to leave.",27Nov2019,1

But it’s starting to get on my nerves, I’m the youngest, my sister the oldest, and lately I have started noticing my mom is coming down harder on me then she ever did with her, like for instance now, my new school period started a week ago, on Wednesday I fell cause it was icy, I told her etc and she decide to let me go home, how nice! But because I had open wounds I got sick hard as hell because normally I don’t get sick, and today also Wednesday, I went to school sick as hell and my teacher and every student in my class didn’t understand why I was there, but hey my mom made me go so alright, then I just texted her that i wasn’t feeling proper and what she wanted me to do, and she immediately told me to go home but not in a nice way, it was only the second time I got sick and yet she’s mad ass hell, even though I remember my sister coughing and she got to stay home?! Whenever she is sick I have to be quiet, whenever she’s feeling down and sleeping I have to be quiet, when I’m down and sleeping they are pissed I went to bed and are stomping around the house, wtf do I do with a mother who fails to see she is being unreasonable as hell?

I was talking to someone anonymously online about half an hour ago from when this will be posted. I don't know much about this person, except for the fact they're male and live in Australia. (As a note: I don't live in Australia. The fact I know the country he lives in and I know that I don't live in it is important.) 

At first the conversation started off as banter, but as time went on he started to go on about setting things on fire (He eventually specified a park). At this point I thought it was a joke.

He started threatening to go to a park tomorrow and rape and murder kids and at this point I still thought it was a joke but as we continued talking he started to go on about what he believed was wrong with the world and how he'd be ""doing them a favor"". At first it gave me a sick fantasy vibe because he went into so much detail but as time went on I started thinking that he was being a bit more serious than I originally thought.

I tried to tell him not to and said it won't change anything but he just said ""alright u'll see"" and added a few insults before leaving.

I don't know what to do. I have screenshots of the chat saved. I just want to know if there's anything I might be able to do in case he's being serious. Is there anyone I can contact or anywhere where I can send the screenshots too or just wait and see if he was being serious?",27Nov2019,1
387,"So, this is going to be super long and personal. Sorry I’m advance.

I’m currently 17 years old and live with my mom and dog and would like to move out as soon as possible after turning 18.   I’m in my final year of high school and plan on pursuing at least community college next spring, as well as getting a job so that I can support myself and become more independent.  As of now, I have a lot of very different aspects of my life that are influencing what I should do next... and I’ll try to summarize them to the best of my ability.

The reason as to why I feel the need to move out  ASAP is because my mom and I do not get along.  I’m well aware that this is the case for pretty much everyone my age, but let me elaborate a little bit.  For starters, she and I have *very* different views on most things.  Here are the main ones causing so much conflict between us:

_Vaccines and health_. My mother spends 10+ hours a day browsing Facebook’s iconic “anti vax” groups, as well as other ones relating to health conspiracies and whatnot.  She’s been anti vaccine for a while now, luckily it started after I got about 95% of recommended and required ones, though.  While her “beliefs” don’t directly impact me as much as they would if I weren’t already vaccinated, they have impacted my dog and what diseases he’s been immunized against.

_My dog_.  When she let me get a dog, she and I agreed that I would be 100% responsible for his training, care, finances, and exercise.. she would only legally own him since I’m a minor.  An agreement that I have been holding up my end of as best as I can, since she has decided to completely take control of whatever she wants.  It started with which dog I could adopt, which food I could feed him,  if he’s crate trained or not, which vet I could bring him to,  how long and when I could leave the house with him home alone, then which vaccines he could or couldn’t get (she absolutely refused to have him vaccinated at all, so I had to bring him myself without telling her. She still doesn’t know).  It’s gotten to the point to where she tries to control when and how much I exercise him as well, which is the most recent issue I’m facing with her.  Now, my dog is a very energetic mutt.  He needs a lot of exercise on a daily basis, which I have been providing in many different ways, mainly fetch and running.  He’s one of those dogs that constantly wants to play fetch even if he’s exhausted.  This is something that she can’t understand... my mom is not an animal person. She doesn’t understand that in order to own a happy, healthy dog, you have to set certain boundaries in order properly train them.  Boundaries such as not feeding them scraps to prevent begging, ignoring excessive barking and whining for attention, etc.  She also doesn’t understand how to interpret any of his behaviors and thinks that if he’s not passed out sleeping, he needs to have more exercise because he’s “depressed” just hanging out around the house. Her and I get into daily conflicts *just* relating to how much time I spend exercising my dog, and she has even been demanding that I take photographic evidence of me providing said exercise. 

The only genuine issue I’m working on with my dog is his separation anxiety.  He came from a very negligent home and is generally insecure and anxious when exposed to certain things, including being left alone.  After about 1(!) hour, he starts to show signs of pretty severe stress like panting and shaking, but he’s gotten slightly better over the last year with gradual exposure and treatment with CBD.  He also whines and barks a fair amount after about an hour as well.  What I’ve figured out is if there’s at least one other person in the house with him when I leave, he’ll usually be fine for up to 8 hours before getting stressed.  This gives me time to attend my classes and spend a few hours a couple days a week with my friends.  But, because my mom thinks my dog needs to be vigilantly supervised for the entire duration of when I’m gone, she usually doesn’t let me leave my dog at home when she’s there (which is pretty much all day every day because she’s unemployed).  I’ve tried to make it clear that she doesn’t need to watch him every time I leave, and that she can just ignore him and do her own thing... even stay in her room and lock him out if she wants, but she won’t listen.  So I bring him to my dads house.  

My dad is a completely different story... something I don’t feel the need to get into as much since it’s not my highest priority as of now, but, so you can understand the current situation a little better, my dad is unemployed as well.  He’s living off of disability from various mental illnesses such as severe PTSD, depression, anxiety, etc.  He does not leave his house except for his therapy session that my older half brother brings him to once a month to have his prescriptions refilled and for certain family members’ birthdays.  My dad spends all day, every day, either watching TV or on his laptop.  He used to be a very successful engineer working in the top companies  as the top employee, but some things happened which have led to his current situation.. a situation he’s been in for over 10(?) years now, I think? I would not be able to live with my dad and lead a productive life because his mental state affects me too much, but I’ve been considering moving in with him because he’s easier to be around than my mom.  Anyway, even though he’s mentally crippled and wasn’t/isn’t very involved in my life, he wants to help me as much as he’s currently able to, which basically means letting me drop my dog off there ~3 days a week for 1.5-8 hours, depending on the day.   Luckily, he lives only a few miles away from my moms house, so it’s not too inconvenient to drive there.  Unfortunately, though, dropping my dog off with my dad is very clearly not a permanent solution because it’s an unhealthy environment for such a sensitive dog to regularly be exposed to and I need to continue training him to be completely alone, which brings me to my final predicament, me and my ability to support myself and my dog.

As I mentioned before, I’m a 17 year old high school senior (I’ll turn 18 in January). I’ve been homeschooled for my entire life and have a high GPA, but my grades *could* only be what they are because my classes are probably easier than those taught in a traditional school.  I’ve had one job that I kept for barely 3 months last summer as a hostess in an upscale restaurant so I made good tips but I quit once my classes started again and because it was a super shitty work environment and management was ripping off their employees of a percentage of their income.  I managed to save up 3.5k in a joint bank account that I have with my mom (which, I know, I need to get my own.  I just haven’t had the time recently.) but my money is going fast because I’ve had to start paying for my own car insurance and gas recently, as well as my dogs’ expenses and other general costs of living.  So, I need to get a job. But I can’t get a job because I can’t leave my dog alone, and my parents won’t watch him anymore than they already do.  I also have issues with my mental health and productivity/motivation, which makes me very inconsistent when it comes to my ability to function properly.  This brings me to probably the hardest decision I’ve had to make in my life, which is whether or not I should rehome my dog.

The way I currently see things could go, is:

A).  I keep my dog, rely on the help of my mother longer,  try to go to community college, spend all of my savings. (There’s a good chance she might kick me out if we get into any conflicts, though, as she’s already threatened it multiple times)

B).  Rehome my dog,  get a job, move out of my mothers house and move in with a couple of my friends, go to community college, and basically start a new independent life away from my mother. (I’ve never been a very independent person, so this honestly scares me a bit)

C).  Try to move out with my dog and force him to be alone so that I can get a job and go to college, (this would by far be the most difficult option because of the extra expenses and my dog’s separation anxiety as well as being independent, and it will definitely be difficult for my dog to adjust as well.)

Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this, sorry it’s so long and definitely more personal than it had to be.  I’m not looking for one specific answer, especially since I don’t really have one specific question, so any input at all would be appreciated :)",27Nov2019,1

394,"My (F21) roommate (F21) just so happens to also be my best friend. Now we've been hit hard with a few bills, I've been paying my share along with her share for while now, only because i owed her money but its been paid off. 

My financial situation isnt the best, i earn about $300 a week, that pay literally goes to rent and my car payment, i don't have money to put fuel in my car to get to work or even put food in my stomach, let alone pay the bills, but I made it work. My roommate on the other hand makes no less that $600 a week (thats a bad week for her) but after whatever she needs to pay, she still has money to buy makeup, clothes, buy alcohol, get her nails done, get a puppy etc. Now i don't care what she spends her money on, her choice. I only care when I've told her about our bills and she needs to pay her share and she says that she doesnt have any money but she can go around and just give money away for no good reason whilst I have to pull money out of my ass just to pay not only my other bills but her share as well. Its left me with nothing at the end of week to the point that im crying to my mum to give me a pack of noodles for the week.

395,"So I (18F) work with a man, let’s call him Dave (17M). 

We each get a base rate of $650 a month as we are both apprentices. The rule sued to be, the longer you stayed ther, the bigger bonus you got. He has been there a year, I have been there 6 months. 

So obviously, I get $100 bonus, he gets $200. 

However, they have just started a new scheme where at all times we have to put our jobs into an online spreadsheet - because they are going to start doing bonuses based on our workload. 

Now Dave is heavily favourited by the bosses in my opinion - they think he is an innocent boy due to his age. This doesn’t bother me. 

Now I had a sick day this month where I got sent home, so they took $30 ( a days wage) off my payslip, as well as an unpaid holiday ( another $30) Now naturally I should be getting $690, right?

Wrong..I earned $590. 

For some reason they revoked my bonus, I have no idea why. 

I presumed it could’ve been to do with my workload, but I remember Dave telling me that the boss was really happy with my work this month. 

When I asked Dave, he said he got his usual $850 ($200 bonus) 

I am very confused. For starters, he has kept failing to update his spreadsheet, so it looks as though he hasn’t done nearly as much work as me. Furthermore, why would mine be taken and not his. All I can think is that because I had a sick day they have taken it off me.

400,"I went on a walk with my old brother and we got talking about politics. It eventually evolved into a talk about his hate speech.


So, in the past he's done many things. Once, on my twelve birthday, he put a sign on his door saying how Muslims should all be killed, and that they're all terrorists. (I was having a party), and he got irrationally angry when I tore it down.


When I got a Muslim girlfriend the year after, he made quite a few racist remarks that I can't fully recall, other than one about how he called her a terrorist. (She wasn't present at the time)


He told me that, regarding the sign, ""all"" meant ""only the extremists"". And that him calling my girlfriend, a girl who was terrified of being harmed for her religion, something so disgustingly awful was a ""joke"".


He says that it's ""dark humour"".  And, yes, if you're trapped in a burning building, crack all the jokes you want about it, if you're able to talk to the people inside the building, make jokes with them, but don't sit watching them burn, whilst making ""jokes"" about how the innocent people inside deserve it. Because that isn't humour, it's just cruel. 


He doesn't understand that, though. 


I'm transgender. I tried to put it into perspective for him by asking him if the people that say ""all transgender people should be locked up"" ""I'll kill any transgender people I see"" are just joking. His response? ""Well they might be"". 


No, the only people who find things like that funny are the people who agree with it. It's different when you're saying that stuff to mock the people who believe such a thing, but saying it as a statement isn't a joke.


I've told him this, and he just says that ""that's your opinion though."" It isn't though, what he says fits the definition of hate speech, and he thinks hate speech can be funny.

I don't stay home often, exercise daily, always am the kindest person in all my interactions through work and outside of it. The past 3 years I slowly watched people drift away (such is life) and have made new ones that have come and gone as well. I suppose my main point is that I am not sure that people don't want to be friends with me since I don't speak with my family whatsoever based upon how dysfunctional they are and I mean very disfunctional since almost everyone is in jail and I refuse to follow their path. I'm told often family is all you have and I've tried to change my family's mindset even my step parents, but it's brushed off. Friends have just out of the blue walked out on me with no reason why.. I've tried to ask over the years and to no avail. I would love to know why, but I suppose that's just what happens. To be honest I've been very alone for a long while and not seeking any form of pity either, but I guess my question is what can I do? I don't want to get medication for depression because I really hate the thought of taking pills that change your mindset. I really want friends, but I've literally had the worst the capability of building relationships with people no matter how hard I try. I have a great position at my work and deal with different people every single day and I love making people smile and learn about their lives and where they want to go next. Should I keep trying harder to fight for these incomprehensible relationships in my family? Try to meet new people every day and be turned away? I won't lie, I never have an issue with girls, but that doesn't matter to me anymore since it's always temporary happiness. I'm getting to a very gradual slope that is starting to seem down hill. I'm not trying to ask too much I hope for friends here, but companionship means a lot to me since my family is a load of degenerates.

404,"Hello reddit,
It’s 5:30 am and I cannot go to sleep because i’m rolling around in bed, kept up by this. I tried googling similar situations but did not find anything as extreme as this case.

Basically: 
I’m in love with a man who’s not allowed to go outside. We were in a long distance relationship for years, so most of our relationship was online either way. We broke up because the relationship became unsustainable in my eyes: I had gone to visit him and his family twice, all costs out of my own pocket (flight tickets, food for the both of us) I did it out of love and have no regrets. However, it didn’t seem plausible that he’d be able to return the notion and come meet MY family, biggest reason being that he cannot leave his home.

His mother is very overprotective, paranoid and his only parent due to grim circumstance. She isolates him, not allowing him to even take a bike ride outside anymore. She ostracizes him for not having a job and contributing financially, yet she keeps him locked up (How is he supposed to find a job without ever leaving his home?) He has not been in school since he graduated high school almost three years ago, despite having completed his FAFSA, having a community college located 10 mins away, and being illegible to receive a full pelt grant which means he’d be paying nothing for his education. Due to this, he has no friends, money, or freedom. His entire world is as big as his house.

I truly don’t understand. As a mother, I would want my child to grow, explore, and make something of himself. I truly don’t understand how she doesn’t see the way he’s hurting him. 
Any time I try to speak about the way his family dynamics are not normal, he gets upset with him. I believe he has some sort of form of stockholm syndrome.

I love this man but see no future with him. Nothing has changed or improved in the many years i’ve known him. He’s able to buy his own alcohol but not go to the store on his own. It’s heart breaking to me not only because I love him so much, but because I see life fleeting before him. He’s a very thoughtful, eloquent, intelligent and poetic man. It hurts me to see his potential be squandered completely by his mother. 

I guess my biggest reason for posting was to share, this eats me up inside. I feel like I can’t say anything. I feel like all i can do is watch someone I love waste his life away from a distance. I don’t know how he will ever start a family this way. I don’t know how he will ever get a career if things don’t change. It’s a nightmare of mine to picture him as a 40 year old mommy’s boy. 

But also... please, someone lend me some advice. I need it. Is this not my business? Is there anything at all that I can do or would my words be fruitless? Is there anyone who’s been in a similar situation who was able to get out of it? 

Thank you.",27Nov2019,1

408,"Hi, so, I'm a 19-years old trans girl from Poland. There's currently a  lot on my head - I study architecture, which is very time and energy  consuming, I work part-time and go through gender dysphoria diagnosis at  the same time. I work to finance my transition - it's very costly, with  no help from the national health services here in Poland. Everything I  do, every doctor i go to I must pay by myself.  
Dysphoria is really kicking my butt these days and I feel bad whenever I look in the mirror.  
My  relationship with my family is also not the best. They don't know  anything about my transition and when I suggest them that I have gender  dysphoria - they immediately change the subject. My studies also get on  my head a lot - I'm late with some projects and my grades are not really  the best.  
I just feel being more and more under the weather  everyday, it started with just some time every day, but it keeps getting  worse. Currently I'm functioning kind-of normally, but I just can't do  anything other than lay in my bed and look on the ceiling when not at  the uni or not in work.  
How can I go back to, um, not being depressed? I really can't allow myself to lose anything right now. I really just want to keep going, do my work, do my uni stuff, be productive and at least not sad all the time..",27Nov2019,1

The coworker also told me about his homophobic views and how he got kicked out for punching a gay guy at his last job.  Thats the last conversation I had with him. The guy has a family and sometimes is laughing over the phone with them so he is not a lonely sociopathic person.

415,"My boyfriend and I have been together 3 years and we’ve been getting really serious. He’s been talking about wanting to get married and buy a house, and I was really excited until recently when I realized I’m only 19 and I’m not ready to be committing to anyone. We’re also long distance, and I’ve been feeling the rosey excitement starting to fade. I just feel like if we do end up making it work, then I’ll have missed out on a lot lf life experiences. We agreed to an open relationship so I would have a chance to explore, but as soon as I started talking to people he decided that he couldn’t do it while we’re long distance, but we could work something out when he moved up next summer. After that and a bunch of other things piling up I ended up cheating on him with my friend which he’s justifiably upset about and wants me to stop talking to him. He really is amazing and if I weren’t feeling a little suffocated, it’d be perfect. Ive never felt so cared for and he’s helped methrough really bad depression. He wants to try couples counseling because he believes we can find a way for me to explore without making him uncomfortable. I just don’t know if I have the energy to put that much work in right now because I’m already taking a break from school next quarter to tackle my depression, part of which will probably include me working on being independent since I’ve relied on him so much. 

Another problem is that I think our biologies are working against us because its really difficult for him to turn me on even if he does exactly what I tell him to. And my friends aren’t helping by telling me i can do better and he’s too controlling and I’m just staying bc it’s comfortable. I kind of wish I’d met him later in life after I already got a chance to be a little wild.

I have pretty bad OCD, and it manifests in intrusive thoughts about my relationship. He has been nothing but supportive since I’ve known him, and he’s learning how to navigate my illness with me. I couldn’t be more appreciative or happy that I’ve found someone so willing to help me.

My issue is that I tend to have my insecure moments often when I’m with him, which can make him uneasy. Why wouldn’t it? He usually is good about helping me in these times but I can’t help but feel like in the long run he will get tired of helping me, or he’ll long for someone normal. I realize this in itself is my OCD, but I have a hard time shutting that part of me off.

I am seeing a therapist and I have an appointment to get on medication within the next week. It’s made me resentful at times. I just wish I could be my best self around him.

So my boss talked to me last Wednesday. This is my first job out of college and one of my batchmates also works here. Anyway, the guy said my progress is slow and that I don't want to do work assigned to me (he said that he HEARD someone saying those kinds of words and adapted those words to say it to my face, thereby taking the side of that other guy). Trust me when I say that I do ALL the work assigned to me. Except this one instance where I thought I have already finished the job but I did not (since I thought that what I was working on was for pages 2-3 but it was for page 2 only, the software that i am using says the work that i am doing is for pages 2-3). Oh, and he also said that all of the other senior guys in the office said that I was not following their instructions. I immediately said that I follow every instruction that they've ordered me to do. But all of my words were not heard, instead, he replied that ""All of that senior guys said you are not following their instructions."" I value my work y'all. I just hate how this guy, who doesn't have a social life, completely blindsided me. Did he? Or am I just sensitive? Advice pls. Thanks.

422,"First of all, I'd like to mention that I met my boyfriend on a game we'd play, and we've been together for about 4 months. What he's doing though is out of character.
In November 16th, he woke up and texted me good morning, his usual texts, with hearts, sweet words, you get the idea. But after that, there was no sign of him at all.
We are both in Romania. We're Romanians, but we don't live in the same place. It takes a 3 hour bus ride for him to get to me, which isn't a huge distance, it's a relationship we both agreed to, and we promised we'd fight so we can move out and live together. He's visited me a few times (I'm kind of poor, so I couldn't plan to visit him, plus my father is very strict and abusive towards me when it comes to ""boys"". He gets violent when boys are mentioned, so I avoid the subject at all cost) Both of us have had a hard past, and we helped each other get over depression, anxiety, and just everything that was wrong before.
At first I panicked, I sent him A LOT of messages, called him for around 50 times, but there was no answer. I checked the game we'd play together, he wasn't there either. The profile pic he had on Discord with us was unchanged, his profile pic on WhatsApp didn't change, and he didn't block my number. Yesterday though, he changed his password on an old email account that we were both logged on (I got the notification of the password being changed), and he unfriended me and our common friends from his friends list,but just on the game. Any other social media he's had was intact. And I've noticed that someone-presumably him-has been playing the game (you can enter his ID in a search bar and see his win rate, which changed, so he's obviously been playing the game), but he wouldn't reply to anyone. I can't find his parents on Facebook, and I don't know their phone numbers. What should I do? He doesn't answer phone calls, but neither does he block my number, although I kind of spam him with messages. He doesn't even tell me to leave him alone, there's no sign of him at all, and not only am I worried, but I'm also heartbroken...
Does he hate me? Does any of this make any sense? If he wanted to break up, he would have told me, or blocked my number, right? I don't know what to make of this, and although I spoke to my friends, stayed up night after night to figure this out, we can't put those things together. Maybe you guys could help me.

438,"I (32F) have a pretty shitty relationship with all my family because of an abusive upbringing. 
I got pregnant 2 years ago &amp; decided to cut contact with them because they're all pretty unhealthy &amp; toxic &amp; whilst I could tolerate it for myself, I wasn't going to let them infect my kid. I have birth. Five months later my brother (36M) suffered a cardiac arrest, died, was resuscitated but now has an acquired brain injury where he can't make new memories. Its basically like Drew Barrymore in 50 First Dates except like, he can probably only remember things for a few hours, if at all.

I took on the responsibility of being his power of attorney. I pay his bills &amp; make sure his money is where it needs to be. 

There are problems occurring recently. He usually gets $40 per day spending money on his debit card. But lately he is calling up because he's been out to lunch or got a massage &amp; needs the money to pay for it. So, for services already rendered, I can't exactly say ""No, you've gone over your daily allowance."" because that's make him a thief if he didn't pay. So he is chewing into his savings. 

I don't want to be responsible for him killing his savings. I am getting no help from family or from his support workers. Usually because he tells his support workers to F--- off because he doesn't think he needs them because he doesn't think he has a disability because he can't remember it. The support workers can't physically stop him from leaving them. He also goes to the bar and spends his food money on beer some days. It's a mess. All of his family, including myself, live in a different state. The family won't accept the idea that he should be closer to relatives to help him with this sort of stuff, so they've enabled him to live in a different state.

Anyhow, I'm pregnant again. I'll have 2 kids under 2 years old. I spend probably 10 hours a week minimum sorting this crap for my brother. It is very stressful speaking to him daily &amp; explaining things over, having to be the bad guy &amp; having to deal with my asshole family in general. 

I do it because I feel like I am helping him. If he had a public trustee appointed they would not be as available to him &amp; would make life a fair bit harder. But it is taking a toll, I am feeling a level of ""carer burn out"" from being pregnant, looking after a toddler &amp; doing all this stuff for my brother. I don't want it to impact my new family &amp; I guess it already does because I can't always focus all my attention on my toddler because of this. So days I feel quite depressed about it. I guess I am mourning the loss of the old version of my brother &amp; trying to adjust to the new version of my brother, too.

I guess I buy away my guilt by doing this work for him too. Because I feel so horrible for what has happened to him &amp; what his life is going to look like now. Because I have since found out how sad &amp; depressed &amp; lonely he was in his life. If I don't at least do this for him, what else can I offer to do from another state? 

Do I suck it up and try to keep helping him or do I put my babies &amp; my partner first &amp; give up the POA gig?

So while I’m doing a 3 person job, Sh made some comment about me “lacking relationships skills”since currently I am not meeting with a few people I am eventually supposed to be leading even though no one has time for this right now. Now I report to someone she reports to X, and that person has no such comment on my performance. X is also very aware we currently aren’t meeting as I recently informed her. Sh also made some comment on what I’m wearing and after I double checked with HR it wasn’t really an issue (in fact HR saw me that day too - I changed into a work shirt I got from them after it was too hot). 

So at this point the whole conversation really soured my mood of the company where I just started working  and im not sure if I should make an hr inquiry about it or just shut up for now? 

1) is it appropriate for someone I don’t even report to, who is not HR to comment on my clothing - to me this seemed like a power move. She has multiple years at this place and I’m a few months old here. I think she is irked that I don’t report to her and that she and I have X in our command who directly reports to the CEO.

2) should I make a comment to HR that this made me uncomfortable and clarify if I report to her and if she (as a non HR) person is supposed to be commenting on my clothes? Or is this an unnecessary stink 

3) I’m pretty annoyed and already feel a bit like the company landed a goldmine with me but yet doesn’t compensate me enough even though I love working there for other reasons. This added on top REALLY soured my mood though and I know the company values me. Can I leverage this somehow to put distance between me and Sh and putting her in a  tough spot for challenging me like that? While we do different things and she is senior to me, I think the idea is that we are not in any hierarchical relationship in the company which I get the impression bothered her.",27Nov2019,1

448,"My husband of 21 years work this text to me this morning after I left the house.  We have been bickering/fighting off and on for the last year or so.  Lots of transitions happening in our life lately and we are under a lot of stress.  Historically, he’s been very forgetful when it comes to events, activities, commitments, etc, especially when they don’t specifically involve him.  I get it, not everyone is on top of things so I’m the past I’ve had family calendars and such but he doesn’t reference them.  At times, he has said I didn’t tell him or he doesn’t know what I’m talking about.  We’ve even had major “discussions” about it. So much so, that now I often state, “I told you xyz during zyx,” or something of the sort. Well, I guess he finally had enough this morning and sent me this via text...

“Ya know, I don’t know what you hope to accomplish every time you throw in a “don’t you remember... I told you xyz...!” Really. Perhaps I am making small talk. Perhaps I knew of the event, but not the exact time. Perhaps I did forget amongst the flow of a busy life. But I don’t need to be treated like I am some geriatric, in a bitter, passive aggressive way. 

Have a wonderful day”

I tend to be more emotional, defensive and/or reactive when we start discussing things.  I would really like to respond to his message in a calm and collected “adult” way.  I’ve thought of just ignoring it but that seems childish or passive aggressive as well. It’s been about five hours and keeps coming back to the forefront of my mind.  

Any suggestions?",27Nov2019,1
449,"I’m in college right now, first semester just ended. I recently spent my birthday alone and got myself through exams with disappointing grades despite trying my hardest (I want to get into medicine). I’ve always identified as somewhat high-achieving but now I feel really disheartened about my abilities.

I have no friends, the only people I talk to are my parents. I do know people to hang out with in college but I don’t feel connected to them at all. They’re more like acquaintances, there’s no one I can talk to on a regular basis.

It’s been hard because I’m being haunted by the people I once knew, like the friends in high school who I cut off due to my depression. I miss them and took them for granted. It really hit home when none of them remembered my birthday this year. I also hurt a few people because I was narcissistic and apathetic and didn’t know how to treat them, they hate me and blocked me. 

I feel like I’m become so cynical and treated people like shit and only recently I’ve realised how narcissistic I acted. I never had bad intentions, I was just so selfish and only cared about myself. Even when I tried to apologise none of them want to speak to me again. I’m haunted by guilt and I feel worthless and unwanted. I’ve never had a good friend that lasted more than a year.

Every day is miserable and aimless. I have goals but I’m mentally drained from the second I wake up. I try to exercise and eat healthy. I have permanent bags under my eyes and my eyes always feel like it’s about to close. I have no friends. I had always enjoyed solitude but now I feel like I’m going crazy from being alone all the time.

I no longer enjoy anything. I enjoyed studying and learning but I swear I’m triggered now from thinking about my terrible grades. The least boring thing is watching Netflix and even that bores me to death. I mostly spend the day scrolling Reddit or contemplating suicide. I have no energy to do anything. I feel like I’m aging prematurely.

I thought about therapy but it has never helped me. I know how to think positive and make positive changes. But therapy can’t get me what I want. It can’t help me get my friends back or make new ones. It can’t help me feel wanted. It can’t give me a reason to feel alive. It can’t give back the things I lost. It can’t make me happy.

451,"I work at the back office department of a kinda big airline in my country, recently (last week) I was told I was expected to take a flight on my day off to another city that also has a base from our airline. I said I didn't really want to go, when I was first hired I wrote down that I was unable to travel, mostly because I'm a college student, but also because I have a pretty severe panic disorder related to planes and flying.



Well, I was told I had no choice and that it was some kind of 'excellent opportunity to get more training' and such. I didn't hear any of it again until today, when I got a confirmation email of said flight for my day off, both flights (going there and coming back) are on the same day and I'm expected to show up at work the day after.


I also learned that I'm not getting paid for this day since 'they are already paying for my flight', while I'm expected to cover my food and transportation at the place.

456,"So there’s this woman in my college class. She’s very loud and confident, constantly joking around. I on the other hand am the complete opposite. I suffer from anxiety so am very quiet and tend to just keep my head down and keep myself to myself. I do try talk to my classmates but I’m not the best with conversations due to my anxiety. 

This woman seems to have sensed that I’m a bit shy and has started trying to make more effort with me. At first I thought she was nice. She’d always make the effort to ask me to sit with her and a few others, always ask me how I’m doing etc but recently I’ve began to feel really uncomfortable around her. She makes really inappropriate comments/jokes around me (and others). Talks about her ‘massive tits’ in front of the whole class about how she’s ‘dying for a shag’. She’s constantly hanging all over me calling me ‘honey’ and ‘sweetheart’ all the time. Other people in the class are beginning to look uncomfortable with her comments as well. It’s becoming a bit much. She done it again yesterday in front of me and this other boy, the minute she made the comment she quickly looked at my face to see how I’d react and found it hilarious because i looked embarrassed. Afterwards I overheard her saying to the boy she’s only trying to make me laugh because I’m so quiet all of the time. 

I do believe that she’s only trying to be nice and make me feel more included with everyone else but I feel extremely uncomfortable around her now. I hate confrontation but I really would like her to stop with the constant inappropriate comments around me. If she can see I’m not comfortable with it then why is she now intentionally doing it 24/7 around me? How do I confront her about this? I’ve got a feeling she’ll just laugh it off and continue it.",27Nov2019,1
457,"Hi! A little backstory here, I (19F), am attending my state university, but due to me living overseas for a short period of time, I have to prove that I am a resident of my state to qualify for reduced, instate tuition.

I do not live with my parents, and havent since I was 16 (for various reasons). I have mostly been living with relatives that were willing to let me stay with them for miscellaneous chores and help with their kids.

 Now that I am off to college, my school's financial aid office has told me that my personal income is not sufficient to declare myself independent, which would allow me to be classified as a resident based off of my job, license, instate hs diploma, etc. They told me the best bet would be to base my residency off of my father (only living parent), because he has maintained his ties as a permanent resident of our state, even when we were living overseas. 

I told my dad this, and sent him the paperwork to go along with it. Its not that bad, only two pages of basic questions, and some additional documentation along the lines of copies of driver's license, state car title, tax forms, and bank transactions in the state, stuff that I know my dad has on hand already and can print out. I told him all of this as soon as I found out, and he's had well over a month to complete this, but it's a week before the end of the semester (deadline for submission) and he hasnt done any of it.

My counselor told me I could drop all of my classes at the last minute, which would erase the largest portion of my debt, but all the work I've done to this point would be for nothing. And this would not erase my housing payment, 3000$ that I cant possibly come up with in the week that it is due. 

I have tried explaining to him how important this is but everytime I ask for an update on it he leaves me on seen or says that ""hes working on it"". He claims to be too busy with work for it, but I know that he just transitioned jobs and he took 2 weeks of his accrued pto and sat around his house doing nothing.

463,"Gonna turn 20 in a month or so, and I have no idea what to do for my birthday. Over the years, I've been convinced that my birthday is cursed. Something always goes wrong one way or another - when I was younger I used get really, really sick every year (up until age 12/13) and as I got older, plans would crumble, the limited friends I had as an introvert wouldn't show/couldn't make it, unwanted drama etc.

Example: My 18th (and worst) birthday

* Random family friends decided to invite themselves over for the holiday season because why not
* One of the relatives (such a fucking pain in the ass) had the same birthday as me and was adamant on cutting the cake together and being birthday buds despite meeting her 3 days ago
* Day of and I'm getting ready to go out for a birthday lunch with my friends. The plan was to quickly cut the cake and snap a few pics before I left, I ended up leaving an hour and half late because this woman took FOREVER to get ready despite knowing I was pushed for time
* When I finally run out of the house, I call them again to let them know I'm on my way (I was keeping them updated with the situation the entire time) only to find out they left and went home. In any other situation, I understand that being an hour and half late is ridiculous but I had on multiple occasions waited a similar amount time for this friend to show up when we doing mundane stuff like shopping together. So when I heard they left, I was heartbroken and unbelievably upset.
* I finally ended up going to the shopping mall, got a massive Starbucks and did some birthday shopping for my mum and went home after the guests left on the same day. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in the process of accepting that I can't celebrate my birthday anymore, at not on the day in the traditional sense, but I don't want to waste it at home just like any another day surrounding holiday season.

One of the girls we'll call Peach offered to take an Uber from the other girl's house to save me drive time because I live further away from everyone else that went. I thanked her and didn't think of it anymore. On the way back, we stopped at McDonald's and I joked that if Peach wanted to get home faster she could take an Uber from McDonald's and she did. At the time I didn't know the area was dangerous because I had honestly never been there up until that point and she took the Uber. She never messaged anyone in the group when she got home. We all met working the same position at a big box retail store, btw. 

She has currently talked to everyone in the group but me even though I apologized twice when it was a genuine mistake and most of my close friends not involved are on my side. I'm slowly being kicked out of the friend group that I used to be part of. It used to be us 4 girls and now the other 3 are all buddy buddy with each other, which I knew would happen (they're all Latina and grew up inner city while I'm white and grew up in the suburbs - they regularly shame me for my privileges as if I can help it) eventually but that doesn't stop it from hurting. Anyway, we're all in the same secret Santa and I told one of the friends in the group that I don't want to go if Peach won't be talking to me because it's awkward. And half of me really means it. But the other half doesn't want to give her the satisfaction of thinking she won and I'm submitting to her, because I'm not. I told a friend ""I think she's being a little dramatic at this point"" and I didn't get an answer of course because somehow everyone in that group is on Peach's side.

When I was about 10 years old, her bad decisions led to us losing the house which led to us moving into a trailer park. My brother and sister (both older) left around that time, so that it was just me and my mother. It’s hard for a young boy to have privacy at that age when you are in a small trailer. So a couple years of that and she ends up fighting, yes fighting, my sister. After this I went to live with my dad. I would go back and visit her, but I’ve noticed lately that whenever I come over then she just bad mouths my siblings. She tries to manipulate and turn me against my brother.

Now that I'm here, I feel like I just seem to be failing at everything. The formal training we get is only IT related, there is nothing on dealing with clients/business/writing or any of the actual legal skills we need.

And he just throws his stupid little fits in front of them without any regard for how they’ll be effected. My sister has shown signs of similar aggression and I’m convinced it’s *learned* behavior. 

I have a primary example of how ridiculous his outbursts are. One happened this morning not twenty minutes ago. My brother was getting ready to go to school—needs a bit of help since he’s only 6. My stepdad was getting him dressed and couldn’t find socks. He searches and gets rapidly frustrated when he can’t find any. Instead of asking for help, he gets angry. He stomps around the house at 8:30 in the morning and has the audacity to yell at my mother when she tries to help. Then when he finally gets some socks, he yells at my *autistic* brother when he won’t stay still. Why my mother wasn’t more curious, I’ll never understand.

This isn’t okay. It’s definitely *not* okay. I don’t want my siblings to grow up with the same problems I have that were born from this environment. But I don’t know what to do. Calling in CPS seems way too far, so I don’t think that’s a viable option. I don’t think my mother will ever leave him or put him in his place either. And I can’t take my siblings as I’m just 22 and my mental health can’t deal with two young kids. I’m moving out this summer to finally get away from this toxic environment, but god... I fear for my brother and sister. What should I do? What *can* I do?",27Nov2019,1

490,"So for some context I am a 21 yr old guy and I am commonly told that I look older than I am. I recently joined a game store, so I have don't have many friends there. This is also a bit of a two parter. 

There's this girl there that is younger but i suck at pinning down ages and i think she's between 16 and 19. Shes a very sweet and kind person. But I've noticed that she makes an effort to always be near me. Lights up whenever she sees me, laughs and talks more when speaking to me. My gut tells me that she has feelings for me. Do you think I'm correct in this assumption? I don't really want a relationship right now because of other personal stuff. However I do think she would be an incredible friend because she's a really cool person. So the second part is how do I ask for her number without coming off as a creep to everyone else or her if I'm wrong and she doesn't like me?",27Nov2019,1
491,"I really don't know what to do. At first she seemed pretty nice but she is very, very annoying and also very dumb. There was no nice way to say that, she just is. I tried everything for her to leave me alone, ignore her, be rude (not bullying or making her purposefully sad) and nothing works. You would think that if someone was trying to talk to you as little as possible and avoid you at all costs you would stop talking to them. one time I made her pretty upset though (the reason she got upset is because I told her I liked being with my best friend of 7 years more then being with her, who I had known for 2 months), I felt bad and apologized but she ignored me and she looked sad. I felt bad for making her sad of course, but at the same time i was happy because at least she was going to leave me alone, right? WRONG. She still follows me everyday and she does this because no one else likes her and she smells AWFUL. I genuinely don't know what to do, I gave up and just started to be nice to her because being rude just doesn't do anything, she cannot catch hint to save her life. Also before you think that I'm just a bitch and that she's nice, I'll list one of the many, many annoying things she did

\-blame me for something she did

\-complained about her MAID for moving a few things in a cabinet

\-grabbed me for no reason and started laughing, making me bump into kids in the hallway who got angry at me.

\-I had to make an assignment with her and my friend, she constantly whined about not being to find anything even though when i typed in the exact same thing into google that she did i found the answer immediately. During said assignment she started playing tetris on the computer.

\-she always talks on and on with no pause, about things nobody cares about to people she barely knows

\-got mad at me for calling her out for interrupting my friend while she was talking

\-hates four girls in my class who are very friendly for no reason

\-dated a boy who is so disrespectful to the teachers that he's going to be suspended

\-said that she wanted anorexia so she could be skinny, and when I tried to explain to her you could die from it she said ""well then I would just start eating again""

\-got mad at me and my friend because we wanted to make a project with just each other and said we ""always exclude her""

\-when a friend of my friend(sorry if this is getting confusing) says hi to my friend in the hallway, the annoying girl always says ""and I'm here too"" in a sarcastic tone

and those were a few examples.

I don't know what to do and also don't want to be stuck with her for my last 2 years of high school.

Bf had a friend in elementary school, she is now in a bad way (drugs, bad bf etc). She hasn’t spoken to my boyfriend in years (like since they were 14 and we are now 21).

Of course he didn’t send it or even respond to the message, but it still bothers me. Should I message her and tell her how uncool that is, or is it not worth my time?

Anyway I didn't want a relationship just for the sake of having one, I genuinely wanted to have a special bond with someone before I was thrown into the real world. I feel like I missed that.

I have recently familiarized myself with the information out there on the importance of sleep on health and overall well-being, and  realizing now that my mother hasn't had a quality night's sleep in probably 40 years, I'm becoming very worried for her. She has a litany of health problems, all of which could be tied back to her severe sleep apnea:

\-Obesity

\-High blood pressure

\-Frequent migraines

\-Dizzy spells

\-Memory loss

Basically, I'm convinced that if she got a CPAP machine, her life would improve markedly and in rapid time. But she's not into it. 

She refuses to see a doctor, and thinks that I'm insane to think that her sleep issues would cause her any harm. She thinks this allegedly because she's had sleep apnea since she was 10 years old. She also hates doctors so I think some anxiety is also contributing her refusal to seek help. My siblings don't seem to care, and would prefer to not address the issue than push her to see a doctor.

498,"So when I was 12 I started to have this weird thing where I view some completely normal things like school and some people as contaminated. They might be great people but I cant physically touch them. 
Some items I view as good like my bed and the notebooks on my desk. For example, I cannot touch my home notebooks with my school (contaminated) clothes because of I do, I have to rub the notebook on something like my home clothes or my bedsheets. If I don't, I will slowly begin to hate that notebook and will throw it away just because I touched it for 2 seconds with my school clothes. I have 2 different types of clothes, my home clothes (good) and my school clothes (bad). If I accidentally make contact with a person I feel is contaminated, I will rub my hand on my clothes until it is red. For example, I find one of my friends disgusting if I make skin to skin contact with her (If she makes contact with my items, it is bad too) but my other friend can touch my stuff all she wants and I can relax around her. Some things are completely normal like some chairs etc. I can touch those with both good and bad items.
It is very annoying to have to be cautious every day out of the fear that I might touch something contaminated. It is also affecting my friendships because they feel bad because I think they are disgusting to touch and I feel bad because I am making them feel bad. Is there any possible reason that could have caused that? Should I go to a therapist? Also, is there a name for it? I would like to read about it.

TL;DR: I view some things as good (pure) and some things as bad (contaminated) and I cant let a good and bad thing touch each other. It has affected my relationships.",27Nov2019,1
499,"Hey guys.

Xmas coming up soon, and recently my grandparents and parents have been very into family tree research. It’s all been manual so far, using old records and so on, and they’ve got a decent tree going up until now.

I recently saw the ancestry DNA test kits, which are apparently great for family trees, as they can find lost relatives and give new info about family history. 

As much as I’d love to be able to afford a DNA test kit for my grandparents and parents individually, I’m a poor university student, and the tests are quite pricey, so I could only really afford one at most.

Then I had the bright idea of getting one and doing it myself, as this would encompass all my family’s history in one test. I’m not particularly interested in all of that, but my parents and grandparents would certainly be, and I’d give them the results.

Some further info, I’m an only child, and the youngest current member of my family out of all my cousins, on both my mum and dad’s side. So I’d really be starting at the bottom. 

My dilemma is that I’m 99.9% certain my parents and grandparents have never heard of these testing kits, and I don’t want to spend a lot on one (as they are pricey for me) just to have them think it’s really a gift for me, when it’s really not.

We live in a heavily wooded area and part of his offering is to clean leaves during Fall. This is the first year we've had anyone do leaf removal for us and I told him he can blow leaves into the forest to compost since that's we usually did in the past with rakes. We put new grass seed down and didn't want to risk agitating the new grass seedlings so we asked him to blow the leaves. 

Instead this guy blows half the leaves into the forest like we asked and the other half he pitches over the fence into the neighbors yard. Keep in mind, just over the fence is another wooded area that is clearly visible from the neighbor's window and they blow their leaves into this smaller area. Now the leaf pile for them is outrageously higher than normal because of our massive amount of leaves. When I confronted our guy he said ""It'll be fine, they won't notice, besides you think they'll something?""

Without giving out too much info, there is a high level individual who is constantly harping on everyone about being at the office and calling you out if you work at home.  I get that you want to make sure people do their work, but everyone in the company does truly work hard.

My issue is that this specific person is never in the office.  If they do show up, they stroll in at 10:00 am and leave around 2.  They are constantly ""working"" from home but we all know they are actually traveling with family.  One notable incident was that they went to a work seminar for a week last year.  The seminar itself was actually only 1 or 2 days and they spent the rest of the week visiting family yet claimed they were working.  I know this because other high level people have mentioned this.  Another thing is this individual is having their underlings spy on other departments to see if people are in the office.  This is causing a huge moral issue where I work and I know other high level employees are disgusted with the toxic environment it is creating.  We wouldn't care if this person actually showed up and was like this, but the hypocrisy is ridiculous.

517," 

i don't know when it started but I remember I used to interact with them fine at first, I chased cats and kittens till I was 11, when I was 5 I threw a cat by its tail because I saw it was sitting still and I had never seen a cat that still. I tried to kick a cat one day, other that that I just used to chase them around with broomsticks until they hid in places or got under cars which I would get under and I'd try to chase them again. I don't remember when I did this but I might be 10 when I once was able to grab a cat, I put it in a cage since I had caught it. When I was maybe 7 or 8, there was my brother's cat, I took it put it in tent and shook it around.

I stopped chasing them when my grandma told me to be friends with them instead, one cat had kittens and I was good to them at first but then they grew up a little and just ignored because they weren't used to humans, I also started chasing them around, until one day I tried to be friends with them again but I only made friends with one and was mean to the other one, that cat had kittens and I took great care of one but I also wasn't fair to the other, he would give love bites ut I would give him a little tap on his head because I tough he was trying to bite and sometimes I used to sneak him in to sleep with me and cuddle with me, so once I was annoying him and kept picking him up, he growled at me then, so I put him in a box with a hole where he couldn't get out as punishment, he started growling even louder and got angry and tried to scratch so I chased him until he went outside the house, he's still with me and cuddles with me to this day.

This is when I was around 15

The cats were also dependant on us since they grew up in our garden and I only went outside ocascinally to play with them, pet them and would just give them some milk since we didn't have much meat or any catfood, once I beged for catfood but got lazy and wouldn't give it sometimes, as a result my cats were usually were pretty thin and we only gave our leftovers at night, my family went on a trip one day, I wasn't concerned aout the cats since they were given some food at night and they're cats right?, when I came home I was really exhausted and just pet the cat and went in, later we found our cat dead, I think it's because she wasn't taken good care of and didn't get enough food , her cousin came and gave kittens here and I try to take the best care of them as i can.

I also had a parrot, I loved him but when I was under stress his noise got to me and I shook his cage and told him to shut up and I thought this was normal because I saw lots of people sout or lash out when stressed

5 years ago a girl had a crush on me and now she’s messaged me on Facebook (I don’t have a pic of me on there) and I’m scared she won’t like me anymore",27Nov2019,1
522,"I may sound vague at times, but that is because I am trying to protect identities. 

I was in a month long relationship with someone from earlier this year and we mutually agreed to end the relationship (not for anything we did to each other, but because of timing). We decided to remain friends afterwards and I even cat-sitted her esa for a weekend. At the end of this weekend, I was blocked from a private social media account and was left wondering why. 

I decided to try and forget about it along with the person up until later that week, when I actually felt I was acting cold towards them. I greeted them via another social media app (this app was our main app for communication and all still seemed well). She then proceeded to tell me about something that happened early in the relationship and asked for space which led me to me feeling so guilty that I participated in self harm and was admitted into the hospital. 

While in the hospital, I felt extremely guilty, but that guilt mixed with fear after a while because I felt rumors were starting. I ended up contacting this person again while in the hospital to apologize and ask about the situation that drove me over the edge. I was told that what I did was mainly a trigger and that I was not meant to feel guilty. 

I was discharged from the hospital soon after and stayed quite isolated for tge next few days. Later that week, I decided to speak with them again, but this time was different. A friend accompanied them, they asked to record the conversation, and I was in complete shock. 

The conversation put me in shock about how this person felt, but it also confirmed my worst suspicions at the time: that I was being painted as a villian to everyone we mutually knew.  This person then said that either I need to leave or they need to leave due to anxiety and fear of me. They also said they reported the event up the chain of command. 

I decided to physically leave the area, which has put my school work, and financial progress at a complete halt. 

However, I have spoken with a therapist and described the situation. Their suggestion was that the individual I am dealing with may have bipolar personality disorder. 

That got me thinking about a few events and things this person said:

Right now he is in a non-stopping seizures basically, eyes seem dead and he continuously keeps moving random body parts, cant eat , drink or even meow.

My father doesn't want me to kill him as he hopes that he would get better,  but my feeling after seeing him in a nonstop 2 days seizure is that we are just letting the little guy suffer in agony, my instinct right now would be to just get the gun and end it...So what should I do?",27Nov2019,1

Hi Redditers,

I am a contractor working at a customer’s site. I am after a means to transfer files from my Linux system to their Windows 10 computer I use on their network, (and in the other direction). I use memory sticks at the moment, but these are unreliable and a hassle. I am wondering if there is a way to use something like USB hub (with a memory stick plugged into that), thinking that I could transfer files to the stick, then read them off with the other PC. However I want to avoid any risk of linking my Linux to their Network. Also I can’t install any software on the Windows PC. Files vary in size from a few kb png to a say 30MB. Don't want to use Dropbox etc, for speed.

Any suggestions please? Thank you.",27Nov2019,1

We have a small border collie mix and they have become best friends, no problems using his litter box, he uses his scratch toys and home we built him, however he seems to have this weird love for our plants. We have a TON of plants in our house, if I had to guess, probably 50+ plants. We have a few small/medium trees and bushes on the floor of our house that he loves to get in and fling dirt around, he knocks them over almost daily which spills even more dirt, and this is really starting to upset my fiance. He used to knock over our smaller stuff on our shelves and tables but we have since moved stuff around so it's harder for him to get to the smaller stuff. Neither one of us have ever had a cat before so we don't know if this behavior of his with our plants is normal or not. Is there a way we can prevent him from wanting to get into our plant pots and fling dirt around? Or is there a possible explanation for why he's doing this?

561,"Sorry for long post - Context: My girlfriend and I have been dating for over 4 and a half years. We've been through some pretty rough stuff together - her dad passed away from cancer about 2 years ago which (obviously) was difficult and for I personally dealt with/ am still dealing with mental health issues which first started during the time when her dad was in hospital (I was in a car accident where a guy crashed into me and literally ran away from his car \[I'm assuming he was drunk?\],both my grandmothers passed away in the space of 2 weeks \[my one grandfather committed suicide when my mother was little and my paternal grandfather passed away when I was like 8\] and I lost my first dog that I got when I was 10 and we had for 11 years. 

Recently my car was stolen from the university I attend and I bought this car with my own money that I had paid off earlier this year over 2 years (which affected me in a whole other way but not necessary). I recently got a new car which had been in an accident but was repaired well. I have a very very limited knowledge of cars so my dad helped me and we got a mechanic to ""check everything"" and even got the car realigned. Everything seemed perfect and then I go to full up with petrol and ask the petrol attendant to fill my water but he says that there isn't one. Don't even get me started how furious I was that this wasn't picked up by the mechanic nor my dad. My girlfriend gave me a lecture about how I should have taken responsibility for it and that I should know by now that I can't rely on my dad for things anything car-related (I had an issue with my air-conditioning in my previous car that my dad said he'd sort out but didn't do it properly). Now (so far) the car runs fine but this missing water canister resulted in my girlfriend to ""shout"" at me over WhatsApp and she got very annoyed with me when the petrol attendant said there's no water canister. She kept giving me shit for it and was telling that I ""really need to take initiative"" and that I should know better. She's made me feel absolutely horrible and I'm waiting for my university results to come out on the 29th at midday (basically if I get my degree or not) so I'm already incredibly stressed. I don't know what to do about this. We also had a big argument (probably the biggest one in the past 2 years) about how I'm ""boring"" and that I'm not adventurous. This really hurt me but I can see why she says that and I told her that I will work on it. I really don't know what to do or how to deal with this. I've looked at seeing a psychologist to talk about this stuff but money is tight at home so I'm on a waiting-list for this organisation that provides psychologists (mostly students) for a low rate which kind of reiterates what my girlfriend said about how my dad likes to take the cheap route and makes me even more upset. 

I really do love her. I genuinely don' think that I will find anyone better than her. She helps me get out of m comfort zone and get out the house more. I have friends but she's incredibly adventurous and loves to be out socialising. I was the same for about the first 2 years but ever since the stuff that happened 2 years ago I haven't been as happy in general nor as engaging as I was. I recently revealed to my close friends and her brother that I had suicidal thoughts 2 years ago which I thought was a load off but at the moment I feel just as shit as I did then. I don't even want to think about failing a course and not getting my degree this year. From an academic perspective this year was ridiculously tough but I feel that I literally worked as hard as I could ( I even had a mental breakdown earlier this year the night before an exam which my girlfriend and her mom helped me get over and still managed to pass despite there only being a 33% pass rate and an average of 45%).

I (24F) do not like Christmas. Mostly because I associate Christmas with stress due to my upbringing, but that's not the point. I'm not an asshole who shits on the holiday, or tries to convert people who love it, I just quietly tolerate it. My partner (24M) LOVES Christmas. His whole family does, and in our 7 years together, he and his family made many attempts to convert me before giving in and accepting that it's not my thing. Two years ago, we moved coast to coast (US) and now it's just us. We enjoy our 2-person Christmas so no issue there. But last year my boyfriend went to the trouble of getting he and I a gift from ""Santa."" (Including a letter from Santa that we'd been very good.) This is a tradition from his family to indulge in the ""magic"" of the season. I felt SO guilty that it hadn't occurred to me to do that for him. He did it, and I got the surprise even though I couldn't care less and he's the one that would like to further that spirit. I need advice on whether or not I should do that for him this year.

Tom has been putting his crush into the stories, and writing him kissing her, saving her, etc. His crush does not know about this. My sister told me about several quite upsetting scenes. Those include in-fiction Tom telling his crush (which was my sister's sister in that story) that she was even more beautiful than my sister, in-fiction.  He then wrote that my sister ran away and hid in the toilet. He then had to go into the female bathroom, convince her to come out, and then whispered into her ear, ""both sisters may not be equally beautiful physically, but they are both equally beautiful inside"". He later wrote that my sister giggled. (note that it's also disconcerting how he loves on his crush; he says that it's okay she doesn't love him now, he'll wait for her and that she is the most beautiful person in the world).

\- Tom always pretends he's a superhero and he never breaks character. He pretends to be a spider-esque superhero (similar to spiderman) and often texts my sister about saving the world. Tom also will text her using another persona, ""Joyce"". Some of the things he texts her about include: asking my sister as Joyce to help Tom remember himself because time is about to be reset and Tom would forget everything. Later, my sister told him, and Tom said ""why would I be a superhero? I'm a bad person"". Joyce also has a crush on Tom.

\- Asked my sister to carry a weapon to protect herself. Where we live, said weapon is illegal.

\- Asked my sister to do something (if I'm not wrong, it was to go somewhere). And when she refused, Tom said that it was her fault the world is ending.

And a lot more incidents.

While they do not talk much anymore, Tom recently messaged my sister, saying he did wrong and wanted to make it up to her. Except when my sister mentioned her insecurity, he just said ""ok"". I've talked to my sister, and she said she wasn't comfortable blocking him. She did give me his contact and did say she was okay if I spoke to him. I intend to do it tomorrow. I plan to bring up what he did and how his actions were wrong. I also want to talk to Tom's crush simply because his actions are very disturbing (writing fiction of both of them being together and putting her in compromising positions). I feel that she deserves to know, but my sister is afraid she'll confront Tom, and Tom will be mad at my sister, and honestly I don't know if it's my place to tell her.

Sorry for this long and rambly and probably very confusing post, but is there any advice on what I should say and go about solving this situation?",27Nov2019,1

I’m excited to share the news with them and my adult siblings and thought it could be fun to share on Christmas morning. Maybe with a personalized gift to my parents such as a tiny stocking that says Baby &amp; Last name for next year. I know they will be happy with the news and we have been trying for years. I have two main concerns. First one is that I will be only two months along and I know that is very early to be making any pregnancy announcement. But I am close to them and will plan to tell my parents and siblings before telling most people anyway. Second I am not trying to make Christmas all about me or seem like an attention seeker. But it will be a good opportunity to tell them in person. We talk on the phone often but since we live so far away we only see each other in person maybe once a year or every other year.,27Nov2019,1

The job pays decently, above minimum wage, but it's a very hostile work environment with no cooperation.

She wanted to hang out, I didn't really feel like it but for old times sake I agreed and I hung out with her and her two friends at a bar. She got drunk and awkwardly flirty doing dumb flirty but not very direct stuff (eg leaning on me, saying awkward compliments etc). Her friends were gently wingmanning for her too despite me not reciprocating outside being polite friendly.

Since that day she's asked me to hang out a few times and I told her I'm busy each time, only to have her double text me again and ask if I want to go to X event with her.

I'm not interested in dating her or anything, but I can't say that because she hasn't actually made an overt move on me. I don't really even want to reconnect anymore tbh, we don't have much in common, we have our own friends, and it just felt kind of uncomfortable. But I'm not sure how to weasel out of this friendship or whatever without being a dick.

Do I just keep telling her I'm busy when she asks? I feel bad flat out ignoring.

592,"I'll copy/paste what I wrote in another sub here:

&gt; I was standing in front of my house, waiting for my spouse to come pick me up for dinner when a strange car pulled up on the curb. For a split second, I thought it was my spouse. But instead it was some guy. It was already dark out, so I couldn't make out anything about him, or even the make/model of his car.

&gt; Without saying a word, he opened the door to the car, and scooted toward the passenger side, as if to jump out. I immediately ran towards my neighbor's house out of fear. The car then shut the door, and sped off, turning. I called my spouse, telling them what happened.

&gt; When my spouse pulled up, they told me that he was probably just about to ask for directions. I tell them that it didn't seem that way, seemed like the guy was ready to grab me or something. Spouse says I was making a mountain out of a mole hill, and to just forget about it. I've been wondering if maybe I jumped the gun but it seemed like the guy was going to kidnap me or...something. I don't know. I don't even feel like calling the cops because I can't even give them a description of the suspect or their car since it all happened fast, and it was dark.


Ever since, I've been feeling anxious and afraid. My spouse and both of my parents basically said that I am exaggerating the whole thing, and it was probably a guy who was lost, and needed directions (then why open his car door..?). I feel like they are gaslighting me, and it makes me feel awful. I even got into a huge argument with my spouse over the whole ordeal, and we are not speaking.

Not to mention that I am basically paranoid today, and can't even function properly. I feel like crying all day. I already suffer from depression and anxiety, so this is not good for me.

I tell him to sleep on his side and it works 95% of the time, but then later he rolls on his back again. He is definitely not overweight but has asthma. He will not do a sleep study and I tried buying those strips (I don't know if they're even helpful) but he never tried them. I read about some cheap machine that's supposed to help but I don't even think he'd used it and take it off through the night. He is the lightest sleeper I've ever heard of/seen. Tosses and turns a lot, wakes up when I *whisper* at him to turn over and lay on his slide.

Would a sleep study be the only (best) option? Is it I'll advised to buy a CPAC machine without having tests ran? I don't think he'd even wear it. Also, how do I go about telling him it's that much of a problem to get one done? My sleep in general has always been bad but I have refused to get one done myself. I don't want to sound petty about it. I usually think I shouldn't get over it and suck it up. Not to be a problem.

The reason I left my previous job was so I could work normal weekday hours and have my evenings and weekends free again. I've been missing boxing classes, dance lessons and much needed social time with friends/family and was so happy to get that back in my life.

However, only a month in and they want to change my shifts completely. So instead of the standard 9-5, they want me to do 8am-8pm, 4 days on, 4 days off including on weekends. I'm just really down about this because I'm now going to have to give up all my classes/family time again after just a month of getting into a happy routine.

I've checked my contract and it does say: ""Operational hours of work are between 9am to 5pm Monday to Friday, but there will be a requirement for flexible approach to working arrangements in line with business and department needs which may move to a shift pattern between 8am to 8pm and weekends"".  

So it's not like I can complain they're being unlawful as it IS in the contract, but I just didn't realise it would come into effect so soon. I remember they also mentioned it casually in the interview saying this may happen at some point, but I'm sure they said that I'd be able to choose which shifts were best for me... but now they're telling me the shift change is mandatory.

So I'm wondering what my options are. Should I quit my job so soon and look for something more suitable? Or should I try and convince my bosses to give me a more suitable shift pattern?

My former best friend (22m) and I were inseparable but we stopped talking last year because he refused to admit his mistakes and asked me choose between him and some other friend when he was clearly wrong. That put me in a depression which I recovered from just a couple of months ago. Him and my bf are on talking terms currently, but they were not talking a month or so ago. We were all in the same group in class. My  ex best friend makes a comment that I didn't care about my brother being dead as I wasn't crying in class infront of him and everyone. My bf told me this.

605,"So I [21M] after pretty much a year of thinking, I decided to finally pursue the career I wanted to do truly, when I finished high school and needed to chose a career I got convinced by my family that I needed a career that would bring me a stable life so I chose Computer Science after all I like computers, math and they are one of the best payed graduates currently.

Well the problems started right away, I didn't get admitted the first time I tried to get in, so I had to way a year to try again, at the time I didn't see as much of a big deal, anyway I got in in the try and everything was cool and dandy during the first semester top of the class, pretty enjoyable.

On the second semester is when I started to realize that CS might not be for me, I still had good grades and was enjoying being at school but when I compared myself to how others were enjoying themselves I could see that the level of passion was different, on the third semester stress just kept accumulating and my interest kept decreasing, grades started to drop and depression started to kick in, by the end of it I was in a very deep state of depression (suicidal) and I stared to fail my classes, so I finally decided to drop out, because if I was already failing and had lost almost all interest in what I was doing and things were going to just get harder I didn't see a reason to keep going.

Now, during this time I tried my best to keep myself invested in art, I tried to practice my drawing in break times and tried to put at least some time into it after school, I also was taking violin classes, but at some point the studying and doing my homework started to take all my time, and putting into art made me feel stressed because I knew I should be studying but while I was studying I couldn't really focus and it became the viscous cycle that contributed to my depression. 

Now I've been working for the past year as a low level developer because I needed money and was a job I could at least get with my curriculum, but doing so has made it very hard to get out of my depression, being able to kinda forget about work after I get home and just practice has helped but it's not enough.

I want to go back to school, I want to keep learning art,  but the college I want to get in is on a different city so I would have to move and live on my own (currently living with my mother), the main problem is that I'm kinda done with kinda done with programming for now, but finding a job in a different city outside of my curriculum that would allow me live by myself and go to college is hard.

So we brushed it off and continued to monitor her poops. 

We did this for a couple weeks before finally contacting the vet. 
We took her in and her had dewormed and the vet put her on probiotics for a week and said her stool should change. (She thought maybe being exposed to antibiotics at such a young age because of a small ovary mutation correction surgery caused her gut health to be wacky).

We do the antibiotics and no change, maybe less bloat, and finally have to give her a stool sample.

Results come in and she said they found nothing and she now suspects she was born/has long term Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).

It started a few years ago, when my mother and grandmother were having a fight with my brother. It was a really terrible fight, and left me crying in my room for almost an hour. He punched holes in the walls, screamed in my face, and called both my M and GM bi\*\*\*\*\*. 

Then this happened. In June or July of this year, my brother came over to visit or whatever. note that my brother is serious about basketball and would make me do push-ups and shit. So he made me do 50 when I just woke up at 7AM. I refused, and then my mother told him to leave. But no, no, no, no, no. He decided to grab a knife from the kitchen, and corner mom and yell ""STAB ME! STAB ME NI\*\*\*!"" I ran into the room and was frozen. He then grabbed me and threw me into a wall. I was crying and screaming for him to chill the hell out, but he wouldn't. My mom eventually found an exit and told me to come on. But being the stubborn idiot I was, I ran into my mother's room and didn't lock the door. B came in and harassed me nonstop. Eventually the cops were called.

Enough backstory, please give me advice on what I should do about him.",27Nov2019,1

613,"I'm 4 weeks into changing my life for the better. Cutting back drinking dramatically, eating less and better, and exercising more. 

I just made a first video and it got emotional. Reasons for me making these changes to my life are: my bouts with alcoholism, overeating, inability to move on from bad life events such as breakups, bad news like my dad getting cirrhosis (alcohol--part of the reason for my changes), bad news and set backs in general. 

I've watched quite a few of these on YouTube and they have been very inspirational to me. In a way I feel like I should also share my story along the way, in solidarity with the hopes of helping others. I'm committed, have a good support network going, accountability, and confident I can do it. It being, reaching a 50lb weight loss, and changing my relationship with food and alcohol, and dealing with hardships in a positive way.

The worry I have with making it public is the repercussions it might have on my professional life. The repercussions on my personal life, and relationships, is something I'll have to strongly consider as well, and will def get the advice from some close friends and family before I do that. But, a future employer maybe finding a video about how I'm admitting to having issues with alcoholism, depression, eating disorders, being bipolar... 

How bad could it affect the potential of being hired? Or looked at in a professional sense?

I realize I'm putting the cart before the horse here, but I'm pretty damn confident in the direction I'm heading...",27Nov2019,1

My fiance wants us to stay with his family, but then my parents get mad that we won't stay with them. I already suggested taking turns, but my fiance said he doesn't want to do that.

616,"Hey there, this is a throwaway.

My boyfriend and I started dating in high school and were admitted into the same university. I love it but he hates it here and is strongly considering a transfer. Although it's definitely a bummer that he isn't enjoying himself here, I am in full support of whatever he decides to do and have offered to help him with his transfer application.   
The problem here is that he is often depressed about being at this school and considered me his only close acquaintance. He is well liked by a lot of people and he does have some friends, but he really relies on me socially. I am fine with this, but there are a few problems arising from his dependence on me.

First, there was a halloween event my school put on that I was really looking forward to. He didn't want to go and was disappointed to hear that I was planning on it. He was in a terrible mood since he found out and I decided to not go to be there for him since it was only October and there would be other events in the year. In retrospect, I wish I had attended the event but I am glad I could be there for him.

Now, whenever there is any social event, he becomes depressed when I want to spend time to be with other friends. He is generally not very happy when I am not with him (although he has been spending more time with some other friends since I have been home while he is still at school) and sometimes, when he is especially depressed, he will be short with me and start arguments and be very critical of me. I try to handle this as best I can and not take his depressive episodes personally, but I am starting to feel the emotional toll of his actions and I want to figure out what to do from here.

 He and I are best friends and he is usually a fantastic partner to me, but college has made life change for both of us in ways that are hard to navigate. Because I seriously value our relationship, I would really appreciate some advice on how to set healthy boundaries, stand up for myself when I need to, and be a better and more supportive partner when he really does need me there for him. I am frustrated with my position because I can't really tell when I am being unsupportive or when he is being unreasonable or mean, so please let me know what I should do in these kinds of situations.

(didn't show my penis) and they then started to say that im a hypocrite (means in islam that i fake being religious) and i have previously told them that i masturbate every day.. i told them because they are best friends of mine so... and then i told them that i was faking it and they didn't believe it but then i convinced them by saying that i remembered watching a porn video (which is that porn is forbidden in my religion)  thats why i got a boner and started faking it and then they forgot what happened that day and one day i was playing Football in school with the 3 friends in my team and then i tell one that he is not gonna kick the ball because he is not good and he says no i will kick it and i say you will not and then i try to take the ball from him, all of a sudden one of them (3 friends that i mentioned in title) came and started pushing me away from the ball so i can not make him not kick the ball and then i broke up with 2 of them and then one kicks the ball (the one who pushed me) and scores a goal and then i hugged him and said sorry and he said no problem bro... and then after the period of football in class, i started talking to the friend that i said that he will not kick the ball.. he started ignoring me and saying to my other friends. (man!! i can not believe this shit! no one controls me like this even my parents!) and then this is where he breaks up with me and never talks to me again since then, and he started turning up my the other 2 friends against me and he succeeded in doing that by saying that he is a hypocrite and he doesn't deserve to befriended by us.. and slowly slowly we started breaking up by weird and foolish situations with the other 2 friends until we really broke up and never talked to each other face to face and then thats when they started exposing me to my other classmates that i masturbate and i got in skype and they said that ''skype'' is a livestreaming program and i showed my dick and ass in it while livestreaming and they told my teachers also but not saying my name by saying.. (Teacher Ali, do you know that ministry of education has caught a student who livestreamed showing off his body and showing everything) the teacher replied by: ''what a rude human being.... maybe he is too young?'' and then he didn't say anything back (ex-friend) and that was during a test a few days ago and today in last period of school (8th) they were oppressed from me that I won against them in football period (7th) one of them... started saying guys who knows who is skype (thats what they call me) and they say who he says hints like the one who livestreamed naked in ''skype'' which is a audio/video calling program not livestreaming but my friends are dumb so they believed that and then he says he is sitting there (the desk where i sit) alone with no one and everyone hates him and someone of my friends say why don't you say his name and he replies i cant say his name because he is a girl.. that's an offense in saudi culture... and said he masturbates and another ex friend of mine not from the 3 that is friends with the 3 bullies says yeah i know who is skype he is sitting in that desk and he masturbated and showed his body and everything in a skype livestream.. and my other friend who's been told that i masturbated and was naked in a skype livestream and i masturbate (forbidden in islam) and that friend is religious.. he says dont talk about him and he says May God (allah in islam) guide him. and then they proceed and all of that happened while the teacher wasn't in the classroom when he came they started repeating what they said previously but in a lower voice and one of them said to the teacher what is masturbating and they always do that when i am in the classroom but not against smart teachers and teachers that they fear....

My friend (called A), has a huge crush and is trying to date a 12 year old transgender boy (called R). A is always holding his hand, playing with his hair, cuddling him and touching him just really weirdly in front of people. 

Recently A has come forward to me and my friends that she has a huge crush on R and has done since he was 11. This, along with the constant touching, really didn't sit with me and others too well. My friend asked whether she would do anything really intimate with him to which she made a face like ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  and went ""it depends really"".

I'm honestly really concerned about R and I feel like he's getting groomed by A. Its developing to the point where A is getting jealous of R having an ex girlfriend which was 12 and today I heard that A has been spending time alone with R in a class room. When I heard this I felt sick to my stomach. 

What am I supposed to do? I feel like if I tell a teacher or anyone in authority they won't believe me and A or R will deny it. I don't want this to carry on especially because R seems to be getting more and more uncomfortable. Any advice is appreciated.",27Nov2019,1

I thought she was interested in me as well because she tried to talk to me a lot and we were both each others best friend on Snapchat meaning that she probably didn't talk to many other guys.

The same day i realized my crush, this guy in my class tells me that he is dating the girl.

Background: ""Fred"" and ""Janice"" had a baby after dating for a year. Janice told Fred the baby, ""Annie"", wasn't his, and they parted ways. Shortly after, Fred met ""Jillian"" and married her. Baby Annie is now 7 years old and has been asking Janice about who her father is and why he has never been around.  Janice has not lied to Annie or tried to hide the identity of Fred. Fred has spent the past 7 years not knowing Annie was his. Janice reached out to Fred to tell the truth. Fred and Janice are open minded and ready to begin co-parenting. All parties agree to meet for Christmas. Janice has asked Fred to leave Jillian behind for the meeting, because she doesn't want to overwhelm Annie. 

Fred: I want to meet my daughter and I want to keep my wife happy. I don't want to argue with anyone. I don't know what to do. I can't take my wife's side without upsetting Janice, and I can't take Janice's side without upsetting Jillian. Jillian is the biggest part of my life and has been with me almost 24/7 for 6 years. I don't feel right asking Jillian to not come with me for something this huge. 

Janice: I understand they are married and Jillian is going to be in Annie's life. I want their first interactions to be just between Fred and Annie. Annie is aware that Fred is married to Jillian, and has talked to her on video chat for a minute. It seemed to go well. Annie is already nervous about meeting Fred, I don't want her to be doubly nervous just because Jillian is tagging along too. I don't want any added pressure for Annie. 

Jillian: I understand this is a stressful situation. However, I don't want to be excluded just because I'm not blood. I want to be just as much a part of Annie's life as Fred. I was so excited to find out I'm a step parent, but now I feel like Janice is looking at me as an obstacle. I'm not the kind of wife who is just totally fine with her husband and his ex spending time together without me. Co-parenting is new territory for all of us and we need to tread lightly. 

Is it wrong of Janice to ask Jillian to exclude herself from the first meeting?",27Nov2019,1

I currently work in a bar, and have been working there for around 5 months now. There's a girl at my work who started a few weeks after me and we became quite good friends quickly. One problem I have always had with her is that shes very bossy, she is bossy to everyone though and i'm not the only person who has noticed. Not only is she bossy; But she's aggressive and bad under pressure usually resulting in her acting out to customers or me specifically. Recently it's died down with how shes talked to other coworkers because they're all quite good at shutting her down when she decides to play queen for the day, but I on the other hand am very very very bad at shutting down situations when they arise or even knowing what to say. I usually just put my tail between my legs and carry on with my shift, or more recently, have an anxiety attack in the back office before a shift that we're both going to be working. I've had one other conversation with her about how she's talked to me in the past and explained to her that I have a really hard time with people who raise their voice at me and she apologised; Yet she continues doing this. I fear that I've let her get too comfortable with the way she talks to me and now i just don't know how to handle these situations when they come up.

   
ex. I came into work and while all my coworkers came over to say hello to me she exclaimed in front of everyone, ""So are you just not coming into work with any pants on now?"" Which left me a bit stunned and I continued into the back office without saying a word because I was so embarrassed.

  
How do I combat this situation? What should I say when something like this arises again? HELP

643,"Sorry for long post - Context: My girlfriend and I have been dating for over 4 and a half years. We've been through some tough times together - her dad passed away from cancer about 2 years ago which (obviously) was difficult and I personally dealt with/ am still dealing with mental health issues which first started during the time when her dad was in hospital (I was in a car accident where a guy crashed into me and literally ran away from his car \[I'm assuming he was drunk?\],both my grandmothers passed away in the space of 2 weeks \[my one grandfather committed suicide when my mother was little and my paternal grandfather passed away when I was like 8 so it was difficult coming to terms with the fact that I no longer had any grandparents\] and I lost my first dog that I got when I was 10 and we had for 11 years.

Recently my car was stolen from the university I attend and I bought this car with my own money that I had paid off earlier this year over 2 years (which affected me in a whole other way but not necessary). I recently got a new car which had been in an accident but was repaired well. I have a very very limited knowledge of cars so my dad helped me and we got a mechanic to ""check everything"" and even got the car realigned. Everything seemed perfect and then I go to full up with petrol and ask the petrol attendant to fill my water but he says that there isn't one. I was pretty furious that this wasn't picked up by the mechanic or my dad. My girlfriend gave me a lecture about how I should have taken responsibility for it and that I should know by now that I can't rely on my dad for things anything car-related (I had an issue with my air-conditioning in my previous car that my dad said he'd sort out but didn't do it properly). Now (so far) the car runs fine but this missing water canister resulted in my girlfriend to ""shout"" at me over WhatsApp and she got very annoyed with me when the petrol attendant said there's no water canister. She kept giving me shit for it and was telling that I ""really need to take initiative"" and that I should know better. This brought back all those feelings 2 years ago and the suicidal thoughts I had. She's made me feel absolutely horrible and I'm waiting for my university results to come out on the 29th at midday (basically if I get my degree or not) so I'm already incredibly stressed. I don't know what to do about this. We also had a big argument (probably the biggest one in the past 2 years) about how I'm ""boring"" and that I'm not adventurous. This really hurt but I can see why she said that and I told her that I will work on it. I really don't know what to do or how to deal with this. I've looked at seeing a psychologist to talk about this stuff but money is tight at home so I'm on a waiting-list for this organisation that provides psychologists (mostly students) for a low rate which kind of reiterates what my girlfriend said about how my dad likes to take the cheap route and makes me even more upset.

I really do love her. I genuinely don' think that I will find anyone better than her. She helps me get out of m comfort zone and get out the house more. I have friends but she's incredibly adventurous and loves to be out socialising. I was the same for about the first 2 years of our relationship but ever since the stuff that happened 2 years ago I haven't been as happy in general nor as engaging as I was. I recently revealed to my close friends and my girlfriend's brother that I had suicidal thoughts 2 years ago (I never told her) which I thought would take a load off but at the moment I feel just as shit as I did then. I don't even want to think about failing a course and not getting my degree this year. From an academic perspective this year was ridiculously tough but I feel that I literally worked as hard as I could ( I even had a mental breakdown earlier this year the night before an exam which my girlfriend and her mom helped me get over and still managed to pass despite there only being a 33% pass rate and an average of 45%). I feel that I don't deserve this. Like we all suck at something and if someone who means a lot to you doesn't understand something then surely this isn't this the way to treat someone?

644,"So I'm Male 17 years of age and I live in Wales. 

I just feel like I should care about anything and I don't, I hate the college course that I am currently on, it is literally been the most boring year of my life (I wanted to switch courses but couldn't find any I wanted so I'm doing the second year now) In all of my assignments I get passes or merits and it doesn't matter to me. Regarding the other aspects of my life. 

I don't have a social life the only people I talk to are brief conversations with my family and conversations about college work In class, but I still don't mind that I have nobody to talk too. 

In my free time I just listen to music and stay locked up I my own head dreaming up scenarios of what could happen just to feign my life with the littlest bit of intrigue (By scenarios It's like when I'm walking I'm looking ahead but I'm looking at something different in my head, like a TV Show that I control)

With my free time I just watch the various TV shows that I can find and they just all seem better than any life I can ever imagine for my self.
Even with personal hygiene sometimes I won't even get out of bed to brush my teeth, I shower like once or twice a week and I haven't had a haircut in 6 months.

There’s always something that I’d rather do than whatever my teachers demand. Somehow, I managed to graduate from high school and I’m right now studying computer science in my university.

And I did briefly wake up at that time. Until I fell asleep again and woke up at 10. I had to turn it in at 10:16 and I was able to half ass some of it, but the fact was that I woke up late to my final.

652,"I’ve been recently diagnosed with severe cases of both depression and anxiety. I’ve resorted to self-harming for awhile, but I’ve been doing them in places that are easy to hide. So, my family doesn’t know, yet.


As a kid, I started showing signs of depression with hallucinations, constant anger, stressed to no end, almost never slept, always exhausted, and a few other things. But when I was taken to see someone about it, they told my parents I was fine and just had an overactive imagination. It wasn’t. Because of that, my parents would brush me off as just looking for attention whenever I came to them about a new problem and my siblings would mock me. Because I was tired of all the humiliation and feeling pushed aside and ignored, I started to keep quiet. Now I’m 21 years old, diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety by multiple doctors, on new meds, and seeing a therapist.


I’m torn on what to do with this information. I feel like I should tell my family because it’s only a matter of time before someone in my family goes poking around my medicine cabinet for something for allergies or something and stumble upon my depression and anxiety meds. I don’t like keeping secrets from them and I don’t like that it’s become a default for me to say, “I’m doing okay” whenever my family asks how I’m doing. But then, I really don’t want to tell them because I’m afraid I’ll get the same reaction as when I was a kid: brushed off as just lying for attention, just being dramatic, and then mocked for it.


My parents still seem to be caring for their kids. For the physical stuff, no matter how old we are, they make sure everything is dealt with and that we’ll be okay. It’s the mental stuff they just don’t know how to deal with and brush it off as something we’ll get over or grow out of.


I want to tell my family because there are some things that they do that sometimes leads to an anxiety attack, which usually ends up in self-harm. But the memory of not being believed and then mocked still sits strongly in my mind.

655,"so recently i've been in a slightly toxic relationship. i met this guy in may and we instantly hit it off. the only thing is, one of my close friends (who was a pretty shitty friend) had liked him for almost 2 years, but she never had the courage to talk to him and every time she tried he wouldn't say anything bc he rly isn't a talkative person until you get to know him. she hated me, and all my friends did to. so, i found a new group of friends and became rly close with his friends. time went on, and we had a really good relationship. he made me really happy and i had been so upset for months before i met him, and he made me feel like i had a reason to be alive. but then he got really close to my best friend, and i started suspecting something. i asked him if he liked her at all and if there was going on, but every time i got mentioned it, he got really sad, made it seem like i was overthinking everything, and made me feel like shit. we continued to be in a relationship, even thought i wasn't sure if i fully trusted him; but i fully trusted my best friend because she was my only friend for quite some time. but, she started distancing herself from me, so my boyfriend was the only person that i had left. so after about 2 months, my best friend (lets call her anne) came to sleepover. anne came over and we hung out for a while and then went up to my roof. when we got up there, she told me everything. after she met my boyfriend, he liked her and she liked him back. they had been talking for weeks and she kept saying that they would just be friend, but he said ""no i don't want that"". anne felt so bad so she started distancing herself from me. he told her he loved her, tried to kiss her, and when anne and i hung out, he would text the post of us ""you're my world"". i obviously was furious and broke up with him, which he practically didn't let me do. he said ""it was an accident"", ""i didn't mean to hurt you"", ""i didn't want to loose anne from my life"". then summer break came around like a week after, so out of sight and out of mind. i had my phone,  and i kept texting him over the summer. i briefly got back with him just to realize it was pointless. he spent his summer far away from me and i wouldn't want to have a relationship over the phone. so then i went on vacation for 3 weeks and left my phone behind. i didn't text him for 3 weeks and everyday he sent me paragraphs and paragraphs about how much he missed me and how much he loved me. i got back, and i was really over him and all his bullshit. i was ready for school, but he was in all my classes. i saw him everyday and i really didn't know how to feel. i half hated him, and half loved him. so then i ended up practically being in a relationship with him in the middle of october but quickly ended it because i couldn't make up my mind if i hated him or if i loved him. we continued to be on okay terms, not talking a lot; mostly because he never responded to my texts. i distanced myself from his friends and got my old friend back. anne was always close with his friends so they hung out. one night, they all stayed out and hung out at one of their friends house. anne fell asleep on the couch and my ex boyfriend moved her head onto his lap and started stroking her hair. she didn't know that he did this, so when she woke up she took a pillow and started screaming at him. one day, i was walking home from school and my old friends showed me videos they took of my ex stroking her hair and i was heartbroken. i confronted my ex and asked him ""why?"" and he said, ""what about is? what do you want me to say"". i was so heartbroken that i trusted him again, and even thought we weren't dating anymore, it still hurt. so now this is getting a bit long so i'll wrap this up. i explained the situations to my closest friends and they all said i was overreacting and just didn't get it. i felt so alone and honestly was so tired of everything. so now im stuck. i found out about him doing this to her yeaterday, and i just wanted some advice :/ if you made it down this far, you're a trooper and i hope you have a nice day.",27Nov2019,1

660," **a little context:**

I (30m) grew up in a very hostile house. my father’s temper was… frequent. and terrifying. I learned to keep myself to avoid the crossfire, and these characteristics carried into adulthood. to this day, people describe me as aloof. I’m owning this part.

fast forward several years and my parents divorce. this is good; both are happier apart. it seemed like he was improving as a person. I’d long moved out at this point and felt like he respected me more at this distance; like he was on his best behaviour.

all was finally well… until it wasn’t.  


**the conflict:**

recently -out of nowhere- my dad accused me of being mad with him. said I was ignoring him …which wasn’t specifically true. or more so, nothing had changed. while I admit to slow replies and keeping him at an emotional length, I was at work and it’d only been 3 hours. I didn’t understand why it was suddenly bothering him and would’ve been more sympathetic if he just told me he was worried about our relationship. …but instead he said unprovoked stuff like “this is why no one invites you to things” and “you want to be alone so bad? you’ll get your wish” and “get your shit together” and-

it was a painful reminder of the past.

I explained I wasn’t upset prior but was now since it felt like he was punishing me over an imaginary fight. I needed space and said I’d reach out once we both calmed down. I then blocked him.

time passes, voice mails pile up. I decide it’s been long enough but first set boundaries; said we can move forward IF he agreed to speak to me respectfully.

he outright refused. and it just… escalated. he ignored everything I said and kept putting words in my mouth to get angry at. it was like we were having two entirely different conversations. this reaction was so over the top and disjointed that I worried he was either high or maybe I’d inherited my psychosis from him.

needless to say, I blocked him again. took a 10min shower to breathe, and by the time I got back my cell had BLOWN UP. voice mail after voice mail of his outrage.

so then he started calling my partner.

and then my sister.

...then my in-laws.

this… was fucking MORTIFYING. I didn’t want them -of all people- to see this aspect of my life. they keep checking in to see if I'm okay, and -while it's sweet- I hate it because they now know too much.

  
**the hard choice:**

I can cut him out once and for all. or I can keep setting boundaries, but put myself in the same vulnerable position I’ve been my entire life. thing is, I know he’s just scared of losing me; but why not just say that? he's never apologized for this, or for anything. even if he did, could I accept it when he clearly hasn't changed? Is ending it too dramatic?

This topic is not as serious as some of the others but nevertheless i would appreciate some help.

I will provide  a little background info. I am from ireland and am 15 years old. Here in ireland driving vechiles is a massive part of our culture such as cars,quads(atv) and tractors.i live in a rural part of the country away from majority of my friends who live in housing estates etc and those who do live near me are all equipped with quads or their own cars. driving underage is very common in ireland and i have always loved motorcycles cars and quads from a young age. I can drive quads, dirt bikes,automatic and manual transmission cars and have even driven a ford escort mk2. i would consider myself a skilled driver and i know when not to take risks.

last year for christmas i asked for a dirt bike (250cc 4 stroke honda crf) and was told no by my father who was concerned about my safety.i dont blame him, im his child and i would be concerned too.I never stopped liking dirt bikes just because i wasn't allowed one for christmas.i constantly reminded them how much i loved them and how much i wanted one however they never really seemed interested.i got a summer job this year and saved around 800-900 euros .my plan of action was to hopefully ask this year and show my father how dedicated i am to get one.I asked last night and was told the exact same thing (""im not going to buy a motorcycle and know that i bought the bike you got killed on"") that im not allowed. My mother is very supportive and considers my choice but my father will not budge. he is trying to persuade me to do other things such as drive his new car around a track.(porsche gt4, were not rich or spoilt we have just worked hard to get the things and had to take out a loan for the car). i am delighted to drive it around the track and would really like that however i still really want a dirtbike not only because i have a great interest in them but because it is convient for me as i live in rural ireland.

669,"Hi,

I made a throwaway account. I enjoy reading through this subreddit, and I have finally made the courage to post my issue. I am so sorry this might be long. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea where to start so bear with me. I feel like context is needed I will try my best to only put in the minimum. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently engaged to my highschool sweetheart. We started dating my senior year of highschool and five and a half years later we got engaged. We have had our ups and downs that felt pretty normal. I have had relationships before, but I am her first. Since we met, she has always had this *dependency* on me. At first I thought it was flattering. I felt needed. She enjoys my attention, really affectionate, always there for me when I am down, always wants me to be happy. She cares really deeply for me. We got along great when we first started seeing each other. I felt like she was the first person who I really connected to. We had a lot of fun together. But she also has anxiety (which is completely okay).  If I was somewhat annoyed, she would panic that I would think something is wrong in the relationship. I could always calm her down or get her to laugh and change gears.  Again, I felt needed. Arguments are a different thing - complete nightmare, she would immediately blame herself. ""I am the worst person ever"", ""I am sorry I am just not good enough"", and a ton of crying. When that happens, I immediately roll over. I feel like nothing is worth arguing over so much that I can just ignore the comments or the crying. Just put out the 'fires'. 

&amp;#x200B;

Two years ago, I started having this depressive states. Just constantly falling into these states for weeks at a time. Then I'd be ""out"" for a week or so then back down. During these states, I would lose all sociability and intimacy. I felt extremely isolated. Nothing suicidal yet. Absolutely zero physical contact. This did not go over well. So back to the whole dependency thing. With no affection/attention, she would take it personally - like I was no longer attracted to her or unhappy to be with her, which brought a lot of anxiety for her. These would lead to some bad arguments which will then lead her to have full meltdown panic attacks. She would tell me ""I just can't live without you."", ""If something happened to us, I would kill myself"". I tried to be vocal about it, telling her that I can't help it that I am a bit disconnected when they happen, but they are 100 percent NOT anything against her. She would tell me she understands and she will try to work with them. This has been going on for awhile, I have not been seeing any changes. I feel like I have to walk on eggshells around her.  During one of these disaster nights I had my first intrusive harsh thought of what I should do to myself to just get out of this situation (This happened once, never since then. This happened a month and a half ago, I have been going to a counselor, I am getting help.).  

&amp;#x200B;

I feel trapped between a rock and a hard place. We are engaged, finishing up college, engagement photos taken, wedding plannings underway, we live together in an apartment, both of our parents are really good friends. I keep hoping that maybe when school is finally over, that layer of stress is what is causing all of this. I don't know if I am hoping or just telling myself this. I feel guilty that I am legitimately having doubts. I feel guilty that I am starting to feel that this isn't working out between us. We have been together for so long that I feel guilty that I can't get over this feeling. 

Just once in awhile when we have our good moments I just get this feeling that my life in on track, this is the way it is supposed to be. Those feelings are starting to seem sparse. I am so lost on what to do and I have so many questions. Am I thinking this way because of these depressive states? Am I clear headed enough to know that this no longer a healthy relationship? Is she in love with me or just the idea of the relationship? When do I know when is enough for the relationship?

When I introduce him to new people, he is quite protective and starts barking, but once he knows they aren't a threat he becomes a huge cuddle buddy. Has anyone else experienced this and if so, is there any tips that has helped you with the initial greetings with new people!

671,"Hey so idk who I can talk to this about in person as I’m deeply ashamed for what I did. I feel so much guilt, embarrassment, shame, and feel disgusting for what I did. I’ve literally contemplated suicide for what I’ve done. I’m so miserable and can’t believe I ever let myself do this. 

But when I was 14 I would spy on my mom after she got out of the shower. I didn’t do it for very long and have never done it again nor have I ever had the urge to do it again. I knew I shouldn’t have done it at the time but at the time I talked myself into it and I’ve always been a curious person my whole life. The compulsion got the best of me.

Many years have passed and I’ve thought about what I’ve done from time to time but most of the time just brush it off and say don’t worry about it that was a long time ago and you didn’t truthfully understand what you were doing even though you think you did.

 But just about a week ago it hit me hard what I did,(I’m not sure why)harder than ever to the fact I just want to end myself for what I did. I’m almost certain I’ll never go that route bc I know I would resort back to drugs before than just to numb myself from all the pain I’ve caused myself.

I feel so much pain. I’ve thought about apologizing to my mother and bringing it to her attention as she never knows this happened. I feel an apology could maybe help me forgive myself but at the same time I feel I will have a weird relationship with her afterwards as I’m almost certain my mother would forgive me. But I’m just so lost and confused and realized I should’ve never done that but I can’t go back. 

Can someone please help me. I also have been trying to detox all the drugs. And no drugs plus my past finally catching up to me makes me feel so empty. I just want to be held and know that I’m still loved. I always feel like I want to cry and just end it. I do cry alone sometimes too. I feel so alone rn and no one can understand how I feel. I feel so fucked up. Should I leave the past in the past and move forward or should I tell my mother so that I may move forward even though it is so shameful, embarrassing, and terrible to tell my mother this. 
I think it’s also important to note that this was just some kind of phase that I outgrew. I have never had the urge to spy on someone without their knowledge nor will I ever do something so fucked up again. But I feel even more fucked bc it was my mom like wtf is wrong with me. I love my mom and it hurts me that I even did that to her. 

I need help rn I’m so confused. I also fear I’ll just leave it alone and that it will haunt me again later in life. But yes I have been ruminating in the past.",27Nov2019,1

She does act interested however in text, and tells me she loves me, so I'm just quite confused... Does she really hate talking on the phone that much? Could she be hiding something? Maybe she's not as serious as she claims to be.

Each week after that, she arrived to class a few minutes after I do. We make brief eye contact when she’s walking up the aisle and passes me. Then, at the end of class when I stand up to pack my bag, I glance up behind me where she sits now(instead of in front of me?).  She always looks up eventually and we make eye contact for a quick second. I’ve caught her staring at me before I look up a few times as well.

I stayed at my dads last night with the cat, as my brother was home- so the cat was fed and cuddled.

And I am on the pill and in addition to that he also pulled out. 

I've always been paranoid about this but in the past weaks my fear of pregnancy got extreme. I can't stop thinking about what if I am pregnant etc.. What if I ever missed a pill? I also took a test today, which was negative but it still didn't calm me down. On the packaging it said, it's best to take it in the morning, but I took it in the afternoon. So now I am worried that would've changed the result. Gonna take another one tomorrow morning, but I feel like I wont ever calm down. It's all I can think about and trust me I can't talk to anyone about it.. I also can't say anything about missed periods, since the pill just leads to controlled hormonal bleedings.

682," 

I (15 going on to 16F) was on my phone in the living room where both of my parents were. Everyone was on their phones, suddenly my Dad snatched my phone out of my hands to see what I was doing. This really pissed me off because I hate it when he does that because it feels as though they don't trust me (which they admitted they do not trust me for some reason). Bearing in mind I am a kid who has decent grades and do not get into trouble at all. Then he was just flipping through the apps in my phone and I got really impatient. I admit I lost my temper a bit and demanded him to give my phone back. My Mum told me to be quiet if I wanted my phone back and said I was overreacting over nothing. This went on as my Dad said he will give my phone back after 10 minutes, then 30 minutes and then an hour. He kept increasing it when I protested until he said I can go on without a phone for a week. I was livid and started to cry. Since my birthday is on a Sunday, he told me I am not going anywhere as I planned to go out with my friends.

I went on to tell them I wanted them to respect my privacy and not snatch my phone again. My parents are Indian so privacy is a joke to them and said only adults need privacy, not children. They said they pay for my phone and I am their child so I have no right to be 'dominant' over them. They mocked me by saying we are not a white family and if I didnt like it then I am free to leave. Honestly, I was so annoyed and they said they were joking and I ruined the mood by losing my temper over nothing. I do not feel good at the moment at all but I do wish I go back in time and just stay quiet like I was meant to.

I live thousands of miles away from her now, and I feel utterly disconnected from her, it’s difficult to tell her I miss her because frankly, it isn’t true.

But she doesn’t. 

My mother is in pain because of the aspects of her life she is uncomfortable with changing. I feel a violent churn of anxiety every time I’m meant to visit her because she just gets more ragged and weary-looking each time I see her.

This girl motivates the hell out of me.  Every time I see her, I get inspired and motivated to do better, and aim higher.  She is basically my only friend as well.  Many people still view me as the kid I was a year ago, even though I’ve been different for a year.  

Anyway, we don’t have any classes together, and since we are both so consumed by clubs and what not, we never get to spend time with each other, which I am fine with, because I get the whole “I have 4 tests this week” thing.

715,"First of all, Thank you for reading this
My name's David, 16yo, and I live in kind of a rular area of Romania.Ever since I was a child I was pretty bad at social interactions, and being raised by highly ""protective"" parents who wouldnt let me go play outside and the physical and verbal bullying  made me shy, and it maybe was the reason I didnt really have a lot of friends.

Now being in high school in the city I was forced to open up a bit more to people and it worked, but I still have this thing in which I have this shyness to go and introduce myself in a  group who is talking.For example If I enter a room to waut for something and there are like 5 familiar people there.
Also, I sometimes get nervous around people because I have the impression that they would think negative things about me, and I get agitated. 

For example, today, before going to the buss station to go to school, I went into a shop to buy some food, and then met up with a few guys from my town.One of them had his right arm in a cast from the elbow, but it was covered under his jacket, so I didnt see that.His arm was positioned like he was giving a hand, so I gave hand with him, with no reaction.After I leave I hear him say something like ""he's such a fool..really stupid""

Another thing is that in stressfull situations, I tend to zone out without intention, or sometimes I get put in f*cked up daily situations.For example, also today I was going home with the bus, which was really full.Also, the space in the bus between the two rows of seats is extremely narrow, And I was cought up standing there with a few other people in my school, also standing up.The, a women with a child from my left wanted to exit, so I took a step back.Also behind me was a senior from my school.The women exits and she doesent make enough space for me to enter in her seat so that she could have enough space o move around the bus with her 9yo child, and I couldnt enter with force cuz I would of stepped on the kid.So I got nervous and didnt do nothing.The situation resolves, but the guy behind me was really upset that I didnt enter the seat earlier, and made me stinkingly supid person and a fool in front of everyone.

These thing make me really upset, cuz I also got called really stupid and get shouted at by my parents for every little mistake I made every since I was a child, so whenever someone calls me like that I get really sad and overthink everything.

716,"Hello!
So context here is that, two years ago I was assaulted. I realized a few months ago I subconsciously kept the clothes I was wearing that night, so I ripped it up and began writing down all the thoughts and emotions that I had/been having while healing. And I think I’m at the point where I’m ready to burn it, because I’m coming to a really good point in my healing. Problem is, I don’t know how to—I don’t have a fire out and I live in the suburbs of NJ. Any ideas? I’d rather do this on my own than around other people",27Nov2019,1
717,"I cooked x2 chicken breast fillets in the oven. They were white inside so I presumed it was okay. After looking more closely I noticed a few red blood spots in a few places, so I guess the chicken may have been slightly undercooked or raw, but most of the fillets were white. I ate a small mouth full, but I’m anxious I’ll get sick. It’s been 25 minutes and I feel fine.",27Nov2019,1
718,"Hey. Our circle consists of 3 people: me (19), Guy (20), and Girl (19). We all met at college and became one group because of... well, clicking with each other in regards to being study-oriented. But we can also relate on other stuff ranging from movie genres to political views.

This year we've been physically away from each other because I had to move to another university, while both of them were split to different sections (which means different schedules, too). I seldom come to visit when I have the money and enough energy, and I always make sure to meet up with them during their mutual free time. Other than that, we also have a group chat so we could still talk even if we're all apart.

The problem here is how Guy talks so much about his interests in the group chat. At first, both Girl and I are happy because he is opening himself to us, considering how he only had one person to trust in his whole academic career until college. Movies? Sure, we love those too. Humor? Damn yes that's what we all laugh at.

But recently, Guy has been getting so overboard in the group chat. He kept on telling TONS of stuff that only he could relate to until he floods the chat box. I always do my best to keep up because I know how it feels like to be ignored, but sometimes I just couldn't understand the context anymore and it feels like it's my fault whenever Guy resends a link THRICE because no one has responded to it yet simply because we are all busy. If the resending doesn't work, he tags us on social media about it! I feel forced and it's been draining me, not to mention it's adding up to the pile of personal burden I already have. Girl had been frank and already told him multiple times (in a friendly manner ofc) that she just couldn't backread anymore because she had a lot of work to do and that she couldn't relate to the talk anymore. I'm afraid that Girl may have been feeling alienated because of Guy.

And about Guy's response? He didn't acknowledge what she said because of me. I think it's my fault because I've been entertaining him even though I'm not enjoying anymore. I'm not originally a social person unlike Girl because of the trauma I'm bearing from ""friends"" I had back in high school. This problem also reminds me of my ex-boyfriend (keeps talking about his own interests, doesn't value my time, gets suspicious and toxically clingy whenever I'm busy) so yeah.

I don't know how to break this whole thing down to him without hurting his feelings. In fact, I have already deactivated my social media accounts where I am connected with him. The reason why I'm weak at doing this is because he's not too social like me. This year in his new section, he refused to get to know his new classmates as potential friends. He doesn't want to hang with them at all. Girl encouraged him that it won't be so bad because he can always back out whenever there are red flags, but he ignored it. He always said that it's okay if he doesn't make friends and actually adjust because that wasn't his goal there. But because of that, he's been isolating himself in our tiny circle. Just to clarify, no one's pushing him out of our circle. Girl and I just want him to grow and explore new horizons. We don't require him to make as many friends as he can; we only wish for him to have at least one or few people to rely on even if Girl and I are not around. Because life is just like that: both of us cannot always be available for him since we also have things to deal with on our own.

There. Sorry, I think I rambled. I hope anyone could give me advice on how to tell him what Girl and I are feeling without Guy thinking the other way around. Without Guy getting hurt.

Thank you. Sorry again if I said so much stuff, just wanted to add context. My grammar might have gone broken, too. It always happens when I ramble. If you also have questions, feel free to comment below. Just want to fix this as soon as possible.",27Nov2019,1

722,"He’s in a gang. He lives in California. I’m in Nevada. My parents divorced while I was at a young age and while my dad never had more kids my moms had plenty. I love all my brothers and who their dad is doesn’t matter one bit to me. 

She never stayed tied down to one man so I never really got to know this brothers dad. I went every year for 3 months at a time until a couple years ago when my mom went to prison. My brothers were given to my aunt who exploited them for tax money. My cousins had all the latest games while my brother who was 12 at the time had to learn to change diapers for my even younger brothers and would gets scraps for food. 

During this time he grew fast and he grew hard while getting mixed up with the wrong type of people to try and get money for him and the kids. Recently he got caught with a gun and is on house arrest. He’s used it before on rivals. I know that much.

My mom got out about a year and a half ago and she’s been in the process of getting custody again. My brothers all come out once a year to my apartment as my parents don’t really care for them too much. 

I don’t make a lot of money and between me and my girlfriend we’re just trying to make ends meet but my brother NEEDS to get out of there.

The problem is he doesn’t want to. 

I’ve discussed with my mom but she doesn’t have full custody quite yet. She can’t move anywhere else because shes still trying to get back on her feet and just got laid off last week. I’m not sure exactly what’s going on because my mom doesn’t really understand it but if I could convince her to give me custody how could I force him to come over here? 

I know force is a harsh word, but believe me I don’t call him up and yell at him and call him stupid. I try to get him to understand the error in those ways, to which he agrees with me. He just doesn’t want to let it go. I’ve been trying to show him that there’s more to life than living that sort of life but I’m at my wits end. He’s texted me like almost suicidal texts a lot. When he’s running stupid ‘missions’. He never tells me what’s going on, only that he loves me and that I’m a good brother. 

I don’t want to push him away but at some point I have to do SOMETHING. I’m just not sure what to do. I can’t afford a lawyer or anything like that. So is there anyone that has been in this situation? Google isn’t helping, and my anxiety is through the roof. 

I remember being 16 and I was hard headed just like him but he’s something else. I don’t want to give up but it almost feels like one day he’s going to catch a bullet or something.",27Nov2019,1
723,"My grandpa died last weekend. He may be dead but to us, he had been gone for at least 5 years. I've made my peace with it.

The funeral is this Saturday.

I don't wanna go...I really don't...I'm a Christian but I've never been good with Church. I hate the loud music, I hate being crowded by a bunch of people, I get bored real easy and I always feel anxious when I go to one. I remember one time I felt so crowded I felt like I was gonna burst into tears any moment. And one of the most embarrassing moments in my life happened in a Church(I don't feel like going into detail).

But my family is counting on me to go...They'll be disappointed in me if I don't...but I feel like even if I do go I'll just end up playing on my phone the whole service and I feel morally wrong doing so.

727,"I recently completed one year of graduate studies in a STEM discipline at a MS program in the midwest. My GPA was a 3.5, I passed my oral exam, and students in my teaching labs enjoyed the experience. Things were going great, I was ready to really dig in to my project. But during the summer, my adviser and I had a falling out. We set up a meeting the following week and I was immediately kicked out of the lab.

Feeling hurt, lost, and scared, I turned in my keys and left as quickly as I could, which I regret. I apologized to everyone. My adviser before I left. My mother on the walk home. My girlfriend for the rest of the day. It felt like I let everyone down, including myself. It has been tough mentally and on my relationships. I have worked hard to protect both of these. This experience has brought up a lot of emotions for me. Feelings of inadequacy, unworthiness, but also resiliency. I am extremely passionate about my field and conservation and can't imagine doing anything else professionally.

I had the opportunity to find another lab to join in the program but told them that I did not feel welcome at that institution anymore. I do want to complete this MS (possibly more) but another part of me says take the year of free education and run. I have found a few job postings close to home that I am extremely interested in but having applied to 50+ openings these past few months, I don't want watch these exciting opportunities pass me by too.

I reached out to my adviser in an attempt to open communication last week but have not heard anything back and frankly don't expect to. I am weary of asking other professors at that institution to be a reference. I only went into the field with my adviser and lab mates but having performed well in classes feel they could vouch for me provided I haven't been slandered within the department. I have also reached out to my undergraduate adviser and professors. I have been able to get a couple references so far which feels good.

Sorry for the long read. I have a few questions for the community. Does anyone have any experience being kicked out of their lab? Are these normal feelings and fears? Thoughts on gathering references as you progress through your education and career? Tips for standing out in the application process?",27Nov2019,1
728,"So my dad found a condom wrapper in my pocket. He talked to me and said he wasn’t going to tell my mom until after thanksgiving. I’m scared on how my mom is going to react. I think my dad is okay with it, just disappointed, but I think my mom may freak out and I want to know how I can maybe prevent that or help the situation when it happens?

729,"I wanted opinions of some people in general, i know there are trans Reddit's, but there not the people i will be running in to on a day to day basis.

there are some things i cant change (voice sounds like a 14-year-old boy, square jawline, big hands), so i feel that (passing as female) may never work for me 

I'm sorry for posting something like this, but all my life I never really fit in with the guy's group, and I liked a lot of friendships between girls I saw, not all of them,,but some, the talking and sharing of feelings with happy comradery.

But when I try to be like that with guys, they put me at arm's length, wondering what the heck I'm doing.

And when I try that with girls, they ascribe an ulterior motive, (i don't have one, I'm 95% sure I'm ace).

I have just realized I am trans (for this and many other reasons throughout my life).  i always wanted to be a girl, I may start transitioning, But IDK if it will be worth it if I will just forever be an outcast from every group.

but even with the best outcomes there are some things i cant change, (voice sounds like a 14-year-old boy, square jawline, big hands), and i worry that no one would ever be friends whit me, and i will loose any hope of fitting in anywhere , or having friends again.

What should i do? i know the mantra ""be yourself no matter what"", but if myself is always alone, i don't wanna be that person

And i know there will be some that hate me for what i am, and can not change.

731,"My cat has a tendency to knock everything over, and I’ve come to the realization that he does this to get my attention.  He only really knocks things over when I’m home so I think he’s bored and wants me to play with him.  I have one of those ribbon wand things that I use with him, but I personally get bored of it pretty easily which makes it hard for me to spend a ton of time playing with him, and I think he also eventually gets bored with it.  He has other toys that are more solo things, and he definitely enjoys those but it seems like he wants more time playing with me.",27Nov2019,1
733,"OK, so here me out on this. I'm 15 years old and I feel like I'm very overweight for my age (11 stone). I've never been particularly fond of my body and I don't exactly have a good diet. I've been so worried about my body that I googled symptoms for impending heart attacks, some of the criteria of which I've met (occasional dizziness, loss of stamina and occasional pressure on the chest area). 

I don't know if I'm just overreacting and I haven't shared any of these thoughts with my family yet since the thought of them knowing would be humiliating for me but I really do want to lose weight. I just don't know where to start since I have terrible athletic abilities, I have little interest in sports, I just can't seem to get away from junk food and I'm not exactly fond of a lot of healthy foods.

I know this seems like a very heavy issue to drop onto a bunch of strangers before my family but I'm honestly just at a loss for what to do. I don't want to doom my existence to excessive amounts of junk food yet I also don't think I could stick to a diet since I'm so used to the kinds of things I've been eating for a while now.

Am I just being paranoid? Where do i start? How can I stop myself from eating so much junk food? Thank you for reading this.",27Nov2019,1
734,"          I have a sister that harasses me and bullies me. She’s pretty popular, so when I do something she doesn’t like, she tells the whole school. The whole school. Like everyone including the teachers will know about me. She’s a senior and I’m a seventh grader. Our middle school and high school recently combined into one school, so that’s worse for me. (Skip to last paragraph if you don’t want to read everything)She yell at me about my grades and tell the whole school, then she’ll get mad at me because she’s embarrassed. I have a terrible rep because of her. Everyone thinks I’m a slacker, stalker, and psychopath. I’d say I’m just a normal seventh grader though. I’ve never stalked anyone and always turn my homework in on time. She even tried to spread that I was autistic, but she later ended up admitting it was a lie. I don’t know why people believe her anymore at this point. She was caught in so many lies. I’m starting to think she is a pathological liar. 
           I even considered changing schools, but all the ones I can go to have bad education or bad kids. My friend moved to one of the schools, and everyone thought she was really smart. She was really smart, but not the smartest in the grade. I used to tutor her. I have nowhere to hide from her and nobody to tell. No matter how many times my parents scream at her and punish her, she never stops. I’ve even considered telling the principal about her, but she was asked to join NYU and I don’t want to ruin that for her. What can I do to stop her or to stop the rumors?",27Nov2019,1

And god blamed us he killed millions of humans just because we don’t believe in him? What for stupid god lets it people suffer and he SAW that it was good.

737,"I'm going straight to the point, I'm not good at arguments or discussions and always lose. But I want that my dad knows the truth about news- or better yet, Russian journalism.

He's stating that China wasn't a dictatorship and that the news that I watch/read (ARD, New York times, The Guardian ect.) are all lies and fakes. Meanwhile he is watching/reading Russian news and media by the government and stating that that is true and correct journalism. 

He just denies every point I try to bring across, and constantly says that it's all fake. Can anyone link me more info on Russian press and journalism or on it's censorship? Or at least give me some advice on how to become better at discussions?

I gotta take social sciences. Also it's a Biochem bachlors and everyone's warning me that there's no jobs for someone with just a bio bachlors. So I looked to college.

-Some factors are Ive never been independent before but my parents want me to stay in school so they said they'll try to support anywhere I go. given I'd still have to get a job and cut those expenses as much as possible.

740,"About two months ago I have been laid off from my previous job as a Project Manager for a small business due to the fact that they couldn't afford to pay me my salary anymore. Since then I have been searching for jobs and have been collecting unemployment insurance.

Here comes the hard part: I have applied to two county jobs which would be a bit over $20 an hour full time (so far i have passed all their tests and ranked 10th in one job and 14th in the other based on the test scores), i also just finished interviewing for both of them. Supposedly they will let us know if they want us on the team sometime next week or the next week after that. Both jobs have a tentative start date of somewhere in mid January 2020.

I have also interviewed for another position as a administrator support for $13 an hour part time 1pm-5pm M-F. These guys just called me and offered me the job (during my interview with them I did let them know that if the county offered me the job i would choose that).

What do I do? Do i take this job and leave them if i get the better paying full time job? Do I say no to these guys but i also run the risk of not getting either of the county jobs and then I'm back to job searching.

She does things like ruins days out, stalks us, tries to 1up everything i do etc... the only gap i see her is that she's scared of confrontation and can't look a person in the eye and speak. This girl literally only texts or whispers insults to others and doesn't directly do things as she probably feels embarrassed to do it.

She seems to exclusively answer to violence only so I was going to beat her up off of school grounds quickly and quietly and maybe just say one line to her at the end about not fucking with my shit but this person is also a snitch because she's scared.

748,"I've been dealing with this for years now, but my brother is married (and my mom doesn't like his wife - A whole other story) and the problems are now compounding with 3 families my brother and I must attend holidays with. Between my mom fighting me, my brother, and his wife, I'm finally pushed over the edge.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother knew of bro and my plans to see my father's side (a normal sized family gathering), and we had tentative plans (working around bro's and my schedule) to get a nice Thanksgiving dinner some night this weekend (stated: Wed, Friday or Saturday) with my mother. This was communicated, by me, as clearly as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother interpreted these dinner plans as we were travelling \*somewhere\* with dad's side relatives, sometime, and we would be doing dinner with her Thanksgiving day. I didn't realize she could have interpreted what I said this way, but I'm kinda thinking she's only hearing what she wants to hear on this one.

&amp;#x200B;

I try and reproach this logically - She knew we were headed to NH, and getting dinner with her sometime. She also knew we had tentative Wednesday plans to come up, tentative Saturday plans to come up, and she knows that dad's side was only doing a big Thanksgiving meal on Thursday. It's a 2+ hour drive, both to her, and to the dad's side family, in different directions. How did she think we were going to see both? I don't understand her thought process, unless it's exactly that she's not making sense. 

&amp;#x200B;

She then accused me of lying and calling her senile (word for word) and a liar, and goes into a sarcasm-laced argument about ""how could she expect us to see her for Thanksgiving"", and how we never make plans with her, and she had made plans (in her head...) and how could we cancel them at the last minute like this. I've never, ever called her a liar, senile, or any approximation of those things, or even implied it. Ever.

  
I then tried to discuss my own thought process with her - I know Thanksgiving is ""Thanksgiving Day"", but bro and I don't care about that. We want to try and see everybody, as much as we can. Dad's family is only doing Thursday, and we were trying to plan a nice dinner (OUT, not a home dinner). We can't reschedule dad's entire family, and we don't understand why my mom can't do the day before or after. Worth mentioning here, she's retired, and does depend on bro and I for some financial help. Why can't we get dinner with her the day before, or after? She can't put to words why not, except ""we never make plans with her"". She won't compromise, she won't do dinner any night, and only will do dinner on Thursday. She also refuses to travel, in principal. We always have to come to her, and we would be picking her up for this now hypothetical dinner.

&amp;#x200B;

I lost my temper a bit, and told her I'm not going to take her sarcasm, emotional manipulation, and we won't deal with her ridiculous demands and lack of compromise on this, and walked out.

&amp;#x200B;

I do want to try and keep her happy, I understand she is lonely and has no other family (her family is all like her, as bad and succinct as that is). Every Easter and Thanksgiving, she pulls this shit, every year. Christmas, we give her the first choice - Dad's side always does an Eve and Day celebration, and bro and I don't care which we attend.  She still wants to see us both days, but that argument is much easier to drop. 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't mean to lose my cool, and I don't care about telling her whatever she needs to hear (within reason) to make her happy, but I won't let her dictate who my bro and I see any given holiday. I keep questioning my own logic here - I've chatted with a coworker, (who is a mom) and says ""Why can't you alternate years?"" - I can see that, but why do we have to alternate?? If this was 2 big groups of people, yes - That'd be the only good solution. But one group, and one person (as much as we love them both) - That one person should just settle. But maybe I'm not being subjective, just objective.

**What can I do? What do I need to communicate? Maybe I just need to vent here. Have any good reading on this, or advice?**

750,Im a senior in high school and a large part of applying is writing personal essays. Problem is that every time i try to write these I end up spiraling into a hole of self-hate. The questions and the thoughts they provoke only remind me of how much of an undeserving person I am. This while thing has done nothing but throw me back into a suicidal mindset but I need to get these essays done in three days. I guess im asking how to compartmentalize. I cant not apply to college but im on my 5th breakdown and I dont know what to do. Ive spent a long time trying to figure this out.,27Nov2019,1
751,So I applied for a part time position at a restaurant online and was offered an interview right away. Later that day they updated their post and said you must be able to work nights. I current have school at night Monday-Thursday so I would be unable to work those nights. Now I'm debating if I should go cause I have a lot of homework due tonight before our thanksgiving break. So I basically have to choose doing homework or going to this interview. I don't wanna go to the interview just for them to tell me they can't hire me because of my school schedule and miss out on time I could be doing homework.,27Nov2019,1
753,"I have asked this online before but everyone just ignores it or I get one “just talk to psychiatrist” which I can’t; they’re inaccessible. It makes me feel like no one cares or something is wrong with me for not conveying something right...but I'm going to try again. 

I want to get E into committed care indeterminately...he's mentally ill with schizophrenzia and a few other things I don't really understand. I haven’t gotten the treats of suicide on recording yet, but he threatens it often, self-harms--which there's proof of. E puts on a soft, levity-filled poker face around basically everyone else, including his psychiatrist. I've seen it happen in front of my face and it's scary.

And I do have sympathy for his issues, but I hit a permanent breaking point when I saw him physically assault my mom. It wasn't when I started crying and he was screaming at me and calling me a freak over it, or when he tried choking me when I was 12...it was then. I couldn't stand it. I want nothing to do with him.

Huge problem is that he seems to actually be forgetting stuff as well—like how he kicked me two months ago. I brought it up and he accused me of lying when I wasn't.

Otherwise, he has spent a lot of nights just talking to voices in his head and screaming about liberals, and often threatens suicide on and off, or to hurt other people. Sometimes he threatens it to us. Usually he's ok, but ends up getting pissed off. How it usually starts is that someone does something he doesn't like (i.e., read a book) and he starts verbally abusing them and will continue doing so for minutes or hours. When someone else steps in, he says it was the person's fault for doing that thing, and gets triggered because he feels like he's being bullied.

Today was possibly the worst so far. All started with him staying up for about 24/7 hours and my mom telling him “please get some rest” in a slightly raised voice (it sounded exasperated to me, I barely even heard it) and then he started verbally abusing her and saying she just ruined his day for being a harpy b\*tch and yelling at him, going on and on while she was just saying she was worried about him. 

I heard screaming from him and when I entered the room I saw her crying, I sat down and wanted to comfort her and I told E “Please leave the room” in a soft voice and then he started kicking the couch and destroying stuff, screaming “STOP BULLYING ME!” And I felt stupid for telling him what to do but realized his psychiatrist literally told him to isolate himself when he starts having anger issues. I said, ""just a few months ago I saw J (our brother) basically whisper to you to please stop talking about him and you screamed at him to stop screaming""...which did happen - J said so too - but E said it was me ""lying"" and ""hallucinating."" I was just trying to show him that he can overreact! 

I basically am done with him. I saw him attack my mom for the first time a month ago, and two when I called the cops after his first violent actions the…well. Cops didn’t really do anything, just talked to him. What I said about the ""poker face"" maybe made things worse. 

I don't know what to do.",27Nov2019,1
754,"I was like this ever since I flew out the taco. You put me in a toy store and say ""pick something, my treat!"" and I'd wander around the store for as long as the adult that was with me had patience before they finally crack and say ""JUST PICK SOMETHING SO WE CAN LEAVE!"" and I respond with ""I don't want anything."" so we go home. 

Now, as an adult living on my own, I'm the exact same way only it's a closed circuit. I don't have any friends or family or obligations other than going to work so I just kinda hoard cash in between work and sleep.  

Occasionally I'll think ""I wanna buy something."" and dive down a million rabbit holes doing as much research as humanly possible so I don't catch buyers remorse if I made a wrong purchase. However in doing this research I usually find myself going up the chain in cost until I'm looking at stuff that costs in the upper thousands. Then I step back and think ""Am I *really* going to spend $3,000 on an electric guitar? I don't even play guitar! Do you (me) know how many other things I could spend that money on!?"" 

So I climb out of the rabbit hole and dive into my self where I then imagine everything a human considers a 'need' and the cost of those things, then I go back into more rabbit holes, climb up the chain of costs and repeat the process eternally. All the while never buying anything and accumulating more Coin that will never see the light of day.

763,"Good lord, what a shit day this has been already.

Anyways, just found out that my cousin just got barely safed and now stays in a hospital.

He has had some major drug problems along major depression for quite a while now.

After his best friend told him that he does not want to be friends with him anymore, well, he wanted to end it once and for all.

It is really tough, especially since all of his current friends are somewhat involved with drugs. Which just is a bloody shame. Giving up drugs is hard enough. Giving up basically all of your friends is even worse. His parents don't seem to be very helpful either. Though he didn't really receive much love in his childhood anyway, he is now seen a black sheep by them. Which just makes everything far worse.

&amp;#x200B;

For the past couple months, I've been trying and trying to spend some time with him.

Genuine time, playing games, going for a walk, eating out. Just spending time together. Trying to integrate him to my friends and buddies. Didn't work at all.

But it seems as that simply cannot replace his drugs. As he still continues to do them, no matter his improvements. Ignoring me from time to time, I feel unable to help him dispise all of my efforts.  
I doubt that my previous tactic is gonna work better this time.

&amp;#x200B;

Although he has been to a psychiatry before, it didn't help at all. As a matter of fact, he met even more people involved with the whole drug craze. An absolute catastrophy.

Now he is once again required to go to once. I just pray for him, that somehow the right person just knows what to do.

767,"i’m aware the title is conflicting however it’s genuinely the best description i can come up with. 
for a long long while now, i’ve acknowledged that i’m emotionally challenged. it’s like i don’t feel anything and act like i do as the norm to convince not only everyone else but also myself. but i do still have times where i ‘feel things’ and can’t explain it. it’s like i subconsciously know how i should be feeling about something but the physical emotion never hits, it’s more of a cognitive reaction. but i’m not numb because being aware of how i struggle with emotion makes me feel both angry and hurt however it’s more mental emotions. 
this is difficult to articulate so i apologise for my confusing explanation but it’s like i feel emotions through manual cognitive action rather than natural, real, genuine emotion. it’s why i had to break up with my first long-term partner, i never loved him. although this may just be because he wasn’t someone i could live which i’m convinced is true, however i’m paranoid maybe i can’t truly love. 
this is distressing to me as i’ve always convinced myself my life’s purpose is to fall head over heels in love and i find love the most beautiful thing, so i’m worried i’ll never feel it. 
anger and fear are the two emotions i’ll feel. anger is always dimmed out for me, but that’s probably due to my mental vow to not express anger and this suppression maybe has affected to what extent i feel it. fear and anxiety are the only distinguishable emotions i seem to be able to access. 
i’m still a teenager, i don’t know what’s going on or why i struggle with this when i see people feel things with ease. and i can’t understand it myself, let alone someone else to understand it however i’m trying this out because nowhere has given me answers. i want to feel happiness, love, anger, pain. instead i cry (which is genuinely out of my control so i see as a good sign) but it doesn’t last and not many emotions come with it. it’s like my brain knows i should be feeling this but it doesn’t send the physical genuine emotions to me.

771,"My boyfriend moved in two months ago with his Pitbull. I have five Persian cats and also do pet boarding and dog daycare in my home. I only board dogs that I know will be good to my cats and these end up being Standard Poodles and Doodles about 90% of the time. My boyfriend said his Pitbull gets along well with all other dogs but his dog has proven him wrong with every single dog that I have kept over these past two months. That’s been about five or six dogs. 

The Pit plays well with these dogs and even snuggles up next to them but, sure enough, during each of their stays, he at some point freaks out for no reason and snaps at them until one of us breaks it up. Not just one snap, it’s more like an attack that lasts for a couple seconds. So far no dog has been injured. 

Another factor to this story is regarding my cats. My boyfriend’s dog adjusted to them within about three weeks and no longer tries to chase them but at night we keep his dog in our bedroom and the cats have the rest of the house, except for my one cat with special needs. She sleeps under the blankets with me and stays there all night except for about two times that we know of. Those times my boyfriend woke up to see the kitty sleeping with the dog on his bed. I’m used to having all the cats sleep with me but gave that up when the dog moved in. I really miss falling asleep with them and waking up with them but I’m trying to compromise. 

I used to think Pitbulls’ aggression was determinant on how they were raised but after doing some research on the breed a couple days ago, I’ve learned some disturbing statistics, including:


-In 1/3 of all fatal Pitbull attacks in which case a person in the household was killed, the Pitbull was NEVER abused, nor neglected. These were family dogs who often times had never shown any signs of aggression. 

-Two years ago, Pitbulls made up approximately 5% of the total dog population but were responsible for 60% or more of the fatal maulings of United States citizens.

-Retrievers were bred to retrieve, pointers bred to point, and Pitbulls bred to bullbait and rat, which means fighting and killing other animals. 

It’s been bred in their DNA to attack and kill and it’s virtually impossible to predict which ones will snap one day. And yes, I’ve known sweet Pitbulls who just want to lick your face all the time and be lap dogs, but these are cold hard statistics which do not lie. Proof is in the math!

After gaining this knowledge, how am I supposed to ever feel safe having this Pitbull in my house? He’s an accident waiting to happen, a ticking time bomb, a loaded gun. My boyfriend works from home in the basement so the dog can stay down there with him during the day, away from the cats and guest dogs, but during the evening and on weekends, what are we to do? Keep him on the 2nd level, separated from us and the other animals? And then what am I supposed to do with my cat who sleeps with me? I don’t think it’s fair for her to have to sleep away from me and boyfriend doesn’t think it’s fair for his dog to have to sleep away from him. Last night we slept in separate rooms so that we could each be with our own pet, which is absolutely crazy but that’s what happened. 

Pitbulls are illegal in the city we live in and I don’t even know if my homeowner’s insurance will cover a Pitbull so if anything ever were to happen, I’m at risk of being sued. Most importantly, I would NEVER forgive myself if the Pit seriously injured or killed one of my cats or visiting dogs. PLEASE HELP!!",27Nov2019,1

775,"So...I'm in a tough situation and I need advice on how to resolve it.  
 

Backstory: Until around 2016, I chatted on a website called Legends of Equestria, on a chatbox I loved hanging out on. I had a lot of fun hanging out and talking to my friends in the chatbox. It was my home for over a year. Family friendly chatbox, might I add. The mods were friendly but somewhat strict, but I don't blame them. People would occasionally come onto the server and troll us, until they were banned. I myself was banned twice, but not for anything huge. Just an argument or two, and myself and another person were banned to separate us, around a month.  

The Incident: I think this happened in summer of 2016. I was having a blast with my sister playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, and we took turns playing in missions with other people. While my sister played, I chatted away with my Legends of Equestria friends. At one point, when we switched, my sister asked if she could talk to my friends. Me, being the naive and stupid 15 year old I was, said yes. Now, I should mention, my sister was someone who had a tendency to cut corners and disobey some rules. She would sneak food upstairs, half-ass on worksheets and chores, get into my business, try to get me in trouble, not put her retainer in her mouth when told to, costing our mom a lot of money to pay for dentistry, a lot of things like that. So, I should have figured, by letting her talk on LoE's chatbox, I should have kept an eye on her, really. It IS my fault for letting her do so, unsupervised, but I wish I had known what she was about to do.  

Several minutes later, she told me (or I saw that) she had ***gotten me permanently banned from Legends of Equestria's chatbox and game as a whole.*** She had posted about Nazi ponies and other ridiculous shit, and I was permanently banned because of it. As much as I knew it was my fault, still, I was upset and LIVID. She BEGGED me not to tell our mom about it, but I eventually did....nothing could be done about it. Later my sister tried helping me appeal to unban, but the moderator was stern and said no.

In 2016 of that year, I found out about Discord. I still use it to this day. I talked with the moderator who could unban me from the site, and after a [stern conversation](http://prntscr.com/q30m02), I'm livid, furious, and upset. He gave me a choice on how I could handle this situation, mostly to send another appealing e-mail to try again, and provide proof other than me telling him my sister sent the messages. Now, I didn't have a phone back then, or the messages my sister sent, so I couldn't prove it. But I still want to know if there's a convincing reason to give him beyond my sister sending the messages. What could I possibly tell him to get him to listen? I don't know what to do, and I really miss playing Legends of Equestria. If anyone has any advice on what to do or say, please tell me. I've missed years of the game because of my stupidity and my sister not bothering to read the rules.",27Nov2019,1

I’ve had severe depression and for almost 10 years and bad social anxiety whenever I was in school or tried to go back. 

Probably from problems at home, struggling to make friends and having to constantly hide that my mother was a teacher at the secondary school I was in.

To deal with my depression I’ve tried: counselling, CBT, doctors, more counselling, antidepressants, more CBT, alternative healing, changing countries, diet changes and exercise. 

None of which have helped. I’m now trying to go see a psychiatrist privately since my GP can’t refer me and I have to go back to where I did CBT despite them saying they can’t offer anything other than CBT and counselling 🙃.

Other than that, I started smoking weed shortly after I began the medication since it caused big drops in my mood and that’s probably what kept me here so long. A few days ago I tried a small amount of LSD a couple days ago and I’m guessing I had a bad trip and a mental break down. 

During my trip at some point my depression disappeared, I was clear headed, full of energy, the numbness that’s been eating away at me for so long was gone and I finally felt in control of myself.

That’s when it all went south. 

I realised 4 things:

I need to stop hoping that I’ll get back together with my ex.

I need to move the fuck out of my parents house.

I don’t want to kill myself but it really does feel like the only option at times.

And I realised how much my depression has taken away from me and how different my life could be if I wasn’t like this. That’s when I had my little mental break down had to leave my house at 3am and eventually decided I need to fix my life.

I stopped talking to her the day after but moving on is hard, I went through a lot with her and she was the person I was closest to and other than her I have 3 friends and we don’t talk much.

I recently got back from trying life in another country. Which honestly felt like the same shit with a different background.

I currently don’t have a job and I know I need to find one I don’t want to be working a pointless minimum wage dead end job where I’m struggling financially for rest of my life.

Which leads me to my next problem, the heck do I do?

I have an interests in plants, mushrooms outdoors, forests, walking, cars, mechanics, welding, driving, folklore and some history.

I’ve taken a few career tests and they’ve all come back with: forester and park ranger but my problem with that is the pay.
Average pay for a park ranger is less than £20k and for a forester 22k

With rent prices what they are that’s not really viable unless I move to a different part of the country.

Other options I’ve thought of are I learn something computer based, save up and buy a camper van and work remotely as I travel around but I’m not sure how viable that is or what I should learn.

If anyone has any ideas, advice , directions on what to do or anything else I can do it would be helpful",27Nov2019,1

The company are known to take the mick a bit so I just wanted clarification without having to ask my employer who'd probably lie about it. If anyone has any advice/tips in regards to handing in my notice before the holidays, but still getting my holiday pay, that would be appreciated.

People here thinks it's funny to hurt people, like slapping them in the head, pushing, punching and kicking them , even stabbing people with a math compass.

795,"Hi guys so I’ve joined this app that is mainly for creating new friends and the app is strictly for girls. It’s like a tinder but to find friends. I’ve been on this app since June and met a pretty good handful of people. 

So background story on this one girl I met she was alright and all but she was a foreign student from Mexico that came here to nyc (where I live). It went good we had pizza and talked. 

But here’s where it went all wrong. On Halloween I asked her about her plans and we agreed to go to the Halloween parade together. But last minute she tells me she’s bringing another friend. Red flag #1 she agreed to meet up with me at 6-6:30 but ended up making me wait and she met up with me at 8:30. She would not answer my texts as if she didn’t want me to come anymore so I had to text her multiple times that night to confirm if we’re still meeting and if she was finished getting ready like updates etc. 

Second when I met up with her and her friend the entire time I was getting ignored by her. Even when I would try to make myself included in the “group” she wouldn’t even acknowledge me. It was super awkward felt like I was third wheeling and didn’t even belong. Long story short I felt very uncomfortable and left after we walked the parade. 

Now here’s the part I need help with. So I hosted a plan on the app I mentioned to go to the thanksgiving day parade. Luckily 2 girls are interested in joining me. But guess what I received a text today asking if I’m going to the parade. I deleted her number but I asked who is this and she replied that it was her ...

I’m unsure whether I should reply again and let her join or just full on ignore her. To me overall she seemed like a shitty person and just cares to resort to me last minute so she’s not alone. I don’t want her to come with me but at the same time I’m a super nice person and I feel bad. I don’t want to get walked all over on and have her treat me like shit and kick me to the side. 

Also since the Halloween parade she hasn’t texted me or checked up on me AT ALL. It was always me texting first. I think she just wants a good time... thoughts ?? Should I give her another chance. (Btw I haven’t confronted her at all about how I felt that night)",27Nov2019,1

799,"Every few days, after around 2 hours after I wake up, I get a pain in one of my knees and/or ankles. This pain will generally last the entire day. I had used to run track and field for three years, 9km a week, 3km every practice. My third year I had to drop out and undergo 3 months of physiotherapy, every single day. I had an x ray on both legs, and a CT scan on my right ankle (which I might add it was my LEFT ankle I had the insane trouble with before) and they didn't see anything wrong with it. Three years later I notice myself more and more struggling to walk more and more frequently. I will get a sharp pain in my left knee, minor pain in my left ankle, and won't be able to walk without limping, lest I endure the major pain. I'd say this has happened around 2-3 times a week. This is hard for me because my school is a 10 minute walk from my place, I don't have my license, and my job requires me to stand for ~2-7 hours straight, with a lunch break on my 8 hour shifts. Should I invest in a folding cane? While I wouldn't say I NEED one it would bring some amount of benefit to my life. A folding one would be ideal so I could easily store it in my bookbag, and so I wouldn't need to carry it around all the time, only when needed.

I've been living with my parents my whole life. Lately I've been feeling lost and basically like I'm stagnating. I've chalked it down to fear, mostly fear of failing. I want to improve at things but I don't find myself making any progress because I'm constantly switching tasks as soon as they get difficult. I'm overdrawn and don't have a job (I get a shift like once a month, zero hour contract). 

There are many things I'd like to 'be' good at. I've found almost nothing I'd actually like to 'get' good at though. I've not found anything worth suffering for and it's making my life meaningless. I have a degree but I am absolutely clueless and unemployable in my field. Whenever I try to sit down and do something I have a huge urge to run away and do something else.

806,"My 7-year-old cousin is currently struggling with reading. Any time she learns a new word or grammatical rule, she'll remember it for a while and then instantly forget it when a new one is taught. She gets letters mixed up often and when I sit down with her while she reads, I noticed that whenever she comes across an unfamiliar word, she'll replace it with a random word and moves on. I've told her many times to sound out a word if she doesn't know it but it doesn't stick. I feel that it might be too early to consider if it's dyslexia. I mainly think it's because she has an abnormally small attention span. I've told my aunt many times that she needs to stop giving her the iPad for prolonged hours and she needs to make the effort to sit with her and read every night. Doesn't help that my aunt also fails to discipline her. I'd gladly do it myself but I live on campus so I'm only around during vacation and certain weekends. Recently, I heard from my mother that her teachers say she doesn't know even basic reading skills as she doesn't attempt to read any given text and there's a high chance she will have to repeat the grade.

807,"Here’s a story for the records. I’m extremely distraught and desperate at this point and if he hurts anybody or he hurts himself I will never forgive myself. He hasn’t been caught for any crimes so I can’t exactly turn him into the police. Jail or prison doesn’t focus on rehabilitation, and finding the appropriate help for him that is my goal here. My boyfriend and I have kids together. So I can’t just take my kids and walk away. I have however taken my kids right now because he is unstable. They’re asking questions, I’m making excuses. And I’m sitting here racking my brain, googling things making phone calls asking about inpatient treatment centers.
      Here’s a summary of the back story. My boyfriend had a terrible childhood. He was in and out of foster care. He was sexually abused by 5 or more people and the abuse was consistent throughout his childhood and teenage years. His child psychologist abused him for nearly 8 years. The one who was supposed to be guiding him through all of the other abuse and sexual assault that he had been through. He told me that these incidences happened to him almost daily. He had become so desensitized by sex because people who were supposed to protect him had used his body and manipulated him so much that he felt like that was all he had to offer. He became addicted to porn, around 10 I want to say. Also around the age of 10 he was forced to have sex with another girl in foster care by one of their guardians and it happened a lot. these types of acts continued and he would act out and start fires and get in fights. He got into a lot of trouble with the legal system. He has been in and out of prison since he was 17. When I met him he had been out for 6 months and he hasn’t been back since. It’s been a few years.. so his sexual addiction hasn’t really had the chance to grow past porn and Craigslist hook ups because he couldn’t stay out of prison. He’s been out for 2 years now, and his addiction is advancing at an alarming rate. He has thoughts in his head that terrify HIM. He’s impulsively partaking in voyeuring which is basically a peeping Tom. He’s  been caught Walking around the neighborhoods at night doing these kinds of things. his life is in shambles now because he lost his family and his home and right before he lost all of those things he was in a 12 step group that he had joined. He has been in counseling for 7 months. He wants the help. He just needs a lot more than 1 counseling session a week and a 12 step support group once a week. I cannot find any sort of inpatient treatment in the city that we live in. They’re all for substance abuse and suicide. There are psychotherapists (which he just barely stated seeing one 7 months ago). These thoughts and acts are torturing him. He said he refrained for a while, but there was just this strong pull that wouldn’t leave him that he gave into every time he felt the need to creep around and night and peep on people. He’s scared he’s too far gone and he’s terrified that he is going to hurt somebody. He told me last night that he is losing it, and I’m terrified about what’s going to happen. He has shared a few of his thoughts with me that constantly go through his head and they’re horrifying. They involve murder and rape. He said it’s like an involuntary obsession and he can’t control his thoughts and he doesn’t know who to turn to. I don’t know how to help him. I can’t find any resources. I can only find articles and stories of people like him who were tossed aside, and labeled as a tragedy because his addiction is severely stigmatized and a lot of people believe that there is no hope for people like him.",27Nov2019,1

819," 

A few months ago, I posted the story of how I was accused of sexual harassment by a girl because I kissed her on the head. Eventually, people found out she was full of crap and my name was cleared. For the first few weeks, most people really hated her guts and I had many people come up to me and start a conversation about how what she had done was unacceptable.

It has been 8 months since then and I can't say that things are the same as they were back then. Lots of people who were against her are now her friends and hang out quite often, even though whenever they are talking to me and the subject of her accusation comes up, they still insult her and calling her untrustworthy, a liar and one even called her crazy. I don't care much about this fact alone, what drives me insane is the fact that some of those people, I also hang out with, so I am forced to be in the same friend group as her and interact with her on a daily basis. I also can't understand why people want to spend time with her.

That chick is a pathological liar and is willing to lie about anything if it means getting sympathy. Even after she was exposed for the liar that she is, people still fall for her lies. She's telling them that her cousin supposedly beat her once, that she's seeing a therapist and even that she has serious heart disease. I can easily tell that what she sais is obviously made up but the others just believe her without question. If she is willing to tell lies this big for the sake of getting attention, why trust her? I am not the only one she has lied about and I will surely not be the last.

What I hate more, is the fact that she thinks she can get away with doing things like this. People no longer judge her for it, they still believe her, they still give her compassion and sympathy. I bet if I people had never learned the truth and still thought I was a sexual predator, they wouldn't have just forgotten about it and kept having me around as they did with her.

What happened today really irritated me. We were in a group of 4 people and one of them had to leave, so she gave her a gave and then kissed her on the chick. So by her standards, she now has the right to accuse her of sexual harassment huh?

One last thing she does that drives me insane is that she eavesdrops whenever I talk to someone in private. She follows us from behind, sits close to us and even when I show her I've noticed her, she doesn't leave. I hope she burns in hell.",27Nov2019,1

831,"OK get ready for word vomit. so i live in england and im 16 yrs old in year 11. right around now im supposed to be applying for colleges. for those of you who don't know, we go to college after year 11 until we are 18. my parents are split up and up until about 6 months ago, i was living with my mum in london, and i am now living with my dad. my mum has bipolar schizoaffective disorder and i moved to live with my dad was because she stopped taking her meds and essentially, her mind was deteriorating every day for over 6 months. i went through hard times bc of that and being in that house brings back horrible memories. i visit every month or so and even that is difficult. her only ""income"" is disability money and so the water pressure is so low it's a hassle to wash my hands, she's bad with money and spends it all at the beginning of the month. she also has a dog which is never walked and ends up shitting on the floor. in short, being there and seeing her like that makes me feel like shit. in the last two months, she's been admitted to the hospital twice because she stopped taking them again. i guess i've lost a lot of trust in her? but i guess she can't be blamed, and i don't actually know what her mind is like. but she isn't the same as i remember her, she might not ever be again. i don't know if i added to her stress and all of her stresses led to her doing this, but if i'm one of the causes then i'd rather keep my distance. i've had to live in this lifestyle my whole life and it never made me think ""wtf this is disgusting"" or that i should be cleaning up after her, but after living here with my dad, i'd hate to go back. we have a nice house which me and his wife keep clean and fresh, enough income to never run out of gas or electricity, amazing food cooked by both of them, and my siblings to keep me entertained. but now that im nearly going to sixth form/college, my dad says it'd be best to go back to my mum's. i fully understand since they are going through a LOT financially. to put it simply, my dad earns a lot of money, but there are a shit load of out goings. he has a lot of debts, mortgages and other things i dont understand that need to be paid off. also, the colleges in london are significantly better than the ones around where i currently live. this would mean living with my mum, OR... in england, you're legally allowed to leave home without parents permission at 16. ofc i wouldnt do this behind anyones back, but i would like to have some advice on talking to my parents about living alone. there are a lot of factors to consider: how i'll earn enough money to pay rent,bills, etc. if im responsible enough to live alone, how to even get a living place in LONDON, and convincing my parents to let me. there are probably more but you get the point. what i want advice on is first of all: should i even consider it? is it worth thinking about, or will i be wasting time? if its a decent idea, can anyone give me any insights about what it'd be like? tysm for reading, i'd be really pleased if anyone replies.",27Nov2019,1
832,"So I’m a F size 10 foot and the slipper socks I bought from Costco ranged from size 4-10 (I have no idea why companies do this ridiculous sizing estimate but whatever). I knew they may be too small but I wanted to take a chance since the design was adorable and they’re pretty big socks. Unfortunately they ended up being just barely too tight. 

Does anyone know a way to stretch out a sock? The calves aren’t really the problem, it’s general tightness around the heel and middle area of my foot.

835,"Hello. I got a new job, the office just opened and every employee started within same time, we are located in a different state so the boss or main manager are never here. We have 4 employees, I am the youngest with least (shortest) experience (5 years), English is not my native language so its even harder for me but I am doing fine. For the first 2 weeks the boss was here and everything went smooth, he wanted to make someone an office manager. When talking to him privately I said good things about my coworker - she is an educated person with 30 year experience, she seemed nice at the very beginning. They made her the manager of our office. Here is when things started to get worse, ill give you few examples where I tried hard to keep avoid an unnecessary conversation:

- we were working on a new software, the manager asked me if I found some feature, I said no but I found was able to get the same information using a different software (connected to the new one), she started asking me dozens question like how did I access it, why I was looking for it, she wanted to know all details and was rude about it. It wasnt anything sensitive or anything that I should use, its something that I use on daily basis but she just did not that this feature even exist so she was asking some stupid questions, she finally gave me a break about that, but than she was complaining about some paperwork that I left on her desk - I'll write about it below

- we were both working on same account, I found that she is making major mistakes so I printed everything associated with those mistakes to show her the details on what needs to be corrected and nicely showed her what's wrong, she did not say thank you, just asked why am I even looking into this...I could not do my job part if she wouldn't correct those mistakes

- one more situation, we got a fax from another office (thats what she said), she put it on my desk and said that I need to take care of it, it did not include any info on who sent it or where was it sent from. I asked who faxed it and she said that its from Jennifer from another office because she recognised the hand writing, I went to the fax machine to pull the transaction report to see who the sender was, as soon as I came to the fax machine she was sighing loud and making irritation faces, than she said something like ""what are you doing? I just told you who faxed it"", I said that I just want to make sure I fax it back to the correct person. There was nothing in the transaction report about this fax so I am really questioning how did she get it

There was more situations like this. I'm trying to be nice and stay calm but it's really stressing me out. I am a quiet person, little shy.

Whenever I come to her with any questions or papers that she is responsible for, I see her making those rude faces. Shes also complaining about everyone's work at the other offices, I really dont want to hear it so I am listening to music through earbuds.

She is asking me a lot of basic work related questions that she doesnt know how to do, I always help her out and explain everything. She never says ""thank you"", all she says its ""thats what I though"" or ""just wanted to get second opinion"", but I am sure that she sees it for the first time.

When I ask her something that I am not able to do because I dont have a password or I am working on a software that she was working on for the last 20+ years, she never gives me a quick answer, she always want to know every non important think on why do I need it and the solution that she gives me is not correct. Even today, I asked her if she could help me locate a feature that was required in order to complete a task, she gave me a wrong direction on what to do and never answered my question. I tried to tell her that this is not the right way to do this, all she said was ""how long have you been using this system?"", I was using it for just few days, than she said ""I've been using it for 20 years"". That feature was a basic thing that every system in that work field has it, she just doesnt know that that it exists (I was talking with her about it few weeks ago and she did not know what I am talking about). 

She is using her certifications and education as an argument of being the smartest, her theoretical knowledge is great - I give her that, but she does not know how to complete a basic task and she wont listen to other suggestions.

When she answers a call from the boss or anyone who is on a higher lever, she is cute, sweet, nice and telling funny jokes.

She is nice when we have a non job related talk, but I noticed that she is very nosy and want to know everything. I cant say that I dont like her, I do to some point but I feel that I would do a much better work without her.

I would really want to keep a good team relationship so I cant just tell the boss about it, he likes her and he thinks that she is wonderful and professional.

One more thing that drives me nuts, I bet that my salary is the lowest out of all employees, I dont really care about that BUT - from my first day Ive been cleaning every account and making sure everything is complete and finalized, I am positive that I completed 80%, where other coworkers all together done only 20%, that manager completed maybe 3% because I am keeping record of everything. Even though she says she done for example January's, February's and March report, shes lying because I was the one who did it. I do the work but everyone shares the trophy. The manager speaks out loud that we both done it, am sure the boss thinks that I am just helping her which is not true.

I am seriously considering looking for a new job. What would you do in this situation? How would you react? What do you think about the manager? Am I overreacting?

I tried to keep it as short as possible but I wanted to give you an idea on how it is. Sorry for my english. I will appreciate any opinion.

Tl;dr I got a new job, all employees including managers are new, the manager is being nosey and thinks she's the smartest in the world. I do most work but she eats the trophy and lies that shes doing stuff when I am the only one who done it.",27Nov2019,1

837,"She’s been with this guy for two years. He’s always been somewhat emotionally neglectful imo from what I know. A month or two ago he suddenly said “we’re done.” Then he told her after the fact it was because he cheated.

Long story short, she thinks she’s ending things but she isn’t. They might as well still be together. They talk nonstop. On Sunday, he flipped out on her saying that it’s her fault he cheated and she’s just too much to deal with and he can’t handle her problems for her. He blamed everything on her and said it’s her fault that they’re the way they are now. An hour later, he was FaceTiming her saying “I love you” and “please answer.”

He’s a sad, insecure, evil human being. The shit he does, it’s like he researches how to manipulate people. He makes her feel like shit and blames her for everything, but then an hour later texts her “I love you” and “you don’t love me, I don’t deserve you.”

It’s gotten to the point where our other friends have started arguments with him, and he’s so fucking nasty during that. My favorite quotes from earlier today are “when am I supposed to be happy,” “why do I have to put in effort all the time,” and “her problems are PEANUTS compared to mine.” Then a little while later he texted my friend “I love you and I’m sorry I’ve been so disrespectful, I respect your decision if you want to leave me,” and basically said “but don’t leave me though I’m worth it.”

TLDR, she comes into school talking about all this shit and knows how fucking awful it is. But all his manipulation has worked. She said “I’d rather be with him and miserable than happy without him.” She still loves him. How do you help someone like that? Even when she already knows that he’s awful?",27Nov2019,1
838,"My good friend (F 18) lives in France and she’s been going out with an Algerian guy (M 21) for nearly two years. At first everything seemed to be going great but rather quickly I started noticing certain things about her that were different. She’s a very beautiful girl and she likes to dress up and wear makeup occasionally when she goes out. Ever since dating him she’s been fully prohibited by him to wear makeup or wear shorts, skirts, crop tops or anything too revealing for him. When she’s at the beach, he makes her wear a full swimsuit with a long sweater over it, so she’s given up even going. She is also forced to share her location with him at all times and she doesn’t get to see his. He made her unfollow all her male friends on social media and she can’t talk to any guy anymore. He’s also pretty obviously cheated on her before because he went out with his guy friends to a vacation island and came back with an STD but somehow he convinced her otherwise. I see what she looks like now and it’s really concerning, she looks frail and skinny and just very unhealthy. They argue a lot but she keeps giving him the benefit of the doubt. “He just gets jealous so he doesn’t want me to talk to other guys, it’s ok it’s because he loves me...” that kind of stuff. I don’t get it, she’s a very smart girl and she seems very blinded to this whole situation. I’ve mentioned again and again that she deserves to be happy but also free of choice without being manipulated the way she is but she shrugs it off. What else can I do?

839,"sorry if the formatting is weird I'm on mobile.
I (17f) have a friend (18m) and he often claims that I'm one of his best friends. He genuinely cares about me, and I'd like to have a good relationship with him, but I can't. He's manipulative and a bit of a narcissist. I used to like him, and he knew about it and led me on. When I confronted him about this, he gave me a bunch of BS excuses, like ""I'm just not ready for a relationship"" (which wasn't true, he asked a girl out less than a week after this conversation) and ""you just didn't meet my standards"" and even pulled the god card by saying he was called to not pursue me (we're both christians, but he makes a lot of claims like this and I don't believe him).

He lies about so many things that don't matter that I have no idea what is true and what isn't.

he claims that he hates how everyone is fake on social media, proceeds to portray himself very differently from how he is irl.

he claims that he would never get snapchat because it's stupid and shallow, gets it anyway

he claims that he would never put one of those anon messaging things on his story because it's damaging, proceeds to do it every few weeks

claims that he isn't judgmental, always talks about people behind their backs

claims to care about what I think, clearly does not.

claims that his parent's divorce has not affected him, constantly makes depressing jokes about it and complains

I don't know if these issues sound dumb, but it's really frustrating to be lied to constantly, even if it's little things. I don't generally care who posts what, but if they're going to give someone else shit for it and then do it without apology, I'll have a problem with it.

I don't want to cut him off, but I don't know how to confront him anymore. He keeps saying we're close but he only talks to me when he wants to borrow money (which he doesn't give back for a long time) or needs to vent about something. I want to find a way to lovingly tell him that he's toxic and needs to sort his shit out, but I can't figure out how to do it kindly.

845,"Hello everyone, I'm a 20 year old male looking for any advice on a decision that'll probably change the outcome of my future. I have a choice to pick between two schools and I'm racking my brain trying to figure out which one to choose.

For a little background (feel free to skip as it isn't super important, but it's definitely influencing my decision a good bit.) I had been attending a school for 1 1/2 years but, to make it short, due to some psychopathic roommates had to transfer out. While overall I'd say my experience going away for that year and a half I have grown as a person immensely. I've learned so much about myself and others that I can't say I regret going there even after everything that went down. This past year I've been attending community college and doing much better for myself. My only gripe is that being home is extremely boring. I'm going to list the pro's and cons of each school, and hopefully  anyone reading could share some experiences or advice with me that could influence my decision. One school I'd be living at home and the other I'd be going away.

**School that I'd have to go away for**

Pro's:

* I wouldn't be stuck home all day, I'd probably have much, much more fun than if I stayed home (this is really the main pro for me)

* I would be able to grow as a person again, just like I went away last time

* I could make a ton of new friends and meet new people

Cons:

* It would be far more expensive than the other school, I will compare the prices at the bottom of the post.

* I could get yet another psycho roommate

* While the school does support my major, people aren't exactly flocking to that school for it

**Staying home school**

Pros:

* This is by far a more prestigious school than the other. Getting a degree from this one would be much more impressive than the other.

* It is also by far the cheaper option, by about 1/4th.

* This school has an entire section dedicated to my major.
* I might even be able to get a job to generate some passive income.

Cons:

* I will most certainly be bored out of my mind

* I doubt I'd make any more than a small handful of new friends, my social life would likely wither and die

* It would significantly harder to maintain a high GPA vs. the other school.

So yeh reddit, it may seem obvious to some, but I'm stumped. I'm a very social person who loves making new friends and hanging out with new people. I'm leaning more towards staying home just off the cost alone, so for the moment of truth;

Going away would likely cost *$18,000* a semester, while staying home would cost about *$4,500* a semester.",27Nov2019,1
847,"I'm a bit stuck and honestly she is making me incredibly angry and sometimes I ask myself why I'm even her friend anymore cus I believe I deserve better than this.  
Lately a lot of things has happened in my friend group that turned a lot of people against her, I however, stuch with her because she's my best friend of course. Everytime I would hang out with my other friends they would talk smack about her a lot and I would always get them to stop because it wasn't helping anyone and I believed that it was wrong to do so.   
I care a lot about this person so I want the best for them, so much so that I'm taking her to her first concert in January, I'm always open to give her advice when she needs it and I am even helping get a stable job and accommodation.   
However this week has just made me feel incredibly unwanted by her even when I try to set up a conversationor try to get us to do something. Most of the time when I ask her a question she never answers it, she ignores me hardcore on snapchat even when it's important and ditches playing video games and hanging out with me to play with some other dudes from across the ocean.  
A lot of the time she gives me hardcore attitude as well when I'm trying to be as nice as possible but I am seriously about to snap and just call it off. I know she's having a really tough period in her life but I am the only person she acts this way with and it's getting me to really feel miserable whenever I speak to her. This is someone that would ask me to face time and discord call every day for hours and when we didn't do that would snapchat eachother heavily.   
I feel used because I do so much for this person but am getting nothing back and I'm feeling irritated because she pays no mind to me at all anymore. Should I just call off the friendship ignore her? Should I tell her how I feel (I feel like I would be too brutal if I did this) or should I just let it continue the way it is while she can think we're best friends.

848,"I'm getting engaged very soon to my partner of over three years. My sisters have been... let's just say, not very supportive of my relationship the entire time. They always have something bad to say about him, despite spending barely any time with him, they don't talk to him if I bring him along to family events, they don't want to get to know him, yet they have somehow convinced themselves that he's a manipulative liar and our relationship is terrible with absolutely zero proof of the matter.

Whenever they start bashing on him, I immediately jump in to defend him, I've always been a very sensitive person so having my family say bad things about someone I truly love upsets me and I do cry a little, and they use that as an excuse, he makes me cry so our relationship must not be good. Whenever I ask them for proof of what they think he is, they go straight to ""we are you older sisters and know what's best for you"" and ""we only want to protect you"". 

I am terrified of how they are going to react when I do announce my engagement, due to how they have been acting during our relationship. As well as this, I am planning to ask my best friends to be my bridesmaids/maid if honour, rather than my sisters simply because of their behaviour and my worries of how they react when I tell them I'm engaged to my boyfriend. I feel like they will tell me that he has pushed me away from them and that he is forcing them out of my life, when they themselves are doing so with their behaviour. It seems to me, and it has for a long time before I even met my partner, that because I'm so much younger then them (6 - 8 year age gap) that I am too young to be able to make my own decisions or think for myself.

We have a lot of fun and talk about random shit and sometimes pretty deep stuff she doesn't tell any1. Yesterday we started Thanksgiving break so we didn't have school (she has to get off her phone pretty early on school nights) and as usual she asks to ft me and we do from around 3 to us both falling asleep at 11 the only reason she hung up was cuz her phone died and I woke up to it at like 5 in the morning.

857,"So, my boyfriend (28 M) and I (25 F) are considering becoming domestic partners. I’ve never encountered anyone in a DP before, so I wanted to hear about your experiences with it, and if it sounds like a good idea. We live in Ohio (since DP laws vary by state).

Some more background:
BF and I have known each other for years and have been dating for almost a year. 
We were roommates for a while before we dated. He moved out and a year later we started dating. With the amount of times he stayed the night, we basically lived together. 
In November, we officially signed a lease together on a house of our own.
Financially we’re quite intertwined, but we have our own bank accounts.
Lastly yet perhaps most importantly, we are so happy. We work great as a team, have tackled many obstacles together, and are excited to see what the future holds for us! We talk about the future a lot (marriage, etc.), but we both have agreed that now isn’t the time. 

What brought this to our attention was insurance. My insurance at work is amazing and free, and his would be $200+ a month and shitty. This alone feels like enough to enter this partnership, imo! Plus, in his mind we’re basically domestic partners already - exclusive, long term, financially linked, etc. 

What gives me pause is how “pre marriage” this feels. I don’t want to take this lightly! Even though if he proposed today my answer would be yes without hesitation... asdfghj basically, is there any reason we shouldn’t do this?",27Nov2019,1

Turns out the agency I went through was fraud and the founder was arrested by the FBI. Tried going to college again...I had a 4.0 and was on the honor society, but then got sexually assaulted. I had panic attacks on campus. The administration asked me to work on my mental health and once I go to therapy they would accept me back...it's been two years since then. I spoke to the Vice President of the college last week and told her how it's been difficult to find a compatible therapist and she refused my readmittance. I got a promotion to be a manager at work...but now they cut my hours and haven't officially promoted me. But last night a new guy walked in and said he was starting as manager even though I was asked to train him. I don't know what to do. I try and nothing is working.",27Nov2019,1

He's been supportive to her in a rough patch of her life so she doesn't want to break up with him but, nowadays, whenever he grabs her or kisses her she said it felt disgusting and as if she were being ""raped"" (her words), I don't understand how she is still not trying to get herself out of this, she told me she is working on an amicable way to end it because she doesn't have the courage to ""hurt him"" but I told her that she is bottling up a lot of trauma by letting him do this to her every day.

864,"Hello to anyone willing to help me out here,

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to start this by saying something I personally really hate and I think it's absurd, but I am officially diagnosed since I am a kid with ADHD. If you ask for my personal opinion, I know this exists and I know people have huge problems with it, to the point where they cannot get their life together, but I am not even close to that.

I am now working for 4 years in a full-time job where concentration is required almost constantly. I won't say I am the best, for sure I am worse than some of my colleagues, and they also know that I am bad at concentration, but in the end, I will get my job done. 

Whole problem start since I decided to study, I was never a big fan of studying, for one, because I hate doing exams, I always forget everything while doing one, sweating like a pig. Secondly, I am not the best when it comes to concentrating on subjects I don't like, which makes even more problems when you have limited time left from your day and you have other things to be done.

So what happens in the end, I come back from work, let's say I have 4-5 hours left to do all my other duties, laundry, dishes, learning for university and so on. I will for sure spend 1-3 hours just for foolish things like watching Youtube, browsing Reddit or even more absurd things. Sometimes it is worse, sometimes it is better. It also heavily depends if I am with my girl, she kinda knows how to start my inner panic monster so I start doing stuff, instead of wasting my time. 

What I tried till now is planning my day with Todoist and do the Pomodoro tactic. I would say it got better, but I would lie if I would say I get things done faster and more properly. I am still leaving the task behind that I don't want and I for sure am not spending all my potential time with things I should be doing, like the university. I also tried ""blocking"" all distractions, so I won't have access to Youtube and so on. But I will put it this way, I will always find something else to do and I am too addicted to gaming to leave that completely hanging since gaming was always my escape from reality when life got hard. 

So what do you guys suggest I could do? 

PS: I won't accept any kind of medication as an answer, I don't like any kind of medical treatment for this.",27Nov2019,1
865,"I am writing this on behalf of someone else with their permission.

&amp;#x200B;

He has been married to his spouse for 14 years. Initially, they were married for the purpose of having kids. They had two, then she was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy. She began drinking and smoking heavily, and would spend all of her money on beer and rarely on the kids. She became emotionally abusive and their ideas about raising children were extremely different. They eventually came to the agreement to be separated and end the relationship, and work on a divorce in the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

One drunken night, they slept together and had their 2 year old. They decided to move forward with raising him, while still being separated, but living together and sleeping in different bedrooms for years. She has become extremely emotionally abusive and very manipulative, so he would leave the house for days at a time and be homeless, sleeping on the streets, but still keeping in contact with his kids.

&amp;#x200B;

About a month ago, he prepared the children for his leaving, but he made it clear that he still wanted to see his children outside of school and be able to pick them up from school. He finally left and now he's homeless and living out of his car. Whenever he requests to see his kids, his wife ignores him, takes the phones away from the kids so that they won't talk to him, and especially will not let him see his 2 year old. He purchased and pays for their phone bills. 

The place he was living in with his family is owned by the mother-in-law and all of their brothers and sisters live on the lot. They threaten to hurt him if he steps foot on the property and he is not in any way welcomed back.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, he began dating a woman who he is very clearly in love with. His wife found out stalking his Google photos, told him he was cheating, and now says that she doesn't want the kids around them because she doesn't feel ""safe"" and that's the new excuse for not letting him see his kids. There was an incident where she was in the car with him when she texted him to see his kid and she'd drop him off. He took the opportunity, but when she found out that his girlfriend was in the car she quickly got out of her car, yelled at the girlfriend, and took the son back. She called the police and told them that he had a ""temper,"" and to avoid a scene, he gave the child back. As of yesterday, his mother (the grandma) and his father are also not allowed to see their grandkids. He is working a job that doesn't pay enough for him to be able to afford a lawyer at the moment. What are his options?

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: Husband and wife are separated with 3 kids. He's homeless and she lives on her mom's property where he is not welcome. She's keeping him from seeing his kids and telling the kids stories about their dad hating them and abandoning them despite him reaching out. He is dating a new woman and wife is using that as more of a reason to keep his kids from him. What steps can he take?**",27Nov2019,1
866,"I'm so sorry if this gets lengthy. I haven't been able to express my feelings to anyone properly and this has been brewing up for months.

I'm not talking about my appearance (that's a separate low self esteem issue lol) but I cant seem to have the confidence to feel like anything I like or anything I want to do is legitimate.

For example, id like to ask my teacher for a university letter of recommendation as we need to apply soon, and my dream is to work animation, and it has been since I was a little girl. I'm considering going to a university centred around the arts. I work hard towards this goal and I draw often and decently well (or at least this is what I'll say on a good day), but I don't have the guts to even tell my teacher that this is my dream job. I'm so afraid of not being taken seriously for what I TRULY want to do, to the point that I only took science courses for my higher education, which I know is so stupid (it was parental pressure as well), but I'm working as best as I can around that. Now I'm even more afraid of not being taken seriously for my original goal because I took sciences; maybe I seem indecisive or not genuine. I was just scared. It makes me feel like a total failure.

Over the last few months, my confidence began to fall in other parts of my life as well. I do volunteering for a different school (helping marking papers and making resources for the kids) and my first day was today, and my own school keeps track of the hours that we do for volunteering as it's compulsory to do at least 30 hours. I did 3 hours today, and yet I don't feel like I deserve to have this marked down? I feel guilty for being acknowledged for the work I did myself. It's just so constant. If I get good grades, I don't feel happy, sometimes I feel nothing at all, sometimes I feel undeserving. I'm embarrassed to express things I'm interested in. I feel like a bad friend, a bad daughter, a bad student and person. My self esteem is so low. It's starting to affect my social life because of how inferior I feel. 

I'm sick of it. How to have higher confidence in myself as a person?",27Nov2019,1

I moved to a new state about 3 moths ago. Now I'm kinda stuck in a hole with school. I slacked earlier in the year, just not doing some of my work and not caring. I realize there's nothing that can be done now, but I have some make up work I can do and I'm supposed to be doing it. I just can't find the motivation to do it though. I can't sit there and concentrate on what I need to do. 

I can barely walk around or have a conversation without being self-conscious about it and thinking everybody hates me. I am especially self-conscious about my acne as I have it pretty bad. Also, I can't smell myself, but my family says I stink and walking around feeling like I stink is horrible. Sometimes people say something about my acne and I just wanna shrivel away, but being a competitive person, I try not to let that bother me as then the mean people win.

I hate myself and I only focus on negatives, both of myself, and life. I think every day about wanting to go back to my old state.

I ignored all of this, but was conscious of what he was doing out of the side of my eye. 

He walked away, but would walk a few steps, stop, stare at me, repeat. I tried to focus on my shopping but I would look up and scan the room every now and then to make sure I knew that I was far away from him and safe.

The sister (the perpetrator) has been a victim of sex trafficking for a few years now. Her situation with her ""boyfriend"" is sketchy as hell and i really worried about her.

The sister is slower than the average person and i doubt she knew what she was doing and that it was wrong. 

If this sister was a functioning woman or a bitch it would be easier for me to support this. I haven't told my friend how i feel. I wish she would find it in her to forgive her sister without attempting to throw her in prison while her life has already been like a prison for years. At this point they are both victims in some way. It makes me sad. They both need help for different things. I don't see this helping her sister in any way. I just see more problems in general.

I honestly never wanted to go to college in the first place. I never really wanted to go to higher education. I don't know what I want to do. The only reason why I went was because of the pressure of society of us high school grads to go to college because that's the only way to go in life and that if don't go, your life is fucked. It was also to make my family proud, and make other people happy which really for me never made me happy.

So I went to community college because it was cheaper. I'm not liking it there and I feel like I wasted my time there. I should've only been there if I know exactly what I want to do. What I want to learn. I remember during the first week of college, I cried to my parents and just told them that I honestly don't know why i'm there and I don't think college is for me. My parents are supportive (thank god and they were also community college drop outs) and my mom just told me to drop 2 out of 3 of my classes and just do one for now and I could think about whether I want to go back or not. I'm obviously not going to so right now I am currently taking one class and I honestly don't care if I get a good or bad grade.

I do currently have a job at target, so I guess while i'm working there, I could apply to work at the post office like usps. my parents actually suggested that to me because they make decent money and the benefits are pretty good. Once I get that then i'll quit my job at target.

How can I cope?

How do I deal with the people that make stupid cancer jokes?

How should I prepare for chemo and other such treatments?

How do I keep up in school?

Umm how terrible is chemo really?

889,"so recently i've been in a slightly toxic relationship. i met this guy in may and we instantly hit it off. the only thing is, one of my close friends (who was a pretty shitty friend) had liked him for almost 2 years, but she never had the courage to talk to him and every time she tried he wouldn't say anything bc he rly isn't a talkative person until you get to know him. she hated me, and all my friends did to. so, i found a new group of friends and became rly close with his friends. time went on, and we had a really good relationship. he made me really happy and i had been so upset for months before i met him, and he made me feel like i had a reason to be alive. but then he got really close to my best friend, and i started suspecting something. i asked him if he liked her at all and if there was going on, but every time i got mentioned it, he got really sad, made it seem like i was overthinking everything, and made me feel like shit. we continued to be in a relationship, even thought i wasn't sure if i fully trusted him; but i fully trusted my best friend because she was my only friend for quite some time. but, she started distancing herself from me, so my boyfriend was the only person that i had left. so after about 2 months, my best friend (lets call her anne) came to sleep over. anne came over and we hung out for a while and then went up to my roof. when we got up there, she told me everything. after she met my boyfriend, he liked her and she liked him back. they had been talking for weeks and she kept saying that they would just be friend, but he said ""no i don't want that"". anne felt so bad so she started distancing herself from me. he told her he loved her, tried to kiss her, and when anne and i hung out, he would text the post of us ""you're my world"". i obviously was furious and broke up with him, which he practically didn't let me do. he said ""it was an accident"", ""i didn't mean to hurt you"", ""i didn't want to loose anne from my life"". then summer break came around like a week after, so out of sight and out of mind. i had my phone,  and i kept texting him over the summer. i briefly got back with him just to realize it was pointless. he spent his summer far away from me and i wouldn't want to have a relationship over the phone. so then i went on vacation for 3 weeks and left my phone behind. i didn't text him for 3 weeks and everyday he sent me paragraphs and paragraphs about how much he missed me and how much he loved me. i got back, and i was really over him and all his bullshit. i was ready for school, but he was in all my classes. i saw him everyday and i really didn't know how to feel. i half hated him, and half loved him. so then i ended up practically being in a relationship with him in the middle of october but quickly ended it because i couldn't make up my mind if i hated him or if i loved him. we continued to be on okay terms, not talking a lot; mostly because he never responded to my texts. i distanced myself from his friends and got my old friend back. anne was always close with his friends so they hung out. one night, they all stayed out and hung out at one of their friends house. anne fell asleep on the couch and my ex boyfriend moved her head onto his lap and started stroking her hair. she didn't know that he did this, so when she woke up she took a pillow and started screaming at him. one day, i was walking home from school and my old friends showed me videos they took of my ex stroking her hair and i was heartbroken. i confronted my ex and asked him ""why?"" and he said, ""what about is? what do you want me to say"". i was so heartbroken that i trusted him again, and even thought we weren't dating anymore, it still hurt. so now this is getting a bit long so i'll wrap this up. i explained the situations to my closest friends and they all said i was overreacting and just didn't get it. i felt so alone and honestly was so tired of everything. so now im stuck. i found out about him doing this to her yeaterday, and i just wanted some advice :/ if you made it down this far, you're a trooper and i hope you have a nice day.",27Nov2019,1

892,"How do I deal with a roomie/best friend who acts submissive to his girlfriends and then takes his anger out on me?

I've seen multiple posts about handling it with love and care and understanding....""don't take it personally"". However, after a while he knows he can unleash on me but then act like an innocent puppy when she berates him. I asked him last night why he doesn't stick up for himself and why he doesn't apply that same energy to the person who deserves it and he answered ""because I know you wont leave"". The lease is up in March and I'm planning on leaving. I'm so broken hearted because he is my best friend and I'd never treat him that way. I dont know what to say or do.",27Nov2019,1
893,"English is not my first language, so if there are any spelling mistakes or my sentance structure is confusing i'm really sorry. 

So I'll start at the beginning of my adult life, I just finished school and decided to take a gap year. I was a waiteress for a year, full-time. At that point i was earning more than my boyfriend (which is kind off relavant). After that year went by we both started studying Marketing Management which we both have a diploma in. While I was studing Marketing I was convinced I wanted to study Law. 
So after I finished with those studies I started studing Law, and boy was I wrong. I hated every moment of it, I tried to push through hoping that it was all in my head so I studied it for 2 years and then quit. I worked part-time as a waitress while I was studying but at this point I stopped working at that restaurant. And started working for my Dad (typical admin work)

My boyfriend after he finished with Marketing started learning coding online. He then got an intership and then a job at a company. 

After he got his job I started to look for a new job in Marketing (which i didn'trally like). And to my luck I found a job in a week. 
What turned my luck around is that this job was horrible. When I went for the interview they asked me if I was comfortable with swearing in the office and I said yes. I mean everyone swears when they are frustrated. 
BUT then when i started my job they actually started swearing at me and calling my work that i did 'shit' to my face (which i would understand if it was shit, but at that point i was only there for 2 days - and i honestly tried my best). So I was in tears every night for 2 weeks untill my boyfried asked me to quit because it was making me upset. So I did. 
And I started working for my dad again.

I SWEAR MY STORY HAS A POINT and I am truly happy of you made it this far. 
I strating looking into Graphic design. Which I actually like (thank God), so I stared looking into schools near me. 
Also just for extra information,the country that I live in is quite unsafe and the crime rate is very very high. So it's quite unsafe for a woman to drive far alone.
But anyway, I found a school and it was only a year course and you receive a certificate. 
And I asked this school if it was n National Certificate, which they told me no, they are not accredited. BUT with that being said they said your portfolio will be the most important thing to find jobs. 

I 80% knew what I was getting myself into, untill 6 months in I realized that we only cover the basics. I was not happy (btw this school is expensive) 

So meanwhile my(23) boyfriend who is currently 28 is earing like 5 times what I make. We still do not live together, we both live at our parents (which in our country is quite normal) and we don't rush things in our relationship. But it seems like he is thinking aboutmoving out and starting a live for himself. 

HERE IS WHERE THE ADVICE COMES IN:
Because this school I went to for graphic design almost teached me nothing, I am very afraid that I won't get a job and won't be able to start my life with my boyfriend. Plus I have an irrational fear of getting a job because what happened at my previous one.
I want to get a degree in Graphic Design but being 23(turing 24) I would finish when I'm 27. And the more I do my research the more I get discouraged because of the cost and expences. 
Plus my boyfriend is taking me overseas next year for a month in April (it's not a subtle flex, i promise) and that is postponing me for looking for a job, or if I do decide to go to college I don't know if they'll let me go for a month. 

I am starting to think I am good at nothing, that I have no purpose and that I am actually dumb. It feels like I can't push though anything and that I quit when things get a little hard  I feel like I'm holding my boyfriend back in life and I feel so weird when he pays for everything because for the first 2 years of dating I was the one paying for most things (it didn't feel like a burden and I quite like spoiling him). 
I honestly don't know if I should go to college and be in massive dept or I don't even know if I would get hired with the knowledge I have. 
I am also on acctuane at the moment so I look and feel so ugly - which i feel is just adding to my sadness.

If you made it through the whole post, thank you so much, this is honestly so therapeutic. I don't have many friends to vent to.",27Nov2019,1
894,  I’m a very independent person so when I can’t do something myself and I need someone to help me with it I don’t really know what to do. Anyways I’m really insecure about a mole that can easily be removed but since I’m under 18 I can’t go to the doctors alone to get it correctly removed. It’s hard for me to bring this kind of stuff up to people but I know I’m gonna have to. How would I ask my parent to take me/bring it up?

896,"Backstory: I'm a chef. I went to university for psychology, though I stuck to the research side of it for various reasons. 

Recently, I got a job in a retirement home in the part of it for people with dementia/alzheimers. And, it's rough. As the head of the kitchen there, I know everyone's dietary restrictions and the caregivers (who also act as servers here) have explained what the dietary restrictions mean. And they tell me when someone is getting worse because it seems to affect their diet/behavior, and since a fairly decent part of my job also requires interacting with the people we're caring for, I made the mistake of, well, interacting them them. 

And they're sweet. And the ones who aren't as sweet, it's so clear they're very sick. And just knowing that they're going to die there... it's awful. We take the best care of them that we can. We treat them like people, not patients/children/whatever. But it's hard to escape that hard truth.

But I can't really talk to my friends about it thanks to HIPAA. Which like, that's fine, they more than deserve their privacy. But now I don't know how to cope with this. 

What should I do?",27Nov2019,1

900,"Hello reddit, I [16M] was going thought a rly though time last year, the reasons don't rly matter as I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me or anything. But I wasn't (and still am not) the most popular person at my school,  yeah I have a GREAT group of friends but I didn't make part of that ""popular circle"".

One night I got drunk, it's normal at my age s(at least in my country) I guess, and I was in a night club when I started making out with a girl, it was kinda aggressive and it's not something that I would like anyone to see... But with my luck one of the guys of my school saw me and started recording, he then sent it to his friends.

As you can assume when I got at school on Monday it was rough, everyone had seen it and some people had it saved... Ofc that made me sad and I was in a rly bad place at the time, I should have learnt my lesson but I didn't... Instead in another night the same thing happened... And I was recorded again.

My mentality was: I don't care what others think about me I'm just gonna be happy... Well once again I was recorded and ppl saw it but I didn't care...

Now summer has come and gone and I'm a new person, I'm way more happy and overall more mature... And things are starting to go really well, ofc that when things go well my anxious and nervous mind starts to create problems and I've been thinking: what if these videos comeback in my future?

I know it sounds stupid  but the guy who recorded the videos sent them to me so they are at least saved on our dms on Instagram (we never talk) and my country is very small so its not like I can run away from this.

I'm a rly good student and great and public speaking, I really want to be successful but im afraid that in my future someone releases this videos and prejudices my career and my image...

 Yeah it may be my ego thinking I'm gonna be famous and everything but it's more the fact I want to have that option in my mind you know? I don't wanna live thinking about running away from things, if I, in the future, decide to be successful I want to be it without having to deal with this... So what should I do?

What if I become let's say, president? What if this gets published and destroys me? 

I know, once again, that it seems stupid but I'm so fucking scared of this, what if these videos comeback to my life? What can I do? I'm probably overreacting (anxiety strikes back) but idk for sure if I'm overreacting or not, can someone help me? What should I do? 

And do you, as adults, think that something I did in my 16 can actually affect my future and my career? Would anyone care? Idk just the idea of it being in the internet... People are so cruel they could make Memes of it or some shit...",27Nov2019,1
901,"I used to harbour many grudges or scorecards and get irritated/pissy about a lot of stuff. I've actually tried narrowing down priorities which deserve any energy. Basically a guideline to ""pick your battles"". 

I'm hoping this is the right place for it because I'm open to any extra input and maybe this could even make others consider this list? 

Basically unless a situation affects one of these four things, I let it go/don't pursue it/give it energy. 

1. Finances/Money
2. Physical/Mental health
3. Reputation
4. Material goods. 

Yes that all can seem vague but say someone's just being catty or rude or something ticks you off, I tend to ask myself if that situation affects any of the above points. If it doesn't then leave it alone.

ive had a crush on one of my friends for almost about a year now and at one point this topic did come about and turned out she had a crush on me too but stuff couldn’t be and can’t be either so i told her we might never be a thing and i still think that because of well,, numerous issues that have got nothing to do with her but ever since then ive been trying to move on from her and I’ve struggled a lot with that, especially since i was the one who told her stuff cant be in the first place. she’s moved on but im still stuck and ive finally decided to try and move on for good now bc i dont wanna take any of this suffering into the next year and I considered telling her about it but im not sure if i should? like whatever she’ll say is uncertain and might hinder my process of moving on and instead of my initial aim of not dwelling over it anymore, i might just think about whatever she’s going to say even more which defeats the whole purpose of moving on and letting it go all in this year. so should i tell her? like it might help but it also might make things worse and I don’t want that considering it was already hard enough for me to make the decision of moving on and what she says may or may not hinder that process so im not sure if it’ll be worth it as ive already made my decision (although im very indecisive my decision might change even though i dont want  it to) and it’s going to be super tough for me anyway to tell her in the first place. what should i do? i realise all this sounds pretty messed up n jumbled so if there’s any additional questions you need to ask before giving advice, feel free to ask!",27Nov2019,1

He has it engrained in his head that everyone looks down on him, people judge him for everything that he does, that the ""cool kids"" look down in him as some strange kid in the corner with no friends.

And he really wants to gain more respect with them, that he's completely alone without friends, that he can't do anything about it no matter how hard he tries. Which in turn makes him even sadder and more and more depressed.

So then he's locked in this perpetual cycle of self judgement and anxiety, and it's really taking a toll on him.

I'm trying to persuade him that it's all in his head, but no matter how hard I try to get the point across, he simply refused to acknowledge anything I said as truth. I suggested opening up to this issue to more people but he thinks they would judge him.

I'm a HS student who's living with my father and older brother (my brother being 27 years old) and due to his mental illness we've always understood that he can sometimes become a bit unruly. But for the past year he has consistently been spiraling into paranoia 

First it started with some sort of elaborate delusion that his doctor was plotting to spread rumors that he's a pedophile. He was so immersed in this lie that he was convinced his doctor was rummaging through our trash to find evidence of this????

But now he is slowly losing all touch with reality. He recently said that one of our relatives put cameras in the bathroom and leaked footage of him stripping nude to bathe?

He's also confessed that he thinks me and my father are trying to bully him into suicide 


But the problem with all of this is that he is normally fine. 9 times out of 10 he's alright, so if I tell the authorities it's almost guaranteed that he'll be able to convince him that he's fine.  He has been in and out of therapy quite a bit, but he recently quit meeting with a local priest because he thinks that he's part of this overarching conspiracy

The main issue is that he is incredibly strong AND he is armed. He's 6 foot 4, several hundred pounds, and has countless weapons at his disposal AND IM STUCK LIVING WITH HIM. My father can't stand up to him because he's physically incapacitated from an old back injury and I'm just a scrawny nobody.

I just need advice ASAP. He's always watching right wing conspiracy videos and he knows I'm a leftist. There is a real possibility he will lash out at me one of these days. He's tried killing himself before. He knows he has nothing to lose",27Nov2019,1
919,To me they are 2 of my favorite planes other than Soviet planes (I'm from Russia) forgot to mention in my first post that I'm brand new to Reddit,27Nov2019,1
920,"I graduated highschool last year and came to Germany to study this September, I wanted to come but also sort of felt the duty to do so cause my parents were always really proud that I did great at school and wanted me to go abroad, my 2 other brothers both study in my home country and my sister didn't even end her studies and is married, so I know how they feel about me here, I love them and want them to be happy, and this is a big financial sacrifice for my dad and my mom literally once told me I'll be better off NEVER thinking about going back. 

I'm studying Computer Science and it's really hard, of course it's harder than I thought but I don't think that's what making me doubt all this, I've been able to mostly handle it considering how I've been feeling. What really fucks me up is the duration of the study, and the fact that here I don't feel like I'm where I should be, and I know it's not been that long but still I have no friends other than 3 guys I came to my city with, and I also don't have that much time nor the will to make friends. 

So all I can think of lately is that I'll be here for at least 4 years ( my Uni is also very competitive) away from my best friends and my family and my girlfriend ( We got together almost right before I left, real dumb but I really love her), and I don't know when I'll be able to see them because of money and because I have to write my exams during vacation if I don't pass them the first try. I've been struggling to wake up and motivate myself to go to class.
 
So I can go back and be sort of happier but of course it's not gonna last forever and there I'll still have to live real life and my parents probably will be disappointed or at least sad and I hate myself for even thinking about purposely causing that, but at least I'll have the emotional stability I've been needing and will belong. 
Or I could stay and try not to be miserable and keep in touch and hope for a sooner visit back home, but have a probable better future (?). And another frocking problem is my phone contract, it's 2 years and would be expensive to get out of this early. 

My main argument for coming was that I'll still go back when I finish my studies but now that it's all happening I feel like I won't be able to handle that much time, especially with my girlfriend.

Any advice would be great, I feel like I'm too dumb and desperate to know the right way. I don't want to be selfish but this is much harder than I can take right now.",27Nov2019,1
921,"A sister of a classmate texted me that she is holding a surprise birthday party for her brother, and that I’m invited. I have known this friend since 5th grade, we’re in 12th grade now, but weren’ really that close. I don’t socialize in school, have never been to a party before and I’m getting anxious to the point that I don’t want to go because this classmate is a very popular person who gets along and talks with everyone (that’s how we became friends) so I’m expecting a lot of people to be there and can’t handle being around many people. Since I lack socializing experience, I don’t know how to response to her text saying I don’t want to go without sounding too harsh, do I just say I’m too busy?",27Nov2019,1
922,"Okay so I’m interested in laws, and I’m thinking out becoming a cop when I grow up, since I want to save others. 


And I browsed on this rather weird website called Sant’Egido and it was about idk, this thing where you help save criminals. And it said sent the appeal here in a big red box. Being the mindless person I am I clicked on it. And idk why I did that I was curious. So it never gave me anything to sign it just showed the whole website and a story on it, about that person. And I’m scared I actually sent an appeal. I was curious and I didn’t mean it. 

I was just a kid interested in becoming a cop! So will it actually send? You can explore it for yourself, if you want but I really hope not. It never even made me write anything",27Nov2019,1
923,"26 year old guy, living at home, recently left a job I was at for 4 months due to the place being incredibly toxic and I DO NOT regret leaving. I generally eat pretty well and hit the gym 4-5 days a week too. But I haven't worked in 3 weeks now and I can't even begin to piece together any sort of game plan about what I should now do.

I see jobs posted every day that I could apply for, but I feel so defeated right now, so exhausted with everything, that even if I got an interview I know I'd fuck it up due to feeling like shit right now. You know, trying to put on the extrovert act when you're heavily introverted.

The last 5 days I've literally woken up at midday, made a cup of coffee, and then sat on my laptop for hours just browsing Reddit and other random things. I also browse jobs through the day, and get flickers of interest/hope when I consider applying for something.. then I feel a wave of depression come over me and I just fucking do nothing about it.

Imposter syndrome? Every job I have ever had I have felt out of place and incompetent. And when I imagine myself doing a new role I just don't know if I could keep up the *act*

How the fuck do I find something to do for my whole life anyway? I just can't comprehend this shit lately. I truly don't know what I should be doing. It's terrible. I feel like there is nowhere to land.

Today is particularly a bad day, I don't know what I expect to hear from Reddit. I know deep down that I hope for *the* answer to solve it all, and I also know (somehow at the same time) that I'm going to get told advice I already know, and need to apply. But here I am, just typing it all up anyway.

Yeah I don't know.",27Nov2019,1
924,"I moved in a new apartment a few months ago. On the floor under mine lives an old lady (between 80 and 90). Probably because of hearing loss due to her age, she keeps her TV volume extremely loud, to the point where I thought it was my flatmates watching TV in the room next to mine. It doesn’t bother me much during the day, but when it goes on until 1 or 2 a.m it does. I already had to ask her once to lower it and she was very nice about it. However, this happens almost every night. I also have to be careful about how I approach her because she’s the mother of my landlord. I don’t know how to deal with this.",27Nov2019,1
925,"I used to have beautiful hair. I loved my hair. Last year, I had to be on a type of chemotherapy drug and it made me lose a lot of hair. It’s so thin. I can’t find a way to wear it without showing my scalp. My boyfriend’s older sister told him that I look like a crackhead when I wasn’t around (to which he replied, “Fuck you. No she doesn’t. She had chemo.” I feel like shit. My dermatologist is having me take vitamins and use women’s rogaine. What can I do with my hair while I wait for it to grow back? Are extensions a viable option? I don’t really want a wig... I don’t know. My self esteem is so low now. I feel like I could cry.",27Nov2019,1
926,There's a girl that I love but she doesn't know and lately she has a very bad time going through things like she told me and I want to help her as much as possible.... We are in the same country but from different cities not that big of a distance. I've been thinking her non stop and I won't forgive myself If I don't do something..

927,"It's just coming up on a year from when a friend of mine took her life. We had grown up together but we hadn't been in contact for a couple of years. I had been wanting to reach out to her around the time it happened but I felt awkward because I didn't have the confidence to reach out. Now I hate myself for it. I thought it go away with time but it seems as time goes on it just seems to get worse. I wish I did something. I don't think that's ever going to change so it seems like I'm just stuck feeling like this. 

I also feel like I can't talk to friends or family about this. Every time I think of talking about it I get scared.",27Nov2019,1
928,"I'ma 23 year old dude. When it comes to sex, I wouldn't say I'm exactly killing it in the ladies department, but I do alright for myself. In the past, I always enjoyed sex, whether it be in a relationship or just casually. Back in April though, I started dating this girl, who by all accounts I considered to be my soul mate (I know I know I'm only 23 and I'm young what do I know). We dated very happily for about 6 months before we broke up quite amicably. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, during our relationship, our sex life was so great, and it just felt amazing to be with someone I was in love with and who I knew loved me back. Now that I am single, casual sex just feels so empty and meaningless to me. I don't enjoy it at all, and I no longer even see the point in pursuing women. I wouldn't say I'm depressed or anything, I'm extremely active and eat very well. I have a solid social circle. I'd say I'm happy with myself as a whole. I don't know, since my relationship, and feeling what real love is, I just feel like I can no longer enjoy sex, and I don't know what to do. Any advice?",27Nov2019,1
929,"My father is an alcoholic. Without getting too detailed he was sober throughout my middle school, high school and associate's degree. I think he relapsed when I moved out and moved away for work. That was 7 years ago. I recently moved back to my hometown. I got a text from my stepmom that she thinks my dad had been drinking again. I left work to go check on him and stayed with him for about 5 hours. He never admitted to being drunk when questioned directly, but he knew that I knew.

I have a wife and 3 kids under 4. My wife is not feeling well so I can't just leave them here and go stay with him. We were supposed to be celebrating Thanksgiving at his place, but now my step mom (separated) says she and my little sister won't be coming, but they will be have thanksgiving at her place. I have no clue what to do, every option will make my dad feel like shit and I'm worried it will cause him to spiral.

I don't know how to help him at all. I've never had to deal with anything like this. I don't want to baby or patronize him, but I also don't want him to hurt himself. Can someone please help",27Nov2019,1
930,"Hello!  TLDR is at the bottom. So, the roommate of 2 years (let’s call him Jack) at my mom’s home pissed in my mouthwash. At first I didn’t know why the color was different. I should have left it alone but I used it a couple times.
Sometimes my mom uses my bathroom before heading out to work. She decided to also use my mouthwash. Yep, we both used that mouthwash.  That man is so mentally sick to have done that to someone.

I called the authorities about this incident and they are looking into what can be done. I don’t have the mouthwash anymore for evidence cuz I threw it out and replaced it. But my mom is a witness to it happening so hopefully that’s enough for evidence.

I want some payback and to get revenge on him. That was crossing a line. Some type of sexual abuse... it went in my body. Body is home for my soul...


What things can I do fellow redditors? Take a stand with me! What things are legal or borderline legal but very messed up ideas 💡 for payback?  
For starters,  how about getting him fired from his job? Jack works at a high school with band. About 3 years ago before he was living at my moms he wouldn’t stop talking about some girl at the high school saying how smart she is. Well fast forward to 3ish months ago I discovered he had a fling with her AFTER she graduated. The flirting started while she was in high school like 1 or 2 years before. 
Can Jack be fired for something like that? It’s like borderline pedophile like behavior.

Thank you for the help.

TLDR; mentally sick roommate pissed in my mouthwash, me and mom used it. I want revenge. Help me with ideas, please.",27Nov2019,1
