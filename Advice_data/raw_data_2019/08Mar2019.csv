I turn off electronics 1 hour before I try to sleep every night, I eat healthy, I took up reading, I stopped drinking caffeine (or drink as little as possible), I don't eat before I sleep, And a few other things.

Even fucking sleeping pills have little to no affect on me 

I'm really at a loss as to what I can do now, I've been like this all my life and now I have no clue what to do now 

Any advice would be smashing

3,"My ex-girlfriend and I are partners in a startup.

We had drunken, celebratory night out that ended in cathartic, longing tears.

We’re pregnant and getting married (not just the baby, we’re awesome together).

We don’t have insurance because we both quit our jobs 5 months ago for the game.

We cannot afford an additional $800/mo. insurance going out at this very sensitive nascent time.

We've got some cash savings but am worried about unanticipated costs, complications, etc.

How much is this uninsured pregnancy going to run us?

Almost all of our savings in this startup.

I've got hot snakes and bubble gut.

Will the pressure ever stop?

Any advice?

6,"Before I start i’d like to make it clear that I am aware that I am still very young (16 M) and I have a lot of time ahead of me for new relationships. 

About 6 months ago I started dating this girl that I had dated before but wasn’t serious back then. I’ve had a handful of middle school girlfriends but I never really counted them as a real relationship. This girl, however, was my first real girlfriend. We got along very well and had a lot of great times together. She was the nicest, kindest girl I knew and I never even thought of wanting anyone else. 

Then, in late November another girl starting texting me. I thought nothing of it and didn’t really pay attention. The girl was nowhere near as attractive as the girl I was dating. However the other girl started sending me nude pictures trying to get my attention. I realize I should have blocked her then but for some reason I didn’t. She would beg me to send pictures back and without even thinking, I did it. Things went on as normal with the girl I was dating and I didn’t even think about what I did until about a month later. The guilt hit me all at once and it sent me into a bad state of depression. I opened up to my family about it and they agreed to take me to a therapist who told me to just not tell her about it and move past it and never do it again. However, the guilt was way too much for me to handle. 

About a week ago we finally broke up over different reasons(probably a result of the guilt causing me to not be able to put effort into the relationship anymore). At first it was very hard because this girl was my best friend and we had a very good bond. I know I sent the pictures to the other girl but I learned my lesson to never ever do that again. After about a day I felt relieved to not have to worry about the guilt anymore. But I was still very down. It’s been almost 2 weeks since we broke up and even though I don’t feel the guilt anymore, I still feel depressed. 

I went back to my old ways of talking to many girls and even though they say I’m attractive and compliment me, I feel empty inside. I have no emotional feeling towards any girl(barely any to my ex). The only attraction I feel to anyone really is sexual attraction and even that doesn’t feel right. 

I don’t know how to move past my depression because I don’t even think I know why I’m like this. I’m not crying everyday and it’s not like I miss her so much that I can’t think of anything else. I just know that I feel down all the time. It’s gotten to the point where the stress has effected my health(my vision because blurred and I see floaters quiet often) along with headaches. I don’t know if this is normal after a breakup or not. My theory is that the guilt and stress from the breakup has taken a toll on me and will effect me for sometime after the breakup. 

She offered to get back together with me but I declined because I didn’t want to deal with the guilt anymore. I don’t know what to do because I rarely find joy or distraction in anything. I’m not suicidal or anything like that, yet I just feel down and pretty much dead inside. I’ve always been a very happy and energetic person and I’m an athlete so sports and video games have really been the only distraction for me. 

Any help is appreciated :) 

Thanks",08Mar2019,1

9,"Basically I'm deciding whether or not to get a degree. I work at a tech company in sales where I got promoted to a senior position within 3 months due to my performance. I've been with the company for about 11 months now and I got short listed for a leadership position. I will be moving into this position within the next 6 months and since this is my first career job, I feel like I'm damn good at what I do. Everything is going extremely well and I make around 80k-100k/year.

My dilemma is whether to go to school and get a degree. I know that if I want to move up past this position I will need credentials. Before this job I was studying computer science but I love being in the business side of things. I don't really care what my degree is because I already make a lot of money and I'm doing what I want to do.

The reasons I **don't** want to go to school:

• Time - I have to spend time on studying

• Money - it will cost around 20k which can be used to invest in real estate, side-business, or stocks

• Effort - I don't know if I want to put in the effort to get a piece of paper when my effort can be geared towards my business and work

• It goes against my belief - I hate the education system and I feel like I can learn anything on my own without having to pay someone to paraphrase a book. Studying CS I pretty much learned everything myself.

Reason I **DO** want to go to school:

• I can get a higher position in the corporate world - I don't even know if I want to stay corporate

• I can move to any company smoothly

• I have a fall back in case my entrepreneurial projects don't work out

My main goal in life is to own businesses. I currently own one and I'm looking to buy real estate.

But we're pretty reliant on each other and after a tough conversation today we decided to spend some time apart to foster our independence from each other. 

I don't really know what to do with myself now. I'm feeling pretty down and my other out of town friends have stepped up but they all get pretty busy during the days when my friend and I would do the majority of our chatting.

It's not like I give up on them because they are hard, I don't mind a challenge, I just don't care anymore, even if I liked it.

I constantly have to find something else, because my mind says so. This is not even just for hobbies but anything really.

Games, books, history, movies, anything that I get into I seem to find something to love about it, but nothing stays, lots of times I even start hating that thing and distancing myself from it.

I obsess over new and exciting things, sometimes it's all I can think about for weeks, but I always ruin it for myself.

12,"Before I dive in I'm 23 (Male) and my bestfriend is the same age (Female). She helped me through a break up and has been a super cool person for the entirety of our friendship. Always honest but never harsh. Recently we've been hanging out a lot. We'll go drinking or go back to her place and smoke. She has a boyfriend who I'm good friends with and we've always had a platonic relationship but the other night something happened. She insisted having me come over to smoke and said her boyfriend was hanging out with his brother for the night so it'd just be the two of us. So we're smoking and talking about our lives and she's opening up to me about stuff I'm sure she's never told her boyfriend about including how she kind of resents him in some ways because he's not driven enough and gets drunk all the time. At one point she gets super passionate about the conversation and starts welling up a bit. She stands up to go to the bathroom and I tell her to let it out. She tries to brush past me as I stand up and I just hold my arms open. She embraces me and starts balling. We're standing in the middle of her living room holding each other for a good minute. Afterwards she goes to the bathroom to freshen up and I'm standing there high as hell wondering if I made things weird. Tell her I'm gonna leave and apologize for making things awkward when she comes back out, but she insists I didn't as she gives me multiple hugs from her bathroom to the front door. Fast forward about a week and she's all I can think about now. No ones ever been that open with me before and I kind of fell for her because of it. Still I value our friendship so I tell her what's going through my head while making it a point that I would never cross that line while they're both together. She appreciates my honesty, we hug things out and that seems to be it.

14,"Basically this: I'm a MTF trans gal that is out to parents who are not supportive. However I have 5 younger siblings in which only 2 of them know I'm trans. 



However, here's the weirdest part. My parents don't want to tell my brothers I'm trans, but are okay with me presenting female 100% of the time. This is getting more and more confusing, because my brother's know I look like a girl but don't understand why. My parents insist on calling me by my birth name and gender.


I am currently going on a vacation with my family for a week, and this has come to my mind, because I don't want my brother's to be confused and I really don't like being outed in public by my parents at all times of the day. I'm currently in college so anytime I'm away from my family I am viewed as female and called by my new legal name, but when I'm at home I have to go by my old name and gender. 



How can I tell my parents that they are causing me stress by forcing me to live a double life while at the same time telling them that my brothers are being further confused by thinking I still go by my old name and I'm supposed to be a dude, when I'm clearly not anymore?

15,"PRECURSOR: let me say that I am fully happy and 100% committed to my Wife and GF.

We are all very close knit and very much are inlove and run a great home together. However, no one is perfect and due to some issues with everyone being unique in the way they handle emotions/stress/life - sometimes we hit snags. 

**Also before I pose this question I will say we are starting trio therapy sessions around the 20th of this month**


______

My wife sometimes gets really in her anger/self loathing side when she’s over stressed and snaps into what I think is somewhat of a fit of rage/complete feelings as though she  is a failure. She really carries the weight of the world on her shoulders and I can understand how she has these moments. I can’t remember exactly how it all began one night but I’ll say what I do remember. 

I remember being angry and very depressed with something she had said / our gf was as well - then fast forward to gf outside who was gonna go to a friends, I asked her to please stay because I feel somethings off - I am looking through the window into the home and I see wife go grab something from the kitchen - this is when I said GF we need to go to her NOW. 
so we go in and she covers something to her side w the blanket. I uncover and see a knife. I try to take it away and wife starts screaming and pushing me pretty hard from where she is laying. Gf then does a loving hold to wife in order to make her stop being aggressive. 

Eventually she does calm from being angry and cries. Gf asks me to let them speak alone. I do so. 

Then - afterward we talk and welcome each others perspectives / really try to understand and communicate. We cuddle and all is well. 

*i swear I’m getting to the question* 

I learn from wife a few days later that she treats me with less restraint and says and does things that are more cruel because she knows I won’t leave. 

What does that mean ? From an outside perspective - what do you think it would mean for someone to be basically more prone to showing their dark underbelly easier to a person they know won’t leave but will withstand and love them through it? 
Am I missing some info ?

17,"[This is like a ""part 2"" of my previous post, read It before reading this one]

I can't take it, i can't live here anymore

So.. Like some minutes ago i told my mom that she has to choose which place my class should travel in the end of the year (it's a ""vote"", everyone already choose it but i have to give the confirmation anyway)

Then, my dad screams that he's not going to pay or ""confirm"" anything because i'm missing classes, and.. I Said that it's just a confirmation, you don't have to pay or go, you just have to choose where the class should go, then he yelled ""IT DOESN'T MATTER, SHUT UP YOU SHITTY"", then he ""explains"" that he's not going to pay anything because i'm missing classes and wasting their money, when i tried to say anything he told me to shut up, even my mom tried to explain something but she told her to shut up too. Then he called me a Lot of things, i.. cried (i'm still crying, if there's any typo it's because of that)

The worst is that he said i'm going to become my uncle, and my uncle is a guy who never worked, has a son that he didn't raise, lives without paying anything, and get food by being nice with my mom. (He also has a gf who lives with him, without paying or working)

It's pretty obvious he just did that to make me feel bad for him, ""to stop being lazy and actually study"". Which is stupid.

He left now to walk with my dog (?)

And my mom says it's my fault, because i'm dumb and lazy and a liar.

And there's another thing i want to tell about School, i don't have any friends there, literally. Why? Last year my aunt discovered my Facebook account, basically there i said i didn't like my aunt, my cousin, my cousin's son, i said cringe a lot and said ""i didnt had any friends"", i'm not gonna tell the context, but that wasn't true and i said that there (i said those things in 2017, don't blame me).

Then she diagnosed me with depression (...?) and went to my school saying that i hate everyone, i felt lonely, i was bullied and basically said that everyone should treat me like a innocent 7 y/o, It was bad, everyone did what she said, and every ""friend"" i had didn't talked to me like before, resulting in me actually with no friends, also leaving me paranoid that everyone i see treats me differently. (I was too scared to say that everything was wrong, then the year passed and i can't tell, it's too late.. My dad doesn't care, and my mom believed me) And.. Everyone in my mom's family started treating me like that, it was a hell, it still is.

The point is.. My life is a hell, i don't talk with anyone since last year, i'm hoping it'll get better someway but It never gets, i can't take it, i don't know what do do",08Mar2019,1
18,"I’m a 31 yr old single mom living with my parents. I got a divorce about 6 yrs ago and moved in to help me get back on my feet. Being that I never really graduated from college and wasn’t working at the time due to being laid off during my second trimester of pregnancy I had to start from 0 again. This was a very difficult time and I always felt bad because my parents were also struggling. I managed to get a job but it was never enough to get my own place. I live in CA and it is extremely expensive. Both of my kids ages 7 and 13 are in an afteschool program. I take them to and from school. I really don’t have any time for myself except for the weekends. I considered getting a second job on the weekends so that I can afford to move out. However, I’ve been struggling with fatigue and feeling sick all the time.

I am indecisive on what the next step for my life is due to my parents hardship. I’m confused bc my children are growing and need their own space but I am helping my parents out now. I feel I owe it to them for helping me. I often worried about my parents bc they are not financially stable. They are always behind on their bills and constantly need to borrow to help my brother who is attending university up north. They pay for most of his living expenses. This is a difficult time for him also being that he has one more year until he applies for medical school. I don’t want to interfere with this and I want to help my family. I just can’t help but notice they make a lot of unwise choices. They have a car payment that is over $600 and all their bills are a month or two behind. I see a lot of wasted food in the fridge. I see them constantly fighting about money but never take serious measures to make things better for themselves. I have tried to talk to them about this to see if there is anything I can do but they just will not budge in making better choices. I need some advise on how to proceed to be more stable myself with my two children. I feel terrible and guilty bc I want to stop helping them due to this. ",08Mar2019,2

20,"Whether I'm working, with family, or with strangers, my mind is usually at a blank and I can't seem to properly articulate my thoughts clearly in the moment. I was diagnosed with ADD in the 4th grade and given medication to help focus, but ever since I graduated high school its effects have started to wear and I nothing I'm given seems to be working at this point. From the daydreaming to getting distracted easily, holding conversations has always been a hurdle. At times it gives me slight anxiety when the topics are on serious/important subjects but other than that I feel alright talking about anything. The one thing that bothers me is I don't feel like I'm really grabbing anyone's attention. When speaking, everyone appears uninterested in what I'm saying or clearly just isn't really listening. Often people will just ignore me, including family. I try not to let it bother me but after years of this I'm really being eaten up from this. I feel like the words leaving my mouth are just garbage that don't really add to the conversation and often I view myself as the dead weight in any group of people. The only real times I can get exactly what I have on mind out properly is when I write it down because I can edit it and take as much time as needed. Because of all of this I've lost pretty much any and all the friends I've made over the years, making me not very motivated and slightly depressed. The fear to seek help from those around me is not fun either and I'll just keep all my thoughts and problems bottled up now. I feel invisible so don't talk a whole lot, making it appear as though I'm introverted when really I want to be extroverted more. I don't like feeling this way and want change in my life.

23,"In one of my college classes, we are working on a group project, with 4 people in each a group. One of the guys in my group (let’s call him Mark)  is frankly, in my opinion, very rude, arrogant, and mean. Over the course of the quarter, he has frequently been making rude comments to myself and our other teammates.

Example: We were working on a mechanism that would allow a piece of paper to fall to the ground as slowly as possible. When one of my group members attempted a test fall of one of our prototype designs, he accidentally released it incorrectly. Mark sorta laughed and said, “Not like that you fucking dummy”.  Keep in mind that all of us are all fairly polite and friendly people, except for Mark.

Example 2: He often comes across as a bit arrogant/reckless. In several of our projects, he will almost immediately state how “easy” the assignment is and voice his solution to it. However, it’s often incorrect (as most anyone’s first ideas are) and it usually take some convincing on the rest of our’s parts for him to see why his solution might not actually work.

Example 3: There are about 15 minutes before the start of class, and I get up to head to an adjacent room to take a quick  1 minute measurement for another assignment I’m working on for a separate class. He asked where I was going, and after I explained, he smirked and said “You’re a weirdo”.

This is just a sample. Quite frankly, I’m a bit fed up with his behavior. Also, I can tell that our other teammates are getting fed up with it too. It’s too late in the quarter for him to just move groups. Plus, that would make a huge fuss I feel like, anyway. 

How should I deal with this? Should I just call him out the next time he’s being rude? Should I tell him to either be considerate or leave? Should I talk to the professor? Should I talk to him one on one (I’d almost prefer not to do that one)? Idk",08Mar2019,1

26,"My SO (32m) and I (35f) were both recovering heroin addicts when we met three years ago, and both starting over in life, trying to do things the right way. We took it slow, both worked, both took care of our own bills, had our own cars, lived separately (both with parents, but again, totally starting over). We wanted to get it right, not trigger any issues in each other. About a year into our relationship, my mom decided to sell her house and move out of state, and I was struggling finding somewhere to live on my own, but he was honest and said it was too soon, and I ended up finding a place with my younger sister (whom I’m not close with), her young son, and her new bf.

The first 6 months here were rough, as my sister had never lived on her own, and her new bf proved pretty quickly that he had no interest in contributing to the household needs. I did the majority of the cleaning and bill paying, had to lock up my food or it would disappear, and my sister would just leave my nephew at home without asking me if I was okay with watching him. My bf started staying over more and more to help me out, and would pay for things for the house and for me. 

I already struggle with anxiety and depression, plus a sleep disorder that leaves me perpetually exhausted, plus having a full-time job, my recovery, and day-to-day things, so all the added stress got to me and I broke down after a few months. My mom spoke to my sister and we’ve been able to work through a lot of our issues, so that she’s not as dependent on me. But then life got even harder...

My bf relapsed on heroin a year ago. He told me and his parents (whom he was still living with) and went to rehab. But he didn’t stop. His parents had set the boundary that if he uses again he had to leave, so when he did, they kicked him out. Guess where he went? Yep, moved right into my room. 

Since then he’s been using almost every day. He went to rehab in November (after I said he either had to quit or get out), December (again, quit or leave), and just came home Tuesday from inpatient. He would stay clean while he was there 24/7, but his insurance will only give him a week (or 4 days this last time), then he does day treatment 9-4 every day. He’s barely worked, but has somehow kept his job, and gets short-term disability while he’s out, so he has some sort of income always coming in. But it all goes to his addiction, and it’s never enough. He is always asking e for money, if not for drugs, then for gas and cigs since he spent all he had on drugs. His mom has also been giving him money, thinking he’s been clean. He has gotten downright abusive if I say no, and recently started just taking my debit card without permission. 

I don’t make a lot of money as it is, and because of my sleep disorder I frequently miss work, which isn’t paid under my FMLA coverage. Stress also makes my disorder worse, so the more shit he does, the less money I have coming in. I have cut most extras out of my life, I don’t do anything besides work and sit at home, and I’m still drowning.

My mom has helped with money here and there, but she gives more to my sister for my nephew, so she can’t do much. She’s been paying my sister and her bfs half of the rent, sends them food, pays for car repairs, and even paid off the energy bill when my sister confessed she’s never paid it in a year. I’m responsible for the internet, and since all our TVs use streaming services (that I also pay for) its a pretty big bill. Last month my mom had some extra money, my sisters car died so my mom bought her another one, and gave each of us $2k to catch up on bills and get some savings.

My bf managed to clear out my accounts within 4 days of this money, and I don’t want to tell my mom that. I was so upset, told him to leave, he said he’d go back to rehab. I’ve missed more work than normal the past month, so my checks are low, and my cat had what was thought to be cancer for three months, so I spent almost a grand on her also. My bf had a few more times where he harassed me for money, and finally after he left to get his drugs, I packed his stuff and kicked him out. He was actually pretty accepting, and left to sleep in his car, but came back at 1am cuz it was too cold out. I was too tired to argue so I let him stay.  A couple days later he was able to get into inpatient rehab, and life smoothed out a bit. I had no money, but his mom sent me a check, and I took out a loan also that I have to pay on my next two checks. 

He’s been home for two days, and had been clean and actually really great. I fell asleep smiling the other night next to him, and was hopeful for the first time in forever. Then this morning his mom texted me saying she put a few hundred in his bank account. I get home from work and he’s in bed in his pjs, tells me he didn’t go to rehab today and instead got high. Then my sister starts yelling how no one can watch TV because the internet’s off-I’m two weeks late on the bill. It’s $120 to turn it on and I have $130 in my account, and another week til I get paid, so I tell her I can’t pay it right now. She tells my mom, and she’s texting me now asking what happened to the $2k she gave me? Why isn’t my bf ever at work? What’s going on?

I don’t even know what to do anymore...I know I should kick  him out, but my brain fights me-what if he resents you forever, he’s so close to getting clean, what if he does it and lives happily ever after with someone else? Then I dealt with all of this for nothing. Am I a horrible person for not supporting him and being angry and letting money get between us? Maybe I deserve it, heck, he’s still way better than my exes, at least he hasn’t done (enter shitty thing here) yet. But this life is literally killing me, I’ve lost everything that I worked so hard to rebuild, especially now that I’m losing my moms trust. I don’t know what to even tell her, she thinks he was in treatment for depression last fall, and doesn’t even know about him being in treatment now. I know she’ll think I’m using too, and either way she’ll be pissed that I let the money get spent on heroin. 

So here I am...broke, bf out scoring dope as I write this, living in a pigsty with almost no clean clothes because I’m too broke and too depressed to go to the laundromat, almost out of food, $10 left of the check his mom sent that I got this morning, unable to respond to my mom, borrowing money from strangers to buy my nephew a birthday present, no one in my life that I can talk to about this (I don’t have any friends), and just feeling so hopeless and alone and like it’s never going to get better. I don’t even know how I’m going to feed myself for the next week, let alone pay for all my bfs needs, because his mom has given us so much money already this week, and my mom will probably never give me money again. And I can’t make a decision to, quite literally, save my life. ",08Mar2019,1

31,"So, I am currently juggling full time graduate school and nearly full time employment. This combination of work has wrecked havoc on me, particularly the past few months as I've made it to the more advanced classes for my area of study. My boyfriend is pretty encouraging and very supportive, but his mother is a different story. My boyfriend is an immigrant from a Western European nation and lives with me in the United States (where we met). I am American (good or bad, that is what I am). My boyfriend comes from a culture that is known to be absolutely blunt and his mother is the quintessential example of this trait. I am not a huge fan of her for various reasons, but I can tolerate her. She, from time to time, asks me how I am. I have already said that I am really stressed (she does not understand the reality of being a graduate student in the United States, living in an expensive area within the U.S., the academic pressure that exists for those who are ""over achievers"" in the U.S., etc). My boyfriend knows that I have gotten so stressed but he does not know that I have self-harmed in my own privacy + verging on a relapse of anorexia  but using all my willpower to not give in. He has just seen me cry and have a few breakdowns. 

The thing is, his parents will ask how I am. I do not want to lie, but I don't feel like telling them an honest ""I can barely life"" so I tell them ""I'm really stressed. I have a lot of work to do."" The latter response usually means 1) they say nothing and 2) they will say ""I hope you can handle it all."" The truth is, I don't think I can. LIfe has become too much and I have exchanged suicidal thoughts for residual thoughts of becoming anorexic again to gain control of my life. His parents will also say things like ""well I hope you have time to have a social life and relax"" and the truth is I don't. In the U.S., you must pay (out of pocket) for so much more than you would if you lived in my boyfriend's country. In his country, students are PAID to go to school and vacation days are plenty. Not the case in the U.S. Opinions aside, that is the truth. 

 I'm already halfway into my requirements for grad school, and I'm at a prestigious university that I worked really hard to get into. While I am not expecting them to be as encouraging as my own parents, it's really sucky to just hear nothing and know that behind my back, they had to look up the acceptance rate for my university because they doubted my abilities for a long time because I am half Hispanic and half white and they think my family came out of Narcos or something (and thus it is impossible I am intelligent and capable). If I bring this up to my boyfriend, he'll tell me I assume the worst in people and defend his family the way an Evangelical defends the Church. If I tell my boyfriend that I have self-harmed a bit through making myself bleed (not cutting) or slightly starving myself out of stress, he will not help me because his empathy skills are below average.. He's this engineer with below-average empathy skills. 

&amp;#x200B;

so, my two questions are: 1) What do I say to my bf's mother next time she asks how I am? If I lie, she'll know and call me out. If I am honest, she'll just doubt me. 

2) How can I continue to hide my poor mental health from my bf? He lives with me. Many thanks. Also, I am 25.",08Mar2019,0
32,"So I am a female under the age of 18 and I fell in love with a boy iv'e known since 5th grade. When i first met him I knew I liked him but I had alot of personal issues I didnt want to drag him into so I was mean and pushed him away . After about a semester I gave in and told him over the phone when valentines day came up I asked him to our dance and he said yes, a couple night after we had been talking on the phone all the time at night, deep conversations and we got to the topic of me liking him and we had both talked and we both knew we liked eachother and decided to start dating. ( despite not reaally knowing how to date) We had been going good he understood me even more then my own parents and I him we told eachother absolutley everything. But despite us being so close on a mental level he didnt like me physicaly. No hand holding, or hugs and all that. I would practically have to beg him to hold my hand. When we came back in sixth it was the same. After the first semester of 6th I admitted to him that I loved him and he didn't say it back, but I was okay with that wanting him to come to it in his own time. Finally after we had talked about it he confessed he too felt the same. But he still wouldn't say it in real life' but he says it over the phone and such he still didn't like to touch me like handholding but I once in a while gave him side hugs wich he tensed up to. We finally made an agreement cause i felt bad (i am a person who need physical contact to have a good relationship with someone like hugs from close friends) so he said when we were out of school we could hand hold ect. Because he felt embarrased in school cause he felt his class thought he was dumb, ugly, fat ect.

first time posting so excuse any mistakes. 

i will try to be short and sum up

due to a combination of out of my control circumstances, and a lot of negligence i failed to make any progress in my academic career at age 28. 

My father has cancer. Chemo and medical care improved his quality of living and he is doing great, and is supporting our family ( mother, and sister ). However there is still a lingering fear that something may go south at any point and the worst happens. if indeed that happens i will be responsible for my mom and sister.  I now at a stage of my life where i need to decide whether to continue pursuing my academic goals, or focus on working and becoming at least financially stable in anticipation of having to support our family when he is no longer able to.

his tumor shrunk to a level were periodic amino therapy to strengthen his  immune system  prevents it  from spreading.

however its still inevitable that he succumbs to the deseas; in year two or three. no one knows. 

 should I keep going or accept my eventual responsibility and focus on working at my current job and leave college once and for all ?  ",08Mar2019,1

45,"I’m in my last year of high school, and there’s a girl in my grade who I’ve had a rocky history with. She’s pretty introverted, but we share a lot of similar interests and we became friends in ninth grade. I ended up catching feelings for her but didn’t end up acting on them until grade 10. She didn’t feel the same, which was fine, and we were both open to still being friends. A couple months later at the start 11th grade, she confessed that she had caught feelings now, and I was open to trying it, so we dated for a couple months, but she ended up breaking it off because she had to work on herself and wasn’t ready to balance a relationship because the stress was taking a toll on her. 

Now at the beginning of 12th grade, we started talking again, and I asked her on a date to see if she was willing to retry, but she declined, saying this time that she didn’t want to date/get back together. I decided to distance myself for a bit because I was tired of always instigating conversations, but during that time she would still say hi to me at school and smile at me. Lately, she’s seemed more closed off in general. At this point, I feel I’m ready to just be friends at this point lmao, but I’m unsure how to go about pursuing it. It isn’t a confidence issue, and I have no problem approaching her, but I wanted to hear some outside advice on how to go about it? She’s pretty closed off as I said before and I’ve asked her before why she has trouble talking to me and she says she just feels awkward, yet we’ve had really deep conversations with one another concerning what has happened. With any other girl I’ve never had this problem, it’s just hard to approach her because it seems she wants to be friends, yet it’s always a struggle to talk to her and she admits she avoids problems rather than facing them. Overall, I just want to extend the offer without her thinking I’m trying to make another move.

TL;DR: Want to rekindle a friendship with a girl who seems to still be open to it, but is closed off. How do I go about it without being too excessive or lax?

&amp;#x200B;

Right now when my buddy of 18 years comes over he usually drinks or smokes until he is incapacitated, basically using my house as a place away from his parents (who he lives with) to smoke and drink without judgment. When he is consciously awake, sober or not, his social anxiety kicks in greatly and for some reason he will use extremely dark humor that never comes across as funny and almost seems violent. Taking him out becomes a liability for me and I will have people coming up to me saying he is not allowed back and that he was saying very messed up stuff. Sometimes he will be the only one fucked up from alcohol or blazed out of his wits while everyone else is sober just hanging out.

&amp;#x200B;

He just seems brain dead and bored with life, randomly blurting out annoying noises or bad jokes just to get a response from someone which is usually negative anyway. I understand that he is more than likely depressed but it really seems like he's doing it to himself. It's just so frustrating to see him live in such a self-destructive way while I just sit here and watch.

I was speaking with my other buddy today and brought up how I was planning on hanging with a group of girls this weekend and hoped to hook up with one of the girls I like in the group and how I can't bring my one friend who I know will be available because of how he's been acting as of recent.

Adult child of some crazy people here, mainly concerned about my sister right now. To preface, my parents are recently divorced, within the past year, I’ve been doing well on my own since I turned 18 (almost 21 now), been managing to keep it together, have had my own place, been doing good. 

I don’t speak to my mom anymore after the divorce brought out a bunch of lies, and she decided she didn’t want to get a job and instead try and get money out of my dad, haha nice try mom. My sister still speaks to her as she was infantilized by my mother most of our lives (I was the older sister, had to be wise and take on adult things, while she HAD to be the baby forever) and depends on her hardcore (even though my father has been the one taking care of her.)

My dad lives about 2 hours away most of the time for work now, he’s still paying rent on a place for her to live in, she has a roommate (a family friend who’s my age), but he’s almost never there, she’s almost 19 now and refuses to get a job and spends most of her time with her boyfriend staying at his place, I had hope for a while as I found her applying for jobs one day, but she gave up and nothing came out of it.

She’s decided she’s going to be extremely cruel to me and my father now, for basically no reason other than my mother is fueling an anger toward us that she shouldn’t even have, I had to block her number today because of how cruel the things she was sending me were. 

My main question is what the hell do we do? I really want my dad to just kick her out of the place and leave her to my mother, but my sister’s tried to kill herself in the past (ended up on antidepressants, refuses to seek help now and get back on them even though she’s admitted multiple times she needs them.) We just don’t know what the hell to do with her without her harming herself and it’s unfair that she’s so cruel to my father while he’s doing everything in his power to keep her happy and push her forward in life and get her to be an adult.

My primary issue is that I currently work nights and weekends for said job. Working every Friday and Saturday night really puts a hitch in a social life. I work a staggered shift. Alternate Wednesdays, and every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday from 5:00 PM to 5:00 AM. My family occasionally has events on Friday or Saturday nights that I’m not able to attend because I’m chained to a desk. Also, due to the nature of my job (24/7 operation), if a holiday falls on my scheduled work day, our entire staff has to be there at night.

The time off I have is great. Sunday’s off are good for catching housework and just general laziness. Monday, Tuesday, and every other Wednesday are good for normal activities. I can go places during the day while everyone is at work. I can travel short distances, etc. It’s good to have days off during the week.

With that being said, I have an upcoming opportunity to move into a day shift role with a 5-day work week from 8:00 AM - 5:00 PM. This job is essentially what I do now, but a lot more involved.

Basically I started dating this girl in June of 2016 and the relationship ended  about 7 months ago VERY poorly. See other posts for details. Anyway, she was best friends with a girl.
We’ll call her B. Ex would be X.

B is no longer friends with X

I started working a new job and as it turns out, B works there. Now I’ve known B ever since I’ve known X.

B needs rides home from work often and our boss schedules us together because I’m happy to oblige. Usually we have long and deep conversations about anything under the sun and just absolutely click in all of our conversations. She seems very flirty with me periodically but when I made advances in the past while she was dating her ex and me, mine, (X opened our relationship) she didn’t take kindly to them.

Now we’re really good friends and I’ve finally gotten over X and B has caught my attention yet again. I think about her a lot and she really just draws me in. I have really strong feelings for her but there’s one issue. She has another boyfriend that she’s been steady with for a couple months. Actually lives with the guy.

I really want to tell her my feelings because I think it’s the right thing to do but I also don’t want to muddy the friendship we do have if she doesn’t feel the same way.

67,"So I just got fired, 4 days into a new job. That's got to be some kind of record. The job was face to face sales, which I had no prior experience in, training on the job.

On Monday I got placed in a team with two other people, one (we'll call her Tash) relatively new still, only a few weeks in, the other has been there for a few months (let's call her Sara). So Sara is in charge of the team, and we've been in the mall for the last 3 days making sales. Sara has been a great help in training me, and I've been getting better and improving my sales everyday. 

Yesterday was weird. From 9am - 4pm, I matched sales with Sara and was ahead of Tash. This is a first for me, and I was happy with how I was going, but also thought I was having a fair bit of good luck. I seem to do better with an older demographic, while the other two are fantastic with young adults. It was just my day crowd wise, so I think. But it's a team thing, not a competition, so though I'm happy with how I was doing, I didn't parade about it, I shut up and just kept doing my job. I soon started to notice both of their attitudes souring towards me, and I just tried to keep my chin up and realise how discouraging it likely was being in their shoes. 

Afternoon turns into night, it's late night shopping and though we're not paid past 5.30pm, we're expected to stay if we still need to make our individual targets. I have reached mine by this point, but have stayed on because Sara  said earlier in the week that we were all working it, even though the boss said that morning that newbies didn't have to. The demographic of the store changed, lots more young people coming through, and Sara and Tash are doing great. I'm quickly overtaken, and as I'm having trouble getting people to stop for me my energy starts to lag. Tash has been stopping people from my side of the stall, and it's starting to grate on my nerves. The next person I stopped, I made an error in my pitch which Sara corrected me for. I replied with 'Sorry, I'm getting tired.' She asked if I'd like to go home. I agreed, as it was 8.20 by this point, and I had the sales I needed.

This morning I get to the office and I'm called into a private meeting with the boss and Sara. I was asked if I knew why I was called in, I asked if it was because I left early. Apparently no, I was called in because I had 'burst into tears and gotten snotty about Tash and Sara's sales.' I denied this, there was no point where I cried yesterday. Tash is then called in and she corroborates Sara's story and adds that I boasted about my sales to her earlier in the day and made her feel like shit. There's literally no truth to these statements. I'm then asked if I can 'pull my head out and do my job today?' I said I couldn't work with people that are straight up lying about my character like that. Sacked immediately - give us your badge, give us your shirt, get out.

As this is a casual job, I don't think I have any legal grounds to stand on for unfair dismissal. Is there anything I can do? How would you have handled this differently? Mostly I'm upset about how I've lost my job over a lie. If I'd done the things they said, I'd take it on the chin and do better. But two people have colluded against me and I have no idea why.",08Mar2019,1

That behavior both got me into the college that I'm about to graduate from, and resulted in my terrible GPA (around a 2.9).

Moving on, today we were eating when somebody braught up how my dads wife (yes they got married, and i wasnt invited to the wedding)can tell what a babys gonna be before their born, she gave the example of how she told my dad that my aunt was gonna have twins, only problem is that my aunt was pregnant back in 2006 way before my dad divorced my mom, and it really gave me this feeling of just hate and anger towards my dad for being a liar. Thats not all, When we got home, my 'step-mom' reminds my dad about how he got her a boot 10 years ago, yea you get the idea, but the problem is just that i cant stand this, i want to hear the truth from his mouth i need to let him know that he cant play me like im some low-key idiot. What should i do? Confront him? Just ignore everything? Should o go back to living with my mom? (i have a great relationship with her and we both k ow about his dirty lies n shit).

75,"Okay so basically some guy in my college has been making my days MISERABLE, I can’t even look forward to my drawing class anymore because he’s there and he towers around me like a cancerous growth. Normally I’m not so harsh but I have had it. 
A little backstory: Lets call this guy Weeaboo Jones (WJ) he seems like the type of person who gets mad at people for playing video games like animal crossing like the type of person to have hentai pics in their twitter or that kind of deal. Anyways, I started this drawing class and I was super looking forward to it because I finally get to have some classes that have to do with my interests; this dude was any other guy in my class I never heed any mind to him it wasn’t until later on in the semester that he would slowly start complementing my work, which I didn’t think much about because I mean that’s just kind a standard art class stuff but soon his compliments became weird telling me stuff like my hair “looks great”. I pegged he was a weeb a long time ago so I just though ‘oh he’s just awkward’ and moved on. Basically I never ever payed this guy any mind at all until my class forced us to go to our school’s art museum to look and appreciate works of art etc. etc, during that time he came up to me and started with over compliments again “Your art is very good” “How long have you drawn?” “You’re pretty cool”. It was painstakingly awkward for me to stand there and take those compliments especially because he really looked like he wanted to say something else until I guess he mustered up the courage to, “Hey do you have social media?” Instantly alarm bells began to ring and I immediately said no, playing the local card and how I only have messenger on facebook. Begrudgingly I let him add me on Facebook after, during the entire exhibition he followed me around the museum I was creeped out because clearly this dude was trying to make advances on me and he just kept stubbornly following me around- I managed to narrowly escape to the bathroom in which i stayed to debate what to do. Finally I set up my mind to set him straight and just tell him I’m not interested and I am dating someone (which is the complete truth). 
Pretty much after that’s what happened, I apologized to him if I misunderstood but just incase I told him that I was not interested in anyone at the moment since I was in a relationship- instantly he shook his head saying “no no no” making and excuse that he’s just “awkward like that” the gullible part in me felt a little relieved but I wasn’t falling for it. After that we had small talk until class was exhibit time was over- I made the mistake of exposing I like anime (he seemed too excited of the prospect of me knowing animes) but anyways the day ended and I went home. 

Giving him my facebook was the biggest mistake of my life. After that, he kept sending me memes of video game characters that he KNEW I had no idea about or some random screen shot of a twitter meme, I never met someone so incapable of making conversation. He would just send me thing of mundane funny things in which I honestly couldn’t be bothered. I expected him to give up sending me messages after acting cold and not reading his messages but I couldn’t be more WRONG it’s been 2 weeks since I gave him my facebook and just YESTERDAY he left me another random picture which I refuse to look at. Oh and another thing, during one of our conversations I told to him that I was with my my s/o (significant other) that i was “with HER” right now. Which his response was “oh cool” 

During class too I can tell when he looks at me (frequently) and just today during our class break he tried to invite me for some ice cream (????) I told him no that I wasn’t hungry but then after he came up to me and gave me some chocolate chip cookies (I threw them away, I wish I had the courage to have done that in front of him tbh). Today we also had to draw the portrait of person so we had to partner with someone, I had the misfortune of coming in after a quick trip to the restroom so everyone had a partner already except him and some other guy. Why couldn’t WJ just partner up with that other guy? But no he purposely waited for me to come back (Oh and before you say, “oh SpookyMulder why didn’t u just partner up with that other dude and not WJ” well it’s because I didn’t know that dude was free)

77,"I have a conflict in the schedule I want to take next year. Not the typical scheduling conflict, but a personal conflict. I want to take AP Chem (C), but still the same time I want to take AP Spanish Language (S) and AP European History (H). At first I thought I wouldn't be able to take C because I wouldn't have room, but I realized that I might have a free spot open for 1 more period if I don't choose another elective. I was going to take S and H, but really wanted to take C. Problem is, C is a double period class. So I have to give up either H or S to do so. I really don't want to drop my engineering course, because if I drop it, I have to instead take a capstone project that is a 1 semester class, and I'll have to take something like comparative govt or foundations of art for the second semester (which I don't want to do). Here are the pros and cons of S and H. I'm really good at Spanish, and S would be a good class to continue my skills, but I don't find it necessary, as I'm learning another language right now and would rather invest more time into this other language (Persian if you are wondering). But at the same time, of I pass the AP exam, I get a ""bilingual"" marking on my transcript, and it makes it easier to get into college (supposedly). Or I take H, which I really love the history of Europe, but it gets me absolutely nowhere academically. But it is a relatively easy class and I will have friends that are going to take it, so I can take it along with them and be study buddies :D.

79,"So I signed a lease alone a couple years ago cause my ex and I broke up and I wanted to get out of the house with him ASAP. I signed on to a two bedroom, thats affordable and cute. I recently went back to school (yay im only 26 F and in grad school!!!) so im not able to work as much and rent is getting hard to pay now that I'm a full time student. I work part time at a clothing store, but $150 a week isn't enough to cover all my expenses. 

So, I got a roommate. 

She's an international student (38 F) and very obnoxious, rude, and loud. She signed on as a sub-lease, where she's my tenant, not the property managers. So I had her sign a rental agreement, give me the money, and all is good. 

She still owes me WIFI money, so today I changed the password. 

She constantly tells me I'm being too loud when I'm washing dishes, cooking, or watching tv (on low volume). She bitches about my cats, my apartment, and me ALL THE TIME. 

We just got into an argument in the kitchen because she wants to move out, but signed a contract saying she has to give 1 month's notice to receive back her deposit (and abide by the other rules). 

On move in day, she was 2 hours late (and I told her I had an early morning class). I told her I was available to help at a certain time, and then I had to leave. She missed the timeframe, and then yelled at me just now saying it was rude that I didn't even help her move in. I said I waited for 2 hours, and you didn't show up. I had to go to class, and I can't skip classes for my graduate degree. 

She accuses me of many things, such as lying about reporting her to the property manager. I've never complained about her to them - only to my friends as she's up until 2am with all the lights on, and I go to bed around 11. I haven't complained about her to anyone in a position of power, so I don't know what shes talking about. She accused me of being prejudiced (she's from South America), but so is my mother. Both my parents were immigrants, and I'm a first generation Canadian. It's not a race thing, its a ""she's a dick"" thing. 

I just don't know how to deal with her until May 1 (Its March 7 today). 

She orders me to do things too. She'll tell me the garbage is full in the bathroom and I need to change it for her. I cleaned off my desk for her, I try to keep my cats away from her, I do whatever I can to try to keep her from bitching at me. I don't even sit in the living/dining room anymore when she is home because she'll spend the whole time bitching and giving me dirty looks. 

I told her if she feels that way about me, she doesn't have to talk to me at all. I told her that I'm not here to be her best friend or slave.

I don't know what to do. I changed the wifi since she hasn't paid it, but that won't last forever. I don't know how to deal with her for the next 6 weeks without going crazy, hiding in my room, and hating every minute of my life.

Sure, these are some pretty serious issues, but they are mainly caused by an serious lack of motivation to even get up in the morning. It’s just a feeling of emptiness and lack of emotion. I rarely feel happiness anymore, and my weight gain caused by my inability to find strength in moving out of bed has gotten my mother angry at me. 

My mom’s a good lady and I love her when she loves me, but forever now she’s put my down on my hopes and always finds a way to put me down. Even if I’m having a genuine time hanging out with her she still manages to put me down. 
(Example: why are you still laying there in bed? You will never be anything in life unless you get a job.)

So, all of these things combined have given me a complete feeling of emptiness and sadness. Nothing ever makes me happy anymore, and my gloom for my future is slowly weighing on me. Is laziness, lack of motivation, general unhappiness, and looming sadness a good enough issue for me to get tested for depression? I don’t want to be an “attention seeker” and claim that I have depression.

My first post in this community, and I really need some guidance.

I met this amazing girl on the internet (INFP) about a month back. We'd flirted before, but recently ( as I often do :( ) I got attached and have truly fallen for her. She remains distant at some times, but is generally loving, especially over the phone and ft. Ig my inner prospective side comes out and I feel something very different and unique from her vibe wise that makes me imagine a future with her very easily.

* She can come off as very condescending, but also very sweet and always wants to talk
* Physically, she's my mfing type lol
* She's interested in meeting in person asap
* She has some problems with trust due to insecurities concerning her body and feeling loved.  

   * She's an artist like me, and shares my interest in music
* Her most recent interest ghosted her. According to her, I'm her first boyfriend

The only thing is, we recently got into a small argument. I confided in my bestfriend (ENFP) (who lives much closer), who I find is easier to talk to and much more loving but lacks that really illusive, attracting vibe that the other has. During that, she confessed her love for me and we ended up in a position in which I nearly cheated -- I couldn't bring myself to do it.

* She knows more about me than anyone else on this earth. She's sweet and extremely considerate
* I find myself attracted to her, but don't pick up on the same vibe
* Our senses of humour and level of openness with one another are unmatched
* We're both very sensual people and thus the sexual tension there is extremely apparent

However, she now wants to pursue a relationship. So do I. But I also feel that I love the girl I'm currently with. I feel like breaking up with her would crush her as well. I've known what it's like to get attached and burned, and I'm too empathetic (not in a braggadocios way of course. Just a softy at the end of the day) to comfortably do that to her. They both deserve the world, and idk how I can give it to both of them

95,"I work at a daycare that has no ""safe storage"" for our belongings. I've worked there for three years and we run pretty much on the honor code. No one would steal if we didn't steal. However, someone IS stealing from me. On Feb. 12th, twenty dollars went missing from my wallet. I thought I had misplaced it, convinced myself of it, even though I'm super anxious about money and know to the last cent how much is on me at all times. I wrote it off, convinced I made a mistake.

It happened again today(March 7th). I had a twenty in my wallet when I went in at 8, and when I got out at 5, and subsequently went to get dinner at 5:30, the 20 was gone. I didn't go anywhere(as I did not have my car until I had gotten home), and I know I didn't spend that 20. There was nothing for me to spend it on. Same room. With the same teachers. The same amount of money.

Subsequently, 40 dollars went missing from my wallet in the last two months. The only thing of value in the wallet was my debit card, but i already canceled the card and have a new one coming in a week. There has been no mysterious bank account activity on the card, but I did so just to be secure.

But now I don't know what to do. Someone is stealing from me and I have no proof. I like my job and want to keep it, but I'm incredibly upset I'm being taken advantage of(I'm a twenty year old college student and this job is perfect for it's location and flexibility round my school hours). My plan of action is to simply go to the director, state my issue, and explain I wasn't going to work until this was sorted out... Then leave.

I have been friends with this person who I should call V since kindergarten (junior year of high school know). He is a strict Catholic and LITERALLY does not care about anyone else's judgment. He himself is a very judgy person and a very smart kid, I am talking smart SMART.

**Today in 7th Period**:
I was working on my essay about how important home education is, until I got distracted. I heard V talking to a girl across the classroom (calling her D), so it is very hard to not hear. I only heard part of the conversation, which is the part that kind of infuriated me. V basically said:

&gt; V - I told K (some other girl) that M (in my opinion the victim), instead of worshiping cows he should worship Christ.

&gt; V - and she told him, I'm not going to her anything anymore.

**Why I was angry**:
It sounded pretty offending and mean, its just something you don't say. The way he said was in a non-joking way and justified it as their is only one god.

I am also catholic, not THAT strict. The other two people in our agreed with me that he should not have said that.

**In Overall**:
I am kind of sick on how V acts, cause he can be a big asshole. This is not the first time he has said this kind of stuff and I have always put it off as ""That's V"". But in the same time I felt like I exaggerated. I was hoping someone would clarify if I did or didn't.

*I am going to distance myself from despite if I did exaggerate because he has body shamed girls before, out loud and without a care.*",08Mar2019,0
99,"Sorry if this is a major rant, but I need advice. 

My friend and I (both females) were both single when we moved in together last year. Well, a little over a month after we moved in, she got with her boyfriend who was part of our friend group.

Fast forward to now, about six months, and he’s basically living with us. Stays over almost every night (the few nights he doesn’t, she goes to his place - his moms house). But the part that is bugging me, besides the fact that I never see her, making me feel like moving ten minutes from my parents to live with a friend was pointless, is that I feel like the guest here. They make dinners, take the couch/tv, where I feel limited to just my room. Again, making me question why I’m paying rent for this. He doesn’t help with utilities, so ultimately me and her are splitting for his showers, his cooking, etc. 

He sometimes asks to use my stuff which I’m good with really, but I’ll find other stuff used that just irks me, as they make far more money than I do. I don’t mind sharing, but it’s not his house. I buy coffee and beer for me, and it slowly dwindles down. My bathroom shelves are slowly getting taken over. AND I do a majority of the cleaning (a quick wipe down isn’t good enough for me when I can still see crumbs/food on the counters and ground.) I take out the trash cans. His laundry and belongings are slowly coming into the house. He spends weeks at a time before spending a night at home. I come home from work (I leave before them) to the lights being on the past 8 hours and they’re breakfast residue.

I’m going insane. How do they think it’s okay? Because we were all friends before? They do ask me to hang with them, but who likes being a third wheel?

How do I tell her that I’m thinking of moving home, to save money but mostly because these are my issues? I’m a very easygoing person, so confrontation isn’t my thing.

Sorry for the rant- there’s more, but my blood is currently boiling. Lol thank you, thank you!",08Mar2019,0
100,"Nobody in my family was as close to my dad as me. When I was younger, my dad was my absolute hero. He understood me and my passion for music. He’d know just what to do when I was down. He was the most supportive dad I could ever wish for. But things soon got ugly between my mum and dad and I never knew why.

Dad moved away after they split up when I was 7 and we lost contact until about 5 years ago when he had decided to move back in with my grand parents. He came at the perfect time as my grandad was sick and they really needed help around the house being wheelchair bound and needed a lot of care. Grandad wasn’t happy about it but my grandma was delighted to have her boy back. When I saw dad again it was like nothing had changed. He was still the same person to me. I didn’t ask many questions about why he didn’t try to contact us. It seemed he had started a new family and then separated with his partner, but I was just happy to have him back. 

Unfortunately, my grandad passed away a year later. My grandma was extremely vulnerable but at least she had my dad. I was happy that she had someone. But it seemed like nobody else was. Especially my mum.

She kept warning my gran about watching her stuff. I got so defensive. I thought wow how dare she talk about my dad like that. I thought she was just jealous that he was back in his daughters life. Obviously I was wrong.

A year passes, I travel to see my dad and gran a handful of times in that year, but one day I get a phone call. It was my grans sister and she lives in the other side of the country but had decided to stay with her for a couple of days. She told me pretty bluntly that my dad had gone missing along with £60,000 from my grans bank account. All her savings wiped. Gone. But not taken all at once, it had gone over the year. It didn’t really sink in at first, I still don’t know how he managed to do it. I thought surely the bank would’ve clocked on if he gradually spent that much money over the space of a year? I thought to myself no, this is a misunderstanding. I was wrong. He had convinced my gran to give him access to her accounts so he could ‘pay her bills and get her shipping done’. 

Can you imagine the shock I was in. But worst of all my poor grandma. She was just starting to adapt to the loss of her husband and her own son betrayed her and stole her money.  I kept trying to call and ask about but nobody could find him. 

So, because my dad is so great at disappearing,  he has been hiding and running from the police for like 3 years and nobody knew where he went, until a couple of months ago. I got a message on Facebook from one of his old friends and they gave me his number. I called the number and when I heard my dads voice I just cried. I completely broke down. However, I put it all down to worrying about him and decided to act totally oblivious to what had happened. I started having a normal conversation with him. All I could think of was turning him into the police. I wanted him to pay for what he had done. I was angry. I was upset. I convinced him to ‘let me visit’ and gave me his address. I was straight on the phone to the police. They turned up at his door and they arrested him. He’s recently been sentenced and is now in prison.

Worst part about it is that there were 4 warrants out for his arrest. He had failed to attend his community service after attacking someone and broke a restraining order put in against him by his ex after attacking her. My mum wasn’t even shocked. She knew what he was like which makes me think maybe he was the same with her behind closed doors. She won’t really talk about it. 

This whole process has completely messed my head up. I called the police in the heat of the moment and I know it was the right thing to do but when I had calmed down, the guilt started to kick in. He’s having a really hard time in prison already and he calls me every week. I think he knows I snitched on him (it’s pretty obvious) but he doesn’t talk about it. I should hate him for what he has done to my family but I just can’t and the minute I start to feel guilty for turning him in, I feel awful and think about my gran and the pain he’s caused her. She’s lost her house, her money and she’s in a nursing home. I find myself lying awake at night trying to justify why he did it. How do you stop the guilt from completely swallowing you? I’m completely torn and I’m not sleeping properly because I just think of him in that jail scared and alone. Do I continue to talk to him? Do I listen to my family and cut him off? ",08Mar2019,6
101,"Hello!

I've recently gone through a really brutal breakup. I say recently but it was the end of august last year. We had a lot of history and I was very in love with her. 

To give you a bit of history: we were first together about 7 years ago in high school and when we were 17. We did all the firsts together like love, sex, etc. We were together for about three years with a wee break up in the middle of it. 

She got pregnant at the end of it that time. It all happened in really a quite horrible way. We were 20 at the time. She had been taking the pill while we were together. She stopped taking the pill and didn't say anything to me and kept having sex with me and inevitably got pregnant. She says now that it was stupid and she thought we were going to end soon and that we weren't having sex as much so she got lax taking it. 

At the time, I was obviously upset about this and didn't want to have the baby. She decided she wanted to have the baby. This messed me up quite badly for a while. I felt like I'd been raped in a way. I tried to keep it together but we ended not talking really at all for the last 4-5 months of the pregnancy. 

When our daughter was born I obviously started to go to her and get more and more involved in their lives. Really our daughter lived with her and the vast majority of the responsibility was taken on by her. I've always felt awful about this but was still honestly reeling and terrified that she could hurt me again. I would go down most nights to give my daughter her her dinner and bath her and put her to bed and then would leave after that. I still had feelings for her mum but was too scared of getting hurt to do anything. In the first year, she got more and more clear with her wanting to be together again. I would always sleep on the couch if I was looking after our daughter and she would tell me it was ok to use her bed, especially if she was on a night out and would be back to share the bed. I didn't do anything for a while but eventually gave in to feeling and stayed in her bed. We got together and then after that started to see each other again. It was nice but honestly still quite strange with the dynamic of having a daughter together. I didn't move in with her and would still do the same routine of bath and bed with our daughter only now would stay later sometimes. It never really evolved much past that. I think I was so scared of getting hurt again that anything new freaked me out as it meant getting more involved. We had some nice times as a family and I really fell very deeply in love with her and my daughter and the family as a unit. 

Then things fucked up. Both over time and quite suddenly. I was happy with the two of them. Everything seemed so nice. Towards the end she started to get more and more distant. Her mum had just had her cancer return so I thought she was just scared with that. I would try to ask how she was and if there was anything I could do and she would just get more and more annoyed and it would end with 'can you cure cancer?', 'no sorry'. I just felt like I couldn't help or do anything. We got further and further apart, until eventually she sat me down and told me we were breaking up. 

She gave good reasons that were honestly just correct; We hadn't really done enough together since getting back together. It was all still a lot of the same routine. She was still mostly responsible for looking after our daughter. I would have her roughly once a week over night at mines and a few nights of the week at her flat till late. I was a bit over stressed and preoccupied with uni and work and honestly didn't invest the time or thought as much as I should have. I left her alone more than she was happy with. 

All of this was obvious in retrospect but at the time I had been happy in my own world just sticking to the routine and carrying on. She had started a new job a few months  ago and had made new friends there who had clearly made her feel much better. So, very upset and still trying to make amends and make the family work we carried on for the next month separated. The month was really just pretty brutal.

In that month I had really started to think back on a few things towards the end of our relationship. Funny wee lies she told. She'd been going out a lot more really late and I'd been taking our daughter so she could get out as she was clearly due it. I was happy to see her making new mates. At the same time I was worried as she had been more distant. We used to share our locations with each other 24/7 (a bit weird but it was nice to trust each other). She had been turning it off and saying that her phone was just doing it. I just believed her at the time. One time she didn't turn it off and went to a funny part of town. I asked her about it and she told me she went some where with a pal of hers but I can tell when she lies. At the time I just assumed she didn't want me to worry or it was just something silly that she thought i would get jealous about so lied to save the bother. Anyways, to get to the point I was at her flat looking after our daughter one night when she was out and added all this together and realised I'd been just blindly trusting her and that she had almost certainly been cheating on me. We had only ever been with each other and I cracked and read her journal. I'm really ashamed of it but I was freaking out and was a bit desperate to know. Turns out she had fallen for someone at her new job and they had been getting together for the last couple of months of our relationship. I was absolutely distraught. She put a lot of detail into the journal. I stopped caring and read her messages to him. They were horrible. She wanted a relationship but he was leaving for Australia for a year shortly so they 'kept it casual'. She would ask him if he was having sex with other women and was upset when he told her not to ask! She literally said 'I'm a relationship kind of girl' to him! When she was in a bloody relationship. Anyways, really wish I'd never read them as she was very keen.

Part of me understands her wanting to break free of being a mum and our relationship. But most of me is just still astonished that my best mate could so casually do that while still kissing me goodnight and telling me she loved me. To do it after dropping our daughter off with me. To not think of how it would affect that seems so oddly cold. I really wish she had just ended us first. She dumped me the day he left for Australia. 

I confronted her about it when she got back in and she got really angry I'd read her journal and was quite defensive and mean and just told me how I wasn't there enough and that she had been unhappy. For the next couple of months honestly I was just a mess and didn't see her or our daughter much. Maybe a handful of times. We eventually started doing some things together as a family again and it was nice. She was with someone else from work (again 'casually') which she made obvious a few times. I was struggling to deal with it all but cracked on anyways. We carried on like this and eventually I asked her if she would want to do something together just the two of us. She seemed anxious but said yes. I couldn't believe it and was really taken aback and sort of relieved. It came to the night we were going to see each other and she said that she just couldn't do it. She sort of burst and said that it was too much and that she didn't want anything between us still. I felt awful again. I spoke to her on the phone about it and she was as straight as ever that she didn't think we would ever work out again and that she just said that she would see me because she was scared to say no that I would get upset and stop looking after our daughter as much. She also told me that she had started up messaging the guy in Australia again for the last few months. 

That brings us to now. I'm honestly not sure how to deal with it all. I can't just leave because of our daughter. I love her to bits. I also still honestly lover her mum. It's shit but I can't help it. 

Whenever I have my daughter alone I just feel so sad and alone now. It's really messed with my relationship with her. I can't seem to act ok around her mum either. I'm quite bitter but also still love her so making sense of anything is always difficult. 

I really just want to disappear and try and get over it all but I obviously have to keep seeing my daughter. Whenever I do it all just floods back. 

She's moved on ok as she's quite happy. I just can't. I'm not even sure how to meet people. Even if I did I'm an emotional wreak which isn't appealing at all.  I've been distant from all my mates for a few years now too. I used to just spend my time between work and her and my daughter so drifted from mates. I've not dealt with it well and have messaged her here and there to talk about how I'm feeling. 

Right now we've decided to not talk and only communicate to pass our daughter back and forth. I hate this. I miss her and having our daughter just reminds me of her and our relationship. I hate that I can't seem to think of my own daughter as an individual. I hate that I'm thinking it but part of me wants to just distance myself or leave the country or something like that.

Just to also be clear, I'm at a real low and am very sad/depressed/alone. I'm not suicidal though.

Sorry for the rambling. If anyone has any advice on how to even begin dealing with this then I'm super thankful for your help. Also any advice on the parts of this I fucked up is appreciated.

It’s so heartbreaking to me to think of my mom going through this:( I wasn’t there. After a while I didn’t want to go anymore. I was torn between visiting and staying home but it’s hard for me. The first time I visited a grandparent in the hospital I nearly passed out. I’m so sorry I didn’t get to physically say goodbye:( 

I’m sorry for having been a brat as a child...I was always very mean to everyone, including my grandma. I’m also sorry if I didn’t express compassion correctly or enough. The entire time was so hard for me. It was about 2 weeks that she was in the hospital. I barely ate and I felt physical pain. 

I want to make my mom happy, or somehow stop her from being sad. I know that’s not possible but I wish it was. Is there a way to rationalize death for someone? Or would that just be ignorance?

I also have a hard time speaking about my emotions. I feel them but I get really confused and tangled up. I’m better at writing them out. I miss my grandma, she was the sweetest woman. I feel her with me a lot of the time. Her energy is really distinct to me.

111,"  I was friends with this guy for a little over 2 years now. He was my best friend. And recently we were talking and I opened up about an ex of mine and how he was a jerk and really hurtful (verbally).  My friend responded with something along the lines of ""I have to hear his side of the story to believe any of that."" And it upset me.
 
 I explained to him how it upset me and how it hurt my feelings that what it sounds like he's saying is that he would need my ex to tell him that it was true and that he doesnt just believe me.  

 He went off on me and called me a low friend to expect something like that of him and that he's not just a yes man.  And that he doesnt believe everything I tell him.

  I have never lied to him or given him a reason to doubt me.  He also makes me feel like shit when I tell him I'm uncomfortable talking about stuff.  Like the one conversation was about how I would feel if I were being stabbed and he went into detail about how I was being stabbed.  

  I messaged him to apologize about my message (the one where I was explaining why what he said hurt me/the one he went off on me for) and he said that now he doesnt see me the same and he doesnt trust me and how hes glad I understand how wrong I was to say what I did.  

  I'm pretty sure I wasnt the one in the wrong, but I apologized anyway in hopes that it wouldn't ruin our friendship and that we could move past it.  But when I apologized he pretty much put it all on me.  

  A part of me (the part I get from my mom) wants to tear him a new one and bitch him out for how shitty a friend he is and point put in explicit detail why he is such a shitty friend.  But another part of me (my social anxiety side that hates confrontation) wants to just ignore him, block him on everything, and never talk to him again.

116,So I was supposed to get my period on February 21st. My period isn’t completely regular but it stays within normal bounds for a period. A few days go by after I noticed I was late and I started feeling very nauseous when I woke up and it persisted until about noon every day and then it was manageable but uncomfortable until it was bad again around dinner time. My appetite started fluctuating and after a few days of that I decided to tell my family and fiancé what’s up. We started paying close attention to how I felt and things and I took a few tests at home and they came back negative but still no period and the nausea and odd symptoms remained. 15 days later and I’ve taken 4 tests (all negative) and had pink spotting and appetite fluctuations every day with still no period. We were starting to get very concerned that pregnancy was a very real possibility. I go to work as normal today and after being nauseous all morning I felt like I had to go to the bathroom urgently and it was very painful so I checked to see if there was more pink spotting I noticed a lot of blood (like a lot) way more than a normal period for me. I threw up twice and decided to take myself home and was in a lot of pain and kept vomiting and having to go to the bathroom horribly all while bleeding quite a lot for a few hours. Even though I never got a positive result on the at-home pregnancy tests (I know those aren’t always reliable and everyone’s body is different and hormones and stuff) I still have this awful feeling that I’ve had a miscarriage today and I just don’t know what to do or how to feel. I have a doctors appointment next week and I am dreading it. I’m just lost. I haven’t told my family because I don’t want to know how they’ll react because I’m afraid they’ll just say I finally got my period and we can all move on like normal when I don’t feel that’s the case.

Last year on her birthday I had to work. I told her that I would take her to a fancy dinner and ordered her flowers. She felt neglected and ended up checking into a mental hospital. Obviously, I felt horrible. 

This past weekend, she posted something on Facebook that was pretty racist. My friends brought it to my attention. I asked her to stop posting so many racist things because it’s causing problems in my life. It’s sounds selfish but I’m almost 30 and have been bullied most my life. She lost it. Told my friends that if they want to “tattle” on her to f@ck off. I asked my closest friends to just delete her and be done with it. 

She didn’t speak to me until today as I was getting ready for work. She told me she wants to kill herself because of our relationship problems and her sickness. I immediately had my shift covered and began traveling to see her. (She lives an hour away) When I arrived she was crying. Told me my friends are assholes, she’s dying and thinks about taking all her meds at once to end it. My mom takes care of my grandpa who’s an amputee that just recovered from cancer and he’s the only reason she’s still alive. 

She went on to get really mad at me and my friends. (One friend commented on her status and mentioned the years of emotional and physical abuse she’s put me through over the years and how I’ll be better off. I told him he went too far and he deleted it.) she told me that when she checked into the hospital last summer it was because she wanted to kill people and herself. She lied to the doctors to get released at the 72 hour mark. Her immediate doctor told her that that was a bad idea. She no longer sees that doctor. 

She has so many prescription drugs on her bedside table. She’s sleeping now and I’m at a loss for what to do now. Please help me. 

TLDR: mom is dying from diabetes wants to kill herself and maybe others after we got into a fight last weekend. ",08Mar2019,0

123,"&gt;hi, okay, so here is a little backstory on my mom and i when it comes to this stuff. i have very religious parents. from a young age things like this would happen. i wasn't allowed to wear leggings without a long shirt covering me, i was in fourth/fifth grade. another thing was when i was in eighth going into ninth ( that summer ) i got my first thong. it wasn't that sexy it was cotton with a little bit of lace, to be honest i just picked up any and said ""okay this one will do."" but at the time i had my first boyfriend, who i was not allowed to kiss either. another instance was when i went to Kennywood ( an amusement park ) and if you live in the pittsburgh area you'll know there is the pittsburgh plunge. well, being that its my favorite ride, i would always wear a tankini and shorts and maybe like a kimono cover up. when i got home from being with my boyfriend at the time. she yelled at me for wearing that around him. going swim suit shopping was the worst because she always said something about my dad. i always had to wear a bra around him wjen i was younger because it made him uncomfortable (??)  
&gt;  
&gt; now to the story. i was around 15 at the time, which i understand now cause i was younger, but i wasn't showing much. we got into an argument about what i was wearing i can't actually remember, all i remember that it was a crop top. i remember asking her why is she so worried about how i look. we get into this argument and she said ""you look easy"" and i sat there and cried. everytime i wear something i feel some sort of self consciousness. i'm 17 now, this happened when i was 15.

125,"Hi! Thanks for tuning in, if you have any questions, feel free to ask. This has been bothering me, so I guess it’s kind of like a rant and cry for help as well?

Whenever I was 15, I was lonely and had a minimal amount of friends. I joined Kik and found friends in an Xbox Overwatch group. Is it the best place to find buddies? Hell no, but I was desperate and very sad back then.

In that Kik group, I had met a boy around my age, let’s call him Mark. Mark and I got along together, we were the best of friends and he was very dear to me. However, there were some stressful conflicts that occurred in the Kik group and it pushed my mental health over the edge. They aren’t important for me to remember, but I was so fragile, it just happened to be the conflicts within the group that made me lose it. I cut off contact with Mark as I begun intensive therapy at a hospital, focusing on myself.

The summer of next year, I contacted Mark again. I had blocked him initially, but upon wondering how he was and unblocking him, he had left me dozens of messages. It was mainly consisting of apologizes and how he missed me- I decided to have pity on him. I hate to say it, but I fell in love with him. He was everything that I looked to waking up each morning and he was my obsession. I like to think that he loved me too, but it was short-lived, seeing as we lived a state apart and there were some problems...

He didn’t lie to me, but he didn’t tell me about his girlfriend of 5 years who lived in Canada. Talk about mentally unstable, she threatened me for talking to him and it was very emotionally thrashing. This lead me from shying away from him, obviously placing mistrust and hurt towards him. We eventually lost contact as I found a boyfriend and started seeing him, however I never blocked Mark.

It’s been nearly a year since I met a new person and have since moved on, but Mark has not. He still messages me and we talk briefly, but I do not want him in his life. However, he seems to be fixated on me and I believe he still holds feelings for me. He talks about how much he regrets what happens and hates himself for it. It’s very uncomfortable and unbearable- I wish he could just let go and move on.

I just don’t know what to do. What do you think?",08Mar2019,1

A few months ago I found out he was sexting a girl and had a tablet full of pictures and videos of women.

He told he was sexually assaulted numerous times starting at the age of 4 all the way up to his teenage years..... by several ppl.

128,"The context is that I'm in medical school right now, and I'm taking a once a week calligraphy class just for fun. We've had 2 sessions so far, and I already feel that she acts very coldly towards me. 

Here are the instances I noticed her acting coldly towards me:

* She doesn't look at me when she talks. There are only 4 people in the class!
* I like to experiment a lot, and in the week between classes I did a lot of my own research and practice on different styles of calligraphy. She directly pointed to one such practice and said ""That's not correct. The letter S doesn't have those things on them. This one is wrong as well. It doesn't look like that""
* Later, I asked for clarification on the letter W, because I couldn't tell what exactly she was doing. She was like ""stop - just stop. That's not a good question to ask, it doesn't matter. Your writing is yours. My writing is mine. Your letters will never look the same as my letters."" 
* She was standing in front of me and the student next to me, chit-chatting. I tried to pipe up during the conversation, and she didn't make any effort to converse back with me. 
* In general, she never talks to me. Doesn't say anything unless I say something first. 


Here are some possible explanations?? 

* I'm coming off as one of those ""know it all"" students by doing extra research and learning other fonts. [I'm thinking this is most likely? If so... any advice on how to tone that down?]
* I'm pretty quiet and don't really speak up in class... maybe she things I'm boring? 
* Maybe she's racist lol
* I'm pretty girly, and wear a lot of dresses. She seems to prefer more traditionally masculine traits (short hair, jeans + tee, etc). It's possible she could be judging me about that?
* I'm totally overreacting and she doesn't actually dislike me.

I realize that this is almost a non-problem, but honestly it really bothers me. When she snapped at me about the letter W, I almost teared up. I had to look down at my paper and avoid eye contact because it felt like I was being singled out, and I don't know why! 

I took this class because I wanted to relax. This is causing me so much more anxiety than I ever anticipated, almost enough that I don't want to even go anymore. She made me feel ashamed of myself for experimenting and asking questions. Altogether this just pisses me off. 

I'm also genuinely worried - as I said, I've only met her twice, and she just seemed to dislike me so immediately. I can't figure out what the reason would be?

129,"This story is going to sound really bizarre because it is.

So, I haven't attended a school assembly since arond freshman year. I'm a senior now, but I never have anyone to sit with, hate the bleachers, and it's boring/a waste of time.

In an attempt to be inclusive my school has a ""renaissance"" assembly, where they send an email out to all of the parents, (but not students for whatever god damn reason) to self nominate/sign up and be recognized fpr hobbies outside of school. Not to bash kids who do it but as you can imagine it has a negative connatation, as you haven't quite earned anything and it's just an excuse to get your picture up front of everyone. Pretty lame all around, especially for high school, it's like kids who sing the ABC's off tune for a talent show.

My mom has always badgered me to do stupid shit. I could write an entire book about my relationship with her, but not just encourage me to do stuff I mean she gets abusive with me (she's been abusive all my life), insulting me, taking stuff away, hitting, etc. It's completely random when this occurs as most of the time she ignores me. Usually I go along with it when it does occur.

I studied abroad last year and when she got the email she insisted I apply. She was upset that I'm not taking the language course for the country I visited and switched it out for math, and thinks I'm ""too quiet"" and shit like that and need to share my story more (I've given two presentations on it).  Against my wishes she signed me up and sent photos from my blog to be shared with the entire school, and today she started yelling at me as I'm continuing to refuse to attend the assembly. She said she'll visit the assembly herself as she often volunteers at the library there on fridays.

I'm set to go on tomorrow morning and might be able to remove myself from the presentation if I email the teacher who does it. We have yet to come to an agreement on it but I deseperately don't want to go, I'm not sure what to do now.",08Mar2019,3

134,"Hi All. I have a very serious situation, at least in my opinion, going on. I’m currently a Junior in high school. Today, I was in class, and this one guy got an image of me in class with out me knowing, but the image looked like I was kind of doing a Nazi salute. I didn’t do this on purpose because I had no idea he was taking a photo, I was moving my arm, and he got the photo while my arm was moving. Then, he sent this photo to some people and wrote some nasty comments. For example, same Nazi comments. I was very insulted because I am ethnically Russian, and I have family living in Russia. My great grandparents and grandparents fought for the Soviet army against the Nazis. In addition, some of my family was surrounded by Nazis in a Russian city. The Nazis tried to starve everyone in the city. Therefore, my family is very much against Nazi Germany. Thus, I was very insulted. This guy sent the photo to a Snapchat group chat and I took a screenshot of the message of the photo in the chat being sent from him. I want to go to administration and report this because this photo can ruin my reputation and it is very insulting. However, this guy can get kicked out of some honor societies, but I was always nice to this guy and respected him, but I don’t respect him anymore. However, he treated me bad several times before. I am really mad at this guy, and depressed because others didn’t really do anything and just were bystanders. I want to have revenge and tell administration. Any one have any opinions on whether I should tell administration about this? I don’t know what kind of consequences this guy can have.",08Mar2019,0
135,"I am now looking for new employment. I have an amazing resume, but unfortunately it is all politically based. I have roughly 5 years of experience at high levels with impressive achievements both quantitatively and qualitatively speaking. I also went to a top university and present myself well. For full disclosure, I was last employed in May (I resigned amicably and have references etc), and then traveled around Europe for 6 months. I think\*\* this is easy to explain.

The problem I am having is that a political resume appears to not line up with any other industry or line of work. Obviously, I have researching, strategic thinking, sales, marketing/media skills, and top notch writing abilities, I also posses some management experience. The problem is, I don't have any work product that directly applies to any other job. For instance, getting someone elected or procuring billions of dollars from helping to write and getting legislation passed and signed into law does not directly transfer to sales or marketing, yet it relies almost exclusively on those skill-sets. Unfortunately, I recently found this out at an interview for a great business development position.

Therefore, I am looking for help in how to switch careers.

Obviously, I have googled ""how to get a job outside of politics"" and numerous variations thereof, and generally researched this topic. It seems that everyone is trying to get into politics instead of leave the industry. This makes sense because every job I have held has had hundreds of applicants for the position, but its still extremely frustrating.

I have also been applying to sales and marketing jobs, but have heard that my skills don't really directly apply to these roles. I have been told I have a great attitude along with unique resume, but other applicants posses direct experience which is more attractive to these companies. I recently asked one HR person I interviewed with for advice, and they were more than willing to help me out a little bit.

I am guessing that people who have had similar difficulties switching careers may have some advice? Or HR people, or headhunters/recruiters. At this point, I don't care where the advice comes from, I just want some direction. Simply put, any help and advice would be greatly appreciated as I have no idea where I should start.

EDIT: The weirdest part about all of this is that I have applied for jobs like dog walking, working in restaurants and even as an executive assistant because I don't want to sit at home, and have not had any luck over the last month. This is getting frustrating.",08Mar2019,0

my freshman year and told me not to talk to him well this guy came in everyday and asked her for a cup of water and then they started talking... so she started to get tired of the arguing and fighting over her talking to this guy and not going out because we was saving up money... so we got enough money for the truck and a week later the guy asked for her Snapchat and I told her that it wasn’t a good idea and that he’s trying to hit on her well she said that he just wanted to hang out all of us and I said yeah right I told her to delete him and she didn’t listen and that caused more arguing then him and her started to talk on Snapchat then he asked for her number so she gave it to him and then they started texting on there she told me 3 days after the Snapchat insistent that he bet her that he was gonna kiss her and that he was gonna do it the next day they worked and I was like I told you so and the day before she had to work with him I got on her phone and seen that that’s not the only thing on there I seen that he said ily and she said no if your gonna say it say the whole thing so he said I love you and she said it back and then he said that he wants to kiss her and she bet him and they then had a betting war and then he said that he was going to... so I woke her up in the middle of the night at 3AM and was crying and pissed and everything and she told me to calm down because she didn’t really want to kiss him so I went to work with her that next day so he wouldn’t kiss her... so she said he had to go to the freezer in the back and didn’t have a pen and had to go back there with him where there wasn’t any cameras and then he kissed her and then she came and told me but didn’t want me to do anything because she didn’t kiss him back and I asked why and she said

152,"I am a 20 y/old college student who’s currently attending a community college in California. I major in Psychology, but may to switch to pre-med. I have moved out from my parent’s house and live with my girlfriend. I have been paying for my own tuition since I began college and have been mostly self sufficient so far. 

My sister has been accepted into a nursing program in North Carolina so my parents have given me the choice to go to North Carolina with her. They want me to attend the college there since tuition is cheaper, but I would have to stay there a year to become a resident. In that time I would need to find a job to pay for an apartment with her. I would also take online college courses, get a driver’s license, and settle down in a new state. We have lots of relatives over there in case anything goes awry. 

After I become a resident I would attend the community college there to finish some science courses. Then I’d most likely attend the University for a bachelors degree and then apply for medical school. My parents want me to pay for medical school, so I’d need to take out loans. To pay for loans, they want me to join the Air Force as an officer so I could have my loans paid off and also have experience. My parents will pay for my initial online courses and will partially supplement for University, but for medical school, I’m on my own. 

It all sounds like a good plan, but this is such a huge life decision that I’m lost on what to do. 

I’m really not sure if I want to be a doctor like they want me to be. I don’t know if I’d do well in the military, and I don’t know if I’ll even be happy in North Carolina. I’ll be leaving all my friends, my girlfriend, and life as I know it for opportunities there that I may or may not have here. I’ll also be getting my first apartment, and basically restarting life. I’m lost on what I want to major in, what I want to do with my life, and what path this will lead me down. It will be a HUGE 8-10 year commitment for an anxious 20 year old. Any advice? ",08Mar2019,2
153,"Hello People of Reddit 😍

Here's my delimma. 

I am in nursing school and working full time. My current job is a coordinator and leaves me stressed and interrupts quality time with my daughter, glued to my phone and computer 24/7 and working from home. But, they pay me well and are very flexible. 

I have another opportunity in a hospital working full time. This would give me more quality time with my daughter, lower stress, and help me secure a job when I graduate. But, I would be taking about a $200 pay cut per month. 

Which do I choose? Stay at my current job making good money and flexible? Or go to the new job with less stress, more time with by daughter, but lower pay?

154,"I know I have anxiety. However, the severity of it, I don’t know. I often try to play it off like it’s “no big deal”, and that “I can get over it”, etc, but, I often find myself assuming the worst will happen in any situation. 
Plane flight? We’re going to crash and die.
Car ride? We’re going to crash and die.
Girlfriend? She’s cheating, or will, even though there’s ZERO signs she ever would. 
Dog? Has some sort of terminal disease, or will get it. 
It goes on, you get the idea. Now, it’s not always like this, or this bad. It comes in waves. I have been prescribed Xanax before, but, I never filled the prescription because A) I thought I was too good for it/too proud &amp; B) I like to drink every now and then after work, and feel like I can’t if I’m on a regular dose of Xanax. My diet hasn’t been as good as it normally is lately due to traveling and being lazy, along with I haven’t been working out as much. I feel like those last 2, maybe 3 including my alcohol consumption, have a lot to do with how I perceive a lot of things happening to and around me. I also drink caffeine quite often, and love coffee/tea. However, I feel like that’s a potential trigger too. 

Does anybody have advice/thoughts on how I can truly combat this? It’s ruining a lot of, what should be, enjoyable moments in my life as I’m constantly overthinking them entirely.

Well, now we have children. She decided not to vaccinate her children and is very passionate about her decision. 
My personality is less confrontational so I tend to change the subject and brush it off because I’m not interested in a debate. My views on vaccination could not be more opposite than hers. 
Now, I am expecting my second child and her children have chickenpox. She herself has shingles. Ok fine because myself and my family are vaccinated. However, my newborn won’t be.

I have a good job that I enjoy a lot, I work evenings (3-11pm) and weekends which is perfect for me as a night owl. The only downside is I have a minimum of 4 hours of quiet downtime where nothing is going on and on weekends it's basically quiet all day. 
I am able to be on my phone for the whole shift as long as I am alert and ready when things get hairy.

I have watched every movie and show, countless hours of YouTube, thousands of word search puzzles, .

158,"Ok so it all started in middle school when I had a crush on this adorable boy. I knew he would never like me back. Fast forward a couple years and he decided to become friends with me. I had been warned by a couple people that he wasn’t the best person but I ignored them because he was lonely and desperate for friends. 

Sometimes when I was walking in the hallway to go to class or something, he would randomly run up to me and give me a hug. It was weird and uncomfortable, but he told me it was fine because he was gay. I believed it because he acted like the gayest person I’ve ever met.

In freshman year we became close, and at homecoming, he wanted to be my date, but I was very hesitant because he told everyone he was gay, but then he told me he was bi. I thought it was weird but I accepted it because I was desperate for a boyfriend at the time. So we started dating that night.

I remember while we danced, he gave me a hickey , which I thought was way over the top, but I accepted it because that was how relationships worked in my mind. We dated for two weeks and then the day before my birthday, he told me he was gay again and dumped me. About a week later he got a new boyfriend. I was furious.

I told my friends about it and that’s when they told me what he really did. He even did this to literally all my friends before to try to get with them. His tactic was to tell a girl he was “gay” to get closer to them, and if he succeeds, they would start a relationship and then he’d break up with them.

I was so mad at myself for being so clueless this whole time, he was obviously doing all this because he’s an attention whore. He even tried killing himself after we broke up and even though I knew he was doing it for attention, I helped him stop. 

Now he’s dating a senior (18 yo) which is pretty much illegal. He raped her from what I’ve heard and he’s done things like this to some of my friends. He slapped my friends ass, then tried to rape another friend, and he’s probably done more things I don’t know about.

After hearing about this, I stopped caring about him entirely because he’s obviously not a good person at all, and I’m still mad at myself for being dumb enough to date him. He’s still hitting on girls even though he has a girlfriend as well, and I’m worried that he’s a danger to people in my school.

I’m worried about my friend’s safety and even though my school usually lets sexual predators roam around, they know about him and do nothing about him. I’m really thinking about telling someone about him because I’m scared for my friends and other girls who have been victims to him. Should I tell an adult? I’m really scared, please help!",08Mar2019,0
159,"In the span of 6 months last year, I was in 2 car accidents. I was T-boned in one (totaled car) pulling into the street. I felt a little cautious after that accident, but it didn’t affect how I drove. 

During the other, I was sitting at a red light in traffic when I was rear-ended at top speed. It pushed my car so much he was able to make room to leave. Hit and run! This one stuck with me a LOT more. I didn’t begin driving again until a month later, and though I was cautious in the car, I seemed to be okay. However, when the investigation closed and they couldn’t find the driver, something changed. I couldn’t stop looking in the rear view mirror at red lights — I’d leave extra room between me and the car in front of me so if someone got too close (read: everyone was getting too close) I would pull forward. I stopped taking the freeway because I was scared to drive at high speeds (I know the freeway is safer than the surface streets). 

I thought maybe it was just because I was in a hybrid, so I switched cars with my dad, who drives a tank. I still felt scared on the freeway — even more so because his car takes SO much to stop — and scared at red lights. I had to give his car back and get back in my hybrid, and I felt a little skittish all over again. 

Any advice for getting comfortable again? At this point, it’s been 6 months since my last accident. I guess I’m my head I scared that I’m due for another, but I drove for 10 years before getting into an accident so I just don’t understand why I’m suddenly feeling this way. 

I really appreciate any advice or guidance. Thank you for your time and have a wonderful evening. ",08Mar2019,0
160,"For some background info: My mom has always been abusive towards us throughout our childhoods. I moved out at 18 as soon as I could, regrettably leaving my two younger siblings there with her. (Currently) 15 year old brother, and 9 year old sister. My mom is a lot nicer towards my sister but is just abusive towards my brother. She always reminds him how much of a disappointment he is and constantly belittles him, as well as physically hurts him. It is just my mom and the two kids in the house, our dad is incarcerated and out of contact.

161,"I'm a junior at a large state university in the US, majoring in International Studies and Spanish. When I graduate the goal is to work for a nonprofit serving immigrant and refugee communities or for the UN or something along those lines. I recently started volunteering with a nonprofit in my college town that does exactly what I want to do when I graduate. Today I was offered a summer internship through them. I was ecstatic until I found out that it was unpaid.

My home town has one of the top food and beverage industries in the country while my college town has very limited prospects for lucrative jobs for young students. Considering this and the fact that I support myself fully financially I go home and live with my parents every summer to work. I work two jobs 70hrs a week over the summer and basically stockpile my finances to get me through the school year. I've held multiple jobs in my college town and I quit all of them because the money is absolute shit. ($1,800 at home every 2 weeks versus $400 in my college town) It's easier to just kill myself over the summer and not work during the school year aside from random weekends I pick up at home and holidays.

So, obviously a summer internship presents a huge financial issue for me. Since the internship is in my college town I would be required to live here. Therefore, I would be unable to work the hours I need at home to save my rent and expenses for the year. On the other hand, it would be incredibly stupid to not take advantage of an internship at the company I want to work for in the future.

My current options are:

A- turn down the internship and continue volunteering throughout the school year to keep my foot in the door. go home and work and secure my financial stability

B- take the internship and take out additional student loans to help pay my rent while getting a low paying job in my college town

C- take the internship and drive the two hours to my home town every weekend to try to squirrel as much money as possible, while still potentially having to take out loans

D- ??? i'm open to suggestions

I want to do B/C because its the best option for my future career; however it feels irresponsible to take out excess loans (I already have $17,000 in loans) when the future salary in my career field maxes out at $50k. Would that too financially irresponsible? Additionally, does anyone have experience in nonprofits? Is an internship even necessary to get a job in that field?

It was okay for like ten months but then I think around a month ago my dog ripped the chair. (My mom already didn’t like the dog) This made her even more mad at the dog. Ever since my family has been going downhill. My mom is always sad/mad now so my dad is started to consider to take the dog away. After my dog started to get even more misbehaved and now my family is canceling our vacation because my grandparents can’t take care of my dog and we don’t want to spend money on a sitter. All the things we would do in the summer are ruined because my dog chewed the grill so no bbq. Even if we fix it he would keep jumping on us and the table and now there is no vacation.

169,"Hi, first post here, I used to be an active reddit user, but I couldn't remember my user anymore after long hiatus. TL:DR at end! 

So, the business.  I'm 20 years old, I was homeschooled from the get-go, and I want to attend community college, but I don't have access to the information I need to apply.

Homeschool isn't at all like people think, for the most part I did go to schools, just not traditional ones.  I still took standardized tests, attended classes, the works.  My problem starts with the second half of high school.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'd been in homeschool programs my entire life, basically taking enrichment classes while a teacher supervises work I submit to them.  It's all going fine.  Second, third, year of high school, I can't really remember, my mental health takes a major downturn.  I can barely eat, I can't leave my house, therapists are balking at me, it's a pretty darn terrible time.  I'm still turning in work, but the school program I'm working with won't give me credit because it's my mother bringing it in, I can't go to school, I can't really function as a person.  My mother decides this isn't fair(which I agreed with) and withdrew me from the school.  An old colleague of hers helps her set up with the independent homeschooling shindig in my state, and we go from there.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is my mother couldn't handle such a thing.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no records, I have no transcripts.  She was supposed to make them, but she didn't.  We did work which met the state standards, but she didn't take care of things the way she should have.  Legally, I have graduated high school.  Legally I graduated from a private school, which is how private homeschooling works.

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory on my mother quickly:  Very kind, smart, so worn down by life she can't handle anything anymore.  My dad has been terminally ill since before I was born, frequent flyer in the hospital because he's constantly almost(or actually, one time he died right in front of me and was revived) dying, and care-giving for him, with the stress of the hospital and his emotional abuse, has driven her fucking crazy.  My grandmother(her mother) has dementia, she's 96, and I've been taking care of her for the last 3 years.  Part of why I'm kind of delayed as a person.  I finally quit, I left, even though honestly I miss my grandmother, because my sister made my home I shared with her and my grandmother uninhabitable.  Her drunken fights with her SO all the time, her erratic behavior, her room infested with maggots because she doesn't clean and lets food rot, her open hostility towards me.  

&amp;#x200B;

My mother and I are on moderately friendly terms, but I don't really want any member of my family in my life anymore.  I can't handle the emotional abuse that's been going on my entire life.  I ask my mother for transcripts, for a diploma, anything, and she says she will give it to me, but doesn't, and if I push it she has a breakdown about how stressful her life is and don't I care about her well being?

&amp;#x200B;

Luckily, I have an amazing girlfriend who I moved in with, who is letting me stay in her pad while I get my shit together, but I refuse to lean on her kindness for this long.  I'm applying for every job I can, and I want to go to school part time so I can make more money, but I can't, without this basic information.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry, that was incredibly long and rambling.

  
TL;DR  
Previously homeschooled, I've been caring for my elderly grandmother for 3 years, I've finally struck out on my own and I'm completely lost.  I want to sign up for community college, but I have no way to access my records, because they barely exist.  I have no transcripts, no physical diploma, the application asked for my GPA and god knows what that is.  I honestly don't know if I could pass anything if there was any way to test out.  My memory is so fuzzy from those years in highschool with my mental health I don't really feel like I retained almost any highschool math.  Can't get into community college to take remedial math.  I don't know what to do here.    I feel completely lost as a person.  I just wish I'd been raised by parents who had it together.  I have no idea how to do my taxes when I do get a job.  

  
I'm lost.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading.  I'm aware that I'm on the internet, but please be kind as I am a sensitive bitch.

170,"Alright, I’m typing this pretty late after a long day of thinking/depression and I feel like I just have to get someone else’s advice that isn’t coming from a friend. Here’s the story. 

For context reasons, everyone I’m talking about is a Senior in HS.

Me and my GF have been dating for almost 2 years now, where we’ve practically spent all our High School lives together. We have never actually gotten into any huge jealousy problems, so when she started talking to this one guy at school, I didn’t think much of it. They start talking and low and behold, they start to have way too much in common; practically becoming best friends. As I said before, I had trust in her that she wouldn’t do anything, but boy was I wrong. Everyone in school starts to realize my GF and this guy are getting way too close, me being the one that’s being played here, but I decide to ignore it. This, however, turns for the worst, when she one day decides to come out to me and say she has feelings for him, and so does him. The strange part, however, was she still wanted to be with me and try to get everything right again. I decide to forgive her on the rule of her not talking to him again, but as expected, she doesn’t listen and literally talks to him again the next day. I decide to break up with her on the weekend after I “do some final dirty work”, and tried to move on. Although it was only a couple of days, I felt relieved, when the Monday we come back to school, she’s practically begging me to come back to her. She realized she messed up, we talk it out, and again, I try to give it one last shot. I decide to interview her on how the whole situation got so out of hand, when I realized she’s been having a crush on this guy and trying to get rid of me a month before the whole thing went down. She also promised me multiple times she never did anything remotely sexual with him.

This is the kicker; I still decide to give her another shot because of my still strong feelings for her, but I learn some outside information on the things she conveniently decided to opt out. My (reliable) sources are telling me she’s been practically sexting this guy and even gave him a handjob at one point; all while still being with me in the first place. More and more people are starting to realize I’m the guy being played here, and to me, one of the most important things I need to have is a good reputation.

179,"so, three days ago me and my mother went to visit the local humane society, and unexpectedly ended up getting a cat. i was nervous of course, since we already own one other cat, but my mother assured me it would be fine. however, evr since we've brought her home, shes been quite hostile towards our other cat. i told my family that they need to be socialized properly, but everyone seems to think they'll just ""work it out"" on there own, which honestly sounds like they dont want to put in the effort. the new cat has attacked the other from behind a few times, almost as if trying to provoke him to fight. its caused him to become terrified of her, and hes started freezing up and making himself as small as possible whenever they have a stand-off, and is constantly peering around corners as if shes going to jump out at him at any second. I know its only been a few days, but Im really worried about what might happen if we dont do something. no one seems to take my opinion on the situation seriously.",08Mar2019,0
180,"I'm on a business trip with a couple of my partners, who are of opposite sex. They traveled together to get here and I arrived late last night and didn't see either of them. In the morning I talked to the guy and he told me how their trip was.

Later in the day I was standing behind him and he was texting and I glanced at his screen and was texting her ""the story for snoglaties is that..."" and how he had told me their trip went. I didn't see the rest - I didn't want to be gawking even though I sure felt like it!

I didn't say anything; played it cool and nobody mentioned it again, but now I am really wondering what they are up to. I'm not really feeling paranoid, like they are conspiring to oust me or something, but at the same time knowing they are conspiring to lie about something to me is unsettling no matter what it is. 

Now, it happens that I'm the email admin. I could easily poke around in their emails, but to me that feels like compounding the sneaking around and sowing the seeds for trouble. I could just ask what is up, but then I would have to say I read his phone over his shoulder, which is sort of the same thing as going into his email. 

Have you ever been in a situation like this? What did you do? What should I do? How can I figure out what to do?",08Mar2019,2
181,"For background, I was 14/F at the time of this event and the person who sexually harassed me was 15/M and we’ll call him C. Back then, I had a very perverted sense of humor and I wasn’t explicitly clear on whether or not I was a very sexual person. This is going to be important later.

So I started becoming friends with C around early spring/late winter of my 9th grade (his 10th grade). I noticed he was quite clingy towards me and would try to interact with me more often than most people would. This, I believed, was a good thing but I soon learned that it really wasn’t. So as a result, C and I became close friends. He put a lot of his trust in me, talking about things that he wouldn’t tell anyone else. I don’t know if he was lying, I kind of doubt it, but that’s irrelevant. I start to notice his behavior quickly became more perverted. He started calling me “small child” and he touched me a lot more often, especially on my butt and my breasts. I was very much a doormat at the time so I went along with it. I was uncomfortable, but I was too much of a coward to say anything.

Now here’s where C really fucked up. I don’t remember what brought this up, but he asked to hug me. I said no and for some reason, I didn’t want to do it in front of everyone. (It was after school and not many people were here so I don’t know why I said that or if that’s what I really said). So he took me up by the stadium because the entrance is darker and he said that many people make out there. This is where I had the first red flag about what was about to happen but I went along with it because I was a coward. Once we were up there, I was up against the wall. He hugged me and grabbed my butt. I had a hoodie tied around my waist, which he asked me to take off and this was one of the first times I had declined. I was extremely uncomfortable in this situation but I still went along with it. I never said I approved of this. After that, I went home and took a long shower while asking myself what the fuck happened. I kept my distance from him for about a week before we reunited, which was obviously a big mistake. C still continued his shitty behavior and touched me constantly. C said that he did this because he “wanted to see if I would like it.” Even after I told him that I was gay, he still did this to me.

In 10th grade (his 11th grade), I remember he asked me if I thought he was a creep because our other friends called him such. I hadn’t learned anything so I just said “no” even though I couldn’t think the opposite more. A couple months in, I finally stopped being friends with C and broke off all contact and I never told any of my friends about the extent of his behavior until around 4 months ago. I’ve never told any adults about this.

What concerns me is how my family would react to this situation. I had just come out of a toxic friendship with a girl who constantly talked me down and made false accusations of me bullying her. My mother, while she was furious with her behavior just as much, if not more than I was, still told me that I wasn’t very smart for letting this happen. Especially since these events weren’t too far apart from each other, I’m worried that my mom will talk me down for letting something like this happen again and being so passive when I was so uncomfortable.

It pains me to know that C could be doing this shit to someone else and I’m not doing anything about it. But I know my mom will judge me for both letting this happen and waiting so long to say anything.

TL;DR: Former friend of mine (M/15) sexually harassed me multiple times and I fear that I will be judged for being a doormat and waiting as long as I would to say something.",08Mar2019,0
182,"I try not to be someone who is unnecessarily rude and obnoxious. I offer people any help I can when they need it and I try to not step on other people's toes. But after a while, I notice this somehow ""spoils"" people and they get used to taking advantage of me so they end up feeling entitled to my time and effort the moment they needed. Regardless of whether or not I can provide the help they need at the moment. I'm expected to drop everything I'm doing at the drop of a hat to fix everyone else's problems while ignoring my own. And as I've tried to expand my social circle, I notice this happens to everyone without fail. I've even been told that I just seem to bring out the worst in people and that I'm too much of a doormat because my voice is too soft.

The most recent example of this is with a coworker of mine. I've only been at my job for maybe 5 months now, and one particular old lady has a reputation of being ""grandmotherly"" with everyone else. When I first started working there, I was eager to do a good job and be as helpful as I could with the people who were essentially my teammates. Somehow this old lady was the first because my work required me to spend the most time around her, and began making unreasonable demands that I couldn't do like telling me (not asking, telling as she made a point to let me know that) that I should be helping her with her work while mine was rapidly piling up. If I said I couldn't, she would begin to go on a tangent about how horrible I was for treating an old woman that way. And if I did, she would complain that I'm lazy and don't do anything because my own work wouldn't get done. And according to my other coworkers, she had never acted in such a way toward them, only to me.

And now this past week, I'm noticing this pattern in a few of the other people I work with. And one friend I have outside of work who I've been spending more time with, who has developed a habit of taking over me, or sometimes ""talking at"" me, and anything I try to contribute to the conversation get ignored.

In the end, I close myself off from people because of this and I prefer to spend time alone. Because I really don't see the point in seeking out friends or a relationship if it's just going to inevitably end when the person gets too comfortable and starts using me as an emotional punching bag and/or personal servant. When I make a conscious effort to never do that to them, but somehow that also seems to be what's causing it.

Is it really me that's the problem? Like do I just flip a ""switch"" in people that turns them into assholes? Am I somehow being an asshole without realizing it and that's the impression people are recieving from me? How do I establish boundaries if people are just going to basically just shit all over them?",08Mar2019,0
183,"**tl;dr: possibly seeking validation from mom to an unhealthy extent 

I think without even knowing, I (17,F) have been seeking my mom's validation since forever and trying to compete against my sister. It wouldn't be the most unusual for I am aware that it is fairly common.

I might even have mommy issues since every motherly figure I meet, I try to impress and gain affection from: be it my Economics teacher, or any of my aunt. To compare, I do not do the same with masculine figures. 

I was depressed for some time but I worked on it and now, I'm better. Before, my bed used to be bare of sheets and clothes lied everywhere but things are different now. I'm a near neat freak and when my mom cleaned my room today, I had a really bad anger episode.

The thing is, I've told her countless times not to do so but she says it's her way of showing love. I don't like to be fussed about like that (like I'm not capable of handling my own?)

I'm not always nasty tempered although I used to be (I worked on that too), it's for the first time in a while that I really felt as angry and upset as I did today. 

I am aware: 1. Losing control (here, making bed and cleaning) upsets people 2. Perfectionism could be a sly attempt in seeking love but I'm not sure if the latter applies to me. 

I might get into a really reputed college later this year but I don't think my parents would understand the depth of it. Or the digital art that I do, they never appreciate because they don't understand. Or the videos I've shot which are quite decent. 

My mom always exaggerates my academic achievements to something it isn't, or when I improved from a failing grade to an above average in a span of two months, she only asked how the class topper performed. Someone please explain why things are so because I'm losing my mind here

I just don't feel appreciated enough because I'm at my absolute best right now and if this isn't enough, I don't know if I ever will be. 

I'm just trying to pinpoint out the problem so, I can work on it. And if it is what I think it is, then, how do I go on from here?",08Mar2019,0

- Checked all the bathrooms and emptied the trash in all of those, nothing there
- We have fruit but we eat it or discard it on a regular basis, and they are definitely juvenile houseflies, not fruit flies.
- We keep our doors closed at all times to keep the air conditioning in, so they aren't coming in from outdoors.

190,"I’ve been referring to these episodes as my “freak outs” that happen when I’m upset or triggered about something, but they’re getting really bad now and effecting me for longer and I need some direction on how to pull myself out of these things. They’re usually the same every time - I cry a bit, shiver a lot, forget how to talk, and want/need something but not know how to articulate it. I become a vegetable almost. Today it was because of an argument with my SO that if I hadn’t just pulled a 12 hour shift on no food and no sleep I might have been able to handle better. After we both cooled down a bit from what we said, he came over to check on me but I was shivering, phasing in and out at my phone/wall, felt sick like I wanted to throw up, and literally could not speak no matter what he asked me. Eventually he thought that maybe I needed space (I was still crying unpredictably) but I motioned for him to stay because it’s like I had moved on from whatever we fought about, but my body didn’t? I couldn’t form a single word and I felt trapped in my body, out of control, tiny, scared, sick, exhausted, and in desperate need of help I couldn’t verbalize. 

Even typing this post I started shaking and hyperventilating and had to pause. Freak outs like that have been happening for smaller and smaller things, sometimes I’ve just been thinking about something upsetting and just being asked “what’s wrong?” starts the process and I just say I don’t know over and over again until I can’t speak anymore and I’m a shivering ball in some corner. Please, where can I go for help with this? What’s even happening to me? I feel like a full unhinged mental patient and I just want some help.

191,"I (21F) and my boyfriend (21F) moved into our first apartment in the beginning of last year. We had a year long contract and it just finished this month and we have now moved to another complex in a different city. 
Our old apartment complex called us the day  before our move out date to ask if we were going to renew our lease. We said no, and that we were already moving out. The lady said that because we did not give them a written 60 day statement saying we’re moving out, that we now have to pay rent for the next month. now, we did give a 60 day notice, but it was a phone call that was made to corporate office and when we asked the woman on the phone if we needed to sign anything she told us no, and that she would contact our locations leasing office for us. Me being stupid.. I didn’t record this phone call.. 
we told our leasing location this and they replied that they only have record of the phone call being made and that is all. My boyfriend supports us financially, as I am a full time student and he let them know that he was not going to pay because he did everything he needed to do with the phone call. 
We just received a bill for over 2,000 dollars from this apartment complex.. our lease states that a reletting fee of $600 would apply if we did not give a proper notice but they raised this to about $1500... and they added all sorts of cleaning fees and damage fees for things I did clean and things that were messed up when we moved in. Yes... I know.. I should’ve recorded everything in the beginning and taken pictures but this was our first time.. ofcourse now with our new apartment, we took the proper precautions but that doesn’t help much in this situation.. 
family members have told us not to pay it and to let the apt complex take us to court. honestly, I’m a really good person so going to court over this terrifies me. I also had a friend say that not paying lowers my credit or puts a mark but I haven’t started my credit yet, and don’t really understand how that works.. my boyfriend has decided to listen to our family members by not paying, but I want to know what the consequences might be? can I go to jail for this? What can I do.. I don’t have the money to pay, but this is eating away at me in the night.. 
please, any advice would help. I’m completely lost

I don’t have the money, so I’m not going to pay.. but what can this lead to? Help pls ",08Mar2019,1

In 10th grade I asked her if she wanted to go on a date one weekend and she said she was busy that weekend, so I decided to hang onto that thought. Two weeks later I asked her out again and she said the same thing. I asked her when she'd be free and she said to me ""I don't think I'm gonna be free for a long time"".

I have been having issues mainly with my mom we do not seem to get along because my mom wants to control every little aspect of my life still. I get that I still live under their roof but I should still be able to have some sort of freedom especially since I am 21. For example when I want to go out and hang out with friends she has to know who I am with, where I am going, and I have to be home by 11 or 12 at night if I'm lucky. If it were up to my mom she would not allow me to go out because she says I shouldn't even be going out because her house isn't a hotel and I do not get to go and leave whenever I want. She has even threatned to lock me out of the house or kick me out if I stay out longer then my curfew. The issue with us mainly is when I want to go out my mom does not like when I want to go out and hang out with friends. She says she does not trust me and was my age once and knows what young people want to do. I tell her that I should be able to go out whenever I want because I feel 21 is old enough to go out and explore and live my life, but my mom says if I want to make my own rules up then I should live on my own because as long as I live with her I will not be able to go out whenever I want for as long as I want. Another exmaple is today I decided to go out and see a friend who is leaving for a couple of months so I wanted to go say bye. My mom told me she wanted me home by 9 p.m. and I told her I would be back by 10 p.m. . While I was out she kept calling and texting me to tell me that I do not get to call the shots in this house and I will come back home when she says or she's going to lock me out of the house. She says she does not like the idea of me entering the house of my friends especially male freinds because she thinks we are up to no good. But I feel if I tell her I'm going to be back home by 10 and that I'm going to a freinds house there is no issue there. Anyway how would you guys solve this problem?

209,"TL;DR: My wife who is an influencer on Instagram who is being bullied from multiple fake accounts where they mention very specific details of where we have been and what we were doing and my wife is terrified. 

&amp;#x200B;

Context:  My wife is an influencer on Instagram.  She posts a lot of style photos working with different brands to create campaigns for promotion.  Her following is relatively small (50k).   The community she is in for the most part is a positive one but there definitely is a history of drama that my wife sometimes gets caught up in (not by choice).

&amp;#x200B;

Since she has been running her Instagram, things for the vast majority have been great.  Every now and then she would get a creepy comment but starting two months ago, things took a turn for the worst.

She started receiving comments from newly created accounts  with 0 followers and 0 posts (assumed fake accounts) that started saying  mean things.  Talking about how old she looked, didn't have style, etc.  Not nice, but for the internet, pretty tame.  She would block the account and then sure enough 1-2 days later a new account would start leaving comments.  She reached to two other people in her fashion instagram circle (other influencers in her community)  and found that they too were getting comments saying similar comments by the same accounts.

&amp;#x200B;

I started becoming worried though once they left a very specific comment.  They commented that they saw me and my wife at a specific place and describing things we were doing that day, continuing to say mean things and accuse her of saying thing about other people, etc.  She started adding 'keywords' that could auto-block comments, but a ton of them still get through.

&amp;#x200B;

We just received another comment where another fake/new account detailing seeing us again at a specific place describing what we were doing again and I'm starting to really worry about our safety.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife is very scared and it is also very mentally taxing on her.  She battles already with severe anxiety and I just don't know what i can do to comfort her.

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions on what we can do?  Making her Instagram isn't really an option since what she does requires her to be a public account.  My wife really wants to go the cops but I don't think it has crossed the line far enough for their to warrant any type of investigation (but i have no idea honestly).",08Mar2019,1

211,"So this all started as a favor for my neighbor. Her granddaughter (16) needed someone to go to this JROTC ball with and my neighbor threw suggested she go with me (20), which she was fine with. I had never met this girl until last weekend were we hung out at my neighbors place. She’s incredibly nice and we got along pretty well (I think, I’m never really a good judge on these kinds of things) and we ended up getting coffee a few days later. 

I’m going simply as a friend, but I honestly don’t know what my obligations are. I didn’t go to prom when I was in high school which this seems comparable to. I’m already a nervous person by nature, so any advice would go a long way. Do I go pick her up? Do I tell her she looks pretty? I don’t want to be weird and overstep anything, but I also don’t want to screw up her night. This is supposed to be a pretty big event for JROTC people I hear.

212,"Context here: I'm an assistant manager at a high grossing bar and grill and absolutely love my job.  However, I have had heard many stories on how my boss (the general manager) has sent explicit photos and proposition many of the servers whom are 25 and younger and they feel super uncomfortable.  Personally I'm disgusted because I believe he is using his authority for his personal needs.  I pulled one of the girls aside and asked if the accusation were true, and she assured me that he not only sent her inappropriate photos but also asked her for some in return.  She is only 19 and the said manager is 38.  I'm so disgusted and beside myself atm.  I talked to the other assistant manager and she confirmed this has been going on for years and the owner is aware.

And I have another younger brother which is 9 years old. He sometimes fight me back like Im not his brother.

The way they talk to me is very heartbroken. The main problem is my sister. When I tell her or scold her of what she did wrong, she acts like I never exist. Her face, her expression. That makes me f*cking mad. She make me feel like a nobody. Literally nobody.

Gladly there's my mother who'll scold me and makes me feel guilty that my mother is mad. I immediately go and apologize to my mother but not my sister.

I always remember everything she did and said to me until now. I always hated my sister and have wish to hate my sister even more. She always makes me annoy like, sing loudly, do the girly things, shouts at me.

216,"hello!! i am currently a sophomore church music major at a small private christian school. when i was looking for colleges, i decided i wanted to go to a smaller christian school, because i attended a huuuuuge public high school and was tired of basically being a number. my freshman year was really hard for many reasons, but i decided to look at other schools that offer church music just in case i really felt like i should transfer somewhere. the music department here is soooo small and it’s not as good as i was led to believe it is and most kids are music ed majors, so i just felt so out of place. i felt like also maybe i could do well somewhere a little more prestigious or larger or whatever. however, doors didn’t really open for me last year. i decided i should stay here and that this church music program really is good and i love my advisor and this was a good major for me. here i am now though, and i have had a miserable time this year. turns out, church music is a lot more music ed and worship leadership classes than i’m interested in. i wanted to study church music bc i wanted to learn about christian studies and music. the program is built to cater more towards those who want to be worship leaders. i know now that that’s not really what i want to do, at least at the moment. i’ve always been a little more interested in music business related things (i  love to sing, write music, record, play with other musicians, gig, etc.), and now i’m wondering if i should seriously consider transferring to a school with a good music business program. i’m so scared of actually considering that though. i would have to go into my junior year somewhere and start completely fresh. i don’t know if i actually would be happier in music business. i could fall behind and graduate later (i hate school lol so i want out as fast as possible lol). what if i regret such a big life change? but if i stay, idk if i can fight out 2 more years studying something that i’m miserable in. i have to take upper level conducting courses and teaching courses that are supposedly really hard and cause me so much anxiety. i just have no idea what to do. i’m praying about it and thinking about it but i just wanted to get some unbiased advice.

217,"So I was seeing someone a few months ago and we had an amazing time together but I started noticing that there were a things that didn't feel right to me. 

1. He never complimented me. Not even a 'you look nice' today. 
2. We usually talked about him and his friends and his 'girl'friends
3. He wouldn't go down on me because he'd gone down on some German chick once and it was the best he ever had so he didn't want to ruin that
4. While we were having sex, he told me I was too sweaty. So I got out of bed and took another shower (I had had one just before he arrived) 
5. He never held my hand 

FYI, I told him all of my concerns and he didn't seem to want to change. For these reasons, I thought it best to stop seeing him. This was back in December of 2018. 

Cut to 3 days ago, he calls me and says that he wants to meet me. Because he wants to go for a walk. 

I ask my roommate for advice and she tells me that it's okay to go see what he wants but to not bring him up. 

I meet him and he starts saying things like I've missed our conversations. You make so much sense. You're the only one who gets me. And I don't know what exactly I said coz I was tripping balls. But, I know I didn't steer the conversation elsewhere. 

After 15 minutes or so, he says what's been up with you and I laugh. 

Me: ""You don't really care. Why bother?""

Him: ""No, we always talk about me. Let's talk about you.""

Me: ""If you cared, you would have asked me questions. I am not interested in sharing anything since I know you genuinely don't care.""

220,"I'm currently 25 weeks pregnant. I work part time at a clothing store and make barely any money (about $260-$400 every two weeks). I've just asked for an increase in hours and I've been trying to work as much as my manager will allow me. That being said, my husband (who works in the oilfield and makes $35 an hour) kind of led me to believe that I wouldn't need to get a higher paying job or change anything, &amp; that I could be a stay at home mom if I chose to be. Things have been hard at his work with some new things being introduced which have the possibility of significantly lowering the amount of hours he gets per day at work. I understand that that is inconvenient to say the least, which is why I've tried to accommodate more and make more money. But he makes comments about how I could've had a full time job, or that I could've gotten a job elsewhere and made more money, etc. The problem with that is that by the time things changed at his work and caused instability in the workplace for him, I was already probably 10 weeks pregnant. There was nothing I could do at that point because nobody will hire a pregnant girl. They can't discriminate, but they do anyway. He has his name on a mortgage with his ex, who lives in the province over, and that alone increases his debt ratio significantly, so he can't consolidate his debts or even take out another loan. He also pays a whopping $880 a month for his truck (which was purchased before I was ever in the picture), &amp; he says that that is ""normal"" or ""okay"" and that he's not the only one paying that much. To me, for that much you might as well have bought a Lamborghini. He also pays $800 in child support per month for two kids which aren't mine, obviously, and who were there before I ever was. I am due with our first baby together in June and he refuses to rent an apartment because he doesn't want neighbors and because he thinks he can't afford it. I suggested (and pleaded) to get just a one bedroom and make do until things were more stable, &amp; he refuses because we will have no ""alone time"" as baby will share the room with us. He has his heart set on moving to a small town 40 minutes away and BUYING a house because the payments for said house will only be around $650. To me, buying is risky and there are always unforseen circumstances that you must be aware of. Renting is the more responsible decision, even if it costs a bit more. I also don't drive, my family will not drive to me, &amp; I know nobody in said town and he will be away for three weeks out of the month. I will be completely isolated with a brand new baby, figuring out how to be a mom for the first time, and I don't make friends. I understand that it's hard for him to pull the weight and not me, but is this really my fault? Am I in the wrong? What am I supposed to do? Am I crazy for saying that renting would be more responsible? Just for background info, I'm 24, he's 30, we currently live in my mom's basement, &amp; he was aware of my low income before marrying me or even dating me, &amp; said it was okay. ",08Mar2019,2

This has happened to me several times and I'm beginning to think that it's 50/50: Either the girl is overreacting or I'm doing something wrong? I'll give you an example:

At college parties, (I'm currently a junior), there are times when random girls would accuse me of being weird/creepy when I did nothing wrong at all. I understand that drunkeness affects people in different ways, but it's quite interesting when one girl is hugging everyone at the party, while another girl may be paranoid about everything.

Now, I don't mean to brag, but my drunk memory is actually pretty good. I don't drink until I get sick or blackout, I only drink until I get that ""feeling"", but nothing more or less.

On an extra note, even though I'm 21, I don't go to the bar that often because I want to save money. So, vodka &amp; juice is my go to at parties...

235,"Hello Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

I misplaced a rather personal item (a stretching device, to be exact) in the house where I live with my parents and siblings (I'm early 20's). I vaguely remember stashing/hiding it somewhere while a bit faded last night, perhaps in a pile or stack of clothes, and now I'm unable to find it.

&amp;#x200B;

I discreetly searched for it before work today, and again more thoroughly upon arriving home ( I work late, everyone is asleep) but no dice. I've looked through laundry, clean and dirty, all of my drawers, jacket pockets, shelves, cases, underneath some furniture in the sitting room where I was hanging out alone, and still no luck.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think someone found it and disposed of it, or could it be somewhere I've neglected to check? If someone found it and tossed it without saying anything I'd just accept the minor embarrassment (I've checked the trash; not there).

&amp;#x200B;

What's bothering me is, if it is around somewhere I've missed checking and it turns up later while I'm not alone it will be so much worse. I realize this is quite funny but it's also a bit worrying for me.",08Mar2019,2
236,"So basically I work at a food and catering business. When I first started, we had a worker that did everything for my boss. Everything was very organized in the store and it was a great environment and everyone had fun. A few months ago the manager left and my boss is having to do all the jobs the manager did. But... she's really unorganized and not great at what she does... Because of this, everyone at work is stressing and it's always a stressful environment and just a stressful atmosphere. 

I'm very high up in the business and my boss trusts me a lot and even offered me a higher up position but don't want to pursue the job as I have uni and can't put in any more hours or dedication to the business. My boss also comes late to all her shifts but none of the workers can really argue with her because she's the boss. This is one of the things that ticks the other workers off. I've learnt to deal with it and get ahead but other workers are definitely annoyed.

Rather than completely blaming the boss, I think us as workers can perhaps do things to help improve the environment. I have really strong work ethic so I come in all the time and try to deal with everything and have been covering all the shifts that need to be covered but I am only one person.  

Everyone has no motivation anymore but I believe we can turn it around. The stressful atmosphere is still there and the environment is always nasty and all the workers always seem to be in a terrible mood. There's not that fun zest to shifts anymore. I've been trying to think of ways I can try and relieve this stressful atmosphere and make people actually enjoying coming to work again. 

Does anyone have any advice on what I can do? I've convinced my boss to hire more workers which will be a little less stress on us all but do you guys think I should talk to her about other things like coming in late to all her shifts. She's a good person but she's the boss and I think she needs to come on time to her shifts but again, I've learnt to deal with it as the morning person as I'm a really fast worker. Others may not be as quick as me so they get really behind. What's something we as workers can do? Or even just me myself can do to help everyone stay motivated and hold their head up high? 

Thanks, appreciate it :)

239,"I'm 28 years old and by every metric that I set for myself  I'm a loser. I'm a virgin that's never even kissed a girl or been in a relationship. I have social anxiety. I don't have any friends. I live with my parents. I did manage to get an Associates degree in IT a couple of years ago but I've since forgotten most of what I learned-not that I ever learned that much to begin with. I pretty much only passed my courses because I showed up to every class and did all the coursework. I've spent most of my adult working life working in fast food and retail. In late November I quit my retail job and I've been unemployed using my savings for personal expenses ever since. I was also about to transfer into a 4 year college for my Bachelors but I withdrew because I was broke and don't know what the point even is anymore.

Now that I think about it, I haven't even earned the right to call myself a loser. You have to try and fail to be a loser. I've never even tried.

One result of all the decisions that I've made is that I've developed a deep self hatred that makes it hard to have self confidence in anything I do. I don't really enjoy anything anymore. Whenever I start feeling good about myself that voice in the back of my head will speak up reminding me that I'm a piece of shit. Even though I didn't have any problems being a good employee when I worked in retail and fast food when I try to apply now all the voices come back and I just get depressed about being so useless. My only experience working in IT was a help desk internship where I would get so nervous when people called that I would mess up writing tickets and the person in charge would treat me like an idiot. One time I even heard him call me an asshole under his breath. I will also admit to not knowing as much as I should about IT. This experience made my anxiety worse and made me want to stay in retail where I was comfortable instead of looking for entry level IT positions after getting my diploma.

I've applied to different jobs and had a few interviews but they've chose other people. Can't say I blame them. I had an interview  for an entry-level help desk position today and am waiting to hear back from them. I hate to admit it, but I hope I don't get the job so my suspicions that I wasted 2 years of my life getting a degree in a field I'm too stupid for won't be confirmed.

Thing is, another side of me realizes that I can't possibly be as stupid and as big of a piece of shit as I think I am. In my previous jobs I made it to supervisor positions and was generally well liked by my coworkers and bosses. I graduated with As and Bs on all my college classes. I went through high school only doing the bare minimum and still graduated with a 3.5 GPA. I really regret not taking high school more seriously. All my teachers said I could do whatever I wanted with my life. I did nothing instead. Thinking I'm a piece of shit has become like gravity and worthlessness is my default state.

I don't really have any hope for the future but I'm too terrified of death to kill myself. I also don't want to do that to my parents.

Has anyone else ever been in a funk like this?

How do you go about getting yourself out of it?

How do you build confidence from 0? I've heard of ""fake it 'til you make it"" but I don't even know how to do that.

Instead of going for an IT position should I look for a job in an area where I have experience at least while I build my confidence up to normal levels?

There are some things I'm leaving it because I feel like I already wrote a novel but I wrote all the major things I can think of. Any help would be greatly appreciated. [I'm also including this clip from Bojack Horseman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F06UDnWW1HI) that I relate to a lot because it's so similar to  a lot of my self talk.

240,"Alright, this might take a little bit, but please bare with me. I currently live with my father and his girlfriend, due to both financial and mental issues at the moment. My father decided to buy a pure breed German Rottweiler for the purpose of breeding. He later got another one from the same breeder which now fights the other with assistance of our other dog. Today my fathers girlfriend ended up getting one loose somehow and they had a bad fight. The older one is going to need at least three different stitches.

I believe the best thing to do is find a better home for the older Rottweiler but they have grown attached to her and would rather go through this shit than giving her a better life. I mean they knew from the start from an experience breeder that you never mix two in tact females together but they didn’t listen.  I care for these dogs and hate to see them get hurt. I don’t want one to die from this stupid shit but that’s the outcome I can see happening easily. 

The older Rottweiler is my fathers favorite dog and I doubt he would ever get rid of her. He doesn’t care much for the other one, but she’s the only friend for my dads girlfriends dog so it just complicates the whole situation. I just want to take the older one and leave but that won’t happen anytime soon.

What’s the best course of action?

241,"I got offered a 5 year academic position in a Nordic country but I'm not sure whether I want to take it. At first I was all game because I've been there on holidays a few times and love the country (there's so much nature versus the densely populated country I live in, and I love nature, wildlife watching etc ). Then I went for the interview a few weeks ago and realised the country is a lot different in winter, it's very very quiet, also nature-wise . Add to that the small city it was in didn't seem too lively, now I don't mind that as long as I don't have to live in it and can be closer to the countryside. Loneliness often only hits when you're surrounded by strangers, rather then when you're alone. 

To finish off, the subject I'd be working on is interesting but not exactly my dream subject..

So one minute I'm thinking I should go for it, I always told myself I wanted to live in that country and now there's finally an opportunity. Then (mostly at night) I think I don't want it, the place I live at doesn't seem so bad and I have nice things going for me here such as my very supportive family and friends.

245,"I’ve been at my job for 8 years. I’ve moved up in the ranks, and have been super loyal. Things have been going downhill for years, and employees have been leaving in droves without being back filled. I’ve tried to stay positive, until last year, when my boss/mentor left. I landed her management position, but it really opened my eyes to how toxic things have gotten. I’m one of the last competent people left and I’m exhasuted. 

My team, which was once a group of 10, was down to just myself and another girl by the middle of last year. Upper management FINALLY started scrambling after years of no action, and they opened 10 entry level positions, with intent to align 3 to our team. 2 started last year, and have had a learning curve, but have been fine and receptive to training. The third started earlier this year. It’s better than nothing, I guess, but it’s still too little, too late. 

Lo and behold, around the same time the newest hire set to report to me started, an amazing opportunity presented itself to me. I went through some interviews, carefully still balancing it all with my current job, cause nothing is guaranteed. I ended up getting a 6 figure offer, and I feel pretty confident that this could be great for me. Change is terrifying, but I’ve given this place so much, and find myself miserable to go into a job I used to love. I need to give an answer by Monday. 

The catch? This newest hire has been a bit of a nightmare. He looked great on paper, and had an excellent interview, and even some relevant experience which was desperately needed. First day, everything changed. He came in with a very weird and negative attitude. Complained about the office, the equipment, etc. I gave him the benefit of the doubt, maybe just first day jitters. He immediately complained that training is too overwhelming. He claimed to get the flu his first week and took 2 days off. We have flexible working hours, but he’s already coming in the latest he can and leaving the earliest he can. He expects to have his hand held every single day for every task given. Obviously, with new hires, we expect some hand holding, but he won’t even try on his own. Yesterday was the last straw, when he blantantly just left a half hour early without discussing anything with me, because he noticed me going into a meeting. I’m done giving the benefit of the doubt. I like to give my employees freedom and flexibility, I have no interest in babysitting a grown adult’s time, but this has crossed the line. I’ve treated him the same as the other new employees I’ve managed and have watched them develop without this nonsense. Hell, I’ve given him more attention and help than any new employee has gotten. I’m going to address it tomorrow, for sure. 

BUT now I’m in this predicament where I need to discipline someone, but I also could be giving 2 weeks notice next week. My new boss is not going to have my back with the new employee situation, she is extremely defensive and goes right to the “it’s something you’re doing” place. Even though I’m ready to go...my career grew up here. I’m sick at the thought that this looks like I got into a situation I couldn’t fix, so I just dipped and left the mess to my colleagues and friends. I find myself almost ready to decline the new job to roll up my sleeves and turn this around. I know that’s ridiculous, but I’m just at a loss and have no idea what to do, the guilt is overwhelming.

We’re literally just building our future together with this new place. We have set our budgets to the rent/utilities  grocery shopping (which we found out that we can order online through Walmart since we don’t drive) and other bills, we can afford the place but will take time to buy furniture as we didn’t save up that much for it anyways.

251,"This is going to be a long post but l try to split it up. Sorry if this isn't okay for this sub. 

Background: 18F diagnosed with anxiety and BPD type II. I regularly take Lamictal which is a mood stabilizer. Adopted so no family history. 

Anyways, in the last few years (15yrs old ish) I've had some mental health ups and downs and ended up seeing a therapist for a few years including DBT. Now I only see a psychiatrist every 3 months. During these last few years my psychiatrist and therapists have toyed around with the idea of me having some kind of learning disorder/disability (I don't really know the PC term sorry). I have never been diagnosed with anything related to that mostly because at the time my depressive cycles were taking the bulk of my time and my therapy time to try and manage. 

Fast forward to now and I am going to be starting college in the fall so if there is an issue I want to get ahead of it now. As a little kid I was never really considered likely to have ADHD bc my grades are stellar however I mostly contribute that to my anxiety issues which basically won't physically allow me to not get good grades. 

In the past I have had concentration issues that are mostly auditory. I have to read something not just hear it if it is a big amount of information. If some talking goes on for too long I will hear all the words but afterwords I honestly would not be able to tell you what any of them meant in context. 

I also have some concentration or task issues. I'll have so much to do that I won't do any of it (just feel overwhelmed or cry) or I'll sit down and work for hours to get everything done- there's no in-between. I'll also start something and then not finish it and jump to the next thing. Like starting my math homework in one tab then switching to Spanish homework and I never finish math bc I forgot I was doing it. 

The big thing that stuck out to me recently was that I deep cleaned my room last month and it was sort of hellish. I had all these things to do (closet, books, shoes, etc) but I started one and then got distracted by another and didn't finish the first one. I eventually found myself sitting on the floor surrounded by books with my dresser half dusted and every cable I owned thrown on the other clear section of my floor. Those were all supposed to be separate categories. 

Once I realized I had started all these things I freaked out because I knew I had to finish them NOW or I would never. Basically I lose the motivation to do things if I'm not super pumped about them in the moment (like how long I am willing to clean has an expiration date). 

Maybe I'm making a mountain out of a molehill but I will only be seeing my psychistrist once more before I go to college so if I'm going to bring this up I have to make a decision. 

Tldr: was diagnosed with some stuff, assessment of learning disorders got cut short. Revisiting past behavior and I think I might have some issues that should be addressed before I go to college. ",08Mar2019,2

I have had trust issues from a relationship in high school in which after the relationship ended i had people coming out of the woodwork to tell me that she had cheated on me with several different people, including a friend of mine. We were young, the girl admitted she was wrong and has apologized, but i’ve never shaken the lack of trust i have in my partners since.

My wife and i have been married for two years and together for about 4 1/2. We met because she was engaged to a friend[F] of mines best friend[F]. She was unhappy in that relationship and ended up sleeping with me after seeing each other out and about. I later learned that i wasn’t the only “other man” either. Her then fiancé found out, kicked her out, and she moved in with me.

While we were together (before getting married) we split up twice because she had developed feelings for other men. She knows of my trust issues and promised there had never been an overlap either time we split up. Both times we were only apart for a month or two before getting back together.

We talk about it on occasion, typically when i make  one too many jokes about the possibility of her seeing other people (the only way i know how to deal with my insecurities), but i know it makes her uncomfortable. She then reassures me that she loves the family we’ve built. And i reassure her its just me and my insecurities. But i just feel like if the cycle continues I’m just going to end up pushing her away. 

I love my wife, but i feel like i cant love her as much as she deserves to be while harboring these undeserved thoughts that shes being unfaithful to me every time she leaves the house.

Another admin leaves. No replacement.

I was a tutor then and would cover in the admin room after class then.

I was not always like these when a i was about 15-16 i was really comfortable around girls and girls liked me as well and  i was really into social media and shit. After i started gaming my life kinda changed, i became a huge introvert and had no interest in finding a girlfriend, i also deleted all my social media accounts and lost any connections with my then normie friends,became a nerd and made new nerd friends. So after starting collage i tried to get out of my shell and started going out and met new people with one if them being a girl. So i started talking with this girl and i found out the we had many thing in common and that she lives really close to my house, now we hang out almost daily  and we sort of become best friends as i can be my real self around her. The problem is that she has a boyfriend and that i never had such a close relationship with a girl as an itrovert it is really hard for me to meet women and open up to them even though i am an ok looking guy. In the end i started devoloping feelings about this girl but since we openly talk about many thing (including the sex that she has with her boyfriend) i have been really depressed and sad about it for a couple of weeks as i know that nothing can really happen between us and that she is going to change collage and go to another country. I know that getting to know other girls can really help me but i really dont know how as my friend dont know any other girls and the girl i like dont have any friend other than boys.",08Mar2019,1

274,"So there’s this girl, and i really liked her however she always hung around this dude who i really didn’t like but it seemed obvious she liked him. I asked her about him and she “ it’s complicated but let’s just say we’re talking” Fast forward a bit and there’s prom and neither of us had dates so a couple of our friend kinda jokingly said we should go together so we did. We kinda hung out a bit at the dance but it wasn’t a serious date because we didn’t know each other (i had barely talked to her before we went as dates) So at the dance i asked her if she liked the dude she always was around and she said no, so i’m like cool, so i ask her for her phone number and everything seems like it’s going great... until i ask her out on a real date. I ask her out and she said that i was really funny and nice but she can’t go out with me because she’s talking to someone else, the same thing she said when i asked her about the dude. So now here  we am, and whenever i get rejected it already takes some time for me to get over them, but with this situation it feels impossible because i know she was interested in me. I have no clue if she’s dating someone else or if she’s just holding out for a dude. The dude she hangs out with is a total asshole btw and would always tease me and like force her to hold his hand and shit and he would put his hand on her leg whenever i was sitting next to her talking. If anyone. 

Sorry for the wall of text and btw i got a crazy fear that someone i know irl will read this so i’m just gonna say i live in california and my name is John Doe",08Mar2019,0
277,"Yesterday my phone died so i asked my dad to use his since i needed to search something and as i open Chrome i see there is an escort page open. I see this and immediately close it since i was near my family, so i go to another division and search his phone.

Here's what i found:

* The window for the escort was still open so it was a recent search.
* Searched his history for escorts and only found 3 results.
* Searched his whatsapp and the only bad thing there is a message to a friend of his saying ""come on dude..."" and a link to the first escort (the escort page was open yesterday but this message was sent mid February?), and they have no other messages to each other so i'm guessing he either deleted the rest or called him.
* Went to his gallery and there is a really big amount of porn there, so i searched the properties and it says they were received through whatsapp.
* There was no porn in his whatsapp conversations so he probably deleted it in the app and forgot he had auto-download on.
* Searched his messages and phone calls for the number the escorts give out in their website but there is no result, which doesn't mean anything since he could easily delete them.

I tend to overthink alot so maybe this is just me creating this scenario.

What should i do? Tell my mom and probably destroy this family? Ask my dad for an explanation? Or should i just not mention it at all? Please help me.

278,"My bf (22M) and i (22M) have been together for 4 year since we was at second year in university. My bf is cheating on me, i caught him and he admitted, he told me that it has been 2 months. We live in same house, i want to move to a new place to live but he stopped me, cried and told me that he didn't want to lose me, he need me. He said that he still love me but saw me as a brother/friend, he wanted to live with me but in a relationship with another one. I really love him, i just don't want to break up with him. So i force him to choose between me and his new bf but he didn't answer the question but start another story. I've cried a lots these days and cannot focus on anything. I don't know what to do. Part of me said that just leave and never talk to him again, another one is just stay. I'm really depressed and tired. Even if he go back with me, i don't think that it will be the same old love. He is my everything in this city, i don't have anyone close here. Every time i think about him and his new bf i feel frustrated and cried. I tried to meet the therapist but she just talked shit, it doesn't really help at all. Should I leave or stay?

(This is very long but this story takes place over the course of the past week but I will fit in as much detail as I can while trying to make it short)

Ok so about a few months ago, I started talking to this girl (F). She has gotten out of a year relationship a few weeks before that, so we decided to take it really slow. We were hanging out constantly for about four weeks straight, until I heard she was still hanging out with her ex as well as another guy. I heard this from one of my “friends.”(B) That’s when I ended things. However, on Sunday night, there was a snow storm where I am. My best friend (M) and I slept over my this friend’s house as all three of us are friends. When we got there, B called and said he went to the store with F. This is when I learned HE was now hanging around this girl he told me bad things about. The night progressed and around 1 A.M. B came into his room where were M and I were sleeping. This woke me up but I pretended I was asleep. He eventually left but F stayed to talk to M. I eventually ended up speaking up. She stayed in the room with us and she eventually literally into bed with us right in the middle. At first we said this was inappropriate as this is a girl who just started hanging out with B. Yet, I still had some leftover feelings from the first time her and I were talking. Anyways, B kept going downstairs, where he was sleeping, and back upstairs to where M and I were sleeping. B kept walking up and down stairs, asking F to hang out with him. She kept denying because she wanted to hang out with M and I. Yet, for some reason he did not care at all that the girl he was talking a little bit to was in the middle of M and I. B kept getting mad and eventually stayed downstairs. The night goes on she keeps touching M and I and basically showing signs that she wants one or both of us. At one point, she literally got on top of me and begged me to kiss her, which made it really hard for me. I failed to deny her and she ended up kissing M too. Then, she took me to the bathroom where she proceeded to give me head. We went back to the bedroom and M seemed to have no idea as he asked where we went. I got back into bed but she stayed standing up. Then, F took of her pants, which made me ask the question, “Do you have your pants on?” F said no, then took off the rest of her clothes. Then she said, “Someone please fuck me” whilst standing butt naked at the toe of bed of two 18 year olds. That was probably the hardest thing I have ever had to say no to. Especially knowing that this girl has given me the best sex I have ever had. She told me things that made my head swell and she always said we were extremely sexually compatible. I already knew I fucked up enough and was already feeling bad about it. I did not want to progress further, but when a girl is literally all over you for hours on end it become really hard to say no. Especially knowing the past. The girl kept trying to get either M or I to do something to “benefit” her. We kept denying and saying that it was be time. Yet, she literally would not leave. We kept telling her that we wanted to sleep and that she was getting out of hand. She finally left us alone at 5:30 A.M. We woke up around 9 the next day and I ended up going home around 11. I texted F and M about that night and morning to see how they felt, as I was feeling remorse. Yet, F seemed to want to talk to M on a more personal level, while still wanting to have sex with yours truly. Here’s the problem: I found out B actually lied about everything he told me so he could take F from me. Now I don’t care at all about that night and morning. Now F wants to talk to M. What do I do?",08Mar2019,1
281,"For those who don't know how the taxi system works in my country:

Taxis drive around on the regular. If you want to get one, you stand on the edge of the sidewalk. If a taxi sees you, they stop near you. You then say the name of the street you want to go to. If the taxi accepts, you get in and he drives you there. You pay him 2,000 L.L (around 1.3$) when you arrive.

I'm 14 years old and this happened yesterday. I overslept and missed the bus, so I ran downstairs as fast as possible and waited on the street. I stood on the edge of the sidewalk and asked 3 taxis, but all of them said no. As I was asking the fourth one, I immediately remembered I didn't have any money. I started to say ""Never mind, sir, I don't have any money"", but then he cut me off and said it was fine and to get in. I got in the front seat, and he started driving. We then talked for a bit, and, out of nowhere, he asked ""Have you started making milk yet?"" (milk is slang for semen here). I awkwardly said no, and he put his hand on my crotch and said ""That's pretty small, huh?"". I moved his hand away and told him to stop, and he said it was normal and did it again. I then swatted his hand away and told him to stop again, and he said that he wouldn't drive me to school unless I let him do it. I then told him to let me down, so he stopped. As I was opening the door, he quickly moved his hand and grabbed my crotch again, and laughed and told me to get out. 

Honestly, the incident itself didn't affect me too much, but the thought of what else might happen is. I haven't told anyone, as even if I did, there's no way the police could track him down, as I didn't check his license plate. He's probably still driving around, and I'm worried he might do it to someone else. I know I can't do anything about it, but I still feel guilty for not at least trying to fight back or stop him. Does anyone have any advice to deal with this?",08Mar2019,1
282,"Hello good people.

Since 2019 started, I had a lot of bad days in a row and as of today, I feel like sh\*t. I was casual weed smoker, but now I cant remember if I was 3-days sober. I spent a few nights crying and thinking about my life and realising, that my life is just one big mess. And it hurts because for the past 6-7 years, I tried to make it an exact opposite, and I failed miserably. 

&amp;#x200B;

I should probably tell you a little bit about myself. I am a son of immigrant parents from West Asia. Because we were poor, we lived in a very bad neighborhood and also went to a shitty kindergarden., where I was bullied. The bullying didnt stop trough my school life. I never was the most beatiful or cute kid, lets just say being made fun of was an everyday routine for me. I dont think I was depressed, but I was lonely and had almost no friends and started gaining weight, a lot of it. When I hit 15, I decided that I want to change things around. I think I am a reasonably ambitious person, so I dedicated my life to losing weight, bettering myself socially and overall becoming the best version of myself.

&amp;#x200B;

7 years have passed and I feel like all this self development and trying to cope better with life was all for nothing. I cant help but feel like everyone else is flowing trough life much easier and are not even trying. I am not complaining about that, everyone has their life, but its just depressing to keep trying and nothing happens with your life. I am still lonely, still feel like sh\*t, still have almost no friends. I feel like my existence doesnt matter to anyone other than my family. Like if I dissappeared today, no one would care. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is anyone else in this situation? If so, how do you cope with that? I really need some good advice because right now, I am just lost",08Mar2019,2

I am totally new to Reddit, therefore I would love to know, how can I engage with people to share my project, while not being annoying. How I saw, that self-advertisement is frown-upon here, and I totally understand that, but I would love to show-off my concept with others. 

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to share just some of my pictures in different sub-reddits, where it could be interesting, but either it have been banned or just rejected. I tried to be fair, and not to share links, advertise myself, or call out for my project, but to  just share a picture. If in the comments somebody asked, I answered and hinted towards my project, but that´s it.

284,"Ayyy, first reddit post. This is gonna be a long one, so sit down, grab a bite to eat, and let's just jump into it.

For the sake of anonymity, let's just refer to my roommate as John, and for me, just call me Jess. So originally, I had made plans to go to a private college in Savannah, Georgia. I lived in Massachusetts with my family at the time, so this was a big move for me, but I felt like the college's curriculum for Video Game Development was great for me, especially since it incorporated art into it, a hobby of mine I've had ever since I was eight years old. I was accepted to the college, given the emails of my roommates, and on July 31, 2018, I got into contact with my roommates (I had two: John and let's just call the other one Greg). So, I got into contact with John and Greg (they each knew each other and lived in Florida) and we started to connect. At first everything went fine. We were getting along with each other in a group chat. However, as we were getting our stuff packed and finishing everything in our checklists, we ran into a huge problem: the school was a lot more expensive than we thought. We got a financial aid reward of around $16,000 in federal scholarships and loans through FAFSA, but none of us knew that the parent plus loan (a loan that covered the rest of the tuition) required a look into our parent's credit history.

Greg's parents got their loan approved, while John and mine didn't. My mother was friendly with some higher ups at her job as a caretaker for the disabled, so we tried asking them for help to cosign on the loan. My roommate was trying all he could to my knowledge, and we were both stressed out. At the time of this news, I had previously told my job at a retail store that I was transferring my information to a location in Georgia and the process of doing so had already begun. In the end, our efforts were fruitless and the college administration unenrolled both of us from the school having no way to pay $160,000 worth of school tuition of the course of 4 years out of pocket. So there we both were: unenrolled with no direction to go and I now had no idea what to do since my information had been transferred over to Georgia. My roommate however came up with the idea of taking up community college in Texas. He told me he had family there that could help us pay rent (we would each still have to pay $250 a month in utilities, which is basically a steal if you're ever been apartment searching), and seeing as my options were dwindling and at the time I had full trust in John despite never having met him face to face, I happily obliged.

Originally, we planned to move the the college in Georgia in September and get settled (Greg eventually went to the college, had an awful experience with a racist roommate and a tough curriculum and left within a month). John and I now had plans to move to Texas on October 1st. No red flags yet, until October rolled around. 

In order to get to Texas, my mother would have to rent a Uhaul truck, drive to Florida, pick up my roommate and we'd drive to Texas. Unfortunately, renting a Uhaul costs thousands of dollars, so as the time came by, my mother informed me we would need more time to get the Uhaul. This was unfortunate news for me, but relieving for my roommate as his grandmother was in the hospital at the time recovering from a bad case of the flu. I took this as time to get myself financially set for Texas, making sure that I had a job secured in Texas in November, as that was what the date was moved to. I also started doing art commissions to make money, as I was out of a job temporarily and stuck in my house. This proved to be a wonderful decision, as I've made hundreds of dollars through this. However, now that November was creeping by and me and my mother were getting things ready to move, my roommate stalled the date once more, saying the place needed to be prepped for us. Also during this time, my roommate apparently lost $100 due to being scammed by a friend and PayPal representatives not being able to help him get his money back. Red flag number one, and I brushed it off.

Now November rolls around. I'm supposed to already be in Texas at this point, and I'm getting a bit antsy about it. During this point in my life, I'm spending all day, every day drawing to make money and it's taking a toll on me emotionally and physically, making me a lot more tired than before. My only reprieve from loneliness was walking to McDonalds or KFC to get fast food. But I kept my hopes up, working to enroll myself in a community college in Texas and getting all of my information done for that. I got my first month's rent saved up and would spend anything extra on food for myself (my mother could only buy groceries so much and was busy with work all of the time, so I was left to fend for myself and for my younger sister when I could.

Now December rolls around. I apologize for the lack of any vivid details, as during these times, the days just seemed to mesh into each other. My friends after graduation were busy in college and with jobs, while I was in my room struggling to buy a cup of soda. My mental state was draining quick, and I couldn't take being alone anymore. I started crying at night and praying that things would end soon and I could just start school already. The college I signed up was set to start on January 22nd, so even if it wasn't for school, it was for the fact that I hated being dependent and wanted to do my own thing. I badgered my roommate about it, and he would always reply ""I'm working on it"", but things never really seemed to happen. Red flag number two, but again, I couldn't see him, so I just brushed it off. 

Eventually, my mother and my roommate's mother exchanged information and finally, on the night of December 30th, I said goodbye to my little sister and my big sister (who had her own apartment at the time), and we headed off on a road trip to Florida, as it would be too expensive to fly all of my stuff to Florida to meet with my roommate. That road trip was something I will never forget, as I spent the time viewing a whole bunch of states with my mother, eating at a restaurant that I went to all the time as a child for the first time in 10 years, renting out a motel for New Year's Eve, eating at a whole bunch of restaurants I've never been to before. It was a blessing of a trip, and if I could do it all again, I would. It was a lot of fun and the last time I had genuine fun as of writing this post.

On the night of New Year's Day, I met up at my roommate's parent's house, which I would eventually start calling my prison. I unloaded all my stuff in the Uhaul, had dinner with my roommate's mother and grandmother, and said goodbye to my mother. We both held our tears as she drove off into the distance and I stood there, watching the car drive off into the night. I can still remember this exact scene play out in my head. So then I met my roommate John: a 5'10"" dark skinned skinny dude. I'm 5'4"", flat as a board, and a lot paler compared to him, so at first I was a bit shy because of the height difference, but I got used to him quickly. That night, I played a game on his PS4, went with him to Walmart to buy some Pepsi, as we both love Pepsi, and we went to Gamestop and he bought some games. The day after, I got my laptop and started practicing drawing, as I didn't have my setup at the time. But here's where things start to go from good to bad.

The original plan was to stay in Florida for a few **days.** But a few days later, I was still in John's room. I was confused, so I asked about why I was still here. The only answer I got is ""we're working on it"". Red flag number three and now I'm starting to get uncomfortable. In order to still get money, I continued making money off of commissions, just now in a completely new place. 1,500 miles away from my place in Massachusetts to be exact. I started spending my days exactly as I had in my old home: sitting at a computer trying to make money and get my college situation handled. I tried to bond with my roommate, but for some reason, he didn't want to. John spent and still continues to spend his days playing Destiny 2, For Honor, Apex Legends, COD, basically any FPS game playing with online friends, but every time I would ask to join for a split screen game or if I could show him my stock of games, he would decline saying ""We have 4 years together"" or ""I don't want to play with someone who's garbage at the games"". I started feeling distant from John, unlike when we talked online. It seemed that online was the only life he even cared about. At the same time, he was doing nothing about the college situation. He promised me I would get to college by the time it started, so my worries were still low. I was hopeful. I was...wrong.

Weeks later, still here. I watch the days fly by, the day of college orientation creeping up until the day passed and I was still here. Got the same answer. ""We're working on it"". By now I'm starting to get really uncomfortable. I want to go to college. My roommate told me that we can probably start our classes online, so I enrolled for classes, hoping that my financial aid would cover my classes. Unfortunately, due to a misunderstanding, I didn't have financial aid processed at the time, which meant that I couldn't start classes on time. Great, just great.

My life stuck in this house only worsened. In the house, there is me, John, John's mother, and John's grandmother. A little bit of information about myself: I am really picky. I believe I have something called Avoid Food Restrictive Intake Disorder (AFRID), I've never been diagnosed but I'm almost 100% sure I have. Basically, my food palette is very limited. I don't eat any fruit, vegetables, most dairy, beans, seafood, nuts, and a lot of the stuff I do eat is very plain or custom ordered. It's a problem that's stuck with me for all 18 years of my life. My mother's tried helping me with it and not much has worked. I have gotten better over time though. At first I used to avoid every food I didn't like and make a fuss over it if I were forced to eat it. Now, if offered a piece of food that I don't like, I at least try it and access if I like it that way. The problem is though is that my main diet consists of just meat, grains, and junk food for the most part. That's it. I don't have the willpower to grab a food I don't like and start eating it when there's option around me that I like and that my mind finds more convenient. Both John and his grandmother have taken notice of my diet. Obviously it's bad on my part and I need serious help. I talked to his grandmother about it (who's a head chef at a restaurant chain, 72 years old and still working her tailbone off) and she keeps telling me that I don't need help and that I have a ""rebellious streak I need to take my mind off of"" and that ""the reason I eat like this is because of a personal vendetta I have against my mother that carried about through my life"". Throughout my life I have been emotionally attached to mother and I have never disdained her long term, so I personally feel like that's out of the question. If anything, she's one of the reasons that I'm mentally sane and I thank her to this day.

That road trip was something I will never forget, as I spent the time viewing a whole bunch of states with my mother, eating at a restaurant that I went to all the time as a child for the first time in 10 years, renting out a motel for New Year's Eve, eating at a whole bunch of restaurants I've never been to before. It was a blessing of a trip, and if I could do it all again, I would. It was a lot of fun and the last time I had genuine fun as of writing this post.

On the night of New Year's Day, I met up at my roommate's parent's house, which I would eventually start calling my prison. I unloaded all my stuff in the Uhaul, had dinner with my roommate's mother and grandmother, and said goodbye to my mother. We both held our tears as she drove off into the distance and I stood there, watching the car drive off into the night. I can still remember this exact scene play out in my head. So then I met my roommate John: a 5'10"" dark skinned skinny dude. I'm 5'4"", flat as a board, and a lot paler compared to him, so at first I was a bit shy because of the height difference, but I got used to him quickly. That night, I played a game on his PS4, went with him to Walmart to buy some Pepsi, as we both love Pepsi, and we went to Gamestop and he bought some games. The day after, I got my laptop and started practicing drawing, as I didn't have my setup at the time. But here's where things start to go from good to bad.

The original plan was to stay in Florida for a few **days.** But a few days later, I was still in John's room. I was confused, so I asked about why I was still here. The only answer I got is ""we're working on it"". Red flag number three and now I'm starting to get uncomfortable. In order to still get money, I continued making money off of commissions, just now in a completely new place. 1,500 miles away from my place in Massachusetts to be exact. I started spending my days exactly as I had in my old home: sitting at a computer trying to make money and get my college situation handled. I tried to bond with my roommate, but for some reason, he didn't want to. John spent and still continues to spend his days playing Destiny 2, For Honor, Apex Legends, COD, basically any FPS game playing with online friends, but every time I would ask to join for a split screen game or if I could show him my stock of games, he would decline saying ""We have 4 years together"" or ""I don't want to play with someone who's garbage at the games"". I started feeling distant from John, unlike when we talked online. It seemed that online was the only life he even cared about. At the same time, he was doing nothing about the college situation. He promised me I would get to college by the time it started, so my worries were still low. I was hopeful. I was...wrong.

Weeks later, still here. I watch the days fly by, the day of college orientation creeping up until the day passed and I was still here. Got the same answer. ""We're working on it"". By now I'm starting to get really uncomfortable. I want to go to college. My roommate told me that we can probably start our classes online, so I enrolled for classes, hoping that my financial aid would cover my classes. Unfortunately, due to a misunderstanding, I didn't have financial aid processed at the time, which meant that I couldn't start classes on time. Great, just great.

My life stuck in this house only worsened. In the house, there is me, John, John's mother, and John's grandmother. A little bit of information about myself: I am really picky. I believe I have something called Avoid Food Restrictive Intake Disorder (AFRID), I've never been diagnosed but I'm almost 100% sure I have. Basically, my food palette is very limited. I don't eat any fruit, vegetables, most dairy, beans, seafood, nuts, and a lot of the stuff I do eat is very plain or custom ordered. It's a problem that's stuck with me for all 18 years of my life. My mother's tried helping me with it and not much has worked. I have gotten better over time though. At first I used to avoid every food I didn't like and make a fuss over it if I were forced to eat it. Now, if offered a piece of food that I don't like, I at least try it and access if I like it that way. The problem is though is that my main diet consists of just meat, grains, and junk food for the most part. That's it. I don't have the willpower to grab a food I don't like and start eating it when there's option around me that I like and that my mind finds more convenient. Both John and his grandmother have taken notice of my diet. Obviously it's bad on my part and I need serious help. I talked to his grandmother about it (who's a head chef at a restaurant chain, 72 years old and still working her tailbone off) and she keeps telling me that I don't need help and that I have a ""rebellious streak I need to take my mind off of"" and that ""the reason I eat like this is because of a personal vendetta I have against my mother that carried about through my life"". Throughout my life I have been emotionally attached to mother and I have never disdained her long term, so I personally feel like that's out of the question. If anything, she's one of the reasons that I'm mentally sane and I thank her to this day. When John sees me eating, he just tells me I have a problem and that I'm going to die. Yes, I know. But I'm not going to change my eating habits when put in an environment where I'm chastised. I'm just left to fight my own demons. I know I have to have self discipline, but I need an environment of encouragement to help me through my condition. It's come to the point that I've stopped eating altogether, in fear that if I'm caught eating that I'll just be ridiculed. Whenever they're both out of the house, I binge on tons of food as I'm always hungry and when I'm alone I can be free to eat without having to be told off for eating, and this realization has pained me. 

So for the timeline, that's as much as I can recall, but let me fill in the gaps by just talking about how John acts. Overall, I think he's a bum. He spends all of his days either sleeping in his mother's room, watching YouTube, or playing video games with his friends online. I've tried to bond with him over games, but all attempts are fruitless, as mentioned earlier. When he plays video games, he's loud and vulgar. Throughout the entire time I've been typing this post, he's been next to me, eyes glued to his screen wearing noise cancelling headphones. He swears constantly, saying derogatory terms like the f word, b word, homosexual derogatory words, and even the r word, which is one I take a lot of offense to as I grew up around mentally challenged persons thanks to my mother and even though I'm fine with cussing, the r word just irks me a bit to hear it. It's even become a pet peeve just to hear him pressing the controls on his ps4 controller, as I'm reminded while I'm slaving away at art trying to make money that he doesn't give a single care in the world about making money or spending his time wisely. He also eats very loudly which is a pet peeve of mine and chews with his mouth wide open for like 2 minutes, I don't know why it gets to me as much as it does but it does. He doesn't care about me, I feel like he just has to take care of me. He also complains when I buy drinks and drink a lot of it. Anything I eat, he tells me that next grocery run we have, I'm going to pay for it all, and it just feels like he's using me for money. We share the same house and we share the same food. He can eat my food, and I can eat his, but if it's not getting eaten, there's no need to complain about it. One thing that specifically gets to me is that he has a chocolate bar that he's had laying around for over a month and half, he told me he isn't going to eat it but I'm not allowed to have it for no reason. I feel like it's because of my diet, but if he at least told me it were because of that, I would understand a bit. But he gives no reason and it makes me feel like he's doing it just to be petty about it. Lastly, he's just cold overall. We both relate in having an abusive father figure in our lives, but the difference between us two is that he grew cold and distant from it and I grew bold and optimistic from it thanks to the support of my mother and sisters. I'm feminine and try to act carefree while he is very stoic and only laughs when he's playing with his online friends. He also likes to act cruel, like taking away my phone and locking it in his car for trying to be silly and playing ""Everytime We Touch"" during a car ride. He doesn't want to have fun with me and it hurts me emotionally. I want to get close with him but he doesn't allow me to do so.

So overall, that's basically it for how I feel about John. So now here's where the Reddit community can help me. How do I relieve this situation? I feel like I'm a victim of a kidnapping situation or even a prisoner in this home. I haven't confronted anyone about this in real life, as I'm really passive. But even as a passive person, it's really hard to not be hysterical in this situation. So from what I can see I have one option: confront him about the situation and from there my choices grow. But I don't know how to go about this. I can't just tell him I don't like this anymore and want to leave, my family doesn't have the money to spend thousands on a Uhaul to bring me back home, and then my efforts from transferring and all that would be for nothing.

This is still going on as of writing this post, so here is my cry for help.

Please, anyone, save me from this 7 month hell. I beg of you. I need your help. I need someone to care about me.",08Mar2019,2
285,"I'm in 11th grade in high-school, my specialisation being mathematics-computer science in English. My computer science teacher is a 40smth woman with huge behaviour problems. I mean huge. I don't even know how to put into words how mad I am on this woman and how grossed out I am. Bear with me this will be long. Also mobile sorry for mistakes and formatting 

A little background: my family has a habit of moving around, I was born in south (important part, I was raised with tough love and my parents taught me early that real life might be harsh so I need to look out for myself) &amp; moved in the north and the mentality difference is huge. 

Now, I'm a good student. My grades are big, I'm adored by teachers, I participate in tons of stuff. Started my own magazine and went national, went to the nationals in physics and recently came back from a NATO Conference and really even managed to check on the list a National Selection Session in EYP. Wrote a play and managed to present it in Vienna at our country's embassy. I'm enrolled in two NGOs and I'm a junior ambassador for the European Parliament. Wrote a scientific paper at 17 and I'm about to write one this year in physics. And now I'm applying for the student's lawyer position in the students county council. You know, I have some achievements myself. I'm a good student.

A year ago I moved into this high school for several reasons, the main one being that I wanted to reinvent myself somewhere, start living alone and experiencing life. The other one is that my mom is a judge and she wants to retire an open a lawyer office in this county since she is not allowed in her county. Yet she has a bit to wait for the retirement age. 

Now this is where the problems start. She is my computer science teacher but I swear, she doesn't know anything. Everytime her program doesn't run she blames the compiler and we just sit there awkwardly like ummm you forgot a semicolon there and you wrote that wrong and she'll just get mad at us so whatever no point in trying anymore. Often she won't even teach anything in class. I tried to ignore her, as I don't like involving in problems that I don't have. And I don't wanna give my parents headaches they don't need. But she started taking pictures of us in school and outside of school without our consent. If we hang out in bars, she'll just come snap a picture and threaten to tell our parents. Even if OUR PARENTS KNOW where we are and don't give a shit. I'm also a smoker (18, I do it legally, my parents know, I smoke with both of them and sometimes even go grab a beer with my dad) so it doesn't really affect me. But she'll see us walking around the city at 3 pm after school and call parents to tell them and ask what are we doing and if they allow us and like ??? Again, something I can brush off since my own parents are great.

She even writes at 3 a.m. if she sees us online to tell us to go to sleep. Weeeeird.

Sometimes she just starts crying in class out of a sudden. Then laughs. Then cries again. Figured out the poor woman might be just lonely or just really sad or no one at home listens to her and she has nothing else better to do. For a long time I pitied her. 

My highschool has several memes pages. This one is a private ig account. They started posting memes about her but you'd have to be one of us to get them. They don't mention names or have pictures with her. Those ones only run in private between us or our class groups. So anyway, I privately complained about her teaching in a small group chat and someone snitched some screenshots to her. I wasn't offensive, or calling her names, just venting that she doesn't teach us anything. Little did I know it was that moment I released the beast. She started thinking that I am the mastermind behind the pages and everything. Trust me. I have. Better things. To do. Also did this with others.

So she started bitching about me in front of the class when I wasn't present. Also does this with other classmates including telling one it's no wonder his father didn't want to accept him, also she called our special needs classmate handicapped and stuff. Really ugly. So anyway, decided I'd be the bigger person and just go apologize for having an opinion. I wasn't salty. I promise. I went like ""I am really sorry for saying that you're not a good teacher, I get it that everyone has bad days, shouldn't have said that out of respect."" She told me it's okay only to tell my classmates that I am an asshole for saying sorry out of respect. HuUh?? It's called being the bigger person you cave woman. Again. I said nothing. 

Then, during class, she calls me outside to tell me she is considering getting me expelled for my behaviour. And suing me for publicly shaming her by saying privately in a group chat that she doesn't teach us anything. Kept my calm. And said the following: ""I'm sorry and I don't want to offend you, but I believe this is not how these things work"". And she started to cry and scream at me. And show me pictures of her swollen toe. And dermatitis. And she even had pictures of her dead relatives in the coffin at the funeral. It was so awkward and cringe and I just kept my calm and told her it's up to her if she wants to expel me or not. She even told me her son would beat us up. 

But WAIT. It gets worse. I blocked her on social media since she has a habit of stalking and writing me shit out of a sudden. And she started writing my classmates demanding info about me, my parents and what they do (mom is a judge, dad is an officer) and claimed it's ""to see what would happen if she expels me"", why I live alone, what do I do in my free time (honestly staying at home 90%, I don't party heavily or anything). She even said that's full of lawyers around here so wtf is my mom's business coming here. Ah. She sent the whole class home one day so she could go see a soccer game and marked me ONLY absent after that ??. 

Anyway, would go to my principal but he has a reputation of doing nothing. Would go talk to mom or dad but they have a lot on their minds (and some health issues and I don't wanna give them some heart attack because of this bimbo), and I would love nothing but to be left alone. I don't want a scandal. Or people getting fired (she is really sad and stuff, but I still pity the old woman). Or me expelled out of this bullshit (not likely tho). I just wanna have my peace of mind honestly. And not be stalked. I have no idea how to handle it correctly at this point.

Bottom note: Other teachers don't like her either. Sunshine (that's how we call out English teach) even told me that she ignored her their whole Erasmus trip and she called the principal crying asking him to book her a flight back home because she doesn't feel appreciated. 


tl;dr: sent a text message in a group chat saying ""she doesn't teach us anything"" &amp; that's true, someone took a ss and now she hates me, stalks me, wants me out. does creepy shit to other students too.",08Mar2019,2
286,"Over that past two years my life has gone in the complete opposite direction of what I imagined it was going in. I’m 17 and I officially dropped out of Highschool in October of 2018 after switching schools twice and constantly struggling with attendance. I was in the hospital for downing a bottle of Tylenol in hopes of offing myself during may of 2018. I have no motivation to do anything or even get back into school. I was planning on doing classes online to at-least get my diploma but I have absolutely no idea what I want to take post secondary. I’m stuck working a job that I absolutely dread going to every day. Overall I’m totally lost and have no ideas about what direction to head in. I’m constantly overwhelmed by my future that I tend to shut down completely every time it gets mentioned. I’m scared. I’m so scared. I’m only 17 and I have absolutely no idea how to get motivated to change my ways. Even the thought of how much of a failure I will continue to be doesn’t even phase me anymore.

291,"I’ve been living with 2 housemates since last summer. I lived with one of them all through university and we’re good friends, even after graduating. I’m also friends with his girlfriend, the other housemate.

Just based on him being home when they first arrived, he’s in charge of the water and energy bills, as well as council tax. I’m in charge of the internet, and insisted everyone set up a standing order with me every month to pay it. We can’t do this with water and energy because it changes every month.

The problem is, he never tells me when bills arrive or what I owe him.

Not long after we moved in I owed him £200 for council tax and energy. I bugged him for a month to give me his bank details, and when he finally did they were wrong. This took another month to sort out because he kept saying they were right and we assumed it was a problem with my bank until I went in branch and was told the sort code was for a completely different part of the country. 

While I was doing this more bills came in, but he didn’t tell me they had or how much they were for - I had to ask if we’d had any. Even when I saw an envelope for a water bill in the living room he didn’t tell me about it.

I have autism and mental health problems which affect my memory and make budgeting harder, so this is a real problem for me as unexpected bills can really throw me. If they end up piling up I’m fucked. 

I’ve asked him to let me know when they come in, but he still doesn’t. I think because he tells his girlfriend to her face when a bill arrives it just slips his mind send me a message or tell me about it. He has a bit of a complex too about being seen as “tight” after another friend made a comment about it (he rarely buys new clothes and doesn’t buy any kind of fancy foods or toiletries, which is fine. He’s more frugal than tight). I think this makes him feel awkward asking for money even if it’s owed.

His last housemate, another friend from uni I’ll call J, had a similar problem. They’re both at fault. J never set up any kind for standing order to pay for internet and didn’t pay him back for council tax. But he never reminded J or let him know he wasn’t getting money either. J owed him hundreds of pounds because of this, but at the same time my housemate never checked his account to see if J was paying him. J insists it just didn’t cross his mind and he would’ve paid if he was being reminded (I’ve known J as long as I’ve known my housemate and believe this). I don’t want to end up in a similar problem because I’m not being told about bills.

Should I just keep hassling him to let me know when bills arrive? I’m toying with making some kind of spreadsheet for all our bills and framing it as being for everyone’s benefit, but that feels excessive...although I do love a colour coded one",08Mar2019,2
292,"This is going to be a long read and also a trainwreck, please bear with me. I really need the advice. English is also not my first language but I hope I can write everything down accordingly.

Back in July 2017, I met this guy. I was 16 then. I’m 18 now. We clicked well and we were talking almost everyday. In August, he asked me to be his girlfriend. I was over the moon. Since he lives a bit away from me, we were long distance, although we did meet occasionally. Things were good. We fought sometimes, but we still managed to keep going.

In November 2017, we messed up. Kind of did the deed without protection and I was afraid I might be carrying his baby. I talked to him about it, and my mom saw the conversation (she went through my phone). Shit went down, and my phone got taken away. We couldn’t communicate much, but we still tried. He visited me in February, and everything felt so amazing. 

Cut to April 2018. All of a sudden he thinks we are not going to work out. The fights are getting more frequent, I’m starting to feel unappreciated. We had a falling out, but decided to still keep hanging on. The threats of breaking up kept increasing though.

June 2018. He tells me he fell out of love. He tells me he wants out. This lasts a day. He comes back the next night and asks me for another chance. He confesses to me that back in January, when we were not much in contact, he slept with someone under the influence of drugs. I decide to forgive him, and gives him another chance.

We hold on for another month until he suddenly leaves saying he couldn’t do it. I thought it was the end. I threw away everything, deleted all pictures of us, tried to move on. But I was wrong. He messages me out of he blue after about 2 months. He says he needs me. He says he’s changed. He says he regrets nothing more than leaving me. So I fell for it again.

We get back together and things seem good. We don’t fight as much. He comes to visit me in December and we spend everyday together... until one day he tells me he wants to leave me again. I couldn’t take it. We didn’t talk for a whole day and met up that night. We decide to work things out.

And we held on again.. for 2 weeks. He tells me he is getting bored. He wants a break. I agree. This doesn’t last long. He comes back.. he needs me apparently. “Okay,” i think, “he has depression. He’s probably going through a depressive episode.” So I let him in. Things were okay for another month. 

He wants to break up AGAIN. I felt so broken, so empty. I’ve given everything and tried my best to make things work, to be the person he wants. I don’t know what made him change his mind but we decided to keep going. And so we did.. for a week.

Two days ago he tells me he doesn’t love me. He’s only pretending to love me. And he’s gone now. I’m in so much suffering and I just want to let go. But I feel like I still will go back if he comes again. 

It’s so toxic. I have to let go. But I love him so much and I don’t know what part of me thinks that we can still make it work. Please tell me what I need to hear so I can move on.

Tl,dr; was in an on-off toxic relationship where my ex kept going away saying he’s getting bored and coming back. I keep giving him chances. We’re broken up again and I just want to let go of him completely. How can I do this?",08Mar2019,1
293," 

Hi reddit, I am a bit confused and need your help! In commemoration of Women's Day, all the female employees at my workplace were given a rose, and made to pose for photos.

Should I be flattered, and treat it like a touching, gallant gesture, celebrating their female employees?

Or should I be annoyed (im leaning this way) that we are being used for their social media page, and made to pose like a bunch of secretaries a la Mad Men series?

On the one hand, the devils advocate in me is arguing ""there is no men's day"" , and this particular company seems fair to its female employees, treats us with respect, equal pay as far as I know and we make up just under half of the workforce.

A part of me is infuriated that we are being treated like PR trophies, and given pretty things to smell.

Either celebrate women's day with a personal compliment on how we (individually) are an asset to the company (for what we do not how we look), or give us a goddamn raise or a book.

Or lets not celebrate men/women day, and just all be equal?

295,"I have been friends with my friend group for about 4 years now, and I love all of them very much. The way they express their love is different than mine, sometimes way different, and it makes me feel like they don’t love me or that they could/would leave me whenever they want. I know this is super irrational because why would they be friends for me this long if they were going to drop me? Or why would they say they love me and call me their friend? This type of paranoid thinking could also very much be rooted in heightened stress and anxiety I’m experiencing at the moment. The simple answer is they wouldn’t leave you, but my stupid brain will not let it go. I guess the inkling of doubt I have held onto is that I feel like they would hang out without me (not out of spite, but just because I’ve been forgotten). My other fear is rooted in the fact that my best friend won’t room with me (because he wants to room alone) but I can’t help but feel it’s because of me. I also just feel like I’m not as important to some of them as they are to me which, isn’t at all their fault, it just makes me feel kind of shitty. 

&amp;#x200B;

This type of anxiety has bled into other relationships of mine as well, including my best friend. Even the smallest, tiniest, insignificant sign that they are upset with me or irritated by my presence makes me begin to think these thoughts.

300,"If this doesn't belong here let me know, newer user on mobile.
So, I've had a lot of issues in the past with doctors not taking me seriously, and I was wondering if anyone had any advice.
25, F, USA. I have had chronic pain since I was 12 years old, and it took 7 years for my doctor to recommend me to a specialist. Even the specialist did very little. My pain is getting worse, and has gone from just one knee to both knees, both hips, and sometimes my ankles. Every single time I go to a doctor they tell me the same: go home, take some ibuprofen, ice it if it hurts. Occasionally they prescribe me Naproxen or tell me to wear a brace ""if it helps."" The only diagnosis I have ever received is for one knee.
If I did like they said, I'd go through a bottle of ibuprofen a week and I wouldn't be able to work properly.

The only problem I noticed is the interaction I have with them. They are all at least 10 years older then me, they all have jobs. We are often hanging out a bit during dinner time when we are all at home. But I still notice this age barrier between me and them. We kind of have different interests, we are in different stages of life. Therefore there are not many topics we can talk about. I should add they know eachother well.. I also have social anxiety which makes everything worse and more awkward. So how can I connect with them?

306,"We're students living at University accommodation and we have an issue with one of our housemates. While we don't see him very often, on the few occasions he gets involved in conversation, he starts expressing views that target my other housemates and will casually act in ways that are inappropriate.

A quick run down: One of our housemates is transsexual (female to male), another is non-binary, but he'll deliberately refer to them using female pronouns. He also said to the transsexual guy that they will likely kill themselves and not have a family because of statistics. Our other housemate is bisexual, he has acted casually homophobic towards him. He's also made his racist views apparent (racial slurs, saying he would bomb Israel etc.). There's a good list of other stuff he's said and done as well.

Yesterday he joined in on our conversation and particularly struck a nerve with everyone. Ridiculous stuff, like you could cut homosexual people out of evolution using mercury? He was keen on questioning our trans and NB housemates on how ""X could know they were Y if they haven't been born as Y"". Needless to say, the rest of the night was ruined.

We're over half way through the year and there's not much we can do about him. We told the wardens, they basically said to report what he says to them. They've offered to have someone talk to him, but everyone's been reluctant about it. They haven't been able to move him, he has to leave of his own volition and pay a deposit, regardless he would just become somebody else's problem. He's done the bare minimum to keep himself out of serious trouble.

I've had arguments with him about why he should take his rubbish off the table and keep his stuff in a cupboard, so trying to convince him to keep his stubborn political views quiet would likely make the problem worse. Everyone else is too afraid to say anything.

307,"I haven’t really felt like myself lately. I’m a 19 year old freshman in college, and I’ve just been feeling like overall shit lately. Last semester I dropped a class and failed two, but did great in my other classes. This semester, I’ve just given up completely and stopped showing up to class. I’ve already missed enough classes for an automatic fail for each one I had this semester. 

I really wanted to do better this semester, but any motivation I had just went out the window. Last semester, I went home about every other weekend. This semester I went home only 2 weekends, one of which was just to go with friends to get a tattoo. 

I’ve also not had a normal sleep schedule. It’s 6:30 in the morning and I haven’t slept all night. This has been happening *every single night*. Then I sleep the day away, and wake up when my friends want something. Or if I feel so lonely I need to interact with my friends. 

Which brings me to my confusion. I love hanging out with my friends, so it doesn’t feel like I’m depressed, just like I’ve given up on school. 

In addition to all of this, I did try to go to the counselor on campus. I was under the impression counseling was free, but it was just my luck that they changed the policy this year and there was a fee for each appointment. 

I’ve started drinking, and at first I wasn’t worried, but when I look back on it, drinking even at least once a week scares me, so I’ve tried to cut back. But nights like this, I just want to be numbed in some way. And alcohol is much more accessible than weed, which I would prefer even though I know even that isn’t good for me, at this age and in this state. 

I don’t even know how to talk to my parents about it. When I first felt myself slipping, I did talk to them. They started to think I was getting better, so now I definitely don’t know how to tell them I just wanna fucking drop out and do nothing with my life.

318,"I don’t know if this sounds whiny or if my parents are genuinely in the wrong for this but here we go.

I’m 16, and like most high school students, I play sports, take AP classes, have to take the SAT and have several clubs I’m involved in. My parents know this and are supportive for the most part but they kind of screwed me over recently.

My parents are out of town (my moms getting surgery— cosmetic, not a life threatening illness) so my older sister is staying with me primarily to watch my little brother. I was mildly annoyed that my parents were leaving during such a busy week for something that could’ve been prolonged and leaving me with my sister of all people. I figured I’d be fine though because I know how to do things for myself and have transportation to and from where I need to be. 

Wrong. When I called my mom to check up on her and confirm that everything was in place for my match, and SAT, she told me I couldn’t go to either because I needed to stay home with my brother. I was confused, because that’s what my sisters here for but she said my sister has to leave for whatever reason.

So recap; I’m missing school, as well as a match, two tests in two of my hardest classes, and my SAT. To babysit.

Now, I know it sounds like I’m blaming them for something that’s on the fault of my sister but they know she’s unreliable. In fact, she was the one who was supposed to go with my mom to her surgery but my dad opted to go instead, last minute. And it’s not like literally no one else was available; my older brother lives ten minutes away but he doesn’t have “parental” instincts. But I guess as a 16 year old girl, i’m the perfect fill to play teen mom. 

I know there will the other matches and other SAT dates and I can always make up the tests in my classes. But now I have no basis for what to study for the May and June SATs (I cant even take the May one unless I want to spontaneously combust while also trying to study for my AP exams.)

My coaches already aren’t thrilled with me since I joined last minute and there was some complications with that (also thanks to my parents). And I have to miss two of our next matches and practices for a debate competition. 

And finally, the grading period ends in 3 days. So instead of worrying about the last few assignments, I have to make up two tests (one of which I might not be able to because I was technically already supposed to finish it. Today was my last day to do so.) while also testing in other classes and doing assignments. 

So what’s the verdict? Are my parents messed up for this one or do I just sound entitled?",08Mar2019,1

320,"Hello reddit​

I have OCD and the two large themes it picks up on are my body image and my relationships. These two intertwine, as when my body image is bad, my sex drive drops and my ROCD becomes worse. As my ROCD becomes worse, my body image is affected as we have sex less and I think I'm a bad partner. I am medicated and have been through therapy, but unfortunately, OCD is just something that cannot be cured, only managed.

​
That being said, I've come to the conclusion that even if I cannot be certain that I am with the right man, I can still enjoy it in the now. My ROCD does not make me distrust him, but makes me question my attraction and levels of commitment to him due to intrusive thoughts about how much I love him and find him attractive.

​I love him, I love cuddling with him, I think he's cute, he makes me chuckle, he's gentle, he listens to me, he calms me down. I love him. But I want to feel passion, chemistry and heat with my boyfriend and I just can't. I think this is down to the fact that his physical style doesn't do it for me - and my ROCD loves that.


The thought ""I think he would look better in [x]"" gets mutated into ""I am not attracted to him"".

​I don't want to change him, I don't want to make him uncomfortable, I don't want to force him to do something he doesn't want to do, but he has body image issues and wears primarily baggy ill fitting t-shirts and fleece shorts with leggings. Usually his boxers/ass crack are hanging out of his jeans. It's not a look I find particularly hot. But it's what he always wears and I just can't get myself to look at him and want to rip his clothes off which is what I want to be doing. Our NYE plans he dressed like this, and I didn't dress up because he told me it wouldn't matter, but we received comments about it on the night, and I feel it was a missed opportunity to dress up and be fancy together and to not be able to stop looking at each other.

I am endlessly positive about it to him though - the other day he wore a new t-shirt and said he wasn't sure because it was a bit tight. I thought it looked fantastic as it was perfectly fitting, so I told him he looks really good in slim fit clothes. When he gets new clothes, I make sure to compliment them, and to tell him what it is about it that I like, and never to put him down for things I don't like.

But it really feels like I am the one making the effort to be attractive to the other in this relationship. I exercise regularly, brush and floss, dress well most of the time (but obviously enjoy dressing comfortably too!). My boyfriend used to go to the gym, but now he doesn't and doesn't seem to have any desire to. He doesn't floss, and has no desire to when I've asked him if he wants to know my oral hygiene routine. And the fact that I have ROCD makes me feel as though these are just intrusive thoughts and shouldn't be thought about, but I really don't think they are this time.

I've asked to spice up the bedroom multiple times so as to get around this issue, but again it seems like it's me who's putting in the effort to improve this, and I'll suggest something, only for it never to come to fruition.

TL;DR having trouble being attracted to boyfriend's style, feel like I'm the only one putting effort into sex and attraction",08Mar2019,1

So, this question stems from the fact that I have been trying to plan a nice trip to another country with friends, and by this I mean I mean that I've been ""bugging"" different people each time and for different places (just to try and improve my chances of having someone say yes to one of the ideas I pitch in). I've been sadly unsuccessful for many years, and I'm not putting the blame on my friends, they are great people and really nice friends, we just have a hard time planning anything really. In groups there's normally that unsaid rule that everyone must want to go for the plan to move forward and that's basically impossible. And the other single friends I have don't really care much for what I care (in terms of hobbies and other interest, again great friends, just not compatible some times). And my last resort is always my big brother which I love hanging out with, and we already travelled together, but he also has friends that want to travel with him so I don't really want to take that from him. 
Should I keep bothering my friends and change strategies? Or is solo travel the only answer for this? 
I already considered solo travel many times, especially cause I would love to do and interrail or intrarail, but I suspect I have social anxiety and I don't know if it would go well with my paranoid tendencies to suspect every sketchy person that comes my way...

She had been almost to her breaking point but we have recently been working on it and we had mostly worked out these issues.  Last week out of the blue she broke up with me saying that she still wasn’t over our issues and needed to put herself first and work that out.  She then drove here and told me about the frat party she had been to last weekend.  She had too much to drink and there had been a guy who was supposed to stay sober to help people who had too much. She left something in a bedroom and when she went back to get it he followed her in. She originally told me that she had had sex with this guy.  When I asked for more details she told me that she remembers him kissing her and she pulled away, but after that she doesn’t remember anything.  The next morning a friend told her that the guy said they hooked up.

After asking for more details she found out that her friend would defend the guy so that he doesn’t get in trouble.  I wanted to talk to her myself by my girlfriend was begging me not to talk to her because it would only make things worse. 

What she has said and done seem more like her being apologetic after having knowingly cheated rather than the aftermath of a rape (although I don’t have experience with either). I don’t know if not remembering what happened has a role in that or not. She has given me no indication in the past of cheating or wanting to cheat and I want to believe her and work through this but something seems off about this.

Over the last 10 years or so, I've watched her change from an empathetic critical thinker with a great bullshit detector to an increasingly ignorant and hostile racist conservative with absolutely no self awareness and a grasp of logic and reason that is tenuous at best.  My mother gets all her news from Fox News and Facebook and her view of America has become so distorted that it's clear to me that we are living in two separate realities with our own sets of facts.  It's like she's incapable of seeing Republicans for who they truly are and I have no idea how to reach her.  She loves Trump and hates all the things that Fox News tells her to hate: ""liberals,"" Alexadria Ocasio-Cortez, Hillary Clinton, hispanic immigrants, et al.  

She used to be much more moderate in her political beliefs regarding minorities, immigration, and political compromise, but she has become this intolerant conservative asshole and its really starting to affect our relationship.  I have made absolutely no headway in my attempts to get her to see what is happening to her.  I have been unable to show her the true face of the Fox News/GOP propaganda machine.

331,"I went through a 1.5 month, 5 interview process to get hired at a company I'm really excited about. It's a 30% pay raise compared to my current position, and it's extremely difficult to get hired. They have a policy that you cannot take time off within the first 3 months of getting hired (or 60 days, not sure) but I had to let them know of three vacation days I already had planned before getting the job -- two of which are 3 months out for my brothers wedding.

However, I have been seeing a therapist regularly for 4 years. I have been going every other Tuesday at 9:30, and my current (soon to be former) employer was extremely good about it. I would say ""I've got an appointment. I'll be in before noon"", they'd say okay, and I'd show up around 11:00 or 11:30 depending on traffic. Now I'm concerned because I dont know that my new employer is going to be as accommodating. I also have an appointment every one or two months for medication management, and then of course the regular one-offs like the occasional dental work or physical.

Admittedly, I probably see doctors more than most people. I have some coming up for a neuro psych eval and a vaccination appointment, for example.

I know about the ADA, and requesting reasonable accommodation for therapy and things like that, but I dont know how to broach that topic with a new employer. Especially one that I'm so excited about, that was so difficult to actually get hired for.

How long should I wait to mention my therapy appointments? I've put them on hold indefinitely until I get it sorted out. Should I say it's a weekly appointment and then continue biweekly, and schedule other related appointments on the off weeks? 

I believe my employer has a schedule of 8:30 to 5, and those are also operating hours. I dont believe there is much room to adjust or make up hours but I'm not sure yet.

Edit: they also have an EAP that includes therapy, but it's under their health insurance. I'm planning to stay under my fathers health insurance until I'm 26 (when I'm legally required to get my own) because his plan is excellent since hes fairly high up at a great company. ",08Mar2019,1

333,"So you can read my reddit history, nothing more or less on it. Anyway I head out of my house this morning for work (I live in the city) and I walk about 1 block away and I hear a man &amp; a women screaming from a roof, or higher ground...first the women said ‘I hate him, I hate orange, **** you, GO HOME! I hate you! **** you’ Both a man and a women distinctly screaming in unison at me ‘I hate you!’ towards me. It is 4:40 am at that point. I did not respond. I paused and looked the general direction to make sure what I was hearing was correct. I just continued in my way to work. (I walk to work.)

I’m not concerned by this development as I would much rather have a face to face interaction with any person who chooses to harass someone. I do not think I caught an argument, as they were yelling in unison at me at 4:40 in the morning in a quiet downtown urban setting. I do want advice on how to handle this, hoping this doesn’t turn into some pathetic melodrama. I don’t want to escalate any of this &amp; hopefully it subsides.

340,"Hi Reddit,

I need advice on how to handle the current situation in my family. 

So, my father, currently 64, has been drinking everyday for as long as i can remeber. He never got drunk, just the usual glass of beer/cognac/whiskey. Last year, he had a brain surgery and after that he was instructed to give up alcohol for at least 2 months. He gave it up for about 1.5-2 weeks. 

Now, he begun to have memory losses, he doesn't remember what he said, he raises his voice quite often and his overall behavior changed. 

Both me and my mom are scared and we have repeatedly asked him to at least not drink 1 day since the surgery. He always finds excuses, he's saying that he wants to feel relaxed at home. (A few weeks ago, i was visiting them and i found my dad in the car, in the parking lot, drinking. that scared me and i never told my mom.)

He is refusing any kind of therapy, we have no family friends and the entire family consists of us 3, a cat and a dog. 

What can we do? Is he an alcoholic, even though he doesn't get drunk? Has anyone any advice for this situation?

341,"I've (M25) known her (F27) for 8 years and we became damn near was a couple for the last 2. She began telling me she loved me and had never felt this way about anyone in her life then I found out she actually had another guy on the side (I was the side guy apparently)

 He tried to make her stop speaking to me but she continued on anyways (I pushed my feeling aside to continue our friendship) until she felt he would find out about us speaking still she blocked me on all accounts just a little over a month ago. I missed her so much I felt as if she had actually died and began to grieve her. I didn't realize until the next day she had sent me a voicemail a few days prior to blocking me where she expressed her love for me, she had left a meeting at her job to call me and told me she still loved me and that I should never forget that then called me her boyfriend.

I sat with this information until last night then created a whatsapp and was able to get in contact with her and asked her to please speak to me and that I felt like I was grieving and she stared at the messages for a while then blocked me without saying a word. Her bf is actually verbally and mentally abusive from what's she's told me about him but now I don't know what to do with myself. 

(I know I'm stupid for continuing our friendship after finding out about the other guy) I didn't just lose the only person I've ever loved and the only best friend I've ever had. Someone I thought I knew and loved for so many years threw me in the trash for an abusive relationship. (She didn't grow up knowing what real love was or felt like and that's why we we're so close because we had both been through the ringer during our childhoods)

343,"First time posting
Coming from mobile so please go easy on me folks.
I’m trying to keep certain things vague to protect the people in this story,  but this is an issue that’s close to my heart and I need to know how to/ if I can help.

A family member of mine, that lives in Michigan, has been allegedly homeschooling their child for the past at least 5 years (perhaps 6). This child is now 13.

Said child came to visit me for a few days (I don’t live in Michigan) as a special treat to celebrate a recent birthday. During this visit, some things came to light that I think should be of concern.

The child let me know that they’re told to not wake up early ( so the parent/teacher can sleep in)
This child lacks basic understanding of money counting/handling, telling time, their handwriting looks like it’s at a first grade level ( same with sentence structure, child was asked to send out some thank you post cards from their trip and I witnessed it first hand), their reading level is much lower than the average 13yo, and I am concerned that the parent has taught their child to not answer questions related to schooling when others ask. The parent has created an aversion to formal schooling because “there are bullies at school”.

Other things of concern to me are that this child seems to lack basic understandings if just interacting with people in general. I came to realize in this situation that they do not leave the house for days at a time or perhaps even longer. 
Examples: not understanding basic interactions when ordering food, not having a grasp on personal space, or understanding to be quiet and listen while others are talking. Etc

Lastly, some other behaviors that I noticed .. they only want to be wearing sweat pants or some kind of elastic band and they pull up their pants to essentially their tits.. they’re obsessed with video games only. The only thing this child would even mention or hold a decent conversation about for their entire visit were video games and sonic the hedgehog. (Yes, for a 13yo that is not uncommon, but the extent that this is happing in this specific case is worrisome) 

Another detail: the parents have money. Enough to get themselves things like, new vehicles, a 3D printer, new video games and consoles as they come out, virtual reality set ups, endless hoards of tech gadgets, and craft supplies (crocheting mostly). I don’t see why some of that time and money can’t be spent to at least get this child a tutor.

Please help! What can I do? My fear is to step in, and have an outcome happen that will our the child in an undesirable situation such as being forced into a public school or the parent being in legal trouble. 
I genuinely don’t think this child could handle being out into a public school setting in their current condition. I think it’d be helpful to have the child checked out by a Dr. to see if they fall anywhere on the spectrum. 
Any advise is greatly appreciated!
I realize that this is all over the place there might need to be more details added.
Thank you in advance!

Example: her blood sugar drastically falls and she becomes hypoglycemic and needs to be hospitalized = not covered since its a direct result of her having diabetes. 
I know other things can go wrong. But if they decide that future complications fall under her pre insurance conditions I wouldn't be covered. I simply just dont know if I should have it for emergencies, but if she had an emergency it would most likely be related to her pre insurance conditions.

Then she started drinking to cope with her depression. She started mixing alcohol with her anxiety medications and blacking out. Last year she was arrested for drunk driving, and earlier this year for public drunkenness (though that was really the cop letting her off easy, she could have possibly been charged with another DUI).

However, I’ve found that I’m not completely satisfied with her as someone who is just nice and supportive. The issue is that I find her to be (and I hate to say this) incredibly just boring sometimes. Our senses of humor don’t always align, and she is super quick to get “triggered” or offended by things that people say which i find to be important and funny. Sometimes it feels like social justice is her entire personality, and i’m just not compelled by it. She’s also friends with my three roommates- all of whom are guys- (I’m a girl, 19)- and they feel pretty similarly about her. It’s almost like she feels that she’s morally superior to everyone, and even if it doesn’t come out all the time, it still shows itself occasionally. She often just seems super socially and realistically out of touch. She’ll do things like come over, and asked my roommate if they want to do yoga. When he says no she’ll get all sad and kind of offended, until he feels guilty and decides to do yoga with her. How lame. My roommate also went on a trip to China, and before he went she wanted to sit him down and force him to listen to a powerpoint presentation she had made on the history of China’s violence towards Tibet. (She’s Tibetan.) She made him listen to this while we were all hanging out and drinking. He left halfway, but she still subjected my friend and I, who had nothing to do with this, to the rest. Super condescending and out of touch if u ask me. She often just seems super socially and realistically out of touch. Or my  friend- who works three days a week at a pool. She said to her the other day- “Oh Chris, I feel so bad- you have to work so much, you must be so exhausted!” And Chris responded to her that no, three days a week is not a lot to be working and basically that she needs to get a grip on reality. My roommates and I live Relatively close to the school that we all attend, while she lives about a 50 minute commute away. Therefore, she is often asking to spend the night-which usually entails sleeping in my bed, even though she had sex with my roommate and could easily sleep with him, or more realistically, just on the couch!  She even asked if she could get a key to the apartment. I want my space and don’t want to have her sleep over, honestly ever. honestly, I just find her and her friends to be quite boring, and often quite annoying and out of touch and not at all funny. she hasn’t done anything particularly bad to wrong me, or to warrant me just ending the friendship. so here I am, she’s been hitting me up for the past two weeks and I’ve been flaking on her. Now we’re supposed to hang out today, but only because I feel super guilty and now I have potential plans which I would be more interested in with someone else. She hasn’t really done anything crazy wrong but honestly I’m just not wanting to spend time with her anymore. What should I do to end this in a way that doesn’t hurt anyone too much? Keep in mind that we’ve been incredibly close for the past year, and that her family has done a lot for me.",08Mar2019,3
376,"Hi guys, first post here.

I have always had depressive tendencies (now 23) but it was really bad when I was 18-20. I have been able to get through them, and with discipline, health and hobbies have stopped myself from slipping back into these negative patterns.

Recently I have had a drug screening for a job- I don’t smoke much, but was on vacation before I knew of this and had about 3-4 hits as a one off thing 12 days before the test. I went on a a crazy detox and should pass (passed all at home drug tests kits no problem.) 

However, I find due to my neurotic nature I have been researching non stop, and whilst I wait on the results I am finding myself slipping back into old patterns.

I have trouble waking up. I have no goal for my days, since my detox is over. I am just waiting for the results, whilst my days have no meaning.

Even now (I used to wake up latest 6 30 a.m. every day) I am still in bed at 10:30.

Any advice? ",08Mar2019,4

i dont think im a ""asshole"" or ""dickhead"" but i can be when they decide to disturb me but its only fair isnt it? , 
recently i blocked my classmate on instagram because he kept spreading what i posted which obviously i didnt want info to spread because i would be made fun of and now after blocking him he got angry and stopped talking to me but honestly its kind of childish in a way just because i blocked u for personal reasons and such etc.

380,"A little backstory, my boyfriends brother got his girlfriend pregnant. They have been dating a while and in their twenties so it's not a situation of babies having babies.... but, the girlfriend has not made the best impression on the family and is not well liked. My boyfriend and I have had our own problems with her and it's known throughout the family that I am not her biggest fan. I've been civil and nice when I see her (holidays) and we try to limit the time we are around her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, my boyfriends sister texted me and asks if i'll be on the ""team"" to plan her baby shower. I said yes, to avoid any drama within the family and I really do not want to piss off my boyfriends mother and sister. My boyfriend said to take it as a compliment since I am very organized and crafty at times. Well, it occurred to me that these things cost money.... So I start panicking thinking crap are they expecting me to pay for half??? This year isn't a great year financially for me and I owe on taxes so really, I cannot swing it. Especially for a person who I do not particularly like or for someone who I know would not return the favor when my boyfriend and I have children. So I text his little sister (his mom's phone is broken) and explain as nicely as possible that I cannot swing it and I just wanted to know what their expectations were from me. She said ""I'll talk to my mom to see how we're handling the money part"". Basically what I'm asking is, how do I stay firm in my decision to not pay for this? I tend to be a pushover, and I don't want to find myself being cornered into something I can't afford. I also do not want to cause any issues with my future inlaws. My boyfriend and I have been dating for five years and I don't want to cause any stress for him or myself. I do not think its expected of me to pay for someone's baby shower who I do not have the best relationship with. ",08Mar2019,1
381,"I am a 21 year old college student who still lives with my parents and I am tired of putting up with them. My dad (and to a lesser extent, my mom) talk down to me, a grown man, like I'm 10 years old. 

There was an incident at Disney World where we were standing at a restaurant waiting for our table, some other family gets called in and leaves a bench empty. I was tired of standing so I waited for someone to take the bench, nobody does, and so I decide to take my brother and go sit in it. I tell my dad that I'm going to sit down and he says ""Oh no you ain't. Let the women sit down first."" First of all, I don't agree with the notion that the women get to have a seat ahead of the men. The only people I let sit down before me are the pregnant, the elderly, and the disabled. Second, I couldn't believe he talked to me like that. I felt humiliated. Here I was, a grown-ass man being talked down to by his father like he's 10. He let me sit down after I pointed out that there was nobody near the seats and I waited for someone to take them, but by the time I sat down, I was fuming.

Another incident that happened when I was 20 was when I accidentally said ""damn"" in front of my parents while handling a hot roll. He then lectured me about how I need to ""clean up my vocabulary"" and other shit. I just want to add that I never swear around authority figures and only either swear with friends or when I'm alone. That time was when a ""damn"" happened to slip out.

Needless to say, I'm fed up with him treating me like this. I know that he's only trying to raise me right but I feel like he's forgotten that I'm now a grown man who can make my own decisions. What should I do?

TL;DR: Dad scolds me like a child. Not a child anymore.",08Mar2019,1
382,"I'm 28, and I've spent the last five years just slugging along in turmoil. I made what I now realize were a lot of terrible decisions when I was 18-20 in terms of college, and I ended up graduating with a bad degree in a field that I wasn't really interested in because I was so paralyzed by taking on debt. It's a long story, but due to the way credits transferred from community college to the state university I went to, I would have had to spend an additional 4 years doing what I did well rather than 2, which would have been another $10k. Almost immediately after I changed my major, I felt doomed, but I stayed with my decision anyway. I knew I wasn't going anywhere I wanted to be and lost all my confidence.

I've just been stuck unable to do anything for five years
but let my dad control my life. I've been working at his company doing an absolutely awful job making $20k a year, with no possibilities for any advancement. I completely let myself go due to depression, to the point where I don't care about my appearance, don't talk to anyone, and don't do anything in my spare time but sleep. I'm too ashamed of my confusion and uncertainty future to have any interpersonal relationships at all, be they with friends or family. I think about suicide daily.

I know to many people it wouldn't be so bad to have a life like this, especially if you have a partner to split the bills with. I realized that what I need in life is success and a career that uses my strengths rather than playing to my weaknesses. I'm a researcher by nature, and I would be happy doing that for $0...in fact, I already do so in times when my depression isn't so bad.

I think the most obvious solution for me is to go back to college. To get into the field I want to be in, I would need around 2-3 years to get a bachelor's degree, then go to graduate school. And that's if I get accepted and get funding for it considering I already have a bachelor's degree. The field is in demand right now and has a good average salary and employment rates, but one has to get there first.

As much as I would love to just live in a shack somewhere and not worry about money, it's always my greatest obstacle in anything I want to do.

Any advice is greatly appreciated. This situation is literally killing me.",08Mar2019,2

&amp;#x200B;

I have a professor this semester who is doing something I've never heard of before. after everyone takes their exam in the classroom then, if they have good enough attendance, they take it again as a 4 person group. Then your grade is averaged with the group so you get extra points. But you only get those points if you made at least a 60% on the individual assignment.

&amp;#x200B;

I have perfect attendance. On our 1st exam, I listened to my professor's advice and took my exam in the classroom so I could also take it in a group for the extra points. It was impossible for me to focus and I didn't have enough time, ect. I obviously needed my accommodations so I preformed very poorly. I ended up making a 47% on my individual exam so I didn't get the group grade bonus AND I didn't get my accommodations.

This might sound silly but, does this count as discrimination? Because no matter what choice I make, all the students without disabilities have an unfair advantage.

393,"I'm 22F and lately I've started to get jealous, even resent, how rich my friends are and how decent their life is.   


I went to college in a top university in my country, which was filled with rich to upper middle-class people, and that naturally meant my friends were on that class, too. I was only lucky to be there because of a scholarship and my mom's hard work. I had to work side jobs just to secretly pay for my tuition and other expenses without my mom knowing. Before, the difference in financial status was never that obvious to me before and didn't bother me at all when I was studying.  


But now that we've all graduated and doing other stuff, it's just starting to show how much poorer I am than them that it's kind of getting me down. Like, they go on so many trips and have multiple vacations a year with their parents paying for it as celebration or like how some of them can just go to grad school right away because their parents are paying anyway. Some of them even have like their parents giving them allowances even after college and all that.  


Right now, I'm not really in a good place financially... I mean I freelance, and it pays relatively higher than many people here considering where I'm from. But despite this, I don't really get to reap the benefits of the pay because a lot of it goes  somewhere else.   


I still live with my mom because rent is expensive but mostly because I don't just wanna leave her alone cus she's really old yknow. Her only 'job' is selling at a weekend market, and that's mostly just enough to pay utilities and food for me and my sister and niece living here. So quite a few times, my money goes to helping pay for food or bills or if she needs more money to get more stuff for the market. Sometimes when we need stuff around the house fixed, I give some of my money too. Not to say that I blame her for draining my money and all, but sometimes it gets really hard and frustrating for me that almost nothing is left for me. What little is left of my money, I just save rather then use it on hobbies and stuff because you never know when you need it yknow.  


My friends all live with their parents too, but they don't deal with the same problems of having to claw your way out of being poor. I know its wrong for me to think, and I try REALLY hard not to be jealous, but it's so hard! The stress of being poor has been causing me so much anxiety over the years, and now the more I try to rational the more spiteful I become.   I just start to remember all those breakdowns I secretly had in campus when my grades would go lower than 3.0 because that meant I could possibly lose my scholarship, and all these times where we had to live with no water or electricity from weeks to months. 

&amp;#x200B;

REcently, the only thing that comes to my mind when my friends tell me about their trips and new stuff or whatever is that ugghhh they never had to put up with the crap I had to go through and probably never will. Lately, I've kinda just holed myself at home and don't talk to people that much because I feel that they won't get it if I tell them my problems. I can't bring myself to do anything beside work, gym, and maybe play games or read fanfic. Sometimes I can't even do the latter two because I somehow end up thinking 'your friends are out there having fun or learning new skills, and you're just at home playing games still'.  


Sorry this is really long now, so I guess I'll stop here. Basically, how do I stop feeling this intense amount of jealousy? Because I really do want to be happy for them and start being chatty again but seeing every development or highlight in their lives makes me feel depressed... Some days I just feel like giving up because if I'm not getting any less poor then what's the point even.

I am 26F and for the first time in my life (about a week ago I'd say), I agreed to go on a date tonight with a guy I met on a dating app (we're going to a comedy show and then maybe to a bar to grab drinks).  I hate sounding like a teenage girl while I'm an adult. But I usually don't get much attention from guys when it comes to dating irl. Even with apps, I always had this weird mental thing where I'd download, feel really insecure, and then just delete a few moments later. 

This is the first time I actually kept the app and have been doing okay on it, to my utter surprise. I have a solid amount of pics on it, all from a few months ago (even used all pics with minimal to zero makeup just to reallly drive in what I look like). But I'm so scared they'll be unattracted to me when we meet up tonight (maybe the lighting was too good in the pics). That or we'll have no connection, or I'll try too hard to sound interesting or fun (I'm not the most boring person but by far not the most interesting either). 

Also, there's this strangeness I think about with dating apps. When people meet up, maybe you're meeting up with someone who you'd never make acquaintances in real life (intentionally avoid them even). I know that's the point of it-- to see what happens and then try again with someone new.

399,"I'm currently working a job that I have been for the past four years. It's a small business ran by a couple. 

I get along amazingly with the wife. She is my direct boss. I am proud of what I have accomplished here and earlier this year, she asked me to 'take on a bigger role', which I have tried to take to heart and I've really tried to step it up, come up with ideas, and take a bigger role in the company. 


Her husband and I do not get along. I try to be polite with him but every time I need help, or I am looking for advice, I am spoken down to like I am an idiot. He openly mocks my skill set, openly mocking my bi-lingual language skills, openly mocking my tastes and comforts....

While I have no formal training on working with computers, I can fix most problems with a little googling. He came in one day and yelled at me for hours about having the virus scanner off. I had turned it off because we use cracked programs in the office and it flagged a critical file as a potential problem and kept quarantining it. Instead, he claimed the reason the program wasn't working was because I have too many emails. I was asked to work from a laptop for the rest of the day so he could 'fix' my pc that was 'now riddled with viruses'. 


Then this situation this week - he needed to install something on my PC and got a static shock when he sat down. He went into a rage, screaming and raving that it must be the computer chair I had budgeted for, that I was going to fry my work pc. His wife came in and tried to calm the situation, but told me to leave the office for the day. The next morning, she called me before working hours and told me to just get my old chair from the garage and start using that again as not to start another fight. I asked for a new chair because I work from it for 7+ hours a day and needed better back support. Her husband received a static shock because of the extremely dry heat, plus his clothes on a fabric chair, in the office. A solution for this was a humidifier. I can pick one up on the way in this morning. She refused, and told me just to go back to my old arrangements. I told her I would not be coming in that day then. 


I cooled off and told the wife I wanted a meeting. I was hurt my personal comfort was being cast aside. She told me she wanted to fix this 'toxic relationship', but that her husband was not going to change the way he spoke or interacted with me and that I should respect his experience. I explained that, while I have respect for what he knows, I'm tired of being treated like an idiot. She said, why don't we try working on a friendlier relationship instead. Let's have dinner in a few weeks when my husband is back from a business trip.


I said I wanted space to think about that, because it felt like a non-answer. She responded, that this is a job and not a hobby, and I cannot 'choose my own hours' like that. 


I'm at my end. I no longer want to step up and 'do more' at the office if at the slightest breeze, her husband will undo it all.

Also when I only got a pub job myself without asking for her help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her.

I’m in a really desperate situation and I don’t want to burden my parents who are going through the toughest time and I don’t have time to work more shifts because I need to focus on school as the primary goal of all this money stuff is for my college.

Is selling my pictures/videos (nudes) a good idea even though I’m not experienced? Is there any other way to make money really? Please help I have 1 year to earn as much as possible in case my scholarship applications don’t work out. 

I’m not asking for donations or anything I want to make my own money. 

Thank you for taking time to read my post! ",08Mar2019,6
404,"Yesterday, I had an interview at a local grocery store, and they were looking for cashiers. In my anxious haste, I almost show up late due to a missed turn. In spite of this, I get there and the interview went smoothly; I get to start Monday. However, since this is my first job, I'm not sure how it will go. I'm also a new driver, so I'm also worried about showing up late since I'm still gathering my bearings. Any ideas of how I can conquer my fear(s)?",08Mar2019,1
405,"I don't know what to do.

  


I'm a graduating college student who's always barely passing my grades. I always run late in my classes. I always study just hours before a long test. Right now, I'm studying for a test later that will determine whether I'll graduate or not - I'm way behind on finishing it (haha).

  


It has always been like this ever since I started college. No, it has always been like this ever since I started schooling. I was worse before college - I didn't study shit but I also wasn't someone who's slow to pick-up on a topic. Heck, I was even part of the ""science section"" because I did good on the high school entrance exam.

  


Going back to the present. I laze around for days and then cram everything into my brain the coverage of the exam in one day. I have tried sitting by my study table days before an exam but I always end up touching my phone or even doodling on my reviewer. I'm tired of this shit repeating every single week. Sometimes, when I can't cram the whole exam coverage, I punch myself out of hatred, attempt to strangle myself and cry out of disappointment.

  


I even self-diagnose myself as a young adult with ADHD and tried applying the little research that I found on tips to remove the habit (I know it's bad to self-diagnose).

  


Maybe there's no advice for this? I don't know... Please help me. I'm also going to med school this year (I know, bad idea). I'm stressed out right now. Why am I even writing this?",08Mar2019,3

415,"I work at a production plant as an office worker. I communicate with truck drivers all day, telling them which dock to go to, setting appointments, etc. I am a younger female and it shows in my voice so occasionally I will have drivers try and keep me on the phone for conversation, ask the warehousemen where I am to meet me (they don’t tell them) and other things similar to that. 

The company’s receptionist is in our main office and she has the worst social awareness of anyone I have ever met. She will keep conversations going despite every social cue in the book that it needs to end. She will continue to talk even after you walk away. She is old and hard headed and not pleasant to interact with. 

So these two things came together today. A driver walks into the front office while his truck is getting loaded wanting to meet me and say hi. I don’t work in the front office so instead of telling him that she calls me. She says there is a driver here that wants to say hi to me and meet me. I tell her to just tell him I don’t work in the front office. She asks if I want to say hi. I told her no, just say that I’m sorry but I don’t work up there. It’s a drawn out conversation that I know would be awkward to listen to as the driver up there waiting. 

Eventually she gets annoyed with me trying to tell her to politely turn him away and just interrupts me and says, “here you say hi to him” and just hands the phone over. He apologizes to me for taking up my time (because I’m sure he got the hint from the conversation he heard) and just thought he would pop in and say hi while he was getting loaded. I apologized and said that I don’t work in that office and hang up. It was a very uncomfortable situation all around that I thought was handled so poorly and unprofessionally by the receptionist. 

My boyfriend  and best friend say I should send an email to HR explaining what happened so that HR could talk to her about it instead of me going to her directly because she probably won’t listen to me anyway. I feel like I’m stuck because I interact with her daily and don’t want bad blood with her. Is it really an HR situation? I really don’t know what to do here but I felt so uncomfortable during the whole thing. 

Also a side note. My grandpa is the VP of this company and I don’t want people to feel like I’m trying to get special treatment or being a princess by complaining about these things. It’s just a weird situation for me that I’ve never been in. Any advice is appreciated.",08Mar2019,1

I always drop my courses before the end of the drop period so my parents get refunded but they’re asking me to get my transcripts from my school and I don’t want them to see I’ve really just been neglecting the academic side of my life. I guess I just don’t feel as if going to college is the right fit for what I should be doing right now but I know my parents would be downright ashamed for a long time if I straight up drop out and work work work. School just doesn’t click and they won’t understand and I’m terrified of hurting them with this information. What can I do or what have any of you done to minimize disappointment in a situation like this?

Last night, I had wanted to borrow his phone to look something up (he was using mine to talk to my brother) and he spent about 3 minutes going through his phone (presumably deleting things and closing browser windows) before he passed the phone to me with the page I’d said I was going to access already loaded.
Less recently, about 1-2 months ago, I had noticed another lewd photo of a young woman on his phone. Often, whenever I approach him, I see him turn the screen off on his phone.
My dad and I are very close (closer than myself and my mom) and I’m not sure what to do. I know this is a really delicate situation and don’t want to do something that could blow everything up, but I also feel as though my mom should know if he’s being unfaithful.

I live in a very heavily populated community. Except for the dark lit areas due to street lights still not being placed, it is generally safe and there are lots of families and kids that live about. I, alongside a good majority of the community, can be found going for walks around the area anywhere from as early as sunrise to as late as midnight.

A month ago while I was walking a heavily tinted car slows down in front of my path, blocking my way and honks at me. I was just on my way back home from an evening stroll and to reach my home I must pass through the dark lit areas, granted it is only 2 minutes away. 

I was surprised by the drivers audacity since I had just left the well lit area and it was a busy night so lots of cars were passing by as well as people. I took out my phone and made it clear I was gonna snap a picture of their license plate. They saw that and bolted.

I had not seen the car until a week ago. I was walking and again, the car gets off the main road and parks onto the side road where I am walking. I feel uncomfortable this time because there are less people and take out my phone and begin to actively record. I try to detour from my house as well so the driver does not see and then pretend I am on the phone making a call. The driver does not pursue.

I am worried. I do not believe this person is from this area and begin to suspect children are also targets. I am not sure how to proceed.

I t really don't this whole dating thing and I've never fell for someone as hard as i feel for her.

 So i thought since she also looks at me then she might be interested so i went ahead and tried to follow her and add her on social media,  where she ignored me no decline nothing..

But then when we meet she still does the whole stare thing.  I personally want to get over the whole thing but she always comes to my head and i wanna know why she keeps staring at me and telling her friends about me if she isn't interested, also keep in mind this has been going on for 2 semesters so for quite  a while we even took a 2 month break came back and all she was doing was still staring..

439," 

So… my mom always had issues with anxiety… and 2 weeks ago my alcoholic grandma attempted suicide… my mother almost broke… she worried every single day about what happened and what will be once grandma will leave the ward. She cried every day…

She had enough… she visited her doctor and told him that she needs to work and function and she cant function while being super anxious all the time. She vomited every day from the stress around the grandma situation. Doctor gave her 0,25mg Xanax to take 4 times a day… i know 0,25mg is a small dose but im scared to death now…

Can anyone tell my how dangerous that dosage is ? Will she get addicted ? Will she do risky things ?

Im mostly afraid that she will build tolerance and start doing higher doses…

I have no experience with Xanax…

 mom told me she only takes half a pill 4 times a day… so its not 1mg a day but 0,5 mg a day… i still idk how big a dose that is",08Mar2019,5
440,"I don't know how else to put it or where else to go. I've been in a lot of bad situations with people and I'm tired of being screamed at or taken advantage of or cheated on or everything else.

I'm 100% an introvert, so every time I try to force myself to talk to new people it comes across super fake and awkward and, well, forced.

Plus the only people I find myself attracted to are people who bear a resemblance to my abusive ex. A relationship which ended years ago.

I don't know what to do. I'm at college and high school was miserable and college is too. I've tried to join so many clubs but at the end of the day the only thing I want is someone to hold at night and to take care of but you can't just be honest with people and tell them that so you have to pretend you give a shit about whatever activity you're currently doing.

I've never had a good experience with online dating or apps so unfortunately I know that'll lead nowhere.

Even as my last ex was leaving me for another man she was telling me how wonderful I was and I was making her laugh, so I know my relationship abilities are not at fault here.

441,"So I am 16M but will be 17 when said concert happens. Four of my other friends and I have been excited to go to this concert for months now and I have mentioned this many times to my parents (respectfully of course). These will be tickets that I will be paying for. There is one problem, though. The closest location is 2 hours away in Massachusetts, making it a pain to drive. Our plans were to carpool there as we will have two of us that are legal to drive friends by that point. My parents are strict about me not breaking laws in regard to driving so I frequently sacrifice outings with friends and make situations a little more complicated so I don’t break the law. However, despite being legal, my parents do not feel comfortable with either me or my friends driving to this concert and I recognize there is not much I can do to change this. I’m feeling frustrated because like I said my friends and I will be 17 and 18 by this point and I am feeling like I still need a chauffeur despite being one year away from living on my own. How do I deal with the feelings that my parents are being overprotective?",08Mar2019,1
442,"Without going in to too much back-story and detail, I have been severely mentally and emotionally abused by my mother my entire life. I think she has an undiagnosed mental illness herself, because she'll go from super loving to satanic screaming and insults within minutes. Moving away from home to university at 18 was the best choice I have ever made because I truly think it saved my life. (It's been about 4 years since then and I still live about 9 hours away).   


However - my mother is still trying to be a part of my life. It's been difficult because many times she chooses to call me she is in 'super loving' mindset and it lulls me into this false sense of security that maybe things will be different, maybe she's outgrown whatever had been happening, maybe this time it's going to be different. But the second things start getting good and I start feeling comfortable, she 180 flips and the abuse comes back as if not a single day has passed.  


The one thing that has kept me around after everything is the absolute feeling of *guilt* of leaving her on her own. By this I mean that she and her mother have a terrible relationship that plagues her every day, and she cries and talks constantly about how mistreated she's been by her mother and how much she doesn't want her family to fall apart. I know she's hurting, and I see it every time we talk, but it is beyond unfair that I have to hurt too because of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

My psychologist has told me I have to cut her off - it was less a request and more of a command. My friends have told me I need to block her calls, and delete her off Facebook. She doesn't financially support me in any way, so I don't have to worry about the impact it will have on me in that sense - but I am (after everything she's done) worried about the effect it will have on *her.* Because, I don't know, I don't think she really knows what she's done to my life and my mental health. I don't think she has a grasp of reality in that sense. I think, if I were to just end all contact without any explanation, she'll concoct all of her own horrible theories about what happened. I'm worried she'll end up attempting to reach out even *more* to reconcile (which, after my many attempts of this, I now know is impossible).  


So my question is: do I tell her *why* I am blocking her and removing all contact? Do I just block her without saying anything?",08Mar2019,3

448,"About a month ago I was laid off (cost cutting). I've been looking for my next opportunity since then, and have a bunch of great ones at the offer stage. One important point of context... I live over an hour from a major city where many of these jobs are available. If I sign on to one of those, I'm back to over 3 hours of commuting per day.

One other piece of context... my biggest meta-priority right now is to retire early so my wife and I can stop ""working for the man"". We are already well on our way to doing so in terms of budget and investments.

This is where the fun begins...

*Offer 1:* Working for a company that wants to pay me over $200k/year salary, plus bonus/401k/etc. It's in the same industry I have been working in. Lots of perks, long-ish hours, and the commute. At that pay, my wife and I can retire in 5 years by our early/mid-40s.

*Offer 2:* Working for about half the salary as Offer 1, but it's local and will allow me to work from home. Different industry, but one that I worked in the past. It will take longer to retire (late 40s), but I'll have more flexibility to enjoy life in my community with my wife and friends.

So, do I burn 5 good years and earn crazy money or do I slow down and take a glide path in to retirement? Everyone in my life has an opinion on this question, but it basically settles on to ""it's a good problem to have!""

The thing is, I just feel so burnt out now. I've been sitting around here for months in my parent's house not working a job - I got one for a few months but the manager was absolutely horrendous and since he was the only person I'd typically be working with, I quit that one too after holding onto it for as long as I could. I really need to get an income again.

I used to enjoy working with kids (art camps, etc), actually I'm applying to be a substitute teacher now at the school I used to teach after school at, but something in me is just balking at the whole thing.

My single friend is really beautiful but I trust her when it comes to this situation.

So my bf and I been together for 4 years and we live together.

He is known to get drunk and starting to become extra flirty. Which I told him that’s why I don’t like him around my friends.

My friend was on the other side of the table and said to us “I’m lonely over here guys” because she was a 5th wheel. I got up to go over to her but guess who got up before me... my boyfriend so we both go over and sit on top of her just messing around. What bothered me is if I didn’t get up he would’ve went over there with her without a 2nd thought. He even bought her a drink. He sat on her lap on time, then he tickled her and I was just trying to play it cool since we were under the influence, plus like I said I trusted my friend that she wouldn’t go that far with my own boyfriend.

He was like staring at her all weird last night. Just giving her the kind of attention you shouldn’t when your girlfriend is around. Like he was just all about her, you know.

She didn’t think about it like that and invited all of us over her house like she normally does when it’s just us girls. So we go over her house and things were fine I guess.

But I don’t want to bring this time up but about half a year ago, last time we got drunk with one of my girlfriends, he slapped my friends ass.

We are both 22 and like I don’t know how to feel about this, we are already in a rough patch of our relationship. I haven’t got to talk to him today because he went to work early this morning.

I just want to be with a guy no matter how drunk he is, he doesn’t knock down his boundaries of our relationship. Plus what if he flirted with the wrong girl that actually liked him back you know... I’m just torn about being with him anymore. I understand we’ve been together since we were 17 so he lacked in his experiences as being a young man but like I don’t want this in my life forever.

454,"Throwaway account for reasons that should be clear once you've had a chance to read through.

I'll preface by saying that I recently got married and couldn't be happier, and I've never been unfaithful during any of my relationships.

I have been working as a consultant on a project that required constant travel, but I'm about to roll off said project. There's a woman who works for the same consulting company who was also on the project, and I got the sense that she may have been flirting with me on a regular basis. Notably, I caught her making extended eye contact during meetings that we attended together, she would often sit next to or near me during meetings, and there were cases during social events where she made repeated bodily contact (like brushing against me or using her feet to touch my legs/feet under the table).

This woman is in a relationship and knows that I'm married. When the news broke that I would be departing the project, she arranged the going-away event and sat next to me the whole time, frequently making bodily contact. At the end of the event, she initiated a hug. I had previously been paying attention and did not notice her being that touchy-feely with anyone else.

All of this can be seen as moot since I will no longer be on the project, but I have been trying to decipher what her intent was given the circumstances. Was it simply a desire for friendship, or something more? I found it confusing and haven't really experienced anything like it before, which is why I'm requesting advice/opinions.

I'm a strong believer in the notion of not defecating where you eat, especially since I've gone down that path in the past and learned from the experience. Having said that, I had to beat back urges and thoughts of pursuing what I perceived to be a romantic interest. Thanks to my will power, belief in monogamy, and loyalty, I was able to do so.

Is this a normal/frequent experience once you're married? My thought is that it's a component of human nature and sometimes there is a magnetism between certain people.",08Mar2019,2

This is only the case for trios, I don’t have this kind of problem if I’m in a duo or groups that contain more than three people. 

The very first failed trio in my life happened when was in kindergarten (funny right?). I don’t even remember what led to the falling apart, I think it was a disagreement among me and one of the member (it was a two girls and a guy trio, the three of us were very close and I’m a girl). In my defense, we were really young back then and I don’t think any of us knew how to truly deal with relationships. Yet, It should’ve be a sign for me that I’m just not suited for trios. I have about three more failed trios (at various stages of my life) after that and I’m wasn’t paying attention to them until I took a social psych class in uni. 

In the textbook it states that a trio is the most unstable form of group, then it hit me. I think back to all of my past trios and there it was, I have never had a successful trios in my 20 years of life. It all started out great, but soon they all became bitter and miserable (for me anyway) and I feel suffocated for just thinking about it.

462,"Tl;dr : girlfriend is very sexual in every way and often initiates contact. And reasons on why she doesn't want to go all the way? And advice for me?

Im a junior in highschool and so is my girlfriend (both virgins). We are both above the age of consent in our state. We have been dating for a little over 3 months and, albeit a little rocky at first, our relationship is good. We have done everything sexual except actual sex. She told me she loves me, which is not something she expected to tell me so early, and I do love her too. 

Every time we fool around we are both completely naked and do everything (oral, hand stuff) to eachother. On certain days she ends up on top of me grinding on my dick or we will make out in a missionary type position so that it presses up against her labia. One time I was behind her rubbing it against her and put my finger in. She gasped and said too deep, as she thought it was my other appendage.

She gets super horny when I talk about us doing things, and she loved it when i sent her a paragraph talking about us having sex. Almost to the point where it seems that she wants to do it.

I don't want to rush her, and I'm willing to wait for it, but I would like to know why. I wouldnt ask her this question, because I don't want to make her feel pressured, or like thats all I care about.

We worked on similar things so we spent a decent amount of time together, sometimes out of obligation, but increasingly because we just enjoyed each other’s company a lot. I really don’t think I’ve ever clicked with someone so fast, so well. 

He initiated what I perceived as flirting at the time. A lot of lingering stares, a little touching, a lot of compliments, questions about my personal life and future plans, giving me his number, a few innuendo-esque jokes and comments. Classic signs, but I guess I realize now that they’re by no means foolproof. He never made a move, and neither did I. 

After a while, I came to know that he had a long distance girlfriend who also goes to our university, but was taking a year off to work/spend time with her family overseas. He never mentioned her to me. I found out through a friend of his who approached me after seeing how close we had become. 

I backed off at that point, but he didn’t seem to change his behavior. And a few weeks before her return, he got drunk and told me that he really cared about me. I didn’t know what he meant, and still don’t. As a friend? As something else? I’ll never know, and don’t want to know.

Anyway, she’s returned, but I still see him all the time. He’s still playful and kind. He still texts little pickmeups and inside jokes of ours. And it hurts a little. He owes me nothing, and I never wanted to mess with someone in a relationship at all. I can see now that all he wanted was a friend, but I was dumb enough to think he wanted more.

We ended up seeing this group of kids who goes to our school. We weren't necessarily friends with each other but we were cool enough to be in the presence of each other. Now, my group didn't necessarily want them with us but we weren't necessarily in the mindset to tell a group of kids we knew we didn't want them with us, so we allowed them to hang out. The day goes on and we are about to take our stuff. When one of the kids says he has never done any drugs before other than weed. I had diluted my molly into water so it was easier to take and he seemed to have interest in it. I told him no because i only had enough to split with my friend and I. He kept asking and i allowed him to take a SIP. (For those that dont know about molly, he never would have felt anything from this sip) So, the day goes on and my whole group is either tripping sack or rolling very hard. The kid who had taken a sip Placebo Effect'ed himself and starting mimicking all of our behavior to, what i would assume, was to fit in. I tried my best while rolling pretty hard to explain to him that just because we do drugs doesn't me he has to and that he would probably not have felt anything from that sip. To which he responds ""No bro i can definitely feel it"" My group spent the rest of the night enjoying ourselves and letting the kid act how he wanted.

472,"TL;DR at the end. I'm a physics student about to finish my studies. I don't know whether I want to do a PhD (my family is very unsupportive and although my grades are okay, it is unlikely that I would get funding at a top university. Plus there is also the boyfriend/current LDR factor that I take into consideration). 

In the meantime, I keep doing internships at some big companies. They are hardly related to what I studied per se, but this is where graduates who don't choose academia usually end up anyway. They are well-payed and people working there seem happy. 

It's just that, as an intern, I either beg them to give me stuff to do, or I carry their notebooks and clean up the conference room after a meeting. On the other hand, I spend a lot of time with people working there and I don't understand how they can beat around the bush for 5 hours working on a small project, or keep staying at work on Friday evenings, just chatting with each other, when there is literally nothing left to do. Their job is everything they talk about, but when I'm asking them for help or for information (even when it's something like ""at what time is the meeting?"") they completely ignore my emails.

I can't imagine myself doing this for the next 40 years. Is every job like this? Should I change my mentality? Should I keep searching? Do you people love your jobs?

TL;DR: about to finish studying Physics, doing a bunch of internships where don't do anything or I clean up after my managers, who seem to love their job so much that it's everything they do, even when there's nothing to do.",08Mar2019,1
474,"This is on a throwaway because I live in a large county with very respectable school systems, know a lot of people work-wise, and really just need anonymous advice.  

I’m a full time education major and I substitute elementary school part time in my county.  I got a call yesterday asking to come into the pre-k class at an elementary school near me.  I agreed, but I found out later that night by googling the teachers name that it was a special ed class.  I was nervous because I felt unprepared, but I was ok with this as I had been in a special ed class before and I love the pre-k age.  The day was going great, the kids were really sweet and easy to manage compared to what I was used too in full size classrooms.  There was an assistant there and a teacher for the PM pre-k class, which overlapped with my AM class, so they were in there with me. 

(Note* The boy in this story is about 4-5, autistic, cant speak or communicate fully in any other way, and was VERY sick today.  Runny nose constantly, coughing, sneezing, etc.)

I went and got lunch (a cheese pizza. carrots, and fruit) from the cafeteria for one of the preschool boys who is autistic.  I brought it back and was cut it up for him, then while he was trying to hold the fork his elbow hit the tray and it flipped landing backwards onto the floor.  The cheese pizza was flat on the floor cut up into pieces and the carrots/fruit were scattered around too on the floor.  The boy immediately started crying and went to the corner of the room, I felt awful and tried to comfort him for a moment before I cleaned up.  As I started to pick everything up with paper towels the assistant teacher said to me, “just put it back on the plate.”, and I answered, “why, he’s not going to eat it or anything so?”.  She rolled her eyes a bit at me and asked again to put it back on the tray for him to eat.  I refused to do this.  The gooey cheese pizza was flat cheese side on the floor and his veggies were everywhere- and this classroom is no where near clean enough to even eat off a table.  

Without even thinking I got up to tell the two PM teachers I was going to go buy him another lunch myself in the cafeteria, but before I could even clean the mess up the main PM teacher took him and shoved him outside in 30 degree SNOWING weather and told me to get my jacket on and go.  I did what she said but I didn’t expect her to shut the door on us outside with no playground, toys, or anything for him to do.  He laid on the floor most of the time until I’d had enough of watching this poor very sick boy and I banged on the door for it to be opened and took him inside.  He had to leave soon so before I could even think she grabbed him and said i’m going to take him to the entrance (even though he’s not even in her class?) very oddly and suddenly.  It was obvious she didn’t want me to come.  I think she didn’t want me to say anything to his parents.  

My career is on the line here because there’s no anonymous reports in my public school system, and I know so many people here.  I work in an extremely competitive and clique-y school district, and I plan on working here after college because my boyfriend and I’s family is here since we may not be able to live alone right away.  I’ve been looking for the past hour since I got home for a way to anonymously report to the discredit and there is none.  

My boyfriend doesn’t really think I should do anything, but if it were my child I would want to know.  I feel so disgusting from what I witnessed today that I left work early right after the kids left around 12.  Am I over exaggerating?  Is there a way I don’t know to anonymously complain?  What would the process be legally-speaking when you make a complaint to a public school district, is the outcome worth it?",08Mar2019,0

479,"Cross posted to r/raisedbynarcissists

Let me preface this by saying that both my SO and myself are ACoN. Currently we live with his parents,but are saving up to leave the country altogether as four cartels are battling for supremacy and there's been almost 100 murders in 2019 in our city alone. The rest of the country isn't much better. We are also going to our first ever therapy session tomorrow.

We both have FLEAs, but I've watched him struggle and grow and become a better man because of it. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that he loves me. But he is as meek as a mouse. He worries constantly about his family, who thank him by treating him like crap and talking shit about him when he's not there (or even when he is). He is extremely paranoid, and with what's been going on lately in the city I don't know if I can blame him.

Recently I got a new job, one that pays more than his does. He's been extremely nervous to have me out of the house, especially on days when he works and cannot come pick me up at night. He no longer enjoys playing his XBox games. He used to eat a lot but now he hardly eats unless I'm there. He speaks of feeling anxious, sad and empty when I'm not there, and insists that on the days when he can't pick me up I wear baggy clothes, use baseball caps, take a taxi rather than the bus, etc.

I hate this. I hate seeing him so nervous and unhappy. I always wanted to leave Mexico, but since an incident with his father he is even more anxious and has talked far more seriously and frequently about leaving. (Long story short his father started insulting and threatening a woman for no reason, my SO had to step in to diffuse the situation before they both got hurt, and after he talked to his mother and brother about it telling them to talk to his father so he will be more careful, they laughed at him and waited until he left to say he's a ""coward"", a ""pendejo"" and God knows what else.)

How can I help him? What is going on? I don't know how to reassure him. My own mental health has taken a nose dive recently and seeing him like this isn't helping. I'm worried he will fall ill, the way he's stopped eating unless I'm with him and even then it's mostly junk food...Please help... I've tried reassuring him that everything is going to be OK (even though I feel the same way myself at times), telling him how proud I am of him, etc but it doesn't seem to help. 

Just to be clear and avoid some comments I've had before, he's not at all controlling. He will let me go anywhere as long as I go with him or with at least one male friend who he feels can protect me. He's told me he will never interfere with anything I want to do as long as I'm safe. But he kicks up a fuss if I go alone or with a female friend. He'll stop whatever he's doing to accompany me to wherever I need to go. The one time I slipped out of the house to have a good cry, he ran himself sick looking for me until he found me in the old football court and he almost cried when he found me, telling me he thought I'd been kidnapped with everything that's been going on.",08Mar2019,1
480,"I was called in by the executive chairman days ago and was informed that my promotion (made by the managing director to me) will be held back. This is so because some of the board of directors are of the opinion that I’m too harsh/ stern/ vocal/ aggressive/ and too hard on the subordinates. The chairman requests that O should cool it down and take it ‘easy. I’m being to hard on people.

In reality, I have been quite stern/ a bit aggressive to select subordinates when they do not perform and deliver on time as agreed. There has been select incidences where I lost my temper on them. Sometime the subordinates would go for two or more weeks on delay before they complete a task - with constant reminders to boot! What am I supposed to do if they don’t deliver? Be more nice???

Anyway, the executive chairman says he will revisit the promotion review in 3 months time. Do you think this is a better outcome/ fair or is it time to start looking for another job ?

FYI - I’m Currently in an associate level and promised an associate director level promotion.

I honestly don’t know what to feel. I feel there is truth to his feedback but yet a little taken aback.  I think I don’t want to leave this job but would this choice have ramifications to them treating me poorly moving forward? 

 I take pride in my work and enjoy it much and dont want to be taken advantage of either.

Has anyone gone through a similar experience? What do you think of the situation? Please advice.

481,"I'm relying on scholarships, personal out of pocket expenses, and student loans for anything left over. 

I currently work at job in my hometown. It's 30 hours per week, and they're very accommodating for my school schedule. I work 30 hours for the sake of getting health insurance, as well as vacation/sick time. 

The job is really good, and they give me off Tues/Thursdays to attend school all day. So, when I transfer to my university, I would drive down (an hour drive away), and do 3 classes a semester. 

Now, this would be limiting for options, and I would have to pick the classes as fast as possible once registration opens. I would also have to shuffle around courses that I could take based on what's available for that Tuesday and Thursday schedule.

Would it be better to leave my work to find something part time, potentially on campus, and have access to classes all throughout the semester, or would it be better to keep my full time job and finish school at a later date?

For what it's worth, if I were to take 5 classes vs 3 classes a semester, I would save myself a year of schooling, but I would have to take out a greater amount of loans.

Any advice?

People complain about their roommates a lot, mine has made my life a living hell. 

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory: I live in an expensive town (unfortunately it is my hometown so I'd like to stay here) and found myself in a situation where roommates became a smarter decision. I found this couple that was signing a lease at a brand new apartment complex and it was in my price range. I met them, interviewed with them and felt comfortable enough to sign a lease with them. I didn't realize until the day of signing it was a 15 month lease but figured that'd give me enough time to get settled in and save some money for my next place.  
The couple was 24F and 30M, both worked service industry at a successful restaurant and they had a dog who was seemingly taken care of and all was well. They weren't always the best at taking care of their dog which was annoying but overall I couldn't complain because nothing else was really bad. About 2.5 months into my lease the guy cheated on the girl and it set in motion the most messed up series of events I've ever endured. I tried to help because the girl didn't seem to know anyone as she moved to our town to be with him and they seemed to keep to themselves. That night I took her out to help her clear her mind and found out she was an insanely promiscuous person with no shame, I figured she did it because of what had happened but whatever it isn't my place to judge her life choices. After the night out she decided she wanted to work things out with him so for a week or so he slept on the couch and they'd bicker but over all it just seemed like normal relationship on the rocks kind of drama. Then one night the cops woke me up at about 2 am coming into my room saying that they were accusing each other of assault and asked me for witness testimony. I am a super hard sleeper, I honestly had no idea anything was going on until they barged into my room. I told them I barely know them but the guy drinks excessively and he had been drinking that night and the girl was sober to my knowledge. The guy ended up getting arrested and things all got very complicated. She had lost her job during the time he cheated on her (she blamed him but really just threw a hissy fit about going) and he continued to pay for everything at this time even when he wasn't legally allowed at the apartment. She had me convinced he was an abusive manipulator and yet she kept taking him back but I noticed how he'd always leave, etc. One of the nights he left I got a text message from someone claiming to be her mom asking me to check on her because she wasn't stable. I bang on her door, no answer, so when I figured she had left I turned around but saw her keys on the counter and decided to enter her room. I found her on her bed with her wrist slashed and open pill bottles on the floor. I call 911, she gets taken to the hospital and receives a psych eval and they said she was fine after a few days and sent her home. They continue to try to work on their relationship.   
She meets this sugar baby girl at her new job and instantly forms a very toxic relationship with her. She starts going out every night and partying (the guy was not at all about this) and the fighting becomes constant between them. He's never home because of her being insane, the dog isn't getting taken care of because of all of the craziness and at this point I had gotten my own dog and couldn't handle the responsibility of both as mine was very ill when I got her. They stay together through her slashing his tires (1 tire each time on 2 different occasions), her taking his wallet and stealing his car on multiple occasions, her ubering to a bar he was at with friends punching him, stealing his keys and leaving (at least once), her kicking in his windshield in front of his work, her stabbing him, breaking his TV and his computer monitor, etc. At this point I had realized that whenever this girls ""mom"" was texting her boyfriend or I it was actually her using a ghost number. All of this caused me to reach my breaking point one night and just let them both have it and explain that one of them needs to figure out who's staying and who's going because both of them being there was not healthy for anyone involved. They insisted they were going to work things out. I went along with it because now they were keeping their dog in the room and there weren't cops showing up every other week.   
Around Thanksgiving they had their last major battle and it ended with the guy being arrested for allegedly smearing dog shit all over her belongings and preventing her from leaving. Now she refuses to drop the charges on him and it's been months since he's lived with us. She told me she made enough money to keep the place on her own so she was planning on staying. The first month he was gone she refused to pay more than half of their portion because he ""owes it to her to pay one last month"". I'm stuck because all 3 of our names are on the lease and I can't make partial payments so I have to cover it with all this drama. As soon as he was gone she started partying every night or just overall being out every night and traveling. She left the dog for 3 days whe she went to Miami and if I wasn't there it would have starved, she insisted the person who was supposed to watch her bailed last minute and she was already gone. The dog would be crying and begging for attention every night and at first I didn't mind helping her out but it wasn't equal and I wasn't getting paid to do it and their dog is not only poorly trained but it's a Bernese Mountain Dog so it is a little bit much for me to handle by myself with my dog (I have a golden retriever). The dog is also so anxious from being left alone all the time it has destroyed some of my things and lashed out at my dog. The animal has always pooped and peed everywhere, literally does not understand how to hold it and she doesn't take it out nearly enough. We even had a notice to evict us because she takes the dog to places it is not allowed and due to her being too loud.   
I've lost cookware, food, hair brushes, paper towels, cleaning products, and she still owes me over $1k and I can't even live in my own home because of the smell of dog poop and pee...  
She left the dog alone again last night so I told the guy he needs to come get her (it is legally his dog) and take her or I'm calling animal services because that dog needs help. She posts adorable pictures and videos on her Instagram of how amazing this dogs life is and that's literally a rare occasion that she is even giving it attention. She decided she wanted to keep it from him since he ""took so much from her"". He has been too scared to get the dog back because of legal ramifications and since after all the craziness she's done to him he's the one going through the court system and being blamed for things he didn't do. She refuses to drop the charges because she wants to be a martyr and save people from this monster she has made up in her head. The girl is legitimately insane and a compulsive (possibly pathological) liar. She cannot be spoken to like an actual adult. The other night her dog made a mess as it usually does and when she got home she just took the dog in her room and ignored the mess. I texted her 15 minutes later figuring that maybe she was just changing out of her work clothes and she literally didn't clean up the mess for at least hours so I went somewhere else to sleep. I can't keep cleaning up her messes, it's disgusting and unfair.  
So after all of this, my breaking point has been this: I set up a camera in my room because I wanted to check on my dog while I am at work and also wanted to make sure that her crazy ass wasn't snooping though my stuff when I wasn't staying there. I went to review some footage this mornjng as I just got home last night after staying somewhere else for a week because I wanted to get away from her. I realize that yesterday morning she came into my room naked and looked for my vibrator, when she didn't find it where it used to be she continued to walk into my room until she saw it. She then took it and used it (still in my room) and put it back.  
The fact that she knew where I used to keep it tells me this was not the first time. I need to get as far away from this place as possible or get her removed.  
For legal reasons, I'm in Florida and we are all on the lease. The guy has an order of protection preventing him from coming back.   
I can't afford to break my lease under normal circumstances, it will literally cost me more than staying and on top of that now owing money back for all of the damage that her dog has caused to the apartment. I can't afford another place to live right now because of this whole situation either and I just really don't know what to do. Now I feel violated and taken advantage of to the point where I just don't know what to do. I feel broken as a person and I need some direct help with dealing with this.   
TLDR;  
My insane roommate doesn't take care of her dog making my apartment unlivable and has now come into my room and used my vibrator (all caught on camera). I need help.

484,"Sorry in advance for the length, but I could really use some support here. 

# Brief background: 

I was born to a single, homeless, junky mother and basically buried my head in textbooks until getting a degree and a good paying job. I’m now 30, married, and stable, but I have no clue what a typical lifestyle actually looks like. I feel completely aimless now that I’ve secured a good job. I spent all my time studying and reading and haven't developed any hobbies or friendships, and I keep my family at a distance because they are unmistakenly toxic. 

By all accounts, I'm doing very well in life: Perfect health, wonderful marriage, healthy salary, and a homeowner in California (which is very rare for my age group as most have been priced out). I've certainly achieved all my lower order needs in life but it's the higher order needs that have me stumped. I've effectively been living the same week over and over for years now and it's making me depressed.

# Problem:

My life is stuck on repeat and have no plans for the future and because I have nobody in life, I'm lacking frame of reference for how to plan my life. 

# My Approach:

To solve my dilemma I decided to start by defining my values so I can begin forming goals around them. 

After tremendous amounts of self reflection (I've been an avid journalist for years) I have devised the following list of values, to which I've annexed to each a short precept to capture the full meaning, in the hope of bringing more clarity and purpose to my life.

I'm still developing goals around these values, but I wanted to check in and ask if I’m approaching life correctly here, or if perhaps I’m way off track. I don’t have anyone in my life, and so I’m lacking perspective on what's normal. 

Once I develop goals I plan to begin prioritizing them, scheduling them, and completing them. I just want to ensure I'm not headed down some weird rabbit hole without knowing it.

**MY VALUES**:

**Liberty** \- To choose how I live and behave, and help others do likewise. - *""Be yourself.""*

**Respect** \- To be respectful towards myself and others; to be polite, considerate, and show positive regard. - *""Give respect to get respect.""*

**Curiosity** \- To be curious, open-minded and interested, to explore, discover, and collaborate. - *“Ask good questions.”*

**Community** \- To be part of a system, to cooperate, collaborate, and build a sense of connectedness and support. - *“It takes a village.”*

**Order** \- To be organized, let all thing have their places; let each part of your business have its time. - *""A place for everything and everything in its place.""*

**Prosperity** \- To thrive and flourish in health, happiness, relationships, and work, and to help others do the same.  - *“A rising tide lifts all boats.”*

Before I begin, a simple no isn't working.

I've this office mate, who keeps taking selfies and photographs of everything and everyone. I have told her countless times I don't like being photographed. She forces me into a selfie and what not.

I let it slide.. coz ugh I hate conflict.

I took a nice picture of her (one she posed for), and put it in our office group. She didn't see this till she was at a coffee with me and someone else.. She saw the picture and flipped out over it in front of an important person (president of a place our office was trying to impress). I've been avoiding her since then. 

Later this happened. She took pictures of an unofficial meeting. Strangers, that we were dealing with for a survey. She just gets up and takes a picture of them. I know she will be posting it. So I ask her if she got permission. Her reply was "" what permission?"" I told her permission to take pictures of them. She brushed me off and proceed to take pictures and asked the people (two young girls) to look up. I felt them being very uncomfortable with the entire situation, as they were not dressed for pictures (house attire). She informs them we need pictures to document. ( We do, but it's not a must, specially without consent). And she tells them ""it's okay, eh?"" To which they nod awkwardly. 

So I think my question is two folds. How do I deal with such a person? And how do I not be in selfies?",08Mar2019,1
486,She’s been apart of my life for 14 (almost 15) years and it breaks my heart to see her in the state she’s in now. She stopped eating and cannot get up anymore. I give her water with an eye dropper but most of the time she will not drink it. I give her head scratches and she sometimes nudges her head closer but that’s about as much movement/interaction she has with us. I’m feeling really anxious and down today and don’t really know how to cope. ,08Mar2019,1
487,"People complain about their roommates a lot, mine has made my life a living hell. 

Backstory: I live in an expensive town (unfortunately it is my hometown so I'd like to stay here) and found myself in a situation where roommates became a smarter decision. I found this couple that was signing a lease at a brand new apartment complex and it was in my price range. I met them, interviewed with them and felt comfortable enough to sign a lease with them. I didn't realize until the day of signing it was a 15 month lease but figured that'd give me enough time to get settled in and save some money for my next place.

The couple was 24F and 30M, both worked service industry at a successful restaurant and they had a dog who was seemingly taken care of and all was well. They weren't always the best at taking care of their dog which was annoying but overall I couldn't complain because nothing else was really bad. About 2.5 months into my lease the guy cheated on the girl and it set in motion the most messed up series of events I've ever endured. I tried to help because the girl didn't seem to know anyone as she moved to our town to be with him and they seemed to keep to themselves. That night I took her out to help her clear her mind and found out she was an insanely promiscuous person with no shame, I figured she did it because of what had happened but whatever it isn't my place to judge her life choices. After the night out she decided she wanted to work things out with him so for a week or so he slept on the couch and they'd bicker but over all it just seemed like normal relationship on the rocks kind of drama. Then one night the cops woke me up at about 2 am coming into my room saying that they were accusing each other of assault and asked me for witness testimony. I am a super hard sleeper, I honestly had no idea anything was going on until they barged into my room. I told them I barely know them but the guy drinks excessively and he had been drinking that night and the girl was sober to my knowledge. The guy ended up getting arrested and things all got very complicated. She had lost her job during the time he cheated on her (she blamed him but really just threw a hissy fit about going) and he continued to pay for everything at this time even when he wasn't legally allowed at the apartment. She had me convinced he was an abusive manipulator and yet she kept taking him back but I noticed how he'd always leave, etc. One of the nights he left I got a text message from someone claiming to be her mom asking me to check on her because she wasn't stable. I bang on her door, no answer, so when I figured she had left I turned around but saw her keys on the counter and decided to enter her room. I found her on her bed with her wrist slashed and open pill bottles on the floor. I call 911, she gets taken to the hospital and receives a psych eval and they said she was fine after a few days and sent her home. They continue to try to work on their relationship. 

She meets this sugar baby girl at her new job and instantly forms a very toxic relationship with her. She starts going out every night and partying (the guy was not at all about this) and the fighting becomes constant between them. He's never home because of her being insane, the dog isn't getting taken care of because of all of the craziness and at this point I had gotten my own dog and couldn't handle the responsibility of both as mine was very ill when I got her. They stay together through her slashing his tires (1 tire each time on 2 different occasions), her taking his wallet and stealing his car on multiple occasions, her ubering to a bar he was at with friends punching him, stealing his keys and leaving (at least once), her kicking in his windshield in front of his work, her stabbing him, breaking his TV and his computer monitor, etc. At this point I had realized that whenever this girls ""mom"" was texting her boyfriend or I it was actually her using a ghost number. All of this caused me to reach my breaking point one night and just let them both have it and explain that one of them needs to figure out who's staying and who's going because both of them being there was not healthy for anyone involved. They insisted they were going to work things out. I went along with it because now they were keeping their dog in the room and there weren't cops showing up every other week. 

Around Thanksgiving they had their last major battle and it ended with the guy being arrested for allegedly smearing dog shit all over her belongings and preventing her from leaving. Now she refuses to drop the charges on him and it's been months since he's lived with us. She told me she made enough money to keep the place on her own so she was planning on staying. The first month he was gone she refused to pay more than half of their portion because he ""owes it to her to pay one last month"". I'm stuck because all 3 of our names are on the lease and I can't make partial payments so I have to cover it with all this drama. As soon as he was gone she started partying every night or just overall being out every night and traveling. She left the dog for 3 days whe she went to Miami and if I wasn't there it would have starved, she insisted the person who was supposed to watch her bailed last minute and she was already gone. The dog would be crying and begging for attention every night and at first I didn't mind helping her out but it wasn't equal and I wasn't getting paid to do it and their dog is not only poorly trained but it's a Bernese Mountain Dog so it is a little bit much for me to handle by myself with my dog (I have a golden retriever). The dog is also so anxious from being left alone all the time it has destroyed some of my things and lashed out at my dog. The animal has always pooped and peed everywhere, literally does not understand how to hold it and she doesn't take it out nearly enough.

I've lost cookware, food, hair brushes, paper towels, cleaning products, and she still owes me over $1k and I can't even live in my own home because of the smell of dog poop and pee...

She left the dog alone again last night so I told the guy he needs to come get her (it is legally his dog) or I'm calling animal services because that dog needs help. She posts adorable pictures and videos on her Instagram of how amazing this dogs life is and that's literally a rare occasion that she is even giving it attention. She decided she wanted to keep it from him since he ""took so much from her"". He has been too scared to get the dog back because of legal ramifications and since after all the craziness she's done to him he's the one going through the court system and being blamed for things he didn't do. She refuses to drop the charges because she wants to be a martyr and save people from this monster she has made up in her head. The girl is legitimately insane and a compulsive (possibly pathological) liar. She cannot be spoken to like an actual adult. The other night her dog made a mess as it usually does and when she got home she just took the dog in her room and ignored the mess. I texted her 15 minutes later figuring that maybe she was just changing out of her work clothes and she literally didn't clean up the mess for at least hours so I went somewhere else to sleep. I can't keep cleaning up her messes, it's disgusting and unfair. The noise and smell this dog creates because of her has made us receive multiple notices for compliance / pre eviction letters. 

So after all of this, my breaking point has been this: I set up a camera in my room because I wanted to check on my dog while I am at work and also wanted to make sure that her crazy ass wasn't snooping though my stuff when I wasn't staying there. I went to review some footage this mornjng as I just got home last night after staying somewhere else for a week because I wanted to get away from her. I realize that yesterday morning she came into my room naked and looked for my vibrator, when she didn't find it where it used to be she continued to walk into my room until she saw it. She then took it and used it (still in my room) and put it back.

The fact that she knew where I used to keep it tells me this was not the first time. I need to get as far away from this place as possible or get her removed.

For legal reasons, I'm in Florida and we are all on the lease. The guy has an order of protection preventing him from coming back. 

I can't afford to break my lease under normal circumstances, it will literally cost me more than staying and on top of that now owing money back for all of the damage that her dog has caused to the apartment. I can't afford another place to live right now because of this whole situation either and I just really don't know what to do. Now I feel violated and taken advantage of to the point where I just don't know what to do. I feel broken as a person and I need some direct help with dealing with this. 

TLDR;
My insane roommate doesn't take care of her dog making my apartment unlivable and has now come into my room and used my vibrator (all caught on camera). I need help. ",08Mar2019,3
488,"So me and my really close friend had a really bad argument and she told me to never talk to her again (basically I pissed her off really bad because it was her birthday soon, not party just birthday, we hadn't made any plans to do anything that day so i made other plans. She got really pissed and when i asked if she wants to do something the next weekend or the weekend after, my treat, she said no. She also had plans to do something on her birthday which fell through.) I was really messed up over this and was in a massive slump for a while. She attempted to call me the week after but the thought of picking up gave me a panic attack so i just let it ring. This happened a couple times after and same deal. I was closer to answering the next couple times but i almost threw up. She texted me seeing if i wanted to try to make it work but for some reason i denied the offer. I feel like shit for doing it and i want to try and sort things out but i suck at argument and sorting out problems and just looking at her contact makes my anxiety go nuts.

493,"I recently got a promotion, which I was obviously happy about. However, I wasn’t aware of the market range of the salary of this new position when I accepted the terms. 

During my annual compensation discussion, my boss told me what my adjusted salary will be. Just your standard annual % increase to keep up with inflation. My boss also shared what the market value of my role is. Turns out, my salary is below the market value range.

My boss said they are aware of this, and that they will try to give me higher merit increases in the coming years so that I am within the market range for future years. 

I don’t really like that answer, because I won’t see any changes for a whole year. But I am very young and new to the working world, so I don’t know how to go about having a conversation, or even if I should. What should I do?

498,"I'm not really sure what to even say here because I feel utterly lost and hopeless. I have written so many variations of this post, and each time fear cripples me from sending it. So I created a new account and hope maybe I'll actually ask for some advice/help here. 

Back Story:

I was raised by a single mother who died when I was 17 after fighting cancer for 2 years. Before she died, we moved a bunch, and the rest of my family died too; except for her older half-sister who treated me like garbage. I never knew my father, save for a half-year experiment when I was 10/11, in which he left as soon as he could, never to be seen again; he died 5 years ago this June. I was physically abused by a teacher when I was in 6th grade, of which not even my mother believed me nor did any of the other male students who were abused stand up when I did.  I was forced in to college by a friend's family after my mother died, which I was not ready for, did not get a degree (not that a Theater degree would have done much). I've been homeless, I was raped by an ex girlfriend once, I have almost no friends now. I do have a wife (not legally married, been together 10 years), but that relationship is difficult as I have a dead-end job and no hope of a job that either pays well or makes me happy, so I am wholly dependent on my wife which is taking it's toll on her. We have too many cats, which is my fault, and our apartment is literally falling apart. I feel worthless, hopeless, and am getting closer and closer to collapsing every day. I have no one to turn to, no one to ask for help, no skills, no talents, nothing but my undiagnosed mental health issues. I turn 35 this year, having now lived more of my life without a parent than I did with. I have no family at all, save for the half-aunt who is nuts and hates me (feeling is mutual). I developed an alcohol, cigarette, and weed addiction that consumed me for a long time. We don't even have a car anymore, nor could we afford one, and we live in a different state than her family (not that they like me much anyway). My wife is up for, and applying for, jobs in different states for her career, but that just forces me to be more dependent on her. I had a seizure in July of 2018, which I have no ability to go to the doctor, so I don't know what caused it. 

***Back Story TL;DR =  I'm 35 years old, an orphan who had a shitty childhood is falling apart and doesn't know what to do to stop it as there isn't anyone I can turn to because they're all dead or dislike me or unable to help.*** 

Work Experience: All of it is in the service industry, and frankly, I'm tired of working for other people and watching as my efforts never benefit me. I have no ""paid time off"" and have only ever had 2 jobs that provided that. I worked in restaurants in the back-of-house for almost 10 years but refuse to do food-service ever again; it takes and takes and doesn't give back, plus I despise food having struggled with my weight and eating issues my whole life. I currently work in a dead-end convenience store, with a very selfish passive-aggressive boss and toxic coworker. I was a Route Manager for a dry cleaner for two years, and loved the driving, but the location moved and the commute just to get to and from work became too much for me (as well as internal structure changes and the effects of my mental health issues). I was recently turned down for a job that I was perfectly suited for, that I did everything right for, and it devastated me. I got excited to pick up other people's dog's shit, and wasn't even good enough for that. Which was the start of the tailspin I find myself in. I've actually been turned down for close to 30 jobs in the last three months, all of which were dead-end nonsense, but I'm not even good enough to get interviews, which probably means my resume is crap, but that's also because I'm crap and I guess every one can tell. 

***Work Experience TL;DR = A lifetime of dead-end service jobs (food and retail), with no options for anything different, while being unable to get something quality, is leaving me desperate and terrified.*** 

Skills(?): I'm good with my hands, like working with wood (though completely inexperienced). I'm tech savvy, having built my own computer and use my Chromebook in developer mode while being able to dual-boot it to run Ubuntu from a flash drive. I am *very* competent behind a camera, as all I've ever wanted to be was a filmmaker, but that is a collaborative industry and no one wants to work with me, and without a car I feel like I can't do anything anyway. I am also good at editing; I built my first linear editor when I was 13 using a spliced RCA cable, a 6-Head VCR (I still own), a CRT TV, A VHS camcorder, and a DVD player. I love film and wish I could be on a film set everyday. But, I have no *real* proof that I'm able to do anything, or how to prove it other than some crap on YouTube and being on IMDB for acting in a short film). I've seen several thousand movies, and a couple hundred tv shows in my lifetime. Mostly though I'm just worthless and incapable of doing anything I consider to be of value or worthwhile. 

***Skill TL;DR = None of any consequence, but some bullshit about film making.***

Mental Health Issues: I am undiagnosed, that's for sure, and while I know that I should probably be in therapy and on medication, not only can I not afford those options the idea scares the hell out of me (as does being diagnosed with a seizure disorder). I already struggle with suicidal thoughts, but have managed on my own to control them; as well as intrusive thoughts and a bunch of other stuff. That said, and while one shouldn't self-diagnose, I have for the purposes of having something to fight to try and be happy (which I absolutely never am). I know I have major depression, and probably ADHD, and maybe an anxiety disorder. All things that have improved as I have my weight under control, and perhaps the thing I am most proud of (but has done nothing really) is that I am **100% sober**; In April I will officially be 1 year sober of alcohol (no program, just luck and hard work), 8 months free of cigarettes (Using a Juul), 3 months free of nicotine (No more Juul!), and 2 months free of weed. In truth, all this has done is made me feel how sad, miserable, and hopeless I am. I know I am sober, as I work somewhere I could have purchased two of those three any day I wanted. I was ""happier"" when I was drunk and high everyday, though I feel more alive now than I ever did. It's a shitty dichotomy that I live with and struggle with. I do drink a *shit load* of coffee though (like 12 cups a day, but it's probably weaker than most as I brew it at home).

But, in sobriety, I discovered potential epilepsy (the seizure I had led to me to learn more about them and found I've probably been having them since I was a teenager but the drug use hid it), as well as my mood disorders have gotten better only for me to realize that I have probably have a personality disorder and it's getting worse every day. I *believe* that I have a mixed-feature Cluster C personality disorder, most likely Avoidant and OCPD with Paranoid features (I thought I might have Borderline, but I'm not emotionally unstable enough, just angry and filled with fear of rejection and abandonment all the time). I am only aware of this because of my sobriety, which has allowed me to try and work on it but I'm just very broken inside and getting worse every day so having this ""enemy"" to fight isn't doing me any good when I have no hope for *my* future. I have always had anger issues in life, but had them under control for the last several years; but without the drugs my anger has come back stringer than ever. It only flares though when someone doesn't do things correctly or lies to me. I don't hurt people, I hurt myself. I've broken my knuckles many times in life and until recently had stopped hitting things. I have a broke a knuckle again the other day and it was all because the cat food bowls weren't rinsed correctly, once again leaving work for me to do for no reason. Even typing it makes me angry. 

***Mental Health TL;DR = Being nearly one year sober, having a decent grasp against mood disorders is worried as my sanity is slipping because of perceived personality disorder, fear of epilepsy, and not knowing what to do because medication terrifies me as does the inability to afford it myself.***

&amp;#x200B;

I guess it's relevant at this point to mention that I *currently* live in Austin, TX, I only make like $800 a month and that all has to go to help pay bills. My wife hates her job but makes decent money, but the stress of knowing I can't do anything to help is affecting her and me. I just don't know what to do, and I feel myself slipping further and further away every day. Therapy and medication might help, but I'm running out of time in the short term and feel like I need to do something drastic, or have a miracle happen, because I feel utterly alone and hopeless and without a future. I'm scared, I'm really scared. I just don't know what to do. I can't keep working a dead-end job, living in an apartment that is literally falling apart, and each day my grip on my sanity is getting harder and harder. I really feel like I'm out of options and time and that I should just give up. I don't know what else to do, and I don't know where to turn, and I'm terrified of being laughed at or told I'm worthless or hearing what I've heard a thousand times ""Just deal with it."" I never got help after my mother died and well, I've been coasting since; leaving damaged relationships in my wake. My wife is the longest anyone other than my mother has been in my life and not without attempts at destruction. I feel like I am a completely worthless piece of shit and I don't know how I can fix it without creating more debt or having to rely on someone else. I'm tired, and sad, and just want a decent job and hope for my future. I don't know what to do and I need help. 

**TL;DR = I had a shitty life, made mistakes and excuses, found sobriety and am now sadder than ever and desperate for a light at the end of the tunnel that I don't know how to make happen.**

499,"Hi Folks,

&amp;#x200B;

I had a spine surgery last year(been more than 12 months) and I was cleared by my doctor to drive.

I renewed my license in Dec 2018, and they had a question which says if there was something which kept me from driving for 3 months. (I filled in yes, and mentioned spine surgery and that I was cleared). Fast forward, last wee[k](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/wcm/connect/f92586ac-be7a-456b-af31-b35acc029982/ds326.pdf?MOD=AJPERES), I got DS 326. I am not sure if I need to give my entire medical history to DMV? I am also seeing a doctor for Erectile Dysfunction .. I even called DMV and they said I need to fill in only about my spine. But the form says:  I certify (or declare) under penalty of perjury under the laws of the state of california that the foregoing is true and correct. I further certify that all the information concerning my health is true and correct.

&amp;#x200B;

I am little afraid to miss out anything. Even though the DMV employee said I should only fill about my spine.

Anyone has any experience with this form? I am also seeing cardiologist and a rheumatologist. None of the conditions has affected my driving ability and no Doctor has said No to me to not drive.

&amp;#x200B;

It is going to very expensive without car.

500,"My brother and mother have estranged themselves from the rest of the family (I don't like them and haven't seen my ma and bro in 10 years) and have been living away from us for years. My brother and I grew with our grandparents and when he was old enough he moved in with her. She's been to jail for some pretty bad things, and they've both used drugs for quite some time - on and off in methadone clinics and using heroin. 

As my mother has gotten older she's become harmless, just delusional, and probably argumentative. My brother, however, will routinely (every year or so) say terrible things to specific family members unprovoked. For example, one of my amazing aunts who helped raise him he thinks is evil, so he texted her and said she was a slut, and blamed her for stealing us from my mother. It's exhausting but we've pretty much all blocked him on every social media account.

I had a slight suspicion that he was hacking into my mothers account (we had been communicating between 2013-2016), because she started to post odd things trashing family members, and not writting in her usual tone. Same thing happened when I tried to confront her - I believe it was my brother. I blocked both of them because I'm 28 and am just tired of dealing with his petty shit. 

About a month later I wondered how terrible it would be if my mother was being abused by my brother. It was a possibility but I shrugged it off because of the true evilness I did not want to imagine. 

About a year later I saw my aunt who had some suspicions and we discussed how weird it all was, but more importantly, my mother sent her photos of being abused - scratch marks on her face and bruises. It confirmed my suspicions. Those pictures were from some time ago, when my brother lashing out on people. My mother has since been diagnosed with cancer, and my brother is taking care of her.

Today my mother, in a incompotent and unusually written message, texted my aunt about ""some message I sent you a while back, we all say things we don't mean, don't worry about it."" And something along the lines of don't worry about the PT scan showing bruises. Obviously, we think they're physically fighting and my brother has taken control of her phone, and in an effort to not feel guilty is posing as my mother and texting ppl incoherently.

I live across the country and don't really want to get involved (as I don't really see them as family), but I also feel partially responsible that I may have the foresight someone is being abused. Even if they're a criminal, not a ""good"" person, I don't want them being abused. 

How can I safely keep my distance and help my mother? Does this warrant the cops being called? How do I even do that being across country? Would the cops even give a rat's ass and would I be jeopardized at all if there was nothing wrong happening?

Let me know, thanks for reading this much. ",08Mar2019,1
502,"     I have just created this account for this story and apologize for any grammer and spelling mistakes and sorry for format because i am on my phone but i need advice, i posted here because reddit has a history of helping people like with the vaccines. I am sorry if i submitted this the the wrong place.

Short version: friend has a mini breack down and confesses that she is in an emotional abusing, stressful, and potentially dangerous stituation with her father. her mother and her are afraid to take legal action in fear of her father doing something worse.

     Today we(me and my group of two others) were meant to make a video but the person we had to do mainly that did not. Thid post is not about that but rather what came after. My friend, we will call her F for friend, didn't meet me to work on the project for lunch and me and the other team member did what we could. We come back to the classroom and i wait at my desk to confront her on not showing up.

      I admit i was passive aggressive due to freacking out over the project (we are in high school), but i drop it the second I see F with red eyes and tear tracks down her face and a red face. I ask her immediatly if she was just having a panic attack from the stress and hard talking to from our teacher regarding the project we had before lunch.

      She doesn't answer and with a wobbly breacking voice she says that she is sorry that she didn't do much of the project and that I will end up doing most of it (kinda true). She says that she has been stressed out because of her dad and his wife which has only been contributimg to her anixity and not helping with her ADD.

    Her step mother emotionally manipulates her when ever she is there with her father on the weekend for the joint custody shared with F's actual mother, who has here monday through friday. When ever she want to go any where it is always about the step mother with her dad saying ""S (step mother) is tired"" or ""S doesn't want to do that."" Any conversation she tires to have with her father ends with S steping in and blaming F and the dad doing nothing.

     I now realize that the way i am talking about the dad makes him look horrible and blind, but let me assure you, he is much worse. He works for the government and is currently employed as a worker for this orgnization that is basically the FBI for a state, i forgot what she called it, sorry. She told me a year ago that he showed photos of gruesome crimes scenes that contributed to her growth and F has often times called him insane and crazy, i only now realize the severity of it all.

     When her parent were going through a divorce he tired to basically kidnap her by dragging her out of her car. Her mother is scared about placing a restraining order on him or takimg away his custody rights in fear of him KIDNAPPING her. F has confessed that she seriously has considered gettimg emancipated, which explains her strong curiosity to the law, but she decided not to because of similar fears she has about her father.

     I do not want her going back to him and offered her my home in case and we exchanged number (I never give out my number because i find texting and everything stressful and i saved a lot of texts and minutes over the time i had gotton it so i made an exception). I told her writing down each occurance on a document online, so they won't find out and she can edit and use it anywhere, would help her emotionally and maybe in the long run.

     I do not know what to do amd only offered what i could think of. I feel like i stepped over boundaries even though she was thr one to tell me all this and I am lost, i can't really take legal action considering everything and i just need to know how to do this as her friend.

504,"So some back story in my late teens all I did was work too many hours and party eventually leading to me jumping into the deep end of drugs and drinking problems... I reconnected with a friend from high school at 20 who was just a stoner really and we hung out a few times and talked about moving out together eventually... Later that year I got arrested and lost license for a year causing all of my problems to come to a head and my resignation of my job to focus on problems. I took all of the next year off and between therapy forced outpatient rehab sessions and court would play video games daily with this friend who was always there for me.throughout last year we pretty much know everything about each other. fast forward thru the year and I've gotten my life back on track am clean and don't really drink anymore with my new found sobriety I don't want to be around any drugs just because of my nature of my habits even if its just weed. He is really set on wanting to move out this year with me and it was always ""The dream"" to move out together but I don't want to go back to that life and I know he won't change If I ask (I've brought it up before) What do I do? 

Ive known friend since childhood and always been friends with him in recent years he has had worsening social anxiety to the point he cant hold a job and I feel as if I'm abandoning him but at the same time If I stick around I will just end up back into my old ways.",08Mar2019,1

A solution some people say is to call on close friends, but unfortunately that awkward transition between losing those people who aren't necessarily helping me to grow and meeting new people is happening right now. I honestly don't know what to do. How do I learn to be okay being by myself? How do I start to let her live her life while I navigate my own?

One person particularly in the group, whom, I dont know, posted hateful things about the group that the lady belongs to. The language is discriminatory, foul and belittles a group of people based on stereotypes. Some people reached back to him and he came back harsher.

I sent him a message with a link showing that this language is against the criminal code of our country. I also sent him a link as a warning. The 2nd link was from police's website talking about how to report hate speech. He responded that he does not care.

511,"So there is this girl I like and I don't know what should I do. So this year I'm a freshman so new school and new colleagues and I gotta say that this one girl colleague is the most beautiful girl I had ever seen and I have the best crush on her. Seems like nothing can stop me from loving her. Fast forward a semester and the school had moved our class to another one cuz our classroom was getting redone so in this new classroom instead of sitting 2 people at a desk how it usually is we had to sit 4 people at a desk and I was the luckiest ever because when I had came into that classroom that day when they moved us the only free place was the one right next to my crush and that's where I got to understand that she likes me back.

Fast forward a few days they moved us back to our classroom and both my and her desk colleague were absent that day and I went to her(bc of that day we stayed together at the same desk we both had courage to talk to each other) and told her "" it seems like you are sitting alone today,huh?"" And she instantly hit me with ""wanna sit with me?"" So I did. That's the same thing happened for the next 3 days. In those 3 days she kept laughing and tilting to me,I catched her numerous time peeking at me,she touched me in different places all the time and fist bumping my arm at all occasions possible. 

Let's go 2 weeks forward and now I asked her if she wants to go out in the weekend with me and she postponed it to the next weekend which it turned out that she has cancelled that bc it was her birthday and she spent that time with her family and very close female friends.

Another week forward and now some cunt started hitting on her but I see that she doesn't like him. For example when he tries to play with her hair she instantly tells him to stop and everytime I play with her hair she starts a conversation and shit like that.

Tonight I started talking to her on Instagram and she said something about some movie she wants to watch and she asked if she wants to watch it at the cinema and she said that she wants to watch it online right now. Seeing that what I tried hasn't worked I ask her what she's doing tomorrow waiting for a ""nothing"" and asking her out but that wasn't the case bc she said that she has to do her homeworks bc she wants to go out with the same female friend, that I have talked about a few lines ago, the day after tomorrow.


Should I still try because I'm the closest I've ever been to a girl witch happens to be my crush and which happens to actually like me back? My plan is to ask her out in the spring break which is nearly a month long so that I'm sure that she can't say that she's occupied the third time in a row, if she won't accept than I'm gonna move on,tell her I like her at school and fuck off.

Any other advice that I can be given to not lose her and make sure she has a crush on me too and make sure that she'll accept going out? How can I make the intention that I ain't looking for sex(girl my age(15-16) always think that we,boys,are looking for sex but I'm really looking to keep her protected and loved I guess.

512," 

I’m struggling with distancing myself with a close friend of mine. I live with her and 4 other friends but we only have a month left before we graduate and part our separate ways. For the past 3 years, my friend and I have been incredibly close, mainly because we bonded over being depressed at the time for very similar reasons. This year, I am a lot less depressed and all of a sudden, I started noticing things about her personality and character that I just can’t relate to anymore. A couple examples:

&amp;#x200B;

* We got into a \*stupid, drunk\* fight a month ago, and the way she treated me during it was absolutely bullying. She did not play nice, she was cruel, I was scared to go to my own home (we live together) and spent all day on campus to avoid her. I had horrible anxiety and she spent her time gossiping about me to my roommates. We got over the fight but I havent looked at her the same since… In fact, being around her, I still feel incredibly nervous and anxious because she was that cruel and vicious to me. 
* She is OBSESSED with what other people, especially boys think of her. 
* She is OBSESSED with her social media and instagram presence. She needs a certain amount of likes to feel validated. She only does things to get an instagram post. She spends her entire vacations trying to get the perfect bikini photo. 
* On topic of that, she will post a horrible photo of her friends as long as she looks good in it.
* She is a dominant, queen bee type personality. She was popular in high school and that is how she acts now, and within our friend group, you can tell people feel intimidated and kiss up to her. 
* She has no standards for herself, will have sex with any boy who calls her hot, and will spend all day crying when he plays her.
* She is passive aggressive
* she has horrible anxiety, as do I, but does nothing to better herself. In fact, she will do things that make it worse such as over drinking
* She only does things to look cool and fit in with other people
* She doesnt really let me have my own friends. And I hate that I share the same friends as her because if I hang out with someone without her she will get jealous and message them right away asking them to hang out 
* She is so judgemental towards other people 

I could go on but I won’t. I’ve been distancing myself now for the past 2 weeks or so, mainly because she has been giving me anxiety but also because I think our priorities do not align. Here’s the thing I can’t figure out. I feel like she has me wrapped around her finger because I almost feel sad that I am losing a friend. I feel like I WANT her to go out of her way to choose me like she used to back when we were really close. She never texts me first anymore (neither do I now because I am distancing), she will choose other of our friends to do things with her when it used to be me, we just simply aren’t as close and I don’t feel the same closeness we once had with anyone else. Maybe I am lonely? Maybe she has manipulated me because I did kinda follow her around… Any advice?",08Mar2019,1
513,"So I recently started going to the gym about 4-5 times a week for a bit over a month now and about 2 weeks ago, I started to feel a slight but sharp pain in my forearm.

But we don’t know what time they’ll come over. I suggested to my mom that she text them to find out when and she snapped at me that it’s impolite. It shows that we are just hungry and only want to eat.

516,"So, as I child, I was shy, submissive, very sensitive and sometimes whiny. As a result, I was bullied practically from everybody, and being naive I didn't know how to protect myself, and chose many wrong friendships with people that made fun of me by my back.

When I grew up I changed completely, and now, at 28, I'm still shy and sensitive, but I became more aggressive - I tend to fight instead of letting go - and I worked on my self esteem a lot.

One thing that still haunts me is my problem with friendships. In my 20 I made a lot of friends, and in the past 3-4 years(28 now) I lost many of them. There is a pattern in these situations: I lost one friend because he was there only when he wanted and needed to, and then disappeared when he got something else on his plate. I lost another one because I discovered that she spoke ill of everybody - including me. Another one, we fought because when he tried to commit suicide he called me for 3-4 hours per day, and then when he got better he completely disappeared. The last one - my closest friend - is a ridicolous situation; her husband sells lamps, I asked him one to give as a gift to my sister, he brought it to my house even if I wanted to pay it for full at his shop, and it was used, broken and without warranty. When I gave him back, trying to explain nicely that I couldn't give it as a gift, he and my friend disappeared from my life immediately and without even a fight.

I still have many people around, but sometimes I kinda notice that they share a certain amount of selfishness - and honestly sometimes I bite my tongue to avoid a fight with some of them, because it still happens frequently that I'm alone when I need help and I'm around when someone else need it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not perfect at all. I'm defensive, I'm too sensitive so I overanalyze things, I'm very sincere and when I'm upset I can be mean. But I didn't think I'm a bad person either, and these situations that tend to repeat with my (former) friends are driving me crazy. I started to question me, and I don't know if I'm still too submissive and nice to people that simply didn't deserve it, or if I'm a shitty friend that ruin every relationship she has in her life.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry if it is poorly written - English is not my mother-tongue - and if there isn't maybe a proper answer to my question, since none of you know me.

But I'm kind of asking myself what it's wrong in all of this, and I can't ask people around me, because they're here cause they still like me so they probably wouldn't be honest with me.",08Mar2019,2

521,"So first off, my brother in this story is not perfect but nonetheless, it doesn't condone what this teacher did.

Yesterday, my mom received an email from my younger bro's English teacher. He's 18 and a senior in high school. It started off by saying: ""He's failing English, always comes in late or not at all and turns his assignments in whenever he wants, etc."" My bro is kind of a knucklehead when it comes to school but he's overall a good kid. Anyway, the part of this email that set me off was what happened next:

This teacher (who I also had run ins with when I was in HS) then went on to say that it was HER fault for not teaching my brother better habits and more manners in the home. She criticized her parenting and the whole message was basically a put down onto my mother! My mom raised 4 kids all while going back to school at 45 and getting her bachelors so she could become a nurse which she's wanted to do ever since she was a child but never got the chance cuz life just didnt work out for her that way at a younger age. My dad is gone a lot for work so she has been the one to nurture, care for, and raise me and my siblings for pretty much the 23 years I've been alive so far. She goes 110mph all the time cuz she loves us and I think she's the greatest person to walk planet earth.

I want to know, what would you do? Should I just let this slide and tell my mom it will be alright? Cuz honestly, finding her in tears over an email some ignorant teacher had the audacity to send criticizing her parenting sent me thru the roof. But I thought I'd ask and see what to do? Respond? Let it go? Take up arms? (Mostly kidding about that last one...mostly).",08Mar2019,2
522,"sos!! need some advice or any similar personal stories. 

OK SO STORY TIME. buckle up baby. 

there’s this guy at my uni who i’ve known for a few months and he recently broke up w his gf of 4 years. 

i was just friends w him when that happened, just supported him thru that, but i started to like him and he started to like me as well. 

when they broke up we started sleeping together and we really started to adore each other, but we started out not exclusive. 

he’s in his last year so he’s leaving next year and i’m quite a bit younger. as time went on i thought as our feelings grew for each other we’d become exclusive for the month we have left of school. i thought this would happen because he is SO sweet to me, the nicest any guy has ever been to me, so respectful and lovely and honest and we click so well.

he says he would marry me and stuff, and that he wishes he had met me at a time in his life where things aren’t as complicated as they are now. he looks at me so beautifully, these heart eyes that he has 

but he says he can’t be exclusive with me. at first i just thought my feelings were stronger than his and he didn’t care about me as much as he says he did. and i was SO upset like i really like this guy. but at the same time i’m way to pretty and awesome to be sleeping with someone who wants to bang other ppl u know? lol. 

but after many days of us having conversations and us both crying but mostly me just SOBBING like a bitch, we sat down and he told me his feelings. 

basically in his last relationship he just gave so much love that he didn’t receive back, and doing things he didn’t want to do for her and that like traumatized him a bit. and he doesn’t want to be exclusive with me because he feels like “detached” from everything. which is fair, if you have a gf for 4 years, that’s 4 years of talking to that person every single day—that’s PART of you—and now that’s gone in for him. 

he needs time to recover. i really understand. 

i’ve been in similar situations, but usually the guy was a disrespectful mf dickhead, so it was easy to cut him off bec i knew it’d be good for me. 

but this guy is so different cause he did nothing wrong! one could say he lead me on because he treated me so well, taking me out and calling me all these lovely things and saying he’d marry me and stuff but his explanation was that i’m lovely and should be treaded that way WHICH IS TRUE. 

so idk what to do. he’s just so unbelievably attractive and everything i want in a person, and i’m the same for him! but he’s like slightly emotionally fucked up. which is so fair. and leaving in a month. 

it’s just so hard to focus on school work, my mind keeps drifting to him and making me sad. he really really wants to stay friends though, and i do too, he really doesn’t deserve to be cut off and at the same time i don’t know what would be best for me! 

he’s someone i see in my future and i haven’t said that about anyone i’ve been with...

anyways thanks for coming to my ted talk lol. please help!!!

524,"My friends and family around me have said that my current dilemma is the most complicated hey have ever seen, so if you think you’re able to help, strap in.

I am 20, already have gone 2 years part time in college. I just recently decided I want to get a Bachelors in Dental Hygiene. Currently, I have been accepted to a university in my state that has a 4 year program for me to complete. It’s 4 years because their actual Dental Hygiene school is 3 years long and I have 1 year of prereqs i still need to complete. I start in Fall 2019. I have planned everything accordingly to lead up to leaving this fall for 4 years. This school is pretty spaced out and each semester is like 14-16 credit hours.

This past December, I applied to work as an entry-level Dental Assistant at my local Dentist office, and two days ago they called me and I came in and they’re interested in having me! This is great news, but because I’m entry level, they told me that it would probably take 6 months to train me... and that they want somebody permanent (at least 2 years)... Since i’m leaving for school in 6 months, it would make sense for me to just turn down the job, right?

But experience is also important right? I was talking with my older brother, and there’s a university in the state he lives in (Texas A&amp;M University) where their Dental Hygiene bachelors is only 2 years long (fall spring summer fall spring) and maybe I could stay for another year here and finish prereqs (while working in the dental office) and then transfer there for 2 years (3 years total) and that would be shorter than my current plan. But, because it’s so short over there, the semesters are condensed into 18+ credit hours..... and i don’t know if i would be able to handle that. My brother who is out in the world and living on his own told me that it would be better to get this done with the quicker option so I have more time to experience the world as a young adult. it’s true, i would be done a lot quicker but could i even handle the course load? Have any of you been to Texas A&amp;M University? I heard it’s an amazing school, people love it, and obviously with work you can make it, but i’m just afraid of leaving my home state and going somewhere unknown and getting slapped in the face with 18 credit hour semesters with no breaks for 2 years. I just went to community college for 2 years part time so how would I prepare?

So it’s either I turn down this job and stick to my original plan and take it easy these next 4 years, or i take this job, work my ass off working and going to school for a year, then transfer to a school that’s apparently great, but with a tremendously heavy course load.

I’m going to keep my state private but I guess if any of you have been to Texas A&amp;M University and have thoughts on the course load, teachers, and even the Dental Hygiene program there that would be great. 

Advice for any part of this post would be greatly appreciated. ",08Mar2019,1

I want to end this agreement but don’t want to offend her, as she is a very sensitive person. She has often overstepped boundaries in many situations, in both inside and outside work.... She often gives me unsolicited advice and is very judge mental, but that is another story. I am worried that if I break this deal with her she will stop giving me rides and I will have no way to get to work... 


Sorry I suck at English and I am also on mobile lol


Tldr: How can I stop cooking for my roommate without offending her ",08Mar2019,2
532,"Where to begin...

My fiancé and I have been together for 6 years. About a year and a half ago we got engaged. Great relationship. Best part about my life. We’ve lived together also for a year and a half. 

His family is split. His parents divorced about 4 years ago officially, but they have been romantically separated for longer and simply co parenting in the same house. His dad still lives in the area near us. His mom, however, moved to a neighboring state about 2 hours away when my fiancé’s mom remarried. That was about 3 or 4 years ago. Since then, my fiancé and I have been visiting her about once or twice every 2 months over a weekend. 

About a year ago, my fiancé’s younger sister (and only sibling) moved in with her mom after leaving a job in an even further state and breaking it off with a boyfriend. She’s always been very complicated. I think she has a lot of personal issues and demons she’s dealing with, as she frequently lashes out at family members. Generally, she carries a heavy cloud around her that is palpable. 

Time goes on, my fiancé and I start planning what we want to do for our wedding. We’ve talked about it from time to time and both sort of came to the conclusion that we don’t really want anyone to see us get married, but we’d love to celebrate with immediate family right after we legally get married. Our plan was to get married privately between us and a pastor, and then meet up with family right after to have photos taken and just to celebrate in general. My family was pretty receptive to this and excited for us to get married! My fiancé’s mom did not like this idea. Last weekend, we went for a visit and wanted to share the news of our plan! Once he explained it, she expressed wanting to be present to “have closure.” And then very shortly left the room. In this family, it means you go off to cry somewhere. His younger sister suggested he go after her and talk to her. 

After about a half hour, they finally came out and my fiancé then pulled me into another room to explain what happened. At this point, he bursts into tears and tells me that his mom feels like she never got a chance to really see our relationship blossom and grow because of her moving out of state. She also recently lost her father about a month prior, so the wound was fresh. She explained that she never really wanted anyone to see her get married either (for her first wedding) but eventually changed her mind, knowing she would regret doing it alone. She wanted to tell us that even though my own mom may not have said so, she’s probably heartbroken that I didn’t want her to see it, either. My fiancé also told me that he never really thought very deeply about what he wanted from a wedding since he just wanted me to feel happy and comfortable. I have a panic and anxiety disorder, so everyday things like this become very difficult for me without medication. After calming him down, I refrained really from saying what I wanted to do. I felt like our whole plan was uprooted and I was kind of in shock. Eventually, I was ready to talk with his mom and he brought her in. She began by hugging me and telling me she loved me and that she will of course do whatever we want to do, but hopes we can find a way to include families. 

The three of us bounced around ideas and eventually the weekend ended and we went home. I should also add that throughout the weekend, everyone except my fiancé’s mom was being an absolute jerk to us. I’m not sure what that was about, but it was going on even before we brought up our wedding. 

Ever since then, I’ve had this terrible knot in my stomach, and my fiancé does too. I’ve told him how stuck I feel and how I don’t want to end up appeasing people. I also don’t want to preemptively go along with something (like having people present) just because I MIGHT regret it. What I will definitely regret is not doing things our own way. My mom’s response to this is that of course she would love to see me get married but she said it was far more important to her for us to do things our own way. Her wedding was basically hi-jacked by her own mother, so she didn’t want to do that to me. 

My fiancé has been extremely busy with work, so he hasn’t had much time to mull all of this over, but he shared with me that he doesn’t know what he wants to do. I asked him to try and remove both myself and his mom from the equation and to just imagine what he wants. So he’s thinking about that now over the next few days. 

I’m considering talking again to his mom now that I’ve had time to think and form a response for this whole thing, but I’m not sure if it’s necessary. I’m also not sure if this whole thing is related to the fact that the tension in that house all weekend was so thick. Nonetheless, we pushed our wedding back because this is not the type of environment I want to be planning a wedding in. 

I wish we had just eloped on one of our little weekend trips and had it be a surprise. We could have avoided all of this. I wish we still could just do that. But I need to make sure my fiancé can voice his feelings and opinions. I need to know what he wants his wedding to be like. So I just have to wait and deal with this pit in my stomach. Definitely the hardest part of our relationship so far. We both just want to run away. 

Any help, advice, or sympathy is greatly appreciated. This is such a complicated situation I can’t really come up with a tldr. Sorry! ",08Mar2019,1
533,"This is somewhat of a long one so bare with me. I have known a coworker of mine (let's call her Trinity) for over a year going on two. Our company allows for us to go out to team lunches once per month. Our boss emails us specifically asking for suggestions. Prior to this, both I and Trinity had discussed voting for hibachi. However, on the day that our boss asked for suggestions, she came to me and said we'd have to suggest something else as her sister (let's call her Ruby) ""doesn't eat foods from outside American cuisines"". I stated that that was cool but that I'd probably still put in my suggestion for hibachi and a few other local places which I ended up doing. Immediately afterwards, Trinity approached my working space and said that it was unfair that I'd even suggested hibachi knowing that one person from our team didn't like it. I stated that it was one out of a possible 12 that would be submitted, and that everyone was free to suggest how they wished and go or not go wherever the team decided. To this, she walked to her desk and typed up an email that basically said that suggestions should only be placed ""if everyone likes the ideas"", a concern that she'd never shared until that moment for the past almost two years.  


Ruby  then declared via email ""I do not eat foreign foods unfortunately so I will not be voting for the hibachi,"" despite the fact that the original email was just asking where people would want to possibly go. I ignored these blatant jabs at myself, and the team eventually voted on another restaurant which was obviously fine with me until we got to the restaurant. At this time, Trinity made several statements while we were eating such as sitting far away from me, despite the fact that we almost always eat together and shouting ""this food is way better than HIBACHI"" loudly. Afterwards she's largely ignored me, despite the fact that I've been pleasant and professional to both her and Ruby. She's also taken to talking to my friends/colleagues in front of my desk (while still ignoring me) who she's largely discussed not caring for in the past, and who she normally does not speak with. I'm at a lost for what to do. Previous behavior leads me to believe that she'd either gaslight me about her behavior, start a scene at work, or otherwise be completely unreasonable about this admittedly trivial issue. At this point, I do not want to continue the mostly work based friendship due to this behavior and past negative experiences with her attitude but I also abhor this type of passive aggressive mean girl routine. What should I do?",08Mar2019,2
535,"This post is fairly lengthy so here’s a **TLDR** 

I’m not enjoying my current course, and want to switch to IT. I’m unsure on whether to get an apprenticeship or take a 2 year computing course and get a part-time job.
I’ve been struggling to find a part-time job/apprenticeship within bus reach. Therefore, I need a car, but to get a car, I need an income, which is much harder without a car.
I would appreciate some advice on a better way to find either an apprenticeship or a part-time job that doesn’t require any experience. I’d also like some advice on what to do in general.

Here’s a more **in depth explanation;**

I’m nearing the end of my 2 year, advanced college course in Electrical Engineering. While I’ve been getting good grades so far and am on track for D*DD, I haven’t enjoyed this course at all and it’s kind of put me off wanting to have a career in this field. Also, I feel like I haven’t actually learned much since I’ve started the course. Instead, I feel like I’ve just been working to reach deadlines, not actually take any of the information in. 

The main reason I am still on this course and didn’t drop out after the first year is because I didn’t have a backup plan and had no clue what I’d do instead. I thought I’d give the second year a go and see how it went, but my opinion of it has stayed the same - I don’t enjoy it. I’m definitely going to continue and finish this second year (8 weeks remaining or something like that) because there’s no reason not to get the qualification when I’m this far in.

Although I’m still not 100% sure on what career I want in the future, I’ve started to heavily steer towards doing something within the IT sector since I’ve always been interested in anything IT related. While I know this is the field I want to go down, I am still unsure as to which specific section interests me the most (Hardware / software, etc). 

I’ve decided that I have two main options of what to do next (please tell me if there’s other options);

**1) Enrol on the college course ‘Level 3 National Foundation Diploma in Computing’ and find a part-time job -**

I spoke to an IT tutor recently about this course and it sounds really good. There is a wide range of [units covered](https://imgur.com/a/HiwugbY) which will help me decide which sector of IT interests me the most. Also, my college has recently become a [Career College](http://www.careercolleges.org.uk/) which hopefully will be really useful in giving me experience / helping in what to do next. I’ve already applied just in case and I have an interview on the 14th so I can find out more about the course.

If I choose this option, it means that I’ll need a part-time job have an income. I’ll be completely honest, before the past few weeks, I wasn’t trying hard at all to look for a part-time job because I was straight up just too lazy to do so. Recently though, I have been trying my best to look for a local job on Indeed (within bus range and no experience required) and I have been speaking to quite a few careers advisors and stuff for advice on everything. However, the only jobs I can find require some sort of experience / a drivers licence, which I have neither of. So while this college course seems really good in helping me choose what to do, I’m really worried of the possibility of becoming 20 (when the course ends) and still having no income. So the main advice I need for this option is what is the best way to go about landing a part-time job within bus reach. Shall I set-up a LinkedIn account? Is there better apps to use? Shall I use a different method to find one?

**2) Try my best to find an IT-related apprenticeship -**
This option would be ideal in the sense that I would be getting paid while learning. But there’s two issues I have with this; 

1) I’m still not entirely sure what sector would best suit me in this field and apprenticeships seem to be more area specific and not as varied in what you learn.

2) I’ve checked Indeed for apprenticeships and I saw quite a few that interested me, like a trainee support technician, really good pay for an apprenticeship but they were all really far away from me (like 1.5-2 hours by bus was the closest one). There are no search results for me when I limit the distance to 5 miles or less either which is a bummer. 

The main advice I need for this option is whether there is a better way to find apprenticeships nearby since I’m having no luck with the way I’m looking.

Whatever it is I do next year, I really want to start making money since I’ll be 18 soon. While my parents are extremely supportive of what I do, I want to start being able to pay for myself and give my parents money for continuing to live with them. Also, I am really, really eager to start having driving lessons, which are expensive. Being able to drive will also increase my range of how far I can travel for a part-time job / apprenticeship. I’ve currently got like £300 saved up but this is far off what is required to have a sufficiency amount of lessons and pass. 

I’d really appreciate any advice whatsoever on what to do next, which option is the best, or just general advice.

538,"So work has had us handling potientially hazardous materials for a long time, and we dont really follow any of the recommended procedures.

I dont honestly know if i should be taking the warnings on the material to heart, or if there isnt really any danger.

We use Tremglaze S500( its silicone, or chaulk), which the label warns may case cancer, birth defects, and infertity. If you touch it, you are supposed to wash your hands for 15 minutes(we do not), you are not supposed to breath it in(we have no respirators or any kind of mouth protection) and if you get any on your clothes, it should not leave the workplace(ive never heard of work supplying us clothing or any kind of protection in that regard)

Ive known people who dab some on their fingers to gain extra grip. Its seemly impossible to change a tube without getting it on your hands. 

Im just kinda in the dark here. It doesnt appear in our companies MDS list, as far as i could tell, but theres a huge discrepancy between what the label says and how we handle it.

539,"For the past few months, I’ve been getting these flashes of sadness. These could range from an hour to days. As of late, everything has been going down the shitter for me and I feel like i can’t catch a break. Lemme layout what has been happening and what’s causing my distress 

-My gf is mourning over her deceased crush from middle school and brings it up often, even going as far as to say she feels like she betrayed him when we kiss. That started the first domino

-Second domino was when I came home happy as I found God again (I’m Christian, and she basically told me what I believed was a lie and that I needa re-educate myself) 

-third domino was when my Dad had the “man talk” with me and told me it’s okay for me to cheat on my gf and ‘explore’ (I don’t believe that but he shoves it down my throat daily)

-Fourth domino came when I got news from a friend that the project I shared with him earlier, he plagiarized and now I’m at risk of not graduating anymore (I’m already numb at this point)

-Fifth domino came yesterday when ppl saw that I only got 2 hours of sleep and when I got stressed, I’d just shutdown and tear up. Then I worked a long shift.

-sixth domino was today, I got lucky they didn’t kick us out of school, but they invalidated all 11 pages of research and analyzing I did, because my friend was selfish and didn’t wanna do any work. I have to redo all my work and I feel stressed, sad and mad at everything. I’ve been feeling more and more empty inside after each domino and i don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve had depression in the past and I’m afraid it’ll come back even stronger than before. I’m already beginning to lose interest in my hobbies and I’m scared I may not be able to stop this sadness and stress. 

This is a cry for help, please, if y’all have any advice it would mean the world to me. I’m barely 17 and I feel so hopeless and alone because I feel like I’m always wrong and I’m never enough for people. I feel worthless.

542,"First time posting on reddit, sorry if I do something wrong, also Wall of Text incoming. Anyway 21y/o from filipino male here, grew up in Italy. Attended school regularly until the end of high school. At 12 years old my father was already saying things like if you are held back a year i'm gonna make you drop out of school and throw you on the streets, I was a kid so obviously i was scared and i studied regularly. As i was growing up the topic we talked about during lunch/dinner was always the same(it was forbidden to eat separately, we all had to stay on the same table), how i'm a failure, how my cousins are better than me, how they don't have faith in me, how i'm incapable of doing something useful or that i'm a burden. When i stayed silent they would get angrier for no reason, when i tried to say something they would put me down and say that I was becoming an arrogant little shit and berate and humiliate me. During the night my father would wake me up violently for no reason other than he just needed to vent. When his friends were coming over he would make me the butt of all the jokes to show his friends his authority over me, then say that i'm fat(slightly overweight, 13kg from ideal weight/28lbs but Absolutely not obese) but he would destroy my self confidence and i was hearing him say behind me that if i tried to rebel he would beat me up so badly they'd need to pick me up like a stain on the ground. This would go on from 14 up till now. Everything i own is something i bought myself, except for gifts. He would take my stuff and throw it at me, one night, he just barged into my room, took my small monitor and threw it at me because i was awake(i didn't make noises or anything, he just saw some light from the crack under the door) since i was little he would limit the things i like to unreasonable levels, i liked reading both books and comics and he would take them away(mind you it didn't affect my grades, i would regularly take 70-80 out of 100) a relative gave me a game boy and he would take it and say that if i wanted to play i'd have to ask him every time even if it was only for 20 minutes, and other unreasonable stuff like that to flaunt his authority over a 10yo kind who got his first toy. Whatever i did his attitude never changed even when i brought home straight 90s or 100s from school never he said that he was proud of me, so when i got to the last year of high school i just stopped trying and was held back a year. Big mistake. My dad was on the verge of beating me up with a bat, saying how ungrateful i was, how i ruined all his work towards our future etc(he was bragging to his friends how he taught me a lot of stuff, false), never realizing that working without akcnowlegding it was the worst thing a parent could do to a kid,he also took credit for the things i did like repairing stuff or fixing his friend' computers, and i learned that he was also cheating with another woman, trying to justify things saying he never gave the other woman money etc. My mom forgave him but i could not, my mom was the only thing holding back his mental abuse on me from going overboard. 7 years of mental abuse and threats from my father, my self esteem shattered, extremely cynical towards everything and getting apathethic towards life. Then i finished school and got my diploma, i tried to enter a course but couldn't make it in the 25 slots available for that class, and the enrollment period was over when i learned that i wasn't accepted. I drifted from part time to part time all while enduring my father's shouts, dissing and insults(he actually never touched me phisically). After a bit i started becoming depressed because i lost two years of my life doing nothing i lost my only steady job at burger king lost a bunch of other part times and generally being a Neet and a burden, my father began making up lies on how many times i was held back and stuff, how he wants to go back to philippines and leave me here to die. His words were:

D:""I want to go back to philippines""

Mom:""Maybe this time he's gonna find work, let's wait a bit more""  
D:""I don't care about him anymore, if he's not capable of surviving on his own i don't care if he dies, if you want to wait, **you can wait for him alone** i don't want to stay here anymore, Italy is going to S\*\*\* and i don't want to sink in this ship because of my useless son""

In a fit of rage he blurted out something i kinda half expected but ignored until now:

D:""We didn't want you, you were an accident, we only wanted your sister, but here you are because your mom forgot to take the pill. It's your fault that i'm stuck here in italy because i want to take your mom there and leave you to rot here but she doesn't want to leave you. Your sister didn't like my rules so she left(women have an EXTREMELY HUGE advantage at finding work here in italy) you're useless you can't even find work ì'm wasting my time here instead of enjoying my life there i'm forced to stay here because of you""  
Something inside me snapped that day, now i understand why he was always angry at me and why he always belittled and insulted me at every occasion. My mom never told me that. He said that when my mom discovered she was pregnant she cried and said she didn't want another child. So here i am, a Neet who can't even find work useless and apathetic, a bit overweight sleeping as much as possible because i can't find a reason to do anything else and nothing to live for, the only thing keeping me from ending my life are my mom and sister, but i don't know what else to do with my life, i can't find work, never had a girlfriend, have just a few friends, which can be counted on one hand. If my father didn't want another problem in his life, why didn't he use a condom instead of blaming me for his poor decisions in life, i have my own problems. When the psychologist diagnosed me with depression(didn't tell anyone, accidentally left document on desk) and my father learned of it he just said that i was faking it and i was trying to get pity from others.

TL;DR: Dad verbally abuse me for years, I discover I wasn't wanted i'm now drifting in the sea of apathy without knowing why i'm still alive.",08Mar2019,2
543,"Hello, I just wanted to go on here to ask for advice, and wanted to share my life. Also I’m not sure what meta posts are, so I’ll just type this up anyway.
(Pardon my English, it’s not my first language.)

A little bit of background: My mom went overseas went I was 2, and I was left to my aunt, who had to go work in Japan every year and only came back to see me for about three months. I would be taken care of babysitters, that were always changed so I didn’t really make any proper bond with an adult(aside from my aunt of course), and listen, I was very spoiled. My aunt would buy me things I wanted, and wherever school I went to, my aunt would ask my mom to pay for my tuition, and obviously since my mom’s my mom, she would send money. I went to a private school which had my mom deliver $1300 to pay for every year, and this was for about eight years straight. 

As a kid, I was very carefree and lazy, like lazy “my babysitters are live-in and they do all the chores. they get paid for it.”(as my aunt would say, she’s a bit of a strict, and cold person to other people.) I would do whatever I want, of course excluding what my aunt didn’t want me to do(use devices on the dinner table, be loud). And because of that I surfed the internet at a very early age(around 7 or 8, but mostly only Youtube at the time).  My mom would occasionally do video calls, about once a month, but me not really, you know, thinking about her as my mom because of the fact that I really never saw her until she does video calls, therefore not really asking about her or replying to her. Again, I was a brat, a lonely brat. Also, be sure to remember that my aunt cursed a lot, so I was used to cursing at this point, I never really cursed though. My family is very strict, so there is always something violent happening, broom hitting, slaps, smacks and stuff.

2013. When I was 9, I really didn’t feel connected to anybody, adults, friends, no one. I was alone, in my own world, on the internet or playing videogames. No one was bothered by this, although some of my previous babysitters had me do chores, my aunt would immediately tell them to stop, cause I was a kid or something, since they were all busy with their own things to do. I lived in my aunt’s house, three floors(we didn’t have basements), all for me. And I, had the freedom to do whatever I want, and so the first thing I did when we lived in that house, was to run around. Little did little me know, my mom came back to my country. She ran at me to try and hug me, and lil cunt me not knowing who she was, again I never really cared to see what she looked like when I was a kid, ran away. This infuriated my mom, and made her grab a broom, and hit me with it.  So, obviously, the first thing little me thought was, “i don’t like her, i don’t like her”, and this mentality kept ongoing until her second visit. 

2015. I was 11. This time, she lost her job, and went back to my country to stay there with me, I was 11. 11-year old me was a genius, acing tests without needing to do work, not getting amazing grades cause he never did homework. I met my mom this time, and lost the mentality I had when I was 9. I embraced my mom, and really liked her. But problems arose once more, my mom and my aunt had a bad relationship. The only reason my aunt took me in was because she wanted the firstborn male to experience a childhood that she never did. She and my mom had a fight, because one day, my aunt was talking through Skype to my mom’s and her sister, aunt (mk II), and said something rude about my mom. I was 11 mind you, I didn’t know what to do about it and thought, “it’s nothing but an insult”, but my mom being a sensitive person went to my aunt. And my very first nightmare began,
My aunt and mom had a fight, fists and slaps flying everywhere.  They were cursing and everything, my second aunt tried stopping them but what can she do? She’s just a Skype caller.
I didn’t know what to do, so I cried. Very, very hard. By the end of it, furniture was broken, some of my devices were thrown as throwing weapons, my mom was crying to me, and my aunt goes to her room. Just before that, I heard my aunt say that she was gonna kick me and my mom out. 11 years old me, had to choose, my distant and estranged mother, or the very person who moulded me into who I was, my aunt. And so I chose the latter, crying, I went to my aunt’s room. I asked her to forgive my mom, all hicks and crying too. That was the very first time I felt extreme fear, not the horror fear, but the “falling apart” fear. I couldn’t bear my family to break apart, since I only had one parent too. My aunt, very reluctantly, looked at me, I knew she couldn’t bear seeing me cry either, and just hugged me. 

The very next day, I woke up, and found myself beside my aunt, I felt dried tears on my face and shoulder, but the tears on my shoulder weren’t mine. They were my aunt’s. This was the first and last time I ever, ever, felt my aunt’s tears. I’ve never seen her cry, in my whole 11 years of living up to that time. I went outside her room, and walked the hallway, to me and my mom’s room. I opened the door and there she was, still crying, heck I’m not sure if she slept but I think she did. I didn’t talk to her, cause I thought it was her fault the event the night before happened. If she had bitten the bullet, and just let my foul-mouthed aunt say that one sentence, we wouldn’t be experiencing that much pain. She went back overseas a week after, my aunt had paid for her. Actually, my aunt always paid for all my mom’s things. My aunt worked as a Japanese entertainer, I still don’t know if that was the sexual entertainer type but I still very respect my aunt, and paid for my mom’s food, schooling, apartment costs, and the money used to send her overseas to find a good job. 

2016. I was 12. The year my mom finally decided to have me sent to her, in Canada. We lived amazingly for about two weeks, but the first problem arises. I’ve had far too many bad habits from being spoiled when I arrived. So I almost always expected her to do the housework. Of course I had to struggle adapting to a life without babysitters doing housework. I was probably a bad son at the time, I didn’t care about her feelings. This went on for about two years, but I had began to get used to doing chores, heck I’m even doing chores right in between these paragraphs.  We’ve begun to get used to each other, me not so much, and she’s been scolding me a lot. Almost every other week or something. Some of the times, she would tell me “if you love your aunt so much why dont you just go back to her and leave me be”, or “god if the law allowed to kill”. I would always be scared, for my life scared. Some nights after her scoldings, I would stay up. Just to see, if she would stand up and try to kill me. Seriously, that’s how much violence I’ve seen as a child.  Please note that I’ve began to lie, ranging from where I was going, to if I ate my lunch. I was around bad influences.

2019. My mom doesn’t threaten me so much anymore, but I still get scolded a lot. I still have some bad habits and such, but they haven’t become too bad. I just got my report card a few weeks ago, and I am deathly scared, I have below average marks in three classes. I don’t know what to do anymore, all I can do is just listen to music, try to escape reality. Sometimes, I can’t do my homework, maybe because of gaming or me being lazy, I don’t know. I know that I’ve become a bad child, but I’m not sure if I’ve become a bad son. Probably. I don’t know. That’s why I’m posting this. 

It’s 4:19 PM. My mom is coming home. I’ve recently lied and she’s found out about it, I am about to talk to her about my report card.

I'm a 14 year old boy and my parents have been divorced mostly my entire life. My dad has found a girlfriend with emotional problems, who I can't stand to be around. My mother however is still single.

Anyways, my mom and I love eachother alot. But I mostly feel it's like the ""Very good friend"" kind of love, and never really the kind of care my dad has given me. We get into constant pointless arguments about the dumbest shit, and she always pulls the same moves and bad tricks. Mostly I don't want to argue, but she accuses me of wanting me to argue, or making some weird shit up, that I myself find troubling to believe. She  NEVER admits to being wrong, and she'll ALWAYS interrupt when ever I actually try to stand up for myself. Because of this, our conversations almost every time end up in a bad mood.

I have no idea if this is normal, but it's the same everytime. Please please please give me advice! ",08Mar2019,2
545,Bug guy sprayed the basement just now (including other areas of the house).  I am not sure exactly what he used.  I went down there and got a burning sensation in my nose.  Is this a possible cause for alarm?,08Mar2019,1
546," 

ok so the story is

so the other day i talked to a girl i really liked and she let me in a discord server

see most of the time i sit in my room or basement and play tf2 or dota2 and i have severe autism

i think it may be this that got me in trouble

so i told her to friend me on steam so that we can play games together

we did and she was really nice for like 4 days

but then i think i messed up

it was late at night and i thought she was flirting with me so i sent her a picture of my peepee.

later the next day she didnt talk to me at all and waited by me after class

she walked up to my mommy and showed her the picture

the next day i lost all the points my mommy gives me to spend on fast food, computer parts, and milkeys and mommy said i have to go to her house and say sorry to her and tell her family what i did or else she wont buy me any more steam games until i do

so im really scared on how her parents will react and what he will say.

&amp;#x200B;

so the conversation went like

when i get to her dads house

&amp;#x200B;

dad is all like WHAT THE HELL IS FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU ARE YOU RETARDED I COULD CALL THE CYBER POLICE AND HAVE YOU IN JAIL IF I WANTED

&amp;#x200B;

ME i just came to say sorry so that my mom would give me back my good day tickets and buy me steam games this week.

&amp;#x200B;

dad IT SOUNDS LIKE NOTHING BAD HAPPENED TO YOU EXCEPT NOT GETTING VIDEO GAMES FROM YOUR MOM FOR A WEAK MY DAUGHTER HAD TO GET SEXUALLY ASSAULTED

&amp;#x200B;

ME im sorry i thought she was flirting with me

&amp;#x200B;

ED YOUR A JACKASS AND HAVE SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU SAY SORRY TO MY DAUGHTER  NOW AND IF SHE DOSNT FORGIVE YOU I WILL TELL THE COPS AND TELL THEM EVERYTHING 

&amp;#x200B;

ME i go and tell her im sorry and ask her to delete the picture

&amp;#x200B;

becky said  wanted to give you a chance, i wont be talking to you anymore or sending you messages.

&amp;#x200B;

how do i get her dad to delete the picture and not call the cops im really scared.",08Mar2019,0
547,"Apologies for the formatting I'm on moblie. 

A while ago one of my friends tried to commit suicide and I was the one who called 911 for her. That experience made me realize that I am not emotionally equipped to handle serious mental health issues (because I haven't experienced them myself). 

Another friend of mine is having problems at home and I've been trying to help her through it but it the situation seems to get worse and worse everyday. When I do give advice (like go see a therapist, or communicate more) she just ignores me or takes drugs. 

I'm going through my own problems at home but I feel like I can't talk to anyone about it because everyone else is going through something worse. I'm starting to build up resentment towards my friends because I feel like they just dump all their emotional baggage on me. What should I do?",08Mar2019,3
548,"(Let me know if there's a better sub for this idk where to post)
So first semester of college made a bunch of great friends and over winter break some stuff happened and we aren't really friends any more (partially my fault partially theirs but I guess they don't see it that way)

Anyways things were a little awkward after and I tried to reconnect and apologize but she didn't want to hear it.

I rushed a fraternity and have new friends and things to do and I'm having fun but I feel like I still slightly miss them and it bothers me/ brings me down a little.

I tell myself that I don't care about them anymore but catch myself day dreaming about doing things that end up making them jealous if that makes sense (kind of like after a breakup if a guy goes to prom with some other girl and the ex gf is jealous/ sad). Also when I walk past them in the dorm my heart starts racing and we don't say anything but it makes me nervous

My girlfriend is kinda my only very best friend. If i leave her i will not really have anyone to talk about anything i want when i want. I was very miserable and sad before this relationship. I dont really want to be in that same state so i am wrecked thinking about both options and i dont know which to pick: Leave of stay. I am nervous/scared about telling my her(who has no suspicion and thinks everything is fine). I dont want to hurt her and fuck everything up. What we have feels kinda special though and i feel like i wont get anything close to that again in the short run as i didnt before this relationship.

551,"So, I am 17, and lately It seems I only have a limited amount of happiness. Most days, I can feel happy for a little while, maybe for about an hour, until my meter runs out and I get a sudden wave of unhappiness.

It’s the worst because I’ll just be hanging out with my friends feeling happy...and then my meter runs out, and I have to go to the bathroom or something and deal with my emotions. Either that or I have to just stay silent and back out of the conversation for a while.

I’d say my overall mental state is just teetering on the depressive side, and I’m trying to keep it fully tipping. I try to go out and do things I like. And I try to keep myself happy. But I just can’t do those things if I can’t enjoy them for more than a little while at a time. 

Despite what it may seem, I’m actually a really outgoing and active person! I’m usually the center of conversations and I love taking and being with my friends. But..whenever I start to slip my friends notice. They ask “hey you still there?” “Did you zone out?” “What’s a matter?”. I usually have to walk away for a second because there’s only so many fake bathroom breaks you can have. 

I don’t know how to fix this. But I want to try. I have been to therapy before, and I do think I need to go back just yet. I think this is something I can work out on my own, or something I can at least try to work out on my own first. 

Any advice is welcome, thank you.

552,"Last week I called someone about a job they had advertised on facebook. It's for an information center in a small touristy town, full time. The lady who spoke to me about it was polite but seemed sort of rushed, so all up the phone call only took about 2-3 minutes. She didn't ask me anything, and she gave me a very brief description of the hours and job, then told me to come and see her whenever, as long as I sent her a text beforehand to check she was actually there. The job would only start in May, and frankly it sounds like she's just getting somebody to cover her 2 month overseas holiday (she said she was going away, and that the hours would be 6 days a week over that period).

So my question is, am I supposed to follow interview etiquette here or is it more casual? Should I postpone it until I have my shit slightly more together? I was planning on wearing black dress pants, black loafers and a navy striped button down. Thanks to a combination of admittedly poor planning and bad circumstances, I don't even have a hard copy of my CV to bring in today, nor has she asked me to email her one. I'm at a loss on what this meeting actually is, and honestly my lack of experience here is making me feel a hundred times worse. I got taken advantage of to a ridiculous degree in my last job, so I haven't properly worked in about 6 months. I really need this job, but I have no idea what I'm doing anymore.",08Mar2019,2
553,"I (cis female) am married to my husband and I think he’s gayer than he thinks he is. He’s had sexual encounters with men before, but says he could never be in a relationship with a man. He’s deeply ashamed of it, and swore he was straight when we met even though he was open with me that he enjoys sex with men. He was raised in a family that is homophobic and shames gay men and has shamed him for just about everything he’s done. I love him so very much and want him to be happy more than anything.  

I’m bi, I have been since just about as long as I can remember, and am really comfortable with it. I am not currently poly, but am very sex-positive and am willing to try anything healthy and happy that is agreed on in our marriage. 

My husband stays deeply angry and depressed nearly all the time. I have tried to tell him that if the anger is because he’s more gay than he wants to admit or than he wants to be, I love him no matter what. I would happily try having an open relationship so that he could have a meaningful relationship with a man if that is what he wants, and I wouldn’t have to lose my best friend entirely. 

I would be happy to share the house with him and a boyfriend if that would keep any type of relationship between us intact, even if it’s just friends and roommates and co-parents. I would do anything to see him get out from under this cloud of anger, shame, depression and self-loathing, assuming he truly is gayer than he admits to me or himself. 

Any time I bring it up, he becomes angry, hostile, defensive, lashes out, and gets withdrawn. I deeply believe in embracing whatever sexuality we are born with, and I want him to put himself first and find peace and acceptance in who he is and become truly comfortable with himself. I love him immeasurably and beyond words, and I love him any way that he is. 

It is important to me for us to keep our house together, both for stability for the kids and also because it’s much better financially for both of us. I love him and want our marriage to be deep, loving, and last forever, but his happiness and peace is what is more important to me. If he needs to divorce at some point and fully pursue being with a man in order to be okay, I can stand behind that, I just want him to feel right with himself. He is an amazing man, and his capacity for love is huge. He deserves to receive and express romantic love in the way that is right for him. 

I am not trying to be stereotypical, but there are  reasons I am suspecting this beyond what he’s just said about his past with men. He loves anal play, pegging, has a huge collection of anal toys, wears butt plugs daily, enjoys anal fisting, he loves art, he loves decorating, he’s my personal shopping assistant (and he’s good!), he absolutely dresses better than I do. He is turned on by me, and we have amazing sex together, but he avoids kissing as much as possible during sex, and avoids looking at me unless I’m the one pegging him. He prefers gay porn (not judging here, I love lesbian porn). He hopes most of our sexual encounters will be of pegging and anal play. He was hoping to get on PreP earlier in the relationship and have a few sexual encounters with men, which I honestly don’t mind, but we were too tired and worn out to deal with picking someone out, and I had worries about the possibility of transmitting an STI to me. 

He came into the marriage too embarrassed to have toys, and now he’s willing to be open about using them, so that’s progress, but I know he doesn’t trust anyone that they won’t shame him deeply for doing the things he enjoys. 

The difference between him and I is that I’m not ashamed of my sexuality. I wasn’t brought up in a homophobic household, I didn’t have a religious background, and several friends were also bi. My sexuality just is what it is. However, our marriage is seriously struggling and on the rocks due to his anger, lashing out, shame, unpredictable avoidance of normal adult stuff, and his tendency to “hide who I really am because I know everyone will be ashamed of me if they really knew me” (frequent statement in our house). 

I love him. I believe in making peace and enjoying whatever sexual preferences we are born with. I believe in being happy and fulfilled, not in shame or hiding or self-loathing. I honestly believe after typing this all out that he’s gay. I know that men who are married to women and repressing homosexuality tend to be angry, depressed, and feel and act the way he does. 

What can I do to help? How can I show support? Men who have been in this position, what did your wife do that made you feel the most loved and accepted? Is there anything you wished she would have done to make this easier? Do you think I’m correct and that he’s gayer than he wants to be? 

I know this is anonymous, but honey if you’re out there somewhere reading this, I love you more than life itself. I will always be by your side and I will always believe in you, even if there’s another man you fall in love with one day. Or just have sex with. Or whatever. I hope one day you see the parts of yourself I fell in love with and you can look in the mirror and see the incredible man I see. I love you. Always. No matter what. Xoxo.

We're all about the same age and only met due to random housing in college that we got lucky and became friends. We all graduated a couple years ago and work and or go to grad school/work in the city.

&amp;#x200B;

Roommate B will be moving back home after our lease ends due to family reasons, so only two of us will be left. We need to decide if another friend should fill the space (easy) or if we should move out. I talked to Roommate A and said I'm fine with either, but that I was also thinking of getting my own place. I'm older than they are and would probably move out on my own in the next year or two anyways. I think this would be a good opportunity if they're moving out now, rather than up and leaving them. They know all of this and we talked about it recently.

 It came up again between Roommate A and I, and they got really upset and angry, acting like I've never mentioned I was considering living on my own, saying I was screwing them over because they can't afford to live alone.  It really threw me off considering they never got mad before and we're close friends. Now I've been given an ultimatum by them, to tell them now so they can replace me ASAP if I am leaving. However, I was also waiting on their decision to stay or move  (which they knew) because that affects what I need to do.

So much so that her parents would joke around about me marrying her. 



Quite recently there's been some issues at home and she's not on speaking terms with anybody at her house. She messaged me to ask me if she could come sleep over at my house(I live alone) and I said yes because it seemed to me that I would be a bad friend by saying no. I had no idea of all the intentions behind this visit. My best friend, her brother, dropped her off and looked extremely upset, didn't even greet me. He just drove off. She and I watched a movie together and I messaged him asking why he was so upset and if he was upset with me. He insisted he wasn't upset with me, that he was angry at her because of the previously mentioned issues at home. 



After we watched this movie I asked what she wanted to watch next, and as I reached to get the remote she proceeded to kiss me.

579,I left my best friend after she said she wanted to kill her self for attention and some other stuff I defended myself cause I don’t allow people to make me feel less than them. Anyways there was messages sent on a group chat as we all were arguing (as per usual with this girl) we were having none of it and in the space of an hour her friend group reduced to her and one other person. I went to school this morning and the head teacher wanted to see me and I started crying out of frustration (I always cry when I’m frustrated) I go up and get screamed at and the headteacher told me I’m a nasty person and a horrible friend. She spoke to other people and only  three people got left with all the shit. Us three spent our lunch at the offices today and a phone call was made to our parents thankfully my mum didn’t care but I don’t want to go to school on Monday and deal with that. The bitch who got us into trouble called people’s parents and said they’re going to kill them. I’m so scared in case anything happens to my mum and dad now. My gran said if it isn’t sorted out by Tuesday she’s going straight up to the school and giving the teachers a lecture because this stuff happens to my friend group and me too often.

588,"Hi, sorry I'm new to Reddit so I'm not too sure on how things work around here but I'm struggling a bit and would like as much advice as possible. I'll try to keep as precise as I can without dragging too much personal things into it.

TL;DR: I'm in a pickle and my choices are to either drop my current class (and face it again with a scarier teacher that I've had experience with in the past) or push through (for 2 months with the constant fear that I only have one more chance to survive). I would appreciate any advice. Thank you for your time 


About 6 months ago, I have failed a class. My classis put into two portions, theory and application. I've struggled throughout the theory portion and was on the borderline of pass/fail (waiting to take my final) but I ended up feeling the class due to the application portion. We are to be confident in what I will call ""the task""; I kept messing up ""the task"" really badly until the last day where my teacher notice a slight improvement in ""the task"" (not competent enough to pass tho)

Over the past 6 months, I've been solo practicing and trying to apply myself to my previous classes. I'm a little bit prideful and have trouble verbally reaching out for help because I fear getting judged and feel like I and not working hard enough to find the answers myself. 
I get scared really easily and freeze up at the hint of conflict, and even though I've been building my confidence little by little, I'm still unconfident.

Fast forward to current time: I'm retaking the same class and stupid me came into the FIRST DAY of the application portion unprepared. I know what was going in my head, I was an idiot.

I can either keep going with this class. It's risky but If I pass, I get to move on and take the remaining 4 classes that I need to graduate. If I fail (theory or application), I get booted out of the school and cannot return. I had talked to my professor about it and they are willing to work with me along with finding other resources to help me improve.

Or, I can postpone this class and take it again in 4-6 months with a teacher that I had some bad experiences with. I will not have another chance to drop the class so if I mess up the second time around, I'm done for. Because I have trouble reaching out for help, I've never reached out to this (the future teacher) teacher's help before, so I don't know how to approach them and ask for their help (especially being as pathetically meek as I am).

I feel like I've improved a little bit over the past 6 months, but I just can't help but think ""What if I freeze up again? What if I fail the theory portion of this class again?"" I know there's a possibility of passing but I don't know if I have the courage to risk it. 
I feel like I'm underestimating my ability but the same time I feel like I'm overestimating my ability...

I'm really at a loss and I would like as much advice as I can read. Thanks.

589,"We had to put down our family dog, Sophie, today. We got here when I was in kindergarten and she’s been by my side since, I’m now about to graduate high school. It was heartbreaking and one of the hardest things I’ve had to do. My parents were there and we all held her and cried until the end. It was peaceful and done how and when it should’ve been, but it was so hard. 

She’s been having some issues recently, so my dad took her in to the vet today. He called me about half an hour later and told me I needed to come down there and I knew what was happening. They found a large tumor on her spleen and there wasn’t very much to do. She had internal bleeding. 

She was 12 and the most loving animal I’ve ever come across. She loved everything and everyone with such an open heart. I’ll miss her dearly. I know that eventually I’ll move on, it will be less hard, but I could use some heklpful words or sentiments to make right now feel less hard. I’m happy she’s out of pain, she deserves that, but there’s such an absence in our house. She was the first of four dogs and has three sisters who miss her at home.

590,"I have posted this a few places because I’m getting this off my chest. It’s been in me 20+ years. In the past I have chatted 1 on 1 with an abuse specialist from RAINN. I feel a little relieved but also still conflicted. 

This is my confession.

Explorations and first sexual contact for me was with a guy over 20 years ago, I’m 33 now and male FYI.

So I’m married now to a woman and these explorations were when I was a preteen and teen but are relived in my mind a lot.

It went from boys hanging out and doing what they do play sports, watch sports, play games, watch tv and movies. Talks about all that and cars and girls and women used to come up and fantasies and desires. Now there used to be 4-5 of us that regular got together because of our families being close. But I was closest to one of the boys let’s call him M. M was about 4-5 years older then me.

One night it was just my family at Ms house and we were hanging out in the basement like usual and while watching some movie together with some sexual scenes and M asked if I was getting hard which wasn’t uncommon as we all did talk about women around us that we found hot and women in movies etc. I being younger out of the bunch was usually more on the listening side when the older guys were talking about things. But in this case it was just us 2. I said no even tho I was. M said I’m super hard want to see? I declined, but M insisted we show each other and compare “don’t you wanna see what a real dick looked like” he stated teasing me. Both sitting on the couch M pulled his pants down revealing himself fully hard and I noticed his dick was circumcised and I am not. (Around this same age I was discovering my foreskin and bringing it full down and up, I was not shown or told this our cultures aren’t open sexually)

So being gutsy and teased on I also pulled down my pants and both of us were there cocks out with out parents upstairs and his grandparents down the hall in their room.

It went from us touching each other to the sexual scene together to getting closer together. He eventually took my hand and placed it on his cock.. clearly a lot bigger and harder than me I was preteen and he was a teen. I found it interesting he had no foreskin lol and he found it interesting I did. We went from no lips kissing, (folding our lips into our mouths kissing) to soft kisses on the lips. And then we heard a noise and jumped up just before someone coming down and busting us in the act. Good thing about older houses can hear someone about to enter a room.

As we got together quite often but not always alone we would at times have to keep it to ourselves at times, but when it was just us two things lead to talks about that night and sexual desires but about women. We also of course got back to where we left off kisses, making out and mutual masturbation. Things then built up to wanting more and him wanting me to blow him. I was ok with the JO sessions and making out but declined the bjs many times before eventually it leading to that. I never let him cum on me or in my mouth and the same went for him never cum on or in him. He used to time me at times for how long I could do it as it wasn’t always my favourite thing and also the attraction to women still was and is in me. Things started to fall off when he would not reciprocate and only expected me to please him. Being so young I didn’t quite understand the pleasures and desires and things I know now of course but I do have the desires for mutual jos, bjs and fun again. I definitely am more aware of being bi now as opposed to as a kid, it was gay or straight. 

It clearly has an impact on my sexual relationships and intimacy now. It has an impact on my mind and desires. 

Til this day I have never told anyone in my life only random internet strangers. But i want to get my situation and story out there to prevent other children suffering the same way or regret it in the future of not telling anyone. I still feel like I had many chances to but I was more embarrassed about what people would say and think about me rather then FF [family friend]. I was concerned about others thoughts more than my own it seemed. Of the things I was doing rather then FF making me do the things which it was not by rape or physical force but by persuasion and convincing and kind of rewarding with things. I get angry now and as I got older thinking about it but I never confronted the FF or told anyone. I’m still embarrassed and would disrupt lives many lives if it got back and all that. It’s something I have to live with but I don’t want others who are potential victims or victims to stay silent.

Do not suffer alone and do not stay silent. I know I did and still do but you don’t have to. If you’re in a situation of danger or you don’t agree with or like tell someone, or help someone that you see in a harmful situation.

I hate it when people say oh why didn’t this person say something when the abuse was happening or why didn’t they speak up then, why are they doing it years later. They don’t understand hurt and courage it would take they don’t get it because they aren’t in that situation. Sexual abuse situations are more public now with celebrity scandals and etc but it’s a situation that’s out there that effects many people and those comments by some to assume the victim is lying because they spoke up years later is bullshit. I wanna punch that person but also beat myself up because I didn’t speak. 

I’m open to speak about my situation or yours or be of help to anyone if I can or if you can help me in some way. 

I just want to get my voice out even tho I can get it out to people I know. I just can’t do it. 

I don’t want other kids being reserved or embarrassed when they are the victim because they don’t deserve that. They deserve help and justice.

I was taken advantage of and manipulated into doing things and putting myself out there to someone when I was too scared or embarrassed to to speak up.

For example, at the moment my girlfriend is travelling so I wanted to say she looked nice but beyond the few generic compliments I use for everybody I choke and can’t communicate.

So on my campus, I had just gotten off of work and was headed to the University Center for some food. As I was walking in, a guy was holding the door for me while I opened a different one for myself. This dude then points out, “Oh I’m holding the door for you.”

That was a big yikes in my mind, but there’s like thousands of people on my campus so chances of running into him again are slim to none. I ended up going through the door he was holding. 

Fast forward about half an hour later. I’m finishing up my meal when the same guy comes and sits in a booth near me. I’m a little scared at this point since he introduces himself with “I’m the guy that held the door open for you earlier.” I nod and smile, unsure of how to react. He asks if there’s any outlets nearby, which I point out, thinking he’ll leave.

Instead he asks if he can sit by me. I nod politely, immediately formulating some escape plan. The guy sits down and begins to drill me with questions; what dorm I’m in, where I just came from, if I eat in the UC a lot, etc.

Eventually he asks, without any warning, if I have Facebook or Snapchat. I lie and say no, starting to realize that I needed to get out of there ASAP. My anxiety was going full red-alert Cos I wasn’t sure what he really wanted. He then asks for my phone number. I told him it was a little personal and I don’t give it out, same with my email. Long story short, I managed to get away from him and like sprinted back to the dorm.

All I’m wondering is if I’m overreacting to this guy. I’m usually paranoid about meeting anyone, but this really struck me as weird. I’m not particularly pretty or attractive, so I don’t normally get approached by guys. Am I just scaring myself or am I right to be freaking out?

600,"So... I don’t exactly go on Reddit often. I had an issue a while back and I was redirected here after the problem was solved for anything that pops up in my future. I’m here now! 

I’m in love with a woman (let’s call her A) but I don’t exactly know how she feels about me. I also have a hard time explaining my feelings, and reading other peoples feelings. I’m definitely split on this, and don’t exactly have any idea where to go with it. Even though we’ve been great friends over the three years I’ve known her (and both of us are still very much so young. She is 19, and I am 20) and there hasn’t been many moments at which haven’t been emotional in one way or another with a constant tang of curiosity. We converse great together. We have many similar interests but enough differences so that we can be our individual selves and we’ve learned from each other as we’ve gone through life. I’ve been there for her in her most pressing of times, and she’s been here for mine. I’ve got a few goals in the friendship we have now, like doing as much as I can to support her and show that I actually care. Also, to positively support her becoming a more courageous and prosperous individual. At any turn, I’ve always been here to help her. But I don’t exactly want to fade away out of her life. I’m very much so in love with her, and I think she might know this. 

I met A in an outpatient program at a psychiatric hospital. She lived about 2 hours away from me. It wasn’t even a hard love from the start. From the get, when I had met her, I only thought that she was either going to be some girl that I become decent acquaintances with or a quick fling. It really took about a year for my feelings to kind of well up too. She was only really thought of as a crush, and I would end up in a relationship every time those feelings would get to maturing. Which would have to be severed by being loyal to the person I was with at that time. Over time, I started to slowly get a grasp on who I was having feelings for by looking at the qualities I love about her, and applying those to myself. Understanding her flaws, and a good portion of what she does and has in place to keep her sane. After realizing that those qualities and personality traits didn’t matter as much as the charismatic and charming character with all of these cute quirks right underneath, I choose to love her more. I don’t know if that’s a flawed ideology but I didn’t fall for her. It was an over-time process that I had to put an exhausting amount of thought into to understand if the way I felt was real, or some sort of infatuation. I’m not exactly a lonely individual either. I’ve got friends, and I’ve got meaning for myself in the things that I do (work, hobbies, helping others, etc.). I know I’m not flawless either, and always working on that. 

Where I’m mostly conflicted is what I should pursue. I don’t exactly know for sure that I mean to her as much as she means to me. I plan on telling her how I feel soon, but I don’t exactly know what I want from this. I know what I want as a long term goal (her happiness, prosperity, safety, and best of well being) but I don’t know how to shoot for that with my short term goals. We both love each other as friends, but I don’t exactly understand either how we would be NOT platonic either. 

I’m a mess because of this, and I don’t know if I should try to date her, or just continue being a supportive friend and risk losing her to adult life and marriage. I understand that friends stick around, but there’s something about her that doesn’t just let me settle for being only friends. I don’t know if it’s an instinct to just spread my genes or what but I’m being pulled regardless. I love “A”, I just don’t know in what way I should love her for the future, or if it should change at all.

Original post above, but basically my roommate and I have had issues regarding her snoring where whenever I politely bring up my concerns to her, she either a. ignores me and refuses to talk to me or b. is rude to me, insults me, and throws a fit.

We never talk anymore and the environment in our room is so bad I get anxious whenever I have to go the room and I try to go there only for sleeping. She huffs at me, glares at me, and is in general rude to me. I recently reached my limit and applied for a room change, and when I told my roommate about it she started yelling at me, saying that I am accusing her of causing my mental health problems. I never accused her. I said ""I cannot really live in this room anymore, this situation is affecting my mental health which I need to prioritize so I will be moving out after break."" Maybe I am biased, but I do not see how that was accusative because I tried to do the ""it's not you it's me"" thing. She told her mom later how rude it was for me to storm out of the room without talking to her; I left the room in tears and spent an hour crying in the bathrooms? What? 

 I pretty much never cry but after this I ran out of the room and cried while I called my parents because I did not know what else to do. My parents were furious and said they were going to inform her parents of the situation. I wanted to keep things between us but my roommate is incapable of having a conversation without lashing out at me and being defensive. I texted her saying that I was sick of how she was treating me and she said ""You're going to call my parents like I'm in preschool?"" So I blocked her on everything after that.

My roommate is a bully. She is a narcissist and always thinks she is the victim. Any sort of criticism she receives makes her go batshit insane. She verbally harasses me. She is telling our friends made up stories trying to make them gang up on me. I have tried being polite and nice, and in return I get insulted and treated like shit. She is warping the story to make it seem like she is being attacked by me, the evil roommate. When my parents called her parents, of course they believed my roommate's story because their precious angel can do no wrong.  

I will be sleeping on a friend's couch until I get a room change but I will have to go back to the room multiple times to get my things and feed my fish. And of course when I move out I will be in the room for a long time packing up my things. I am afraid of how she is going to treat me. I know she will start insulting me and throwing a tantrum so I do not want to provoke her. I also do not want to let her get away with her behavior, but any time I try to talk to her rationally she does not take it well. What do I do? ",08Mar2019,1

We all graduated a couple years ago and work and or go to grad school/work in the city.

Roommate B will be moving back home after our lease ends due to family reasons, so only two of us will be left. We need to decide if another friend should fill the space (easy) or if we should move out. I talked to Roommate A and said I'm fine with either, but that I was also thinking of getting my own place. I'm older than they are and would probably move out on my own in the next year or two anyways. I think this would be a good opportunity if they're moving out now, rather than up and leaving them.

It came up again between Roommate A and I, and they got really upset and angry, acting like I've never mentioned I was considering living on my own, saying I was screwing them over because they can't afford to live alone.  It really threw me off considering they never got mad before and we're close friends. Now I've been given an ultimatum by them, to tell them now so they can replace me ASAP if I am leaving. However, I was also waiting on their decision to stay or move  (which they knew) because that affects what I need to do.

&amp;#x200B;

We have a couple months left in our lease, so I'm not worried about timing to find a place if so. But man, our friendship is on the line now. Even though I'm fine living on my own, Roommate A seems they'll hold this against me, make the last few months awkward, and ruin our friendship too. Ridiculous.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it fair I ask Roommate A to decide if they want to stay and then we can come together to figure it out? This way, if we're on the same page, we work it out. If not, we're at least honest and remain friends ( but I'm not sure they can see it that way).",08Mar2019,1

My friend was obviously depressed and needed help so her friend convinced her to go to the psych ward. Her insurance didn’t cover that so she decided to go to a rehab clinic. I have a few questions, one. How long do you think she’s going to be in there. And two, do you REALLY need to be addicted to something to check yourself into it? She’s in Florida if that matters. She told me and from what I know she’s only smoked weed. 

Does anyone know things about rehab centers? Can I call her? I just want to make sure she’s okay. ",08Mar2019,1
612,"I’ve been taking lexapro for a while (20 F) and it’s been helping my anger and my feelings of being sad. i feel good, but i think it’s because it’s been making me “numb” in a sense... i don’t really FEEL anymore. i went off it for a while and really actually cried and felt sadness for the first time. it was weird to actually feel my heart hurting. i don’t know what i should do. lexapro helps me calm down and not lash out so easily. BUT when i don’t take it i feel like a normal human being.. not like a robot. my mom said that i absolutely need to take my pills, because otherwise i am a nightmare. she’s threatened to kick me out if i don’t take them... she evens counts my pills and gets angry if i don’t. should i just pretend to take them and keep on smoking weed to medicate, or are my feelings of being zombie like irrational? help me in this trying time reddit! please be kind. am sensitive ☺️

613,"Like the title says, I’m gonna start my first part time job in late April - early May. To me, it’s mainly to grab extra cash and just get away from the house but my mom is hoping that it helps me make friends with other teens. I do homeschool(make any jokes you want I welcome em) so pathetically, I don’t have any friends irl.  

My main concern is how irritated I’ve recently become whenever people try to socialize with me. I hide behind a poker face very easily but controlling my voice is what pisses me off even more. I have zero hostility to the people I talk to, in fact they’re usually people I care about, but I still feel this spark of annoyance when they talk to me..
What sucks is I’ve become so much of a hermit I barely even talk to people online either. Even more sucky, I apparently have an atmosphere that draws people in and want to chat. It sounds dumb but I’ve been told it countless times and it’s unfortunately been proven just as many.

I’m on a mission to fix myself this month and just overall become better. I actually like being quiet and to myself more than how open and talkative I used to be, but I don’t like how I can’t even reply to anyone or start a conversation without it feeling like a chore. Does anyone have any ideas on how I can calm myself down while getting used to chatting again and actually enjoy a conversation?",08Mar2019,1
614,"I’m on mobile so I apologize for the format, and this is a rather long rant over all of the ridiculous things I’ve been handed at work. I’m at a loss for  what I should do. 

 Short version- my boss has set me up for failure, and I also have narcolepsy so at our year end reviews I end up with a bad score since he won’t stand up for me. 

So (23f now 25) I was hired in at my job in October 2016. Literally Everyone else is at least 35 on my shift since its leadership. I have a mechanical engineering degree, but was hired  into  the quality department - they toss all the girls in here. At this point even though my job was “quality engineer” I wasn’t assigned any lines, my job was to make spreadsheets for my boss. I did. I chugged them things out left and right, redid them in a different format for whatever he asked. I thought I was doing a good job. Now I’ve had narcolepsy for years, but at this point I didn’t know. This is my first professional job, and before it I’d always worked and gone to college both full time. I thought feeling dead tired was normal. Well after graduation it continued, I tried everything, ate better, drank more water, exercised, and I even have a strict bed time of 830pm (which made me a laughing stock). Nothing worked. No one took me serious, they all just thought I was out partying all night and that’s why I was so tired at work. How is a 23 yr old more tired than a 40 yr old? I was falling asleep at my desk and in meetings. I couldn’t sit down, even if I thought I was having a good day, I would fall asleep in minutes without realizing it. Before anyone says I should have just stood up- My body would go to sleep before my mind, so I could hear things but looking at me I looked like I was asleep, since I could hear things I would pretty much dream the meeting, so to me I couldn’t tell. How did I drive to work? Lots of coffee and singing super loud. Anyway the year end review comes around and I’m told that perception is reality to many so I was being given a 4 since to the outside it looks like I don’t care. 

Background - we are rated against eachother 1-5, 1 being that your a god among men and 5 is how do you still work here. This number decides how big our bonus is and if we get a raise. If you get a 4 or 5. A 4 you get a small bonus but no raise, 5 you get neither. Since we compete for them so many people have to fall in each category, so your boss has to fight for you. 

This devastates me because I really am trying my best and I’m trying to stay awake and I just can’t.  My boss also knows that I have some type of issue so he knows that not caring is not the truth. 

So this year, right away in January I am given an assembly line to manage the quality for, I am given no training or tools, I have zero guidance at all. I was given this line so that the quality engineer that did have it could focus on their other line since it was going to have a huge launch. That’s fine, but how do I do my job? I could have been the lines process engineer without any issues, quality is something I still need to learn. My youth and inexperience quickly have me at ends with the line leaders as they want a million things right now and I have no idea how to get them. And since I’m perpetually tired I have a bad time remembering things and I’m not very aggressive, so I don’t fight back if it’s not my job I just do my best to help.  The line adds another shift and I get to hire my own techs I think things are going good. The manager of the line keeps canceling the meetings to go over issues so I take it upon myself to do it as driving numbers is part of my job. We get a new manager, and now they’re to busy to come to my meetings because the new product launch that my predecessor is trying to work on and it’s messy so the whole plants out there and I have pretty much no support. So not only will assembly not work with me, they want me to fix all of their issues for them, I can’t get help to finish anything as everyone is gone. 

Somewhere around mid year, I finally get a doctor to let me have a sleep study cuz maybe I really do have a problem and after that I was out on meds and the sleeping thing was no more. So now I’m wide awake like everyone wanted, but the medicine gives me crazy anxiety and makes me rather quick to get mad. The side affects are horrible. They haven’t gone away either. This has also made me a little lippy, my filter is gone. 

So here where things get really messed up. 
Pretty much as soon as I get medicated and wake up my boss piles on more work than I thought possible. There was no let’s see what she can do now that she’s awake, things went from 100 to 10000 right now. 
In the past an engineer only had one line, well everyone is quitting my dpt, and the boss isn’t hiring more... 
So my boss tells me that I’m going to take responsibility for 2 more lines, at this point I have 1 already and a small support area. With these lines I am given 3 techs that someone else hired. 2 of them are the lowest rated techs that should have been DQd a while ago. They reported to my boss for about 8 months and he never did anything about them, I’m told to coach them or find a way to get rid of them. They’ve worked this job longer than I’ve been alive. 
Best part the other quality engineers all only have 1 area. Also to add to the wtf of the situation, I’m an entry level engineer, and they’re all at least one level above me. The one is busy with the new product launch but the other is the bosses favorite. This person doesn’t do much, and their also been able to grow their team and create the dream team for that area so it’s pretty easy going out there. Why couldn’t this person take this extra work on?  

This year comes around, my boss has me come down to go over what I wrote up for my yearly rating. He hasn’t read anything I wrote and I know at this point he’s already collaborated some on where we all will score. I leave the office even more uneasy about where I stand. This has consumed me all year, I fixed my sleeping problem, I want to not be told I’m still not good enough. So they do the scoring and they’re supposed to tell us by X date what we scored and why, he won’t tell me. I have to wait to get my “bonus” so I can do math and find my multiplier which will correlate with my rating. I wake up at midnight to see what I got and knowing the amounts for each score I see I got another 4.  How? I’m defeated, I don’t even want to go to work at this point. I’m trying so hard and I can’t win. I go in for a little bit that day but decide that I would leave early, I didn’t want to be seen crying. 
Today I go in and talk to the HR person that I trust (I trust no one at work, everyone wants to screw you over). I tell her I still haven’t been given my review from him and I’ve gotten my comp statement so he should have talked to me by now. I tell her this whole story and she acknowledged that my boss is def not doing things fairly big lit pretty much said sucks to suck you gotta work with what you got. Then says that she can give me the review herself so I say sure since I might lash out at the boss. This year I was docked for being late to meetings to often, and cursing to much. Wtf. First of all, I’m only late to one meeting that no one ever even goes to, and it’s cuz waking up is next to impossible for me and it’s earlier than my normal working hours. Secondly yes I do curse a lot, but it’s a factory. Yeah I might be in leadership and I might need to “know my audience better” but the men do it! This is sexist as hell and I think that these are both petty as can be for reasons to give me a bad rating. 
I want to be an mechanical engineer and get out of quality (not just cuz my boss is horrible). But with bad ratings I cannot apply for internal positions with any real hope of getting them. 
A bit more on my leader, I’ve never received a straight answer from him, and he loves under-handing his team. He does this to everyone, he’ll go and investigate behind your back then when you present your project to the other leaders he’ll ask you something you hadn’t thought of yet. How can you lead people when they’re now looking at you like you aren’t capable since you can’t think of all the angles, why can’t he wait till after and say hey maybe you should look at this too.  I’m to the point where I just don’t care. I’m not his favorite so until he’s retired I’m gonna be the one he throws to the wolves. I moved a long way from home for this job too so up and leaving isn’t easy. ",08Mar2019,1
615,"So I’ve been experiencing bad mood swings and anxiety ever since I went on birth control. I had extremely bad PMS sand was really irritable when I first started. It’s gotten better and I don’t PMS as bad. But my anxiety is still there!

In fact, my anxiety has been crippling the last few weeks. I decided to switch. I went to see my doctor and got a new prescription. She said it’s unlikely for birth control to CAUSE anxiety and that I’m probably just an anxious individual that is having issues coping with stress. She says this because I experienced crippling anxiety the weeks where I had midterms and med school interviews. So perhaps? But I’ve been experiencing it on and off for the last year. I ended up seeing a counsellor yesterday and she thinks it’s the birth control. So my doctor and counsellor aren’t agreeing what could be the culprit for my anxiety. 

This week has been pretty decent though. I feel happier and less anxious. So I feel like maybe she’s right and it wasn’t my birth controls fault. Maybe I should stick with my original pack? 

The new one she gave me (marvelon) is scaring me as well. The side effects look so much more serious than the one on my prior one. Plus I read nothing but horror stories on it!

616,"I’m a 35 year old mom of two (5 and 9) and my mother is the bane of my existence.  She has struggled with various mental health issues and addiction on and off her whole life but in more recent years she exhibits what I suspect is paranoid personality disorder.  She has elaborate paranoid theories about situations and people in her world- work, landlords, neighbors and sadly me and my husband ☹️. She is great at acting like things are fine and just making a million little comments and facial expressions that make me feel horrible without overtly saying what she’s thinking.  But over the years it has come out in the open at times.  She often concocts notions that my children are unhappy or being mistreated.  She thinks my husband is some kind of a monster and lies about everything.  She reads into every little thing and adds it to her view of the world.  And then she wants to get together and spend time with my kids.  The kids love her of course and I try to protect the relationship but it is so distressing.  I have taken to just putting her off and making excuses because sometimes o think she feeds off the drama if I ever tell her how she makes me feel.  
She wants to get together tomorrow and I am vacillating between making an excuse or confrontation.  The whole thing makes me sick, it’s so awful to know your mom thinks so poorly of you.  I know it’s mental illness, but it’s not so far as schizophrenia so she is still functioning and able to act normal.  What would you do.  I feel guilty to cut her off but it’s insane to keep hanging out and pretending she isn’t reading into every little detail when we are together and thinking of elaborate hurtful and untrue conspiracies.",08Mar2019,1

618,"I'm a 22 year-old male college student living with two other guys the same age as me. Before I get into this, I want to point out that our house dynamic is healthy and we get along very well. However, not everything is perfect and there some issues that arise sometimes. We have a housemate (let's call him Alex) who has the need to make sure he's the alpha most of the time.  Alex is a good looking guy who used to be very muscular/physically fit, party, and get with a lot of girls (also want to point out that he's the middle child with an older and younger brother, for anyone who's familiar with middle-child syndrome). That all came to a halt two years ago when his humerus snapped after a drunk arm wrestling match and has been severely traumatized as this was a huge blow to his confidence (now that he's skinny and the number of girls he gets with weren't nearly as high as they were before his injury). 

&amp;#x200B;

I started living with Alex only a few months ago and I'm noticing that he almost always overcompensates and has to be the center of attention. Whenever he's doing something that is fun/interesting, it has to be posted on his social media to let everyone else know. He lives in the master bedroom, has the king size bed, drives the huge truck, and just recently, bought an X-box to play Apex Legends in his room instead of sharing the PS4 with me and my other housemate in the living room. In addition, his way of thinking is to maximize his own personal benefit even if it's at the expense of everyone else. Here's an example; 

&amp;#x200B;

Last night, Alex took our big TV in the living room and put it in his room instead because he was complaining how he couldn't see well while playing video games on the smaller TV that he has in his room. Now we're left with the super small TV which isn't ideal for watching movies/playing video games with groups of people. Alex did pay for the bigger TV at the beginning of the school year ($40 used), but it's been in the living room this whole time along with our other housemates PS4 so that everyone can watch TV or play video games in groups.  When I confronted him about it, he immediately started shouting and making the argument that since he paid for it he can put it in his room. That's not necessarily wrong but the way my other housemate and I see it is that, we should have the bigger TV in the living room since more people use it at the same time whether it's watching movies or playing video games together, which requires a bigger TV instead of a smaller one. We believe that it's fucked up that he's maximizing his own utility at the expense of our utility. How do we convince him otherwise? 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, after setting up the small TV downstairs, he texted our house chat this, trying to say how good of TV the smaller one is compared to the big one lol. Btw, I forgot it's not even a TV, it's a monitor. 

""Honestly not bad for rn! It’s better resolutions and when ur up close like this it’s fine, can someone try and find an affordable new tv for downstairs because I honestly really wanted to have a tv upstairs for watching Netflix and playing games and then this tv (now downstairs) was suppose to be my monitor and it helps me code and have multiple layout""

I’ve had a few people over the past years who I’ve been best friends with and things didn’t work out. In the past year I’ve reconnected with each of them and were friends I guess. The thing I really miss being best friends with people and there’s still a part of me who loves them immensely and wants to make them happy. With some of them I’ve tried to make an effort to be close again but it seems like they’re not interested and I don’t want to push it and make them uncomfortable. I understand that they most likely don’t feel the same and that’s totally understandable. Despite this I just spend way too much time missing them and thinking about them. It just feels like my heart is set on some people and can’t let go, but it’s starting to feel unhealthy and it’s upsetting. I know I need to get better at letting go of the past and people in general so I can move forward and focus on getting close to new friends who are just as interested as I am. ",08Mar2019,2
620,"I normally don't post on Reddit - just read through subs for fun, but I need help and figured this might be a good place to turn for help outside of asking family/friends.

I am a freshmen in college and currently live on campus. The thing is, I have two sisters who are also in college, however, they go to a community college where the state I live in offers the first two years free. So basically my two sisters are going to school for free right now and will go to a state university/college for their junior/senior year and pay for themselves or with student loans. I go to a state university, however, it's only because I received enough scholarships to only have to pay for housing. My parents pay for my housing, and, to be honest, it makes me feel like shit because they're basically just paying for me to live there while my sisters go to school for free and work. I live in state too, so I could commute 45 minutes, the only reason I didn't is because my mom wanted me to be able to experience at least a year of living on campus and because I don't have a car. 

My plan for my sophomore year was going to be to apply to be an RA. If I did that, I could use the money I have saved and money I will make over the summer to buy a car. That way, I would receive free housing next year and have a car so that I could save up for when I'll pay rent to live off campus my junior/senior year. The only thing is, I found out today that I got waitlisted to be an RA. 

I don't want to get my hopes up that I might be offered a position, and I don't know what to do. I don't want to live on campus with people because I would just feel guilty the whole time if my parents pay for it. I could take out a loan, but that's stupid to take a loan out for some piece of shit dorm. I could also commute, but it's 45 minutes and I'm on an athletic team and always have practice, and I don't have a car. I just don't know what my best option is and need an unbiased opinion. I think I got my hopes up on the RA thing and was kind of banking on that happening. Now that it isn't I have no clue what to do/what is the smartest thing to do.
