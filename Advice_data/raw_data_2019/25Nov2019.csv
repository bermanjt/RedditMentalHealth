0,"My mom wants to move in her boyfriend and all of his kids (3), and my only sibling will probably be moving out to avoid it. I’m not a big fan of this. To start, her boyfriend is just okay. He’s not a bad guy, but he seems arrogant and like he needs to be right all the time. I don’t know his kids very well except one who’s one of my friends (friends before our parents got together). I feel like she’s going to be clingy, she was ready and excited to share a room, but I insisted to my mom that that was an absolute no-no. Something I really value is my alone/quiet time which is going to be super difficult to find in a house of 6-7 people. My mom hasn’t been great about this either. She once called me in to talk about my feelings about the situation, saying she wants me to be happy, but she really only seems to want me to want what she wants. Not to mention, it took some time for me to really establish what I absolutely needed in her head, she used to say “Worst case you just have to share a room with *my friend*”",25Nov2019,1
1,"Okay so the title probably sounds like I'm being all dramatic but like... this honestly bothers me. 

So, My Brother is 28, his girlfriend is 24 and I'm 18 (my birthday is on Tuesday) 

For privacy reasons, let's call Her Jessie, and her 5 year old son is Cody. 

My mom is constantly slamming me and telling me that I dont know the basics of living. Can't keep things clean. I break everything. I can't cook to save my life. I won't make it out in the real world because I can't do a single thing right. Tells me I'm too stupid for college and that I'm gonna live on people's couches like a crack whore and work in a factor doing the same job over and over again at minimum wage because I can't understand one simple task, blah blah blah 

But with Jessie, she does the EXACT OPPOSITE. 

Mom tells her that she's so smart, and pretty, and that she's such a good cook. Mom tells her all the time that she is so impressed with how well she's done in college and that she is so glad she is happy. She treats my brother's girlfriend like a Queen half the time.

Mom JUST told her (20 minutes ago):

 ""I'm suprised that you don't know how to cook liver!! I honest thought there was nothing you couldnt do! You're so talented and amazing! I'm honestly shocked!""

But when I tell Mom that i dont know how to make mashed potatoes right and I'd like some help she goes off and tells me I'm a shit cool anyway and she'll just make them. So like......idk. 

And on top of that she treats Cody like he isnt a part of the family really. 

My older sister has a 4 year old daughter and my mother is CONSTANTLY getting this and that for her but she never buys anything for Cody, doesnt really think of him often. It's very rare that she just up and decides ""I havent gotten him anything. Maybe I should give this to him.""

It bothers me a lot and i domt know if that's me overthinking or what. Am i just being dramatic about this or is there really a double standard between Me and Jessie???",25Nov2019,1
2,"Have any of you ladies moved far away from family alone to start over? Did you have any fears? If so how did you overcome them... I'm ready to move and start over somewhere new, but I'm very nervous to be 5 hours away from family with all the human/sex trafficking going on.

3,"I've started developing feelings towards a friend who is trans. I find it impossible to even admit that to them, not to mention that we are not from America, so everything would be insanely difficult to maintain.

4,My parents and grandparents are super religious (my grandpa is the preacher of the church) and very judgemental. I tried telling them once before but I got sent to a church camp and I got grounded from my phone and I had to cut all contact with my non-religious friends (I didn't actually do it I just hide the fact that I talk to them now). That was 9 months ago and I'm still being forced to go to church. What do I do now,25Nov2019,1
5,"She lives out of state now, moved away several years ago, and is now suddenly texting me constantly saying she’s thinking of me, misses me, and loves me. She never said that stuff to me when I was a kid and it has obviously left a deep wound and feelings of resentment. I don’t know how to respond because I don’t feel that way towards her. I had to learn to be independent and live without love until I met my boyfriend five years ago. It’s still hard for me to tell him I love him out loud. It feels so emotionally manipulative at this point. All I wanted was for someone to care about me when I was a kid. I learned to be strong and find my own family in friends - and now she wants my attention. I tried to pretend and say what she wanted to hear, I tried to confront her at one point but then she responded with, “why don’t you like me anymore?”

I don’t know what to do.",25Nov2019,1
6,"The title says it all, I’ve been dealing with this for a while and it’s getting worse and worse. It is sometimes affected heavily by the nature of the pornography I watch (when I occasionally watch trap/trans) but isn’t limited to this.

7,"Hi all,

I’m currently in high school and have plans of joining the United States Navy as an aviation machinist mate (basically an aircraft mechanic) right after I graduate and it’s been my dream job for a while now. I don’t want to go to college right after high school just as a personal preference. I’ve never been too great in school. I want to join because I genuinely enjoy working with my hands and tools. My uncle has been in for at least 15 years now and worked the same job up until recently when he got higher in the ranks. However that’s not the reason I want to join. I want to join solely because that’s what I want to do. That’s what I can see myself enjoying in life. I don’t want to be a part of the majority of Americans who don’t enjoy what they do for a living. Unfortunately, my mother doesn’t support that dream of mine because she claims it’s not great for living conditions. And she’s not wrong, but I’m very aware of the living conditions and the fact that my pay would be below minimum wage. (it’s below minimum wage because the Navy offers really great benefits) I will be able to travel the world which I’ve always wanted to do and get payed for it on deployment. I’m currently a class officer and I’ve always had a part of me that’s always been willing to serve, whether it’s been my school, community or (eventually) country. I’m not sure how my dad feels about it, but I feel like he would support me more because it’s his brother that’s in service now. I know some of you will probably think I’m young and my brain isn’t fully developed or whatever but I’ve given it a lot of thought, put in my research and I’m 100% sure this is what I want to do. I’ve explained to my mom that if I don’t like my job there, I can always go to college after my 4 year contract is over and the Navy will pay for it, and I would go into psychology or ophthalmology but that’s my second choice. 


I just kind of wished my mom supported my dreams cause she’s always been the one to tell me I could be whatever I wanted to be. I don’t know if I should let her opinion affect my dream or not, cause she’s my mom. If it was literally anybody else in my life that told me no, I would go in anyways. But it’s my mother.",25Nov2019,1
8,"Litteraly this morning i got the text from her. Pretty shitty, and i feel pretty shitty. I usually play guitar to release my energy but its just not working. What are so ways i can release all this pent up sadness, rage, and everything else im feelin?",25Nov2019,1
9,"I'm relatively new to my job, where I've been for almost 5 months. I have wanted this job for over a year, and the application process and getting back to me took forever.  

Since I've started, I'm working for a new manager which used to be my coworker. I'm loving how her and I work with each other and she gives me great feedback, but any time that I make a mistake or I let her down, even for the smallest of things, I feel like I'm on the verge of getting fired (even though I've heard our department is necessary for the job and I've got some job security). My previous job was very hard on me and had high expectations of me, as I was thrown into management. 

Apparently people only say great things about me, but maybe because of the high expectations for myself and how hard I am on myself, I feel like I'm letting my manager down and I wish I was more helpful rather than asking to help her, then not really being able to help her. So then I get overwhelmed and I had a melt down at work with just being overwhelmed with all the thoughts I have of myself. 

I went to counseling in college and I feel like I need it again. Help :(",25Nov2019,1
10,"there were 3 things that were stopping me from doing it. 1. religion, 2. my family would be sad, 3. it would really hurt. the reason I thought about it is because not only did I realize that i'll never get a wife or girlfriend, but also my favorite person in the whole world is dead, along with my dogs. on top of that the world has become increasingly insane. if it wasn't for my 3 reasons to live, I would have done it by now. some days I wish God would take me away from this lonely existence. don't tell me to get therapy because it's expensive, stupid, a waste of time, and gives terrible advice. if I went to therapy, they'd probably tell me TO kill myself.",25Nov2019,1
11,I finished undergrad this past May and have moved back in with my parents to save up money while starting grad school.

12,"This is going to be a long post but I really need advice (and just a little time to vent).

I'm 24 (F) and graduated college Fall 2018. It's been almost a year now but I've done nothing. I thought that once I got out I would be able to at least get a job as an assistant or secretary and get experience but I've applied everywhere and never received a response. I live in CT which is a small state with really nothing going on, as I have discovered this past year. I want to work in publishing or editing (I have an English degree, yes, I know, bad choice, it was too late to change without having to spend even more money on school) but there are few places hiring and the few that are, never respond. What I really want to do is be a writer/artist. I'm working on illustrations for my Grandmother's children's book but it likely won't make very much money and I've never gone to school for art so I'm not the best. I'm also working on my own writing but novels can take a long time and there's no guarantee anyone will like it.

I honestly don't even know why I got my degrees (English and Linguistics). My dad wanted me to go to school (but didn't want me to do art) and in the first year I had no idea what I wanted to do. I thought about leaving school and joining the Navy (Dad's in the Navy), but my dad pretty much gave me a hard no because ""he did that so I wouldn't have to"". I could have joined anyway but at the time I was a super meek person and didn't have much confidence. I still don't have much. 

Now I am considering joining again, I've even talked to the recruiters and submitted my medical records. It just feels like I have to catch up with everyone else. I'm 24 with absolutely nothing to show for it. I've got 2 useless degrees unless I go get a masters, which I can't afford (already have loans I can't pay). My sister who is a year younger is already set up with a great future, she's at a high-paying internship and set to be hired full-time when she graduates. This makes me feel even worse (obviously I'm happy for her but it's hard not to compare myself to her). I've just been wasting away at retail jobs that have nothing to do with anything I want to do.

If I join the Navy I'll come out with 4 years of experience plus paid training (hopefully as a CTI). And then I'm hoping that I can use the GI Bill to pay for an art program at a college (after using my time in the navy to build a portfolio). But that in and of itself makes me depressed (not clinically, but still a downward spiral of sadness). By the time I leave the Navy I would be 30 and going back to school with people much younger than me. It just feels like I've wasted 4.5 years of my life on two degrees for nothing. And I'm moving in reverse. On top of all of this I have no friends near me, I have some from travelling abroad and I love them but it's not the same, they're not here with me. We can't hang out or go to dinner. I left a toxic codependent friendship before going abroad, which cut me off from other friends. Then I never got close with anyone the semester after I came back. I've also never dated anyone which is its own source of insecurity. 24 and never really interacted with anyone romantically. Which has made me nervous about being intimate with anyone, even with online dating. All I do is go between work and home. I try to work on my art but it's hard to stay positive about it when nothing is going well.

My grandma wants me to go with her somewhere and work wherever I can and on art and with horses (she's trying to work on opening a rescue/farm). But there's no guarantee that that would work out. I could end up at a dead end job for the rest of my life. My mom is thinking of having me help her do appraisal work which could be great and I appreciate her help, but again, I might do that forever and be stuck in Connecticut without ever doing what I really want to do. I also want to travel. Living in a whole different country on a whole different continent was the best experience I had in my entire life.

I feel like the navy could be my escape, though I wish I had done it earlier. But I'm worried that if I join and never make friends that I'll be more miserable. But I am already miserable right now, living at home, nothing to show for my debt,  no friends, and trapped in CT. 

What should I do? I just feel so trapped and don't know if I'm actually rushing into something bad because of that trapped feeling or if I really am making a good, logical decision. Are there other options that I'm not seeing? Also, how do you make friends away from school?

Sorry for dumping my life on you but I just can't really talk to my family about it. They don't especially like the idea of the military, and I think they'd feel sad or guilty if I told them how sad I feel. Thank you for your advice in advance, I'll take any advice about anything, in any form (tough of otherwise).",25Nov2019,1
13,"Hi there,

So long story short, at some point in 2020 I will be moving away from the town I have grown up in for the last 14 years in order to wipe a clean slate and reinvent myself. I'm currently saving up money to cover 12 months of expenses just in case of emergency and I have 2 people who will be witnesses for a Deed Poll. I have no friends to complicate matters and my only family was my mother but time took her many years ago. I have no debts as I finally cleared those back in July and the minimum notice I have to give work is only 3 weeks. I'm currently only renting a bedroom and the house owner is perfectly fine with me giving 4 weeks notice before moving out and stopping payments of rent. 

Is there anything else I should consider so once the time comes I can look forwards and not backwards?",25Nov2019,1
14,Hey guys I know this post is pretty immature but I wanted to get some advice. I’ve (17m) been talking to this girl in a few of my classes for a little while. We don’t talk a ton mostly because there isn’t a lot of time in our classes we have together and I feel like we don’t really have anything to talk about but I really like her and want to ask her out btw I’ve never even been on a date before. We don’t have any of the same friends and she’s popular and hot and I don’t have many friends in general. I’m pretty sure she likes me but I don’t know her well at all and don’t wanna scare her off or anything or wait to long so she doesn’t like me any more or something. Whenever we’re talking in class we’ll hold eye contact for a long time and she’ll smile at me a lot. When I told her what college I’m going to she started blushing really hard and her friend told me she’s going to the same college. Anyway I know this is pretty childish but I have zero relationship experience and I don’t want to mess anything up so I would really appreciate any advice.,25Nov2019,1

17,"A little background; my family is kinda spread around the states.

  My sister used to live in the middle of nowhere with her husband and two (obnoxious) kids.  Don’t get me wrong, I love them, but they have very “outgoing” personalities.  My step kids are very quiet, shy and reserved and they don’t exactly get along with my niece and nephew all the time. 
My sister and her husband moved back a few years ago and I was beyond excited to have my sister back, we used to be so close. My husband and BIL get along really well but my sister and husband can be at odds sometimes. 
My mom does a lot for my sister like watching her kids, letting them live with her until they were able to buy a house, paying their car payment etc.   I get the feeling that because I didn’t have any of my own kids, my mother and sister have a closer relationship. My mom helped her to raise those kids.  I think she’s finally accepted that I am not ever going to give birth..

As of late, my husband and I have had zero interest in spending time with my sister, BIL, or their kids.  Every time they’d come over for a football game or just to hang out, she and her husband argue(the whole time) or have to wrangle their screaming children. 
I know she’s upset that we never invite them over or ask if they want to hang out.  She’s doesn’t interact with me on social media nor have I heard anything from her for a few weeks. 

Are we jerks for not making an effort to spend time with them?",25Nov2019,1
18,"I live in NC and that’s probably enough to give me away to the manager, but i need some advice.

I live in an apartment where I’m pretty sure if you can smoke something, my neighbors do. It seeps into my apartment. From what I’ve been told by people that do use it, my neighbors must have the cheapest awful weed ever. It reeks horribly and sometimes keeps me up at night. 

I’ve been told to call the police but I don’t know which neighbor (if not all) are doing it. I don’t want everyone hating me. Anytime I mention it to the manager, it’s brushed off.

Recently, the manager acts weird. Like they are nice but have said weird things about how great the apartment smells (it doesn’t , it reeks of cigarettes at the least) and there were unannounced visits when the lease requires 24 hr notice but it seems to be only my building this happened to.

Anyway, I’m trying to leave this apartment and go elsewhere. I’m pretty sure the apartment manager think I do drugs. I don’t. The only drugs I take are from my doctors and are completely legal. 

What should I do to leave without causing a fuss in this situation? And, in case the cops are called by someone, what do I do in that situation? Some of my clothes smell sometimes due to the smoke coming in.",25Nov2019,1
19,"My mother who I haven't heard from in months and haven't seen in years contacted me few hours ago. She said that she's sick, though it sounds like way more than just being sick.

She wants me to ""pull the plug"" on her life support if she goes into a coma. She wants me to come to Virginia to see her but I really don't know. She often lies about health issues. 

There have been many, many times where she's done that. I don't want to leave take time away from school (in my senior year no less) only to find out that she's lying. I'm so lost. If I talk to my uncle (who I live with and the only ""trusted"" adult in my life) he'll just immediately dismiss it and get mad at me for even considering that she might not be lying so I absolutely can't talk to him. I really can't take being yelled at right now.

I spoke to her about us not spending as much time together and she agreed, she even said we should set up a time to meet and catch up. She thinks of me as a really close friend tho:/ I have no idea how to proceed, no idea how to tell her, I can handle the rejection even if it happened but I don't think I can handle losing a friend.

21,"So to preface this, I am 16 years old. I have really bad anxiety issues, but they come up in flairs. I repress most things because my parents always yell at me and punish me for “faking mental problems”. 

I’ve been having one of those flairs recently. They come out at my friends, because I have nowhere else to go. I think I’m a good friend at my good moments, but today was probably my absolute worse around them. I was rereading the text conversation in our group text and I was horrified with myself. I’m very toxic to be around when my anxiety flairs up, I blocked them on all social medias, then told them I wasn’t going to talk to them for a while, but the moment I get my shit together I’ll be back. Before I blocked their numbers there was a flood of texts telling me not to go, but I did anyway. 

This was yesterday. I think I need at least two weeks to repress the anxiety again, or get it all out when I’m alone. That’s how long it usually takes. These are the first friends I’ve ever had, too. I’ve never had this happen with friends. 

My main question is how am I going to go back? By that time I’d have abandoned them for two weeks. They’ll either be angry, or have their opinion of me severely lowered. I don’t want them to leave me... I’m not sure what to do.",25Nov2019,1
22,"Hello fellow redditors,

I'm in a bit of a strange place at the moment, and am looking for some advice from people who maybe have gone through similar things. 

So in a bit of a back story, myself and my group of friends, there's about 12 of us, have been very close since we were all very young, around 9/10 years old. We're all from the same small town and have been hanging out there for years. As we've been getting older, people are starting to go their own ways, and the only thing we tend to do together now is either go to some sort of clubbing event, getting majorly high off of cocaine, or going to the pub to drink alcohol, they never really feel like doing anything else when it doesn't contain either of these few things.
At the beginning of this year I went travelling, and it really opened my eyes and made me realise the other sort of people who are out there, people who are driven, like to take risks, and just adventurous... I suppose these people are so called 'yes' people cause they like trying new things and testing themselves. 
But it also showed me there is so much more to life than either going to a pub to get pissed, or going out to do drugs, and since returning home I've had to distance myself from them as it's all they seem to want to do, and it kinda upsets me to see.
Along with all of this, when I returned from my travels, I moved in with some family who live outside of my original hometown, only a 30 minute drive but it adds an extended restriction on what I can do with them, and now that I live further afield and with my changed interests, I can tell my relationship with them all is slowly disappearing.


I'm a reallllllly social person, I sometimes get so low when I'm not surrounded by people, as I feel like I'm the best version of myself when I'm with other people making them laugh and enjoying life with others. 

I suppose the sort of advice I'm after is people who have gone through similar things, I know that when people grow up then they start to drift apart, but how did any of you deal with it? Have any of you got good ideas of things I can do (hobbies, etc) maybe even by myself so that I don't feel the need to be surrounded by people all the time to feel happy and content?

Cheers all!!!",25Nov2019,1
23,"When I (25F) met my (35M)bf, I thought he was the perfect guy for me. We've been together for a year and now I'm starting to see his ugly side. We live together and whenever he gets angry, whether or not I'm the cause, he always treats me like I've done something horribly wrong and makes me feel like my life is meaningless. I know what he is doing is abuse. Mainly verbal abuse. Idk how to leave. 
I grew up with an abusive stepdad so I feel like all I know is abuse. I keep forgiving him when he apologizes.
When he really hurts me is when I feel the strength to leave but I don't have the financial stability to live on my own. I'm a full time student. I don't have any close friends. I don't have supportive family. When I lived with family, they just take advantage of me and abuse me.
When I moved out of my familys, I thought I wouldn't have to deal with this abuse anymore. Its always held me back from finishing school, getting a license, a place of my own, from growing up. I thought that moving in with my bf was my way out. I thought I wouldn't have to be treated like this anymore. I thought he was the only person that was supportive of me.

25,"To move or not to move.

I am a 24M , with a full-time job, average paying in a high cost of living area. I graduated from university two years ago and have been working for about a year and half now. 

I had a plan to stay at home for a year to aggressively pay off my loans and build some wealth. After my loans were paid off (6 months after the job), my single mother (divorced and has gone through a number of serious relationships) started to charge me rent. It started off at $300, then up to $500, and now up $700, which is market price for a room in this part of town. It’s close to the city but not close enough where there much going on without having to take some pubic transport over.

I floated the idea of moving in the summer and had went maniacally looking for a place. For both GOOD and BAD reasons, convinced myself out of at least a dozen of places. I even ended up putting a deposit down with two random roommates (didn’t work out), and after that moment, I stopped looking say a month ago. 

Reasons that i had throughout the four month search: my budget kept fluctuating “1100 to 1600 to 1300 to 1200 to 1000”, no windows, weird roomates, too far uptown, no living room, this part of town is not my type of people, etc. 

Searching for an apartment is a lot of work. And I had decision paralysis. But I realized, it was more than just those silly reasons, everyone in NYC whose middle class has to make those tough decisions. For me it was more. 

What is holding me back is fear.. I haven’t done the best in terms of dating — my confidence is shot from my rare disease and shorter stature — and moving seems like a start of reckoning so to speak. Meeting new people has always been tough for me, despite — with some humbleness — I have a great personality. I guess its my high functioning depression.

Here is my list so far:

Pros of leaving:
- Being in a new place means I don’t have to deal with some of the normal rife and tension that builds
- Potentially closer to work, not by much, but the commute would be more enjoyable. Instead of taking a bus, train, it would just be one train. 
- There’s this been weird dynamic in my life, where I believe that because my mother controlled my life and not letting take charge of my medical condition, I’ve never have the courage to discuss my condition openly with anyone. There were a few instances, but I never wanted it to define me. But I feel when I am independent, I’ll be able to muster the courage to make my appointments and see how much the surgery would cost, and arrive at an independent conclusion, whether to go ahead or not. (It would mostly be cosmetic).

Cons of leaving:
- Especially as someone from an ethnic background, I feel some guilt leaving my mother alone.
- Probably double the cost of living, rent would be around 1100, and then laundry, extra food cost that I don’t pay for at home, added cost of buying furniture and misc things. Not hitting my financial goals. 
- My grandmother, who is not doing so well health wise and having lost her spouse a year ago, is only a 10 minute walk away. I barely get to see her on weekdays because of work, and only see her once on the weekends. I love her the most, but I’m not sure if I should feel compelled to put a pause on my life. But... she is the sweetest person in my life. 
- I would definitely need roomates, which is both good and bad.
-Making new friends in a completely different part of the city. 


I look to my brother, who went to military after graduating from college in a complete and utter turn of events, and is now married, living in another state, and for the most parts, seems to have his life in some order.  He doesn’t really see my grandparents often, and comes home only seldom, mostly just the holidays. I don’t know if he has an ounce of guilt or not, but I’m inclined to believe not just the way he acts. He took charge of his life.

Part of me wishes I didn’t live so close to NYC, and quite frankly, working in the city, because if I had a job in another state out of college, I would have been forced to move out and start life.

I’m afraid of the next step.",25Nov2019,1
26,It took me 7 hours (I timed it) to do a Chapter P review of Pre-Calculus. I am one hour into Chapter 1 now. And I took one break so far (20 minute break). I am frustrated. I don’t understand math. All I am doing is guessing or memorizing because when I try to understand it makes no sense and sounds like random symbols to me.,25Nov2019,1
27,"I was having a hard time at work as another colleague was being negative and making me feel like general shit and saying things like, ""we were put here because we're not as good as the other workers and they look down on us"" and that we should quit. It was really starting to get me down and feel unworthy against my other employees as much as I tried to ignore it.


I finally decided to confront my boss, but was conflicted and felt guilty as this person wasn't intentionally horrible in nature and that night I didn't get much sleep.


I decided to do it after work but felt emotional and lucky I had a supportive co worker who kept checking up on me.


It wasn't until a nasty supervisor came and yelled at me asking how much of something I'd made and just yelling numbers and asked me if I'd been following the chart all the words started to jumble and get confusing as she was talking a mile a minute and it overloaded my head and I cracked (I already have anxiety).


They asked me to come into the office and make an incident report and tell them what was going on. I explained about what had happened with the colleague and they wrote down all she had said and said they would take it to the general manager but keep it confidential for now. I also said it [the negativity] had been impacting on my mental health and she told the other supervisor to write that down.


I have never cried in front of anyone and felt pathetic but it was carthatic finally telling them and I felt really guilty. I assured them that I would improve now that I had gotten that off my chest and felt like a burden had been taken off. They asked me a few times if I would follow and remember what they said as on that day I was learning a new dept and had to clarify a lot of stuff that I had learnt briefly a month ago and I had a lot going on in the meantime, it seemed like the biggest imposition to just assist me to refresh me on all that stuff and they acted like I was stupid for not remembering.


I'm not, I study law full time and have a really good memory but just wanted a refresh.


Anyway, I check my roster today and they have rostered me off all week (it's opening week) and this has made me scared.


If I was fired I wouldn't be still on the roster and they would have contacted me right?


Did they just want to give me stress leave over the most stressful period?",25Nov2019,1
28,"Warning: this is LONG but necessary to fully explain my situation

&amp;#x200B;

So I've been friends with this guy since we were in elementary school - we went to the same elementary, middle, and high schools, and he's a year older than me. Fast forward from there, we both moved across the country for college (but two different schools within a short distance of each other.) Last semester, we tried dating and everything just went downhill from there: we no longer talk or hang out and I can't tell if I miss the memories I have with him, or the validation he gave me, or if I actually do love him but I can't admit it to myself. I'm going to give some background because we have always had a complicated relationship and I never knew what to make of it. 

When we got to high school, he told me he found me attractive and would blatantly hit on me, but not a whole lot changed. We still remained good friends, talked everyday, gave each other advice, etc. Sophomore year he told me he didn't want to date but was interested in hooking up. We made out once and I wasn't really into it. We still continued to talk/snapchat just about everyday and he would tell me I looked hot or that he wanted to hook up again and things like that, and I didn't think I really wanted to do it again, but I also wasn't sure if I wanted to date him. I liked/hooked up with other guys throughout high school, but he was always in the background kind of as an option if I wanted that (which I know is a shitty way to view someone who is one of your closest friends.) I was extremely insecure in high school and I think I just loved the attention he gave me and the fact that someone was interested in me. 

He attempted to kiss me two other occasions where we were hanging out alone, and I got mad at him for it because I was interested in hanging out with him as friend at those points. My junior year and his senior year, he started dating this girl in his class and we didn't talk as much throughout that school year. Once summer came, he asked me when he should break up with her, and once he did he started flirting and hitting on me again. Essentially, this other guy I liked wasn't giving me attention so I turned to my friend for validation. We exchanged nudes, there was a lot of sexual buildup, and we hooked up again (at 10 am lmao) before he left for college across the country. We continued to text still somewhat frequently and the fall of my senior year he helped edit all of my college apps (and I applied to A LOT of schools, including the one he goes to.) Three days before May 1st, I visit my current school across the country and decide to commit because I really wanted to get away from home. My friend kept encouraging me to commit there because it was close to him. I found it odd that he was basically begging me to go to school near him, especially since the school wasn't any better than the one I could've gone to at home - it made me think, like, does he think we're going to get married? Why did he want me to commit there so badly when he obviously has other friends and girls at his own college? I asked him why he wanted me to go there so badly and he said ""I don't know."" Interesting.

Fast forward to my freshman year of college and we hung out the first semester a few times; the social life at his school is much better than mine, so he invited me to football games and parties at his apartment. We were probably the closest we've ever been at that point. I was honestly very happy that we finally just had a great, normal friendship - until one night when I stayed over and he tried to make a move. I said no, he asked me why, and I told him I liked how things were. He ended up giving me his bed to sleep in and he slept in his roommate's bed, who was out. I really didn't think he was still interested.

I knew at some point in our future we'd end up dating because of this weird tension we've always had. Before winter break started, we were facetiming and he kept asking me to come over late at night before I left, as my roommates had already gone home. I told him I didn't want to hook up. He then got extremely embarrassed and suggested we try dating. I was shocked, as he'd never brought that up before and I never expected him to suggest that. I told him maybe, and we commenced talking everyday and facetiming over winter break, we made out once in his car, and *the night he flew back for spring semester*, he literally came straight from the airport to my dorm and took me out to dinner. He paid for everything and didn't even try to kiss me when we got back to my dorm (another shocking thing!) I never had a boyfriend before, so I wasn't really sure how all this worked. While we dated, I stayed over his apartment a few times and we'd fool around, but every time he asked me to have sex it just didn't seem right, so I never did it. Looking back, I feel like this was just a blatant sign I was not into it. 

Things were going well for about 2-3 months, but I kept trying to find reasons why it wasn't working and looking at his flaws rather than good qualities. I think he sensed that I wasn't as into it as he was, and he completely emotionally withdrew before I could - just stopped talking to me. I never got closure. He just avoided me for the rest of the semester, responding to my requests to talk about what happened occasionally, but never actually going through with it. Once summer came, he decided he wanted to talk. We met at a park and I pretty much chewed him out while he made excuses as to why he completely shut me out, saying he was ""busy with school and stressed."" Any time after that I would reach out and ask him to get ice cream, or watch the dem debate with me, but he'd make excuses and told me we couldn't sit in the same room together without fooling around. THAT pissed me off. Everything pissed me off, though. I hated that I was so in control of the situation and it completely backfired on me, and now I don't even have his friendship anymore. I think he just hates me now. I've spent this entire year fixated on this and I fucking hate it. Why can't I let him go?

I was heavily depressed my entire freshman year, which I had informed him before, but he's never been depressed so he didn't really understand. This depression and extreme insecurity from gaining weight and adjusting to college were the reasons I couldn't just relax and allow myself to accept him treating me well when we dated. Currently, I am so content and happy in my life and I've never been in such a good place. I wish I could communicate that to him, especially since I've been so mean to him this past year during and after dating and now I'm fully aware I completely fucked up. He was trying and I just wanted to sabotage everything because I didn't know how to be happy in those dark times. 

Deep down, I think I know he loves/loved(?) me and that's why he wont' talk to me know, but *it hurts.* I've been thinking about him all year and I don't want to let this go. He was one of the most constant things in my life and it's hard to accept that he no longer wants to see me. I really thought we would be friends for life, especially only having each other so far from home. Do I just have to wait for him to come to me? I feel pathetic reaching out again when I know he doesn't want to see me, but I really don't want to let him go. I don't know how/if I'll ever be able to communicate that I think it was just bad timing. We'll both be home for winter break coming up, but I'm going abroad next semester. Do I try to run into him or embarrass myself and reach out again or do I just let everything go? I don't know how to. Also, I still can't tell if I just love him as a friend or if I really am romantically interested still (though I feel like that should be more obvious if I do.)

31,"I [28F] have withdrawn almost completely from my stepfather within the pet few years. A little backstory, I’m a survivor of sexual and emotional abuse as a child by my
mothers first husband (not my bio dad, but my brothers bio dad). He was an alcoholic and everyday was toxic and we had to walk on eggshells. My mom left him when she found out and for a while it was me, my bother and mom. Around 2009, she remarried. At first we got along pretty well. I would consider our relationship back then “good” but not “close.” He was nice, helpful etc. 

He has changed a lot in the past few years. At this point, he is irritable, yells at the animals, and is overall unpleasant. I witness bickering between my mom and him and he often snaps at her when she tries to express herself or shuts her ideas down. It bothers me a lot. My
Mom thinks it’s the result of the heart attack he suffered a few years ago. It very well may be, but in my opinion the end result is him treating my mom badly and causing a negative vibe around the house. My brother doesn’t live with us, and I know for a fact that if he was witness to daily interactions and if my stepdad spoke to my mom the way he does in front of me in front of my bother (which he definitely doesn’t do) he would not be a fan of my stepdad. 

Today, my mom and stepdad were having an argument/talk and I overheard a good chunk of it. He was pretty much saying that I disrespect him. He will not accept any of the “blame” for the change in our relationship from what I heard. It’s as if he’s using the heart attack as an excuse to treat my mom poorly and be negative. 

I don’t mean to minimize his experience because it’s valid, but as a child experienced abuse in more than one way, and witnessed my father treating my mother poorly I can’t help but have resentment for a man who speaks down to her and brings a shitty mood into our home. I feel myself not really liking him anymore and not wanting to have a relationship because of the way he behaves. 

I know deep down he’s a good person with a good heart, but his toxicity is starting to wear on me. I feel my mom deserves better as she spends all of her time catering to his feelings and needs (of course, that’s for her to decide). As her daughter, however, the way he speaks to her bothers me and as a child who grew up in a toxic home it makes me sensitive to his behavior. I want to know if I’m being a jerk, so I can change my mindset or if I’m in the right here. Thanks all.",25Nov2019,1

43,"Hey all.  So I may have screwed the pooch here and need advice on how I should move forward.  My brother and his wife have been trying to have a baby for a while and they finally got pregnant.  Well,  they actually told me first a couple of weeks ago. They mentioned they were just waiting for the scan to make sure the baby was OK and was planning on announcing at Thanksgiving.  Here's where I fucked up.  I was hanging out with my Mom a few days ago for just a little bit and out of the blue, she asked me if my brother's wife was pregnant.  I pretty much immediately said I didn't know, then she asked again and I kept saying that I wasn't sure, etc.  She asked a solid 5-6 times and the look she was giving me made me think she already actually knew and was wondering why I wouldn't just tell her.  Well, I spilled the beans after that.  I immediately regretted it and verbally said 'I shouldn't have said that'  and told her seriously a few times not to tell anybody.  Well,  she has a pretty big mouth (like me apparently 🙁) and turned around 30 minutes later to tell my sister.

I feel like I hugely broke the trust he has in me and I regret it already.  He still does not know that I told anyone as far as I'm aware, but I'm wondering if I should tell him that I said something.  I feel as though I should be upfront about it to him before ThanksGiving and apologize letting him know what I did and who knows.

I recently got out of a serious long term relationship and my ex leaving me destroyed me. Another relationship is the last thing I need or want now, or ever really. 


She is constantly making sexual advances, telling me that she loves me, that she wants to be with me, etc etc. I don't reciprocate those feelings, but I like her as a friend. I've had to reject her numerous times in the past few days, for both her and my own good. 


Today, it got even further out of hand. She sent me multiple sexually explicit pictures and messages, begging to see something in return. I refused multiple times, she either responded with ""please"" or ""yes"" each time. I gave her a lot of reasons why it's not a good idea for us to be together, trying to explain to her that I'm not ready and it would be unhealthy, but she won't listen. She started listing reasons why I should date her, ""I have never cheated,"" ""I love spoiling my boyfriends,"" ""I'll never leave you,"" ""I'll treat you better than any other girl would,"" etc. I had to reject her last night and tonight, and both times she suggested that she is going to kill herself.


This could be just a manipulation tactic, and I have reason to believe she won't do it, but I'm still extremely stressed about this. I don't want her to kill herself and I don't know how to deal with this situation.

I’m very used to it. However, I have a coworker who repeatedly spells my name wrong on emails to outside parties when she’s trying to put us in touch with one another. I know this sounds trivial and it’s not a huge deal in the grand scheme of things but it bothers me because 1) I think it looks unprofessional and 2) spelling things correctly is a big part of the industry in which I work (publishing).

She responded and thanked me and said moving forward she’d be sure to spell it correctly. And this week she butchered it again twice. I think it makes her look sloppy at her job but maybe that’s just me. I said something once. Do I let it go and let her keep making this (little) error?",25Nov2019,1

56,"Tw: sexual assault

In short, i believe I was a bystander to potential rape / sexual assault, and I don’t like the way I handled it - but I’m also not sure how I should’ve handled it. I’m a bit confused, so I’d like some advice.

First I’ll introduce three people: M, “my friend”, and B. I’ve been friends with M and my friend for ~18 months. I’ve met B twice - once a couple of weeks ago, and then yesterday.

I’m 21. M is late 30s / early 40s. B I think is 18. My friend is early-mid 20s.

I met M and my friend through my university’s LGBT+ society - weekly pres at an LGBT+ pub then go to a gay club. The events are for grad students - I was an undergrad and M was actually a professor. He’s not the only professor who goes but probs is the only one that interacts with undergrads as much as he does.

M has always kind of weirded me out. He has a thing for “twinks”. Twinks are skinny, young-looking gay men - they basically look like teenagers, and are usually mid-20s or younger. I thought some of his comments were objectifying and LGBT, but also I was a gay girl, and there are genuine differences between gay women vs gay men culture, so it was difficult to know how to judge. He once marched with a 19 year old on Grindr and we all pretty awkwardly gritted our teeth. I didn’t stand up to him - just sort of tolerated it - bc we were all one group, and we all needed the LGBT community. I kind of just ignored/compartmentalised it - especially since he barely gets with anyone and I thought “maybe when he does he’ll mature” (he came out quite late so is very inexperienced).

Skip forward to two weeks ago, M is dancing with B. The age is inappropriate (and I know that deep down), but it’s legal. And unfortunately I see it among gay men a lot - nothing that drastic perhaps, but older guys (think mid 20s, early 30s) hitting on 18 year olds. I don’t like or understand it, and in my opinion there’s not enough discourse about abuse within LGBT+ spaces, but it is what it is, I’m not a gay man, no one involved seems to mind, so I sort of just ignore it.

Then skip forward to last night. We’re at a big LGBT+ party. M is dancing with B again. My friend is staring at them quite a lot uncomfortably, I look closer and B is practically falling asleep on M’s chest - still stood up and dancing (with M’s help), but barely conscious. My friend is like “is he okay??” I go “I don’t know”. We look at each other, look at them some more so I tap B on the shoulder and am like “are you okay?” He’s unresponsive. I ask M “is he okay?” (to try and alert M’s attention to it), M is like “he’s fine”.

I feel increasingly uncomfortable so I take my friend aside and ask what he thinks about the situation. My friend says “I mean, I think they’ve had sex before so it’s sort of a grey area”. I say that that doesn’t affect consent, my friend says “oh so you’re saying like you need to consent each time?”, I hear “each time” and ask if they’re a thing, they’re not. My friend sort of tries to change the topic to his own sex life and seemed a bit uncomfortable when I mentioned the word “consent”. I think at some point my friend described B as having “fallen asleep”, and then I said “I think you mean passed out”.

Tbh my memory is blurry. We might’ve went back then I pulled him aside to chat again? Not sure. Anyway at some point M and B come over to us. B is no longer unconscious but is still clearly really drunk. He’s talking to/at us the way drunk people do and occasionally hugging M and kissing him on the forehead. M (who doesn’t seem particularly drunk) is hugging him back and sometimes kissing him on the forehead. I ask M a few times if B is okay, who says he’ll be fine, he just needs chicken nuggets. I say some things about needing to get B home, it seems to fall on deaf ears. M says “we’re gonna get B some chicken nuggets that’ll sober him up”.

I then ask B if he’s okay. B says “it’s fine I’m fine! I’ve been friends with M for two years.” I didn’t properly process this and that made me feel relaxed bc i thought “oh they’re good friends, he trusts him”. It’s dawning on me now this means they became “friends” when B was 16 (and M middle aged). B continues to act really drunk again and says “did you know M teaches at *name of our university*?! He’s amazing!” then kisses him on the head. I say “yes, I’ve known M for a while”, B says “how do you know him? Wait! We’ve met. You’re *my name* you’re so beautiful!” (I’ll mention here I was in fancy dress but still). This just made me increasingly uncomfortable - the power dynamic of M being a lecturer, and B acting so young and kind of naive/idealistic. I felt increasingly uncomfortable, like it needed to stop, like M would probably go home with B and thatB was too drunk to consent, but I did nothing.

Had it been a stranger I may have imposed myself on the situation and sort of forced/pressured M to get B home safe (I do this sometimes when I see strangers in need). Because I knew M (and considered him a friend) I felt very uncomfortable acting accusatory or aggressively. After they left I got thoughts about chasing after them, but I kind of thought “it’s not my responsibility, I can’t control M” (which is technically true but feels fucked up and also rescuing B =/= controlling M). At the time it didn’t occur to me to speak to the bouncers about it.

I obviously regret letting them leave, and I feel worried about B more generally. I was considering telling LGBT+ soc and M’s workplace what I saw, but now feel unsure as to whether that’s too far (especially as I don’t actually know what happened after they left, I only have my opinion which might not be correct). I’m also wondering what I should do in the future. It’s hard to know how much I should intervene. I don’t like that I let them leave, but I also don’t know whether forcing myself on the situation would’ve been right. I don’t believe B could consent, but alcohol’s also quite weird - everyone has their own line. Yeah I just feel confused.

Needless to say I think I’ll stop being friends with M. Whether it was legal or not, that behaviour just doesn’t sit well with me.",25Nov2019,1
57,"So I have this housemate (friend since middle school) who claims to ""not have touched"" a $20 that I left on the the table one night.  I do no care about the amount of money he took , but no one else could have taken this bill except him.

He's usually a chill guy, but Im thinking he's justified his actions by getting me some random b-day present the day before .

58,"Hopefully this isn't the wrong place to post this, but whatever...

So I bought a surface book on eBay. It was a replacement order from Microsoft and was in new condition, and still had a warranty on it for a bit of time.

When it arrived, **immediately** when I turned it on, the mouse started glitching. I didn't think much of it. A few months pass by, and I realize more and more issues with it.

When using two-finger scroll the screen flickers, the mouse always glitches, Bluetooth disconnects after 30 seconds without sound being played, audio not playing, and more. So I contact the seller on eBay, they explain how to get it replaced, and I do.

I have a to wait like a week and a half and call support and all that, and this was the second replacement on the device, but whatever. As long as it got fixed.

I get it back, turn it on, and you wouldn't believe it. **It had the SAME issues.** Mouse glitching, Bluetooth issues, audio issues, and screen flickering. I couldn't believe it. I contacted support and explained the issue, and they said they would replace it, AGAIN. I was upset because school had started and I use it for school a lot, and asked how this could be done as quickly as possible. They mentioned something called an ""advantage exchange order"", where basically they would send me the replacement while I still had the non-working one, and once I got it, then sent it in. Then I could still use it for school and all that. So they say you have to pay the original price until I returned mine, and I agreed. They said the price was $3000?? It was like $700 on eBay, and it has a performance base! I tried to make the payment, and it wouldn't go through they told me. They said to contact my bank, and me, not wanting to go through all this crap, just decided to exchange it normally like I did before.

I ask if I could do it later this year during break, so I didn't have to worry about missing it for school, and was told I could.

So now it's November, break is almost here, and I contact them. I ask if they can send the shipping label. I was given a response (email at this point) that I would need to make the order THAT day because my warranty expired THAT DAY. Ok, that's fine I think.

I go to the website to make the order, and **it said my warranty had expired**. I start to lose it a bit, I *NEEDED* to get this goddamn laptop fixed. I tried emailing the support agent, but being stressed and anxious, I tried just calling customer support. I call support many times and am not given the chance to talk to a human. Just told crap about getting a text message with a link and crap. Eventually I reach a support agent, thank god.

I explain the situation, the man asked for the id number for the email conversation I had with the agent at the time, and when he read the emails, he said since I was told I could get it replaced this break, that I can.

I email him yesterday and explain that THIS weekend is the perfect time to send it in, and said if he could send in the shipping label Friday or Saturday that would work great. He emailed back right away saying;

***Hello (My Name),***

***Good to hear from you, i hope you are doing great! yes definitely i can help you with that, i will make sure you get the label by tonight!***

***Regards,***

***(His Name)***

That was two days ago.

Now it's today, and almost 8, still no label.

I'm not trying to rant, but this is just annoying. This is the **THIRD** time this device has been sent in for replacement (including this time). Today was the PERFECT day to send it in, and now its too late. Am I crazy for being annoyed at all this? Any advice?

TL;DR: I have to get my laptop replaced for the third time, second since I've owned it. Was promised a shipping label the end of the day two days ago, it's a day later, still no label. Am annoyed",25Nov2019,1

72,"Tw: sexual assault

In short, i believe I was a bystander to potential rape / sexual assault, and I don’t like the way I handled it - but I’m also not sure how I should’ve handled it. I’m a bit confused, so I’d like some advice.

First I’ll introduce three people: M, “my friend”, and B. I’ve been friends with M and my friend for ~18 months. I’ve met B twice - once a couple of weeks ago, and then yesterday.

I’m 21. M is late 30s / early 40s. B I think is 18. My friend is early-mid 20s.

I met M and my friend through my university’s LGBT+ society - weekly pres at an LGBT+ pub then go to a gay club. The events are for grad students - I was an undergrad and M was actually a professor. He’s not the only professor who goes but probs is the only one that interacts with undergrads as much as he does.

M has always kind of weirded me out. He has a thing for “twinks”. Twinks are skinny, young-looking gay men - they basically look like teenagers, and are usually mid-20s or younger. I thought some of his comments were objectifying and LGBT, but also I was a gay girl, and there are genuine differences between gay women vs gay men culture, so it was difficult to know how to judge. He once marched with a 19 year old on Grindr and we all pretty awkwardly gritted our teeth. I didn’t stand up to him - just sort of tolerated it - bc we were all one group, and we all needed the LGBT community. I kind of just ignored/compartmentalised it - especially since he barely gets with anyone and I thought “maybe when he does he’ll mature” (he came out quite late so is very inexperienced).

Skip forward to two weeks ago, M is dancing with B. The age is inappropriate (and I know that deep down), but it’s legal. And unfortunately I see it among gay men a lot - nothing that drastic perhaps, but older guys (think mid 20s, early 30s) hitting on 18 year olds. I don’t like or understand it, and in my opinion there’s not enough discourse about abuse within LGBT+ spaces, but it is what it is, I’m not a gay man, no one involved seems to mind, so I sort of just ignore it.

Then skip forward to last night. We’re at a big LGBT+ party. M is dancing with B again. My friend is staring at them quite a lot uncomfortably, I look closer and B is practically falling asleep on M’s chest - still stood up and dancing (with M’s help), but barely conscious. My friend is like “is he okay??” I go “I don’t know”. We look at each other, look at them some more so I tap B on the shoulder and am like “are you okay?” He’s unresponsive. I ask M “is he okay?” (to try and alert M’s attention to it), M is like “he’s fine”.

I feel increasingly uncomfortable so I take my friend aside and ask what he thinks about the situation. My friend says “I mean, I think they’ve had sex before so it’s sort of a grey area”. I say that that doesn’t affect consent, my friend says “oh so you’re saying like you need to consent each time?”, I hear “each time” and ask if they’re a thing, they’re not. My friend sort of tries to change the topic to his own sex life and seemed a bit uncomfortable when I mentioned the word “consent”. I think at some point my friend described B as having “fallen asleep”, and then I said “I think you mean passed out”.

Tbh my memory is blurry. We might’ve went back then I pulled him aside to chat again? Not sure. Anyway at some point M and B come over to us. B is no longer unconscious but is still clearly really drunk. He’s talking to/at us the way drunk people do and occasionally hugging M and kissing him on the forehead. M (who doesn’t seem particularly drunk) is hugging him back and sometimes kissing him on the forehead. I ask M a few times if B is okay, who says he’ll be fine, he just needs chicken nuggets. I say some things about needing to get B home, it seems to fall on deaf ears. M says “we’re gonna get B some chicken nuggets that’ll sober him up”.

I’ve been friends with M for two years.” I didn’t properly process this and that made me feel relaxed bc i thought “oh they’re good friends, he trusts him”. It’s dawning on me now this means they became “friends” when B was 16 (and M middle aged). B continues to act really drunk again and says “did you know M teaches at *name of our university*?! He’s amazing!” then kisses him on the head. I say “yes, I’ve known M for a while”, B says “how do you know him? Wait! We’ve met.

73," I'm in a Discord server for an upcoming webcomic with about 9 other people; we all migrated there from a larger server we were in since we were getting a little overwhelmed by the rapidly-growing population and we didn't wanna clog the server with discussion about a completely unrelated work. One member in particular - I'll call them E - that I talk to pretty frequently also gets along well with the creator, and has written a lot of fanfic for the project already. As you can imagine, even though about half of us prefer to avoid spoilers, the line is pretty blurry and we've decided to more or less go with the flow - if a theory or joke or fic one of us made turns out to be pretty close to canon, oh well.

 Now, I was out for most of the day, so I don't have a whole lot of context, but I like to catch up on messages if I'm gone for a long time, and the best way I can summarize things is: E made a joke about a character that has yet to be acknowledged publicly by the creator but has been leaked to 3 or so members, one of the younger members (I think he's 16? E themself is 22) said something about wanting to avoid spoilers and made a ""spoiler cop"" joke that I'll admit didn't land too well, the mod asked E to delete the joke, which they did, but not before kinda snarkily pointing out that they've dropped bigger spoilers before - albeit out of context, so it's not like anyone knew what they were. After that, though, things were back to normal.

 A while later, E mentions working on a spoiler-free fic and a directory to keep all their works in one place (it was a concept we had talked about before, so it's not like they brought it up out of the blue just to pick a fight) and the mod tells them not to worry about spoilers too much. E responds by saying that if the spoiler-free rule is gonna be enforced after all, they'll just pull all spoiler fic from the directory, even ones they've shared before. Mod again assures them they really don't have to and they can just label which fic has spoilers and which doesn't, and then E goes on a totally-not-angry rant about how even saying which ones are spoilers is spoilers and how everyone got heated over a joke about a spoiler character and how their username and icon were WAY BIGGER spoilers anyway (they weren't; nobody even *knew* they were spoilers) and how they better just do it in case the ""spoiler cop"" gets on their ass again.

 Before I get a bunch of comments bashing my friend, I want to point out that this is not normal behavior for them. They've written a lot for previous fandoms, but as far as I know they've been pretty lax about it and don't usually get this worked up about any rules. They snark a lot, sure, but they usually come off as laid back (or, rather, they aren't online very much if something's really getting to them) and definitely aren't the type to pitch a fit over a joke some high school kid who doesn't even read their stuff made. If they're annoyed with something or someone, they're more likely to take it to DMs than anything else. However, I also know that their housing situation and mental health have both been very stressful to deal with lately (the latter of which is usually exacerbated by the former) and I'm starting to wonder if they snapped today because they've just received some particularly bad news or just had a shitty day overall. It wouldn't excuse them snapping at a teenager who didn't know better, but it'd at least be a start.

 How do I ask them about it without making it weird, as well as make it clear that they should probably apologize, or at least acknowledge whatever that was? They aren't very emotionally open most of the time, and I doubt they'd be in much of a mood to talk.

TL;DR: Discord friend got weirdly hung up on a joke a teen in a mutual server made, doesn't seem like them at all and I'm a little worried their IRL situation might have something to do with it, how do I approach them about it?",25Nov2019,1

77,"This started a few weeks ago when we hired someone to work at our restaurant. He seemed alright and we were desperate at the time because we had no employees.

He said in his application that he had more than 10 years of restaurant experience but turned out to not know how to operate anything, and pretty much admitted that he had nearly no experience whatsoever, meaning he lied. At this point, we're a bit hesitant and we've hired another employee who is far more diligent. We're planning to have him and the new person split shifts but here's where the problem comes along. We find out that he has quite a bad criminal record and pretty much admitted that he makes drugs and sells them. He's been convicted of robbery, theft, and some minor assault charges. We notice that a weight that we always put in the same spot every day has disappeared. It might've just been displaced, but it still hasn't been found since. A short while ago though, we found that the cash drawer had been opened on a day we weren't open and some of the metal things keeping the money down were up. Now, the cash drawer could only be opened through the iPad that we have, and only our employees know the password to that iPad. This is highly suspicious, and makes us believe that he broke in on a non-work day to steal some money, but probably fled before he could take too much because one of us came in. 

At this point, it could have just been a glitch, but the metal things don't just fling up by themselves, so it most likely would have been done by a human, and a human who knows the restaurant. 

This is why we want to get rid of him immediately. But how? We made a mistake of hiring someone without checking their background, and this is probably the only job he's gotten in years because of that criminal background. He will probably be very resistant to leaving and might try and steal more stuff if we dismiss him.",25Nov2019,1

I consider myself an ally to the LGBTQ+ community, so this news hasn’t affected our friendship at all. However, she recently came out to her parents, and they have not been at all accepting to her.  Her father called her disgusting, a disgrace, etc. Her mother is giving her the silent treatment. I have been in the house and the “vibe” in the house is extremely toxic, awkward, and honestly disgusting. She doesn’t feel loved in her house or by her parents. They’ve basically put her on house arrest. She’s not allowed to have people over or be at other people’s houses any more.

83,"Basically I had a harmless miscellaneous error at work (healthcare) that affected absolutely no one which was later confirmed to me by my shift supervisor as harmless and correctable. My department lead thought otherwise... 

She wrote me up with an error report, proceeded to bring it to me without privacy as I just got into work and chatting with the previous shift for handoff. She interrupted my conversation and abbrasively gave me the report with this horrible look on her face like I've ruined her entire week. I started to ask questions as to why it's a formal error being that it's correctable and affects no patients and is not even seen by anyone other than our own department. She then snatched the paper out of my hands and tears it up and throws it away and goes on a rant about how I'm just like everyone else who fights her with error reports and how she's been ""letting me slide for too long."" I later bring that up to my shift supervisor and he explains that he has no idea what she's talking about with that comment. I've only been working here for 4 months, always on time, always show up ready to work, and never had a single error report or complaint...

After she walks off, while I'm at mid-sentence, I'm left there with everyone still around me obviously able to hear and see everything. I calmly proceed to the public bathroom and then break out in a panic attack from the social embarrassment and frustrating communication that I just endured. I have a history of panic attacks, but NEVER at a workplace. They happen usually after heated arguments with my boyfriend over miscommunication, disagreements with my father, and once after a verbal fight with a teammate that escalated from a simple disagreement infront of the rest of the team. 

The kicker of it all is I'm the one who brought the error to her asking for her help to fix it! She has a history with a handful of coworkers giving out multiple error reports that are not errors and sometimes it's as simple as she didn't look at the second page of the report. This is also not the first time she's ripped up an error report after it is being disputed.

Regardless, what should I do about the verbal embarrassment along with triggering me to a panic attack? A coworker of mine had to talk me down and stay with me as I was shaking and hyperventilating. I am so embarrassed how that part of my life has been exposed like that and infront of everyone when I've never been triggered at a workplace before even with criticism. I've been told I was wrong before and given instruction on how I can improve or correct the issue without getting upset in any way. I've had scarier people tell me worse things! I'm pretty sure it's the social environment that makes me sensitive and also the embarrassment too of public condescension. My shift supervisor said he's going to talk to our director and his own supervisor. He told me not to worry about it for now, but now after a day has passed I've got a clear head I'm really not okay with how unprofessional she was. Coming into work today I want to vomit and my hands are shakey. Do I have any options? Are people in leadership allowed to treat workers like this? I've never had to deal with anything like this before.",25Nov2019,1

88,I was in a mountain all weekend and Friday. On Thursday my history teacher told us to create a fake government. I thought it would be a one day thing that wouldn’t matter much. Then Friday happened and I was at the mountain. Turns out it was actually something that matters. The fake government became a project we are gonna presentate on Monday but I wasn’t aware of its existence till Sunday afternoon. So my group did all of the work while I was in a mountain out of WiFi and reception unable to do it. I did basically nothing but organize a vote to decide what government we want. Everyone else did so much more. It was pretty much finished and about to be turned in by the time I was back. My history teacher will be able to tell I did basically nothing for the project.

I don't understand why they act so nice in the beginning and then act all passive aggressive and people feel even more sleighed versus if they just said things for how they are.

97,"This is a throwaway account. I apologize in advance for how long this is but there are a lot of details to be considered.

Two years ago I (22F) met this guy (28M) through military service. We hit it off and both ended up being interested in one another. We went on some dates, we talked on the phone, he paid for my dinners and bought me things, etc. He told his family about me and showed them pictures of me. A lot happened. One night we were drinking and he left to go to bed but later came back. He sat down with me and told me things like he wanted to kiss me and that I could move in with him if we dated. At this point I had very strong feelings for him. But he followed up these things by saying that we should date other people so we could each get more experience etc. About a month later he invited me to spend the weekend snowboarding. He paid for almost everything, bought me new goggles, cooked for me, and took care of me when I ended up breaking my wrist on the slopes. Needless to say after that weekend, I was smitten.

A few weeks passed and I noticed he was distant. He didn't text me much or respond to my messages quickly, if at all, and he stopped calling. He stopped hanging out with me. Eventually I said something to him about feeling ignored. We talked it over and he again said we should date other people, but then he also said we were kindred spirits, which was what he was looking for. He also said he didn't want to mess things up then if it could be something later. So his answer was essentially a MAYBE. Meanwhile, I found out he had been going on dates with a girl we'll call C. Obviously I stepped away from him at that point because he was clearly done with me. We really didn't talk much for a few months. I did not reach out unless I needed to because of the military. A few months passed like that.

Then, out of no where, he asked to hang out. I was swimming at the time and said sure, but he'd have to wait a bit because I was busy. So I went back to my mom's house (I had my own place, but was staying at my mom's at the time) and showered etc. I told him I'd meet him somewhere or drive out to him, but he insisted that he had planned to come to me. I told him I was at my mom's and again he insisted on coming to me. He came over and met my mom and my younger sister, and then came up with an excuse to drive out to MY house, which was an hour away. I agreed and we went. He told me all about C and how things didn't work out with her. We talked about that and some other things until about 8, and then decided to leave and get dinner. We were together until around 11.

After that he talked to me and hung out with me quite a bit. He helped me with various things a lot and said he'd protect me when we went overseas. People asked if we were a ""thing."" He treated me differently than other people, even other females, and people I barely even knew noticed. It made me think maybe he was interested again.

However, a little over a month ago he started getting distant again like he had before he started dating C. I got suspicious because this was a pattern I'd noticed in him. He usually was very quick to reply to my texts and would frequently come to me for emotional and moral support. But suddenly it took him days to respond, and sometimes he wouldn't at all. Then his best friend said they were talking on the phone quite often. So I knew something was up.

About a week later I saw a picture of him on Facebook with a girl that looked a lot like me, who we'll call G. Pixie cut dark hair, hazel eyes, botanical tattoos, and a lot of similar interests. This pissed me off for obvious reasons, and I decided the best thing for everyone at that point was to go our separate ways. I asked him to call me, and he did. I then told him that I had never been over to overcome my feelings for him and that we should part ways. I didn't really go into a lot of detail, I just admitted my feelings and told him I couldn't be a good friend to him because of them. After we got off the phone, I vomited because of how sad I was. I'd never been that close with someone before; we were like twin flames or something.

I deleted all of my social media so I wouldn't have to see anything else with him and G. I also threw away photos of us etc. I had no intention of reaching out again because it was too painful. 

A month passed by and I was still a mess, but dealing with it the best I could. The other day I woke up and had a text from an unsaved number. It was him. He said things didn't work out with G and that he hoped he and I could be friends regardless of who we date because he doesn't want to lose someone like me who he has such a connection with. I responded by telling him that we needed to have a conversation about everything. But then he said he was pretty upset about their breakup (they only dated for about a month) and that he wasn't in the right head space. I told him I understood and that was that.

Now I don't know what to do. I really don't think I'll be able to move on if he's in my life. It's been two years since I met him and I haven't been interested in anyone else. I've never felt understood the way I do with him, and it's been extremely hard without him because I really have no else like him. I've had some hardships the past few weeks that I had to deal with on my own, and I cried because he wasn't there for me to lean on. But it just seems like it would be detrimental to me, and a win-win for him. I've felt like he just talks to me when he needs emotional support, but when he's seeing someone, I'm not important anymore. And knowing that he was interested in me in the past but didn't make a move makes me feel like I wasn't good enough.

Should I give him another chance and try to be friends with him or should I just cut him off for good? I feel horrible because I know he's hurting and doesn't want to lose another person. We are/were very, very close. But I was hurting for a long time while I watched him be with other women. I feel like he led me on. I just need an idea of what to say when I talk to him again.

Then i kept seeing him staring at me and looking at me, (i had 4 out of 6 classes with him) This made me feel uncomfortable. He had also started to tell people we were dating when we weren't and he even told his family and church friends that. I thought it was weird. Then i sat with him at lunch and he let his friends call him names, and so the next day i sat somewhere else, i overheard his friends saying ""she's uglier than you"" he didn't day anything about it he didn't say ""that's not true"". Then the dance came ( i didn't back out because i;m not rude) so i just got my mom to pick me up early and told him i had to be somewhere.

I told him no that i was gonna move soon (this is over text, which who does that) but he kept saying please, just to make me happy but i didn't want to be in a unhappy relationship, so i told him i didn't like him.

Over the summer I decided to lose some weight. I weighed 196 at most. According to my BMI, I’m obese. I weigh 187 now. Some setbacks caused me to not lose weight for a couple of months but I was happy about my progress. However, my heart pain came back.

105,"Hey everyone, hope all is well.

My life took a huge turn recently. I had a break down at college and was locked in a psychward. I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety (something I delt with for a while but am only recently understanding what it was) I ended up taking a year off school because of it and I’m currently back home with my parents.

While I was in the ward my parents went into my room and found a bunch of my weed paraphernalia. They did not react to this very well being that they’re Muslim fobs. They blame my occasional smoking for all the issues I have now, for them I smoked weed got kicked out of an Ivy League school and am now a useless loser with no future. They constantly berate me with this kind of language on a daily basis and insist on drug testing me. They react badly every single time I leave the house, regardless if I’m doing anything.

I understand where they’re coming from, they just want what they think is best for me. Thing is, I’m 19 and I want freedom. Being cooped up in my parents apartment is driving me insane.

All I’ve been doing for the last month is laying in bed and driving myself insane. I know my depression is getting worse but they just don’t see it as a real thing. My younger sisters are worried about me and I don’t know how to handle it either

I just want to have the freedom I had before, but I also don’t want my parents to disown me for disobeying them.

I love them a lot, truly, but I miss my friends, being able to go out freely, and having any type of agency.

I guess what I’m asking is if there is any way I can possibly get out of this. I’m scared that I’m gonna remain in this state for the next 8 months and possibly the rest of my life.

106,"Just to open this, me and my brother are still living with our parents, he's 19 and I'm the younger brother.

There's been a long history with me treating my brother badly. Ever since I was a little kid I would steal things from him, hit him, and verbally abuse him. Most of these events were told to me by my parents, often after I've told them that I need to treat him better. Even before I was born my brother cared for me and loved me. He is an extremely caring person and unless you've done something to him he would never hurt you, and if he did it would be unintentional. Yes, he can be annoying and make weird sounds unintentionally and that in enough itself is annoying but still, very caring. When we were kids he would let me borrow his toys with little question and generally protect me. All this while I punched him and was a little shit to him. He held me up when I was learning how to walk. In the long run he was a very good brother and wasn't the traditional ""bully"" older brother at all.

I'm glad to say that most of the really bad stuff like stealing and the physical abuse I've grown out of, but I still have a habit of telling him off for no reason and making him feel bad through words. At least twice a day when he's talking to me or wants to show me something I literally walk away and don't look at him and the only reason why I do this is because I'm at least slightly annoyed at him. When I want him to leave me alone I say shut up and tell him to go away, in the mean way that I don't think people talk to their siblings with. In general I'm a jerk to him when he doesn't deserve it.

I've tried several times to change how I act with him but I can't. I think I've treated him like this for so long that it's literally a force of habit at this point. I still get very annoyed and tell him to go away and all my other stuff. I don't want to act this way with him anymore. He's done nothing bad to me and he deserves better as a brother. I don't know how to. I just want to act normal with him. I just want to know some way I can fix this, because my worse fucking fear is that one day he'll end up hating me and I wont be able to fix it at that point, or he'll die and the last thing he remembers about me is me calling him a piece of shit and walking away from him. I want to treat him good. That's it. We have our good moments too along side the bad ones, and I love him too. I just want less of the bad and more of the good.

119,"TLDR: What kind of jobs can you get with an arrest record or pending conviction?

I got arrested for minor felony possession (state crime) in TX the other night. Spent some hours in county processing, got let out with a free bond but I have to pass drug tests. Got my first hearing tomorrow, hoping case will get thrown out on probable cause, but bail bond companies called all my relatives and I am now on all of these shitty fucking websites that give your info to employers and anyone who looks your name up. If anyone has been in this situation before I have a few questions:

What jobs can I get during this case or just with an arrest record? Seems like a major roadblock for most white collar and public work alike since most don't have records. Don't care if it is manual labor, coding, or working in a restaurant. Just need a way to pay the bills until I can get this shit fixed or start my own business.

Do I have to pay to take my name and info off of these internet sites? Can I ever get this stuff removed from the publicly available internet?

Am I likely to get expelled/not graduate from college? Was supposed to graduate in 2 weeks but now I don't know if they will let me walk.

Will I be stuck in minimum wage until I get training?

If I can get charges dropped and my arrest record sealed, will I ever be able to work for a major company/govt. entity again?

121,"For some background, I was fired from the first few jobs that I held during college, each one giving me the reason that I wasn’t learning fast enough. This excuse was confusing to me, as I had only worked each of those positions a maximum of 2 weeks. A few others didn’t even fire me to my face or give me a reason, they just stopped putting me on the schedule. Once I graduated college, this trend continued until I became a job hopper. The second that I got even an inkling that my boss didn’t like me, or that things weren’t going well, I’d just quit and find something else, figuring that I was going to get fired anyway. Some of my friends find themselves unemployed for months on end while they search for that perfect job, but I don’t have that luxury, and usually just accept the first job that is offered to me. 

As a consequence, my resume consists of an assortment of low-level call center, warehouse and restaurant jobs. I frequently feel depressed, aimless, worthless and hopeless while at work. I hold a bachelor’s degree in the social sciences, thought I had valuable skills, and thought I’d be further along in life by now. I’ve applied to many positions that are similar to those that I enjoyed in the past, but I never get contacted. I don’t have any disabilities or any sort of criminal record or drug problem, in case you’re wondering. 

Now that I just turned 30, I’m panicking about my future employ-ability. By my last count, I’ve held 3 dozen jobs already, and those are just the ones I remember! Some were part time or temporary and other times I held 2 or 3 of them simultaneously just to make ends meet. The longest I’ve ever lasted at a job was 8 consecutive months. I don’t know what’s wrong with me and feel like I’m the only person who has this issue. I don’t want to be a job hopper forever. I’ve never made more than 20k a year. It would be nice to find a job that I enjoy enough to stick with, one that doesn’t make me feel like a worthless robot or pay me poverty wages. Maybe those jobs don’t exist, and I need to somehow learn to stick with whatever shit job I have no matter how pointless it feels.

126,"Went on a first Tinder date a while back and it went very well but not really sure how to feel. When I say it went well, I mean we got plastered and made out hard for like 2 hours in the back of a dark pub and on the train home. Lovely girl by all accounts, but looking back there's a few factors that make me not want to meet again.

1) She came on **hard.** Like she was mad into me and I think she's not that experienced because she wasn't a brilliant kisser when I look back soberly. Combined with the fact that she kept showering me with compliments (how intelligent, good looking and kind I am), I felt it moved a bit fuckin fast for a first date, which has put me off slightly. Not a brag by the way, I'm fairly average by all accounts.

2) it's been too long. This date was 2 weeks ago and I haven't been able to meet her again for genuine reasons between work, illness and existing arrangements. She's kept messaging me and the convo is dry as a desert but she keeps reviving it. I keep the convo open because every now and then I consider I might be lucky to have found someone who values me so highly after a first date, though the other 95% of the time I just think it's a bit mental.

3) I don't think I'm ready for a relationship yet. I'm only 19 and never had anything more than casual one-time sex- I'm pretty certain I like it that way. I also fear that I may not be giving one a chance *because* of this.

So yeah, what do you think? Meet again or tell it how it is?",25Nov2019,1
127,"I’m 15 and she’s 14, both in hs and don’t get along very much.

To try and avoid repercussion, she says that I smoke weed. (To be completely honest, I don’t. I’ve never done drugs drunk alcohol or any of it.) So she says this and my mom reacts by telling my grandmother, my gma says to ask me and she does, I told her the truth and she says ok and we continue our day. Two days later I’m still pissed at my sister and I kinda blew up on her, I wanted to call her a bitch and cuss her out but knew I’d be screwed so I just said she was lying on me. She said she wasn’t and tons of people told her I was, I don’t know that I believe that because even then why would she trust them over me?

131,"Here’s my issue. A long time friend and her spouse are planning a vacation for 21 days going to England, Ireland and Scotland in March.  

In the past I have been drafted as a dog sitter when they take a trip over a weekend or a week.  

She has gotten so that she doesn’t even ask me if I can watch the dogs, going to her home before work (they live about 3 miles away) which means getting there around 6 am. Stopping back over and walking the dogs after working an 8-10 hour day. 

This trip is going to 21 days. Way too long to leave two big dogs (45-50 lbs each) alone In my opinion.  She expects to leave them at the house all day and all night with only me going over to check on them 2-3 times a day during the work week and more on weekends. 

She didn’t ask this time either. Just said I should  plan to stay at their house while they are gone. 

Which I can’t do. I have kids and responsibilities I need to be here for. 

I’ve told her this trip is too long. She needs to find a kennel or someone who can take the dogs or else stay there with them.  It’s like talking to a rock.  The rock would probably listen better. 

I flat can not / will not stay in their house. She is not the best housekeeper.  They have a roach issue. Her husband spends a fortune on cars / boat / trips and yet the house has holes in the wall where he threw something and two broken windows he hasn’t fixed and the windows have been broke for months. 

I have already told her I can’t do this.  I can’t watch the dogs and go over to her house every day for 3 weeks. 

My job requires long hours and getting over there to watch their dogs (for no pay yet) is just too much.   The last trip they took she didn’t bother to mention it until the day they left - 3 hours after they had gone.   I got a text saying “Don’t forget to give the dogs the flea / tick stuff on Wednesday.  We should be back by 8 pm Saturday”

She hadn’t mentioned a trip at all.  She just left her dogs in the house with the assumption I would be fine with having to take care of them.   She also said she’d left $$ on the table to buy dog food as she “didn’t have time”


She left me $4 to buy 6 days dog food for two 50 lb dogs. 


I really don’t know quite what to do.  I do know right now with work issues and health issues I have (having surgery 12/12) ..  having to try and add the additional responsibility of trying to make sure the dogs are okay is just too much for me to handle when the time comes. 

And no, I rent and can’t have the dogs here at my home. 

I am worried she’s do the same thing she did last time.  Leave and send me a text telling me the dogs are in the house alone..  and expect me to make sure they’re okay.

132,"I have an estranged relationship with my mother and I have noticed over the years that she has developed/changed at a fast pace that has scared and confused me. (However, my uncle and grandmother say that she’s always been “like that”)

She’s what you may call the black sheep of our family. And recently she unexpectedly stopped by my place because she had come upon an epiphany. 

A fairy—that my mother calls “she” when we discussed it—came into my mother’s life when she hit her birthday(Mid 40s). This happened 10 days ago. 

My mother kept referring to the fairy FREQUENTLY and kept saying that “she” is beautiful, pretty, and sweet. And my mother claims to have reached enlightenment and that she gained a star on her birthday and that she was the only one that has achieved heaven(?). My mother also mentioned something about putting everyone before you and that the world has become shameful. 

The fairy has been telling her to be kind, be sweet, be loving of all things. The fairy has ALSO been saying some crazy things about government conspiracies, climate change, reptilian creatures, etc.

When my mom came to my place, she said “I’m not crazy”. Everyone in our family that she talked to—they’ve been telling her to stop and that she’s crazy. It’s worse too, since she goes on LONG tangents about the fairy, enlightenment, and conspiracies. 

My mother is a social creature and she hates being confined, but she lives in a place where you NEED to drive (she can’t drive, so she feels trapped). She has no advanced education, so she struggles to connect/communicate her feelings beyond basic words. I live in a different state (u.s.) and she’s spending her time here for a few days before she goes back to her boyfriend and my half siblings. 

I...don’t even know where to start. I’m at a loss for words and I can’t even understand her. My family has said to leave it be. Since it’s been something that’s been going on since my mother was a kid, apparently. “You can’t change her mind” is what everyone is saying. 

I don’t believe she tried therapy yet, my family are by no means, rich or middle class. We fall along the lines of “making ends meet” and we can’t put a financial strain on us right now—so I worry about looking for medical/therapy due to the cost. I’ve been looking for mental health/therapy sessions in her home state, and I don’t know what I’m looking for!

And I worry she won’t stick to therapy. What I did so far is listen to her, let her talk, and try to tell her that she’s not crazy. I gave her a spare notebook and told her it’s a good idea to write or draw your feelings and thoughts. But she hates writing and says her drawings are ugly. 

But the more I listened to her, the more I believe she’s crazy. I need some advice because I know my family will let this slide, as it has been for 30 years. I think something needs to change.",25Nov2019,1

136,"Hey guys so I’m in a really frustrating position right now that’s been weighing on me forever. My sister brought a dog (3 1/2 year old Maltese poodle) into our house that no one was prepared for. He’s adorable and I’m okay with having dogs definitely but I made it clear that it’s not my responsibility. 

The problem is she works every weekday but not on the weekends so she uses that as an excuse to never put any effort into him. We have had the dog in the house for almost 3 years and it is not really potty trained, it can’t communicate to us when it needs to use the restroom. When Me or my mom are home with it we have to take him out very often just to make sure it doesn’t pee or poop inside the house. 

First of all she doesn’t give a fuck that while I am not in class I am always having to listen to our dog cry for attention outside our doors, I usually let him in and hang out with him and let him on the bed like he wants but a lot of the time I also can’t because I don’t know if it will make a mess. This is very frustrating because the dog is obviously suffering from loneliness and discomfort when it is not with someone but it isn’t my responsibility to take care of him in the first place but I would if she actually took 1 minute of her free time either at night or on the weekends. 

My sister never ever takes the dog on walks and when I tell her why she is not taking care of him and that I didn’t sign up for it, she says ,” I don’t care I didn’t ask you to take care of him, so just ignore him!” Wtf.. I feel so much pain for her dog because it always seems sad and disappointed, how can a normal human ignore this? She isn’t mature enough to care for another being apparently and thinks dogs are toys. I’ve begged my parents to give the dog to a proper family but they won’t listen because they also think dogs are just toys that are made to please you even if they aren’t happy. 

This dog is still biting at our feet, not potty trained, feels lonely and even doesn’t ever eat dog food or treats because we fed him real food and now he only eats rice or real meat. It is hurting me so much to see what his life is like but I have to take care of myself too and the dog has been weighing down on me. 

The worst part is I kindly tell her every week if we can train the dog this weekend and that I’ll help her. She says yes but then when the weekend comes she forgets about it or acts like she is too tired to do anything about training him. I feel like I’m being trained to look the other way by my whole family and just pretend this situation is working. What the hell do I even do? 

Can you guys please give me advice?",25Nov2019,1

Basically back in 2003 my dad got a postcard from a male friend who was in prison saying merry Christmas. And note this happened before they were together. So she starts saying all this stuff about how it’s from some ex and that he should just leave if he’s gonna be dating someone behind her back. I’m just walking I’m too see her crushing up papers and shoving him back. Thankfully my dad is a calm guy but this, it pissed him off beyond his point. They just went back and forth arguing like hell.


My brother at this point is in tears and keep on walking back to the room where their fighting in tear sobbing like hell. Then my mom who I will admit is crazy when arguing walks up to the bathroom and shuts the door. Thankfully she did have time to lock it as we followed her to see what she was going to do.  She went and grabbed a hair dryer and rapped the cord around her neck and started squeezing while trying to hook it on to the sink to have a place too hold it tight. Her neck immediately started too go purple and you could hear her suffocating. It really scared us because my dad was freaking out and I had to rush too her and remove the cord from her neck. She then immediately started saying “ I don’t wanna live” “ god just kill me now “ and it really broke my heart because my brother was watching this all and we’re all mad and scared. She then went to get her keys, put her hair dryer in her purse and tried too leave.  Thankfully my sister came and we were able to lock all doors and get her away from her car keys and her purse.

What are the odds that she has an outstanding arrest warrant for this? Also, with shoplifting, would the store try to do something civil first, or would they go straight to the police to ask for an arrest warrant? Would the store call the police on an item so small?

I don't know why people care about the earth or human race. It's useless. I don't want to kill myself or anything (although if I were to die it wouldn't matter), but I want to know some valid reasons why I shouldn't. 

This way of thinking has got me to overcome fears and get out of my comfort zone because if something happens, who cares? You're gonna die, at some point the human race will be extinct and the earth will explode. Why should I care? People are always saying ""save the earth, don't litter, global warming blah blah blah"". Who CARES. 

I know what your thinking, ""if you don't care about anything than why do you care about this?""
I don't know! I don't know anyone else who feels this way about life. Everytime I talk about it to someone, they try and give me a reason to care but they aren't good enough to make me care.

154,"Hi everyone. So I have been debating making this post for a while now, I might feel guilty about it but here goes. This post is kinda long so thank you if you read all this.

So I am in high school and have been hanging out with this friend group for the past couple years. We don't have much mutual interests other than a sport we all partake in at school. Throughout this time, I have not really felt super close to them. Never have I, in my head, considered them my ""best"" friends. I have been debating with myself over whether or not they could be a little bit toxic, or if they are fine and I am just overreacting, that's why I was skeptical about making this post. I know toxic is a strong word so I'm sorry if this post offends anyone who has had some truly toxic friends. Here are some reasons that are leading me to believe this:

They are mean about an insecurity of mine a lot. I have very severe food allergies that threaten my life. It is something I am pretty embarrassed about, and I've had things said to me from them like ""I bet your parents hope you die so they don't have to deal with your allergies anymore"" or giving me a bunch of shit because I decided to apply to a college because the particular college deals with food allergies well. I might be overreacting, but these comments really hurt me and I am too scared to defend myself because anytime anyone gets offended about something in the group they just get called a pussy and they say they were only joking. Anytime I do defend myself I just get called sassy and laughed at.

Overall this one isn't that bad but it still causes me stress. They want to hang out a lot, and this is fine, but whenever I don't feel like hanging out at the time they always try and pressure me into doing it and it takes me saying several times that I don't want to for them to back off. I know this one really isn't that bad but it still makes me feel stressed every time I get asked to hang out. 

I don't feel like I can be myself around them. I have a few close friends that I share some of my strong interests with, such as gaming and anime, however usually when I bring these interests up around my friends they kinda just get shit on. Once again, I know this isn't that bad, as this occurrence doesn't happen with all of those friends, but I still thought I would bring it up. 

They make fun of me for the dumbest reasons. I'm sorry if this makes it seem like I get offended too easily, I suppose that might be the case. Unlike the case with my allergies, it's not like these incidents of being made fun of are about something I feel sensitive about, but they are just for reasons that make no logical sense. For example getting repeatedly made fun of for my pointing my face downward while looking at my phone, crossing my arms too much, saying words like ""correct"" and ""intuitive"" that they deem to be too complex to be used in everyday conversation for some reason,  wearing a certain jacket, liking a certain teacher at our school, and a plethora of other simple things like that. Once again, I know these jokes are just to be funny, but it still doesn't feel good as they come very often and I can't defend myself without being made fun of even more. 

Being mean in general. This isn't specifically to me, but they can be quite mean to people in general. For example calling the marching band at my school the ""F\*ggot patrol"" or making fun of someone based on something they knew they were insecure about in front of 50+ people at a presentation. (This I kind of feel guilty for as I feel as if I could have stopped it from happening but I was too shy to).

Being selective. While I am not the only person in this group that gets joked about/made fun of, it doesn't seem to happen to anyone else to the same extent. There oftentimes will be a situation that applies to me and one or more people, however I am the only one who will get made fun of.

Overall, oftentimes when I am around them I feel stressed out. This might not be a direct shortcoming of them but rather  of myself, but I just can't help but feel anxious or stressed out when around them. So basically the advice I need is, are these friends toxic or am I just overly sensitive? If so should I take steps to distance myself from them and how so?

If you took the time to read all of this, I truly thank you. Any advice is appreciated.",25Nov2019,1
156,"In the past month, I've gotten two calls from two different numbers soliciting sex from me. The first was in the early evening, simply asking for ""escort services."" The latest one was at 4:30 this morning, asking for ""a girl"" to be sent to a specific room of a local hotel. I texted this number asking where he got it, but to no response. I have both of these numbers but have deleted the messages because they freaked me out.

For those who live in Los Angeles, they're aware of how poor public transportation is and it's not really feasible in terms of my job: I teach private music lessons in people's homes.Now, the way I see it I have three options:
1. Buy a New Car
2. Lease a Car
3. Rent a Car
The problem is that I don't have any savings and I'm living paycheck to paycheck. (Rip Bitcoin)I've done some research on potential cars and I'm afraid I'm not able to afford the down payments on leasing or buying a new car.

160,"My parents got divorced when I was 16.  My mother re-entered the military to continue her career after not working for 15 years.  Was an admin in the army, and never went to combat.  She medically retired 4 years early for hip and back issues.  I am not 100% convinced enough was wrong that she had to retire.  Because she retired early she did not get full retirement funds and receives a pretty small amount from the government per month.  She still relies on my dad for pretty much everything 16 years after the divorce.  He gives her money, does weekly yard and home repair work for her.  His family still considers her a part of family and invites her to everything.  My dad feels guilty for their marriage which is why he does all the things he does, even though I feel it just enables her bad behavior.   He takes ownership for the things he did wrong, but I have never heard her once say that things she did effected them. 

She seeks guilt from everyone for her life being what it is and never takes responsibility for her actions.  Has no hobbies and usually sits in her house all day.  Talking to her is difficult as she always turns the convo back to her, never lets people really talk and does not engage in things they are saying.  She won't talk to therapists or seek help as she believes everyone is against her.  And she believes in some weird govt conspiracy theories which lead her to be very vocal on controversial topics. I try and push her all the time to grow and develop her life and she constantly lives in the past of what has happened to her and how it has made her life difficult.  

It's truly exhausting for me to deal with and is effecting me emotionally.  I get she has had hard things in life, but everyone has had times.  In my opinion at some point you have to better your own life and stop blaming others. 

Am I being insensitive to her just needing different emotional support then I do, or is it ok to pick my mental well being over hers; even though she is my mother.  Should I grin and bare it to continue trying to push and help her, or would cutting her off and forcing her to figure things out alone pull her out of the dependency she has on me and my dad?",25Nov2019,1

I've always been awkward around boys, but  I've realized that I have this odd desire to make them happy/be exactly  who they'd like for me to be. I realized that I want men to find me  attractive. I started thinking back to my early childhood to see if I  could find any reasoning behind this attitude.  When I was 8, I had an  iPad of my own.  I discovered porn, but I watched porn of women.  I want  to try having sex with a guy just to see what it feels like and know  that I can please one.

I was never  very well socialized around anyone, but particularly not around boys.  I  had one male friend when I was 6, but his mother made him stop hanging  out with me because she didn't want her son to be friends with a girl.  I  feel like I must obey the boys/men in my life - adult men and teenage  boys.  I fear them to some extent, but I want their approval just as  badly.  My father is around, always has been, but he usually works and  when he comes home, we don't talk all that much.

169,"I got offered a really amazing internship which has a good salary and with a load of extra benefits on top of it (covers my rent, health insurance, 25 days leave, etc...) for 5 months, before I start my 4th year of college. The company is the top of it's industry in technology and is involved in exactly some of the stuff I want to work on when I graduate and would definitely give me some amazing experience. 

However the company also has one of the worst reputations around, especially for how it treats its lower paid workers. I would not be working in the section for which it has a bad reputation. 

When I told my friends I received the internship offer many of them jumped to hate on the company and talk about how absolutely terrible it is and even go so far as to call it ""the worst company ever"". Though I believe that statement is definitely hyperbolic, what they said really hurt me and is making me reconsider accepting their offer. 

I've yet to even get any other internship offers, though I am still in consideration for most of the companies I applied to and I won't be interning until next year so there's still some time. My friends who reacted badly aren't in the same degree as I am, I do engineering while all of them do arts and I know that paid internships aren't even an option for them so they'll never have this same dilemma. But I honestly don't know, would I be compromising my morals if I worked for this company?

I don't see myself getting a better offer of an internship and my parents would never let me say no to it without a fight as it would cover all my living expenses and allow me to be completely independent of them. 

However it's reputation is just pretty awful, and I'm afraid of being judged or seen as a bad person for accepting an internship with them. 

TL;DR - got offered an amazing internship with a company with a terrible reputation. My friends reaction was to immediately start talking about how awful the company is and I'm now having second thoughts about working for them.

Ok so about a month ago I received a very late birthday card from a family friend. When I opened it I was kinda shocked. It was the SAME exact card that some guy I used to talk to gave me on my actual birthday. We hung out all summer and talked every day. We grew pretty close I would say, but he ended up ending our friendship. The thing is, I liked him but he didn't feel the same way. However, he did and said things that really made it seem that way. Anyways, he got me the same card on my birthday and I still had it. What really shocked me was that it was the same card, AND they both have the same name, just spelled differently. I was so heart broken by this guy for leading me on and giving me false hope, but I couldn't help but think; does this mean anything? I turned 18, so it could be a coincidence that it was the same generic card for when someone turns 18 but. I overthink a lot. I was just thinking about it again recently, any advice or opinions would be really appreciated!!",25Nov2019,1
178,"Hey everyone, so my family and I are getting pretty worried about my younger brother. He is 15 and having a lot of issues at the moment. For instance, he started smoking weed and is also most likely huffing paint. He also drinks on occasion with friends. He stopped hanging out with a lot of the nicer kids in school in favor of being with the popular kids, and his grades are slipping. He had all kinds of interests like soccer, playing guitar, and painting and he was pretty good at all of those things, but now he spends most of his days either at the mall or locked in his room and has dropped his former interests. His room is also really messy and is covered in empty junk food packages, which from my experience contributes a lot to a person's mood.

Most of the people in my family have struggled with some form of anxiety or depression (myself included, so I can relate to him), but he also gets extremely angry. Last summer, he got really upset and had a few breakdowns which included self-harm. He goes to see a therapist every once in a while but I'm not sure it helps, and he also is on anxiety medication. He also has been lying lately, even about obvious things we know are true. 

Today, my parents got a letter in the mail (which he was trying to take before it got to him) saying that he was banned from the mall for about half a year for shoplifting. He came clean about stealing small things from other stores as well. My parents had us sit down as a family tonight to discuss these things and how we can help and be there for him, but he was very closed the whole time.

  I need some advice on how I can be there for him, but its also pretty hard because I have a hard time relating to him these days. I was always more of a loser in high school and was not popular at all, and I'm having a really hard time connecting to him. I want him to know I love him and am there for him, and I want him to fix his behavior before it turns into a bigger problem for him.",25Nov2019,1

There is this one guy I know who I tell everything about and he tells me everything about. we have been friends for 10 years. When we first met he didn't really have any friends and I wa the only one. We hung out all the time. As time went on he gathered more and more friends but it didn't seem to affect anything (pathetic as I was I started to get jealous as this started to look like the convenience cycle over again). But ever since he started working he got less time as (I am unemployed currently,my Bachelor isn't getting me a job  so I'm getting my Masters) which is fine. 

Anyway what we have done since 15 is just make stupid fanfiction crap just to pass the time on messenger,skype or whatever. But it seems like the last year, on the weekends(Which I work on part time) he hangs out with other people which are his friends. However when he has plans he always ask if we can write and the nehads out and when he comes back home he asks the same thing. I just feel like I'm being the conveniece friend all over again and I told him the stories before about how I was when he started to get friends but I'm starting to doubt that.

182,"Throwaway, because some of my friends know my actual reddit handle.

To preface this, my goal is not to mend or rekindle my relationship with this person or anything along those lines. I'm thinking of making this apology for the very selfish intent of clearing my own conscious. I'm just worried if there's anything here that could make my situation any worse or hurt the person I'm apologizing to.

Backstory:

About 2 years ago, one of my best friends, lets call him Sam and my other good friend, lets call her Vicky abruptly broke up. Since Vicky was the one who was broken up with, I offered to take her out to get coffee or something to take her mind off of it. This is where the r/TIFU shit comes in. I had never been in this kind of a situation before, and as a dumb and nervous 17 year old, I asked her some questions, that at the time I though were good questions, but looking back were completely inappropriate to ask someone who had just gotten out of a relationship. I won't go into detail, but long story short, she was kind of creeped out because she thought i was hitting her, and I don't blame her. I still cringe just thinking about it. I heard about this later through the grapevine of our extended friend group, but Vicky never told me about it. My friends advised me at the time not to say anything about it and act normal, since she didn't say anything to me, but we pretty much stopped talking after that. Luckily it was senior year.

We drifted apart in the following months and moved away to our respective colleges after the summer. About a year ago, I contacted her to let her know I was coming down for a internship interview at a tech company near her university  and asked if she wanted to catch up. She said headed back to our hometown that weekend and couldn't but offered to let me sub-let her apartment if i needed a place to stay for the summer if i got the internship (so at least maybe she still trusts me a bit). During the interview, there was actually a campus shooter alert on the side of campus where my interview was taking place. I didn't get the alert because I'm not a student there, but she immediately texted me, while she was in our hometown to make sure I was ok, because she got the alert. We haven't had almost any communication since.

Question:

Should I just leave her alone, or do you think it's a good idea for me to try to apologize for my behavior in the past. It kind of eats me up inside, that she might think that I would do something like that. I just don't want to do anything that could hurt her, but I also don't want to keep living with that regret.

184,"hello all, so before I jump straight into things I wanted to give a brief background to the situation.

My mom has a therapy dog that is a Pomeranian and he’s been her baby since the day they met. He follows her everywhere she goes, never strays from her side, comforts her and quite honestly, he likely understands her far better than any of us ever could. His name is MooMoo (she named him that since he resembled a mini version of a cow when he was young) and he’s currently 17 years old. he’ll be turning 18 this coming march however, my family’s worry is that he is not going to make it to his 18th birthday sadly. 

Usually he follows my mom all throughout the house. No matter where she goes, he follows. recently though, he’s become quite tired. He rarely gets up to follow her anymore and he spends most of the days sleeping. He doesn’t play like he use to a few months back. We’ve had to get him a special type of soft food for dogs since he can’t eat harder foods. He’s been having trouble trying to get up and down the stairs when we let him outside to use the bathroom. We use to let him go out and play in the snow because he use to love it. He would jump around and lick the snow and just dance away like nothing mattered but this year he hasn’t played in any of the snow that we’ve gotten. He just goes outside, does his business and comes back in. Its becoming more and more visible with each day that he’s having a bit or trouble with telling where things are are things like that. he’s become blind with age sadly but we’ve accommodated to that a while back and try to help him out. He’s getting skinnier although we feed him the recommended amount for him. In general, He just doesn’t seem so well anymore.

My family and I have known for a while now that this time would eventually come but now that it’s approaching, we are unsure of how to handle it. We don’t know when but we know it’s coming soon sadly. I know my mother will absolutely be distraught and I don’t know what to do or how to help her. The pair of them are inseparable and I just know that it’s not going to be easy for her to handle this. He is her baby and has been with her through thick and thin. They have quite a bit of history and have a deep connection. 

I’m currently 16 so I still live at home which I think gives me an advantage to trying to help my mom process and deal with this entire situation. I just don’t know how. 

If there is anyone out there who has been in a similar situation or just has some advice in general, please help. I want to make sure that my family will be okay and that MooMoo can live as comfortably as possible for the remaining time he has here with us. Thank you for taking the time to read my post, have a lovely evening/day/night/etc.",25Nov2019,1

My ex boyfriend and I, “josh” broke up about a year ago. We went on a miscommunicated “break up” and then a few months later an official break up. We ended on a bad note and didn’t talk for 6 months. This past summer, we ended up meeting up at camp and stayed up till 6 am talking. We both apologized to each other for being mean and decided that we would go back to being close friends as we were before we started dating. It took some time but we finally got there. Here’s the thing, we are both very into BDSM. I like being submissive and so does he. We would take turns of who got to be sub when we were dating. After we became friends again, our hookups also came back. We’d do it A LOT throughout the summer, often disappearing  into the woods or places that were for the most part closed off to do it. After the summer, I’d sometimes ditch school and head to his apt in the city where we would do our shenanigans with our newly bought sex toys. Recently, he told me that I should find myself a sugar daddy who would be able to keep up with my sex drive and do the things I like or find living situation where I’m a “free use for free rent” type thing. I checked out a sugar baby website but decided against it cause it asked my address and I wasn’t so comfortable. It ended up being that he went on one of these websites and signed up to be a sugar baby. He then later told me that his sugar daddy takes him out to eat and then his sugar daddy fucks him. “Josh” is also into being femme. I don’t have a problem with him being femme or bi-sexual but it just weirds me out a little. I’m not homophobic but it probably sounds like I am. The thing is that when we were dating he never expressed any interest in boys. We had a pretty open relationship with no secrets. I can’t help but wonder if I did something when we were dating to push him onto this? Growing up he was physically abused by his father and I’ve definitely seen the ways it has affected him in daily life. I’m not trying to offend anyone. I’m just kind of shocked. I learned most of this about an hour ago and still trying to comprehend what I’ve been told. He’s a good friend and I support his choices but I’ve just had a lot dumped on me. I guess I’m trying to find a way to cope with this? He still would like for us to hook up and I’m not sure if I still want to. I know I should have a serious conversation about this with him but I’m scared of hurting his feelings or things being taken the wrong way. Please help! Thank you!!",25Nov2019,1

So about a week ago he raped his ex, which is also my best friend. It took us a while to realize it was rape. Turns out he was incredibly manipulative sexually when they were together. 

One big turn of event was when he admitted to his ex/ my bf that he was choking the dogs I was dogsitting. I'm talking chihuahuas, miniature schnauzers, some adorable incredibly innocent dogs. He, said, quote on quote, that he knows when to stop to avoid suffocating them. 

Heres the thing, this psychopathic behavior started about a month ago when I started hanging out more with his now ex. We are very close, but I am gay, and she knows it, and he knows it.

After breaking up with her, they kept on seeing each other on and off (until the rape incident), he kept on telling her that we should invite him to our outings, even though he broke up with her, and she asked that they stopped seeing each other. Then he hits me with the ""Please don't hook up with \[ex\]"", I was quite shocked as we are well aware I am gay. 

Lately, he has been increasingly nice to me, a bit too nice considering that he always texts his ex asking her why he's not being invited, that shes isolating him (even though he has his own group of friends), in other words, blaming her for the situation, but has been awfully calm with me. Am I overreacting by thinking that he might lash out on me at some point? All that anger, or jealousy, whatever it is, is building up. I was even telling my best friend about three weeks ago that I am worried he might hit me at some point as I was feeling quite uncomfortable back then too as I felt like there always was some tension building up, but didn't know why until recently.

So far people around me has been telling me that I was not overreacting. have",25Nov2019,1

192,"So I know this girl i really really really like (F18). However she has a bf, the relationship is ok however I'd be lying if i said i didn't want to secure my position as the next boyfriend if or when the relationship ends. (I'm not trying to end the relationship whatsoever, i wish them the best but if they breakup I kinda want it to be my turn). So we were chatting at a Cafe last night. The topic of sex came up and we just started talking about it for several minutes. She told me how she was insecure of herself and her body. I tried to be subtle but i told her that ambitious and straight headed girls like her are hard to come by these days, i then continued to say she's perfect just the way she is and anyone who thinks differently well then f**k em', there is always someone out there that will see her perfection. She then asked the question, ""are you flirting with me?"", she didn't say it in a serious tone nor playful one. I was frozen, milliseconds felt like hours, if i say yes she could be repulsed by the fact that she has a Bf, if i say no she may see me as her ""friend"" in the future. So i basically said ""no, I'm just stating the obvious, people pleaser is a hard mantle to carry"". I drove back home and now I'm slapping myself in the forehead because I may just confirmed a permanent freind zone. I know I'm probably overthinking this lol, but i need to know. Did i ruin myself?

193,"I do have specific questions like
Should I behave more like an adult and what does that mean? Or rather, of course become independent, keep myself alive, face my fears and reach my goals; but have the personality I want and not a traditional adult behavior?
How do I face my fears, become more confident and reach my goals?
What are essential mental or physical skills I should have?
How do I cope with the loss of my childhood? Is it okay to simultaneously look for out-of-the-norm solutions like research, time travel and age manipulation along with doing what I'm supposed to do? (I'm a clown k lol, and I'm generally interested in that not just because of my birthday)
If I make a celebration what do you recommend? I was thinking about a fun celebration based on technology and art. But I fall short on details.
How do I keep a good relationship with my parents?
What should I look for in roommates or how do I spot money scams?
How do I have fun and balance everything in my life?
How do I start my career? (I left school at 15 and do not plan on going back, but I have been told I am smart and I do have aspirations like business ideas, inventions and art)

I think I will generally miss my childhood. My parents are pretty neat and they took me to parks and museums and were always making jokes and making sure I was having fun and reaching my goals. It's hard to grow up. But I've always been really independent and I always wanted to be on my own and get the personality I want, along with clothes and skills. And if something that I want doesn't already exist in the world, I am proud to say that now I can build it without the legal restrictions that I had for the last 18 years.
I'm having trouble with my memories specifically. Of them being forgotten forever and never happening again. All the past that if I don't bother to remember or write down and share it could disappear, and there isn't the possibility of it happening again, unless it is a trashy simulation

His heart behind the matter is pure and sentimental — he wants to have a time of intentional bonding or something between the new three of us. However I am very conflicted. I really envision my mom staying in our guest room for the first week to be support for us during such a new transition. 
* I do not think he quite understands the severity of change that will happen after delivery (my body’s recovery, baby’s sleep schedule, our sleep deprivation, our lack of time and energy to cook or pick up food, do laundry, care for our dog). 
*Also I’m even thinking of small things like, my mom being there to hold the baby while I shower and my husband gets a nap in, or if he has a business meeting he can’t miss (he owns his own business and doesn’t exactly have any pto), or even just having a woman there who has had experience (she has had 7 children) in case I have trouble breast-feeding or something. 
*My mom isn’t intrusive and knows when to give us space…so I know she wouldn’t be a bother at all. 
*But I’m also trying to be kind to the fact that my hubby envisions this cute homecoming of our baby.

Should I just let him have it his way and he learns the hard way that having had support that first week would’ve been ideal? Or do I try to help him see how important it is to have that help?

*Plus my mom lives 3.5 hours away. So if she wasn't to come until a week later, she wouldn’t get to come during delivery-it isn’t practical for her to drive down while I’m laboring, and then go back home and drive down again a week later.*

I told her I do not drive and I'm not in nor interested in a relationship. Around that point is when the conversation became explicit. She then told me she would like to f##k. I never had anyone admit that to me before and I always wondered what it was like to have someone send nudes to me so I then suggested (if she was ok with it) she deliver nude photos to me. I believe she then told me to show off my body and figuring I would get something in return I obliged and showed her my ""eggplant"". To her credit she did show off parts of her body in return. I soon regretted the whole ordeal and told her to pretend like nothing ever happened. Fast forward to the next few days and she does not post anything it's hard for me to pretend like nothing happened when she goes radio silent. I soon decided to unfriend her because in my mind I don't think she took my rejection well and I also felt that I shouldn't have shown that part of myself nor should I have talked her into showing her body. my question is did I make the right decision unfriending her considering the key things I have brought up and considering that this is the first and probably only time (to me at least) she has done something like this.",25Nov2019,1

207,"TL;DR at the bottom.

Warning: Really long read and bad formatting ahead. I'm on mobile.


So, a little background before I start. I've been working at this restaurant (I'm a cook, used to be a dishwasher) for almost 7 years now and a lot of employees come and go. However, when I started there was this waitress (her name is Gemma) that I got a long with very well, we joked around, talked a lot etc. All at work though, I've never hung out with her outside of work. She quit about a year to a year and a half after I started, came back and quit again. We still got along when she came back and she has visited a couple times to say hi to everyone. I did have a little crush on her but nothing ever came of it. 

Anyway, so, last Thursday she comes in to visit pretty close to the time I should be closing up and heading home. I figure she was just gonna say hi, ask how I'm doing etc. but she was really drunk and crying. So she comes over and starts hugging me and basically crying into my arms. I ask her what's wrong or if something happened and she just said ""nothing"". So I continue hugging her and like 3 or 4 minutes have gone by at this point. She steps back and I tell her she needs to tell me what's wrong and she says ""me, it's me"" over and over a few times. I then said ""I don't know what you're trying to say"" and she just hugs me again and starts crying harder. After a few more minutes pass by, she asks me to put my number in her phone but she doesn't have it on her so I put hers in mine and send a text. A few seconds pass and it looks like she's about to kiss me but the bartender (Kayleigh) upstairs is walking down. Kayleigh had Gemma's phone, I assume she saw it when I texted her for my number. Anyway, Kayleigh starts asking how Gemma is going to get home and why she's crying. Gemma says no one cares about her to which we both reply that we do. Gemma says that some guy named Trevor is going to pick her up, but she's clearly lying. After a few minutes, Kayleigh goes back up upstairs and it's just gemma and I in the kitchen. She looks at me and says ""come here"" and starts kissing me, I start thinking ""holy shit I'm making out with gemma"" to ""this girl is drunk I should stop"" so I pull away and I ask ""what was that for?"" And she says ""I just really wanted to kiss you."" I pause for a second because I have no idea what to say then she kissed me again, this time for a few seconds. Afterwards she says she needs to go and I tell her that she needs to find a ride home (I wasn't able to at the time but would have if I could) and she promises she would. So at this point I'm very confused, sort of happy, but mostly worried about her getting home safely. I then talk to my manager about the situation Gemma is in. My manager says that she gemma was crying because one of her ""friends"" was talking shit about her brother upstairs. I ask how she's going to get home and she says she's going down the road to her boyfriends house. She also was saying she missed me like 7 or 8 times throughout the 10-15 minutes she was hugging me. So, the next day I text her saying ""Hey, did you get home okay last night?"" and she never responded. It's now Sunday night and I'm just very confused. This is what I'm thinking, either she does this when she gets really drunk and I should try to think nothing of it,  there's more to her being sad than just her friend shit talking her brother and maybe she has feelings for me too? I don't know, I've never been in a situation like this and I'm not sure how to feel. If she would just text me back and talk about it it would be so much easier. Anyway, thank you for reading this and thank you for anyone willing to give some advice. 

TL;DR: I work at a restaurant, wait staff constantly comes and goes, when I started there was this waitress that I got along with really well. She visits Thursday night really drunk and crying, asks for my number, makes out with me and I texted her Friday but she hasn't texted back.

When I was 15-16, I lived in a tough situation as my dad was briefly unemployed and my household was somewhat abusive. But I myself was a toxic person. During that time, I would spend most of my time on the internet since I am introverted and would play games such as roblox where I would participate in roleplaying groups to have some fun. We would often discuss what's going on the roleplaying group in skype or even discuss how our real lives were in terms of school and such. But I was an asshole and manipulative as I would work with other toxic people to get people in the group ""banned"" (though no one is exactly banned in the roleplaying group) by accusing them of doing something against the roleplaying group with fake posts/comments. I would often start arguments/flame at other people in our group for no reason and would often do stupid things against the roleplaying group as I have said/joked about insensitive things. When I was finally ""banned"", I threw a stupid tantrum and went off on the people that supposedly betrayed my toxic group on how I was going to ruin their roleplaying career/life and continued to be friends with other toxic assholes who were plotting a ""coup"" on the group. Eventually, I stopped caring about roleplaying as I focused more on school to the point I was getting near straight As while taking the hardest courses that are offered by my school and was able to graduate as top 15% of my class though I was ""pardoned"" in the group when one of my toxic friends took over and kicked people that were hated by my toxic friends.

My boyfriend is an over-the-road worker so we end up living in hotels/motels  close to his job location.  We are quiet people who stay to ourselves, in our room. Until recently, we've never had issues with places we stay. We have everything you need to keep the room clean. We also wash they hotels sheets and towels when we wash our clothes. No place has ever bothered us or showed concern bout us doing that.
 Well this place we have been staying at insists on the maid coming in every other day.  I had spoke with the maid and we agreed on her coming in to pick up and change linens twice a week. 

 On her days off an Indian couple cleans the rooms.
 Not long after we got here the couple lied saying our room was messy and I wouldn't let them in to clean. This caused the front desk lady to knock on my door. She was beyond rude threatening to throw me out, call the cops on me, even went as far as telling me she will personally remove the lock on our door.  The regular maid told her our room is never messy which the desk lady apologized about her behavior treating me nicely, until about 2 weeks ago. 

The couple told the same front desk lady that it had been over 3 days since our room had been cleaned. Which was a lie, I had them on video cleaning our room on a Saturday. The regular maid was in on the Thursday before. (every other day like they want) The front desk lady came and woke me up so they couple could clean. I got dressed and wait 2 hours for them to come clean like they wanted. I said screw it and was using the bathroom when they finally came to clean (I locked the door, not wanting them to end up walking in on my in the bathroom) 

Now, I am a loud person in general so I know they heard me one of the 4 times I shouted to give me a moment, I was in the bathroom. The couple got the front desk lady back up to my room. I answered the door as soon as I was done and the lady went into a rant telling me it was unacceptable to not answer the door even though I was using the bathroom. She threatened to kick me out, to call the cops. Which I told her go ahead I'll show the police the videos of them cleaning Saturday (this was a Monday). The lady was cussing me telling me that I must let them in everyday at 1pm from now on. I said I would, trying to defuse the ticking bomb at my door. That wasn't even though, she kept cussing me threatening me, telling me off. Me, getting annoyed, had had enough so I shut my door in her face, locking it. I opened it back up, she was gone n I let the couple in to clean (I don't know why they want in my room so bad. That's the only thing I can come up with as to why they'd lie causing these conflicts).  

Now here's my issue, I had ordered a few things online (from Amazon) a couple weeks ago and have been waiting on these packages.  Last week I went to my home town and visited friends for a lil over a week. On the 18th one of my packages arrived at the hotel. I know this because I tracked the package from the time it got to the States til it was delivered. So from the time it arrived in Queens, New York til it was delivered to the front desk at the hotel I stay in in Ohio. When I got back I asked about my package but the 3rd shift lady said there's not packages. I said something to the nice maid and she said she never saw my package either. She normally brings them up for me. I asked the weekend days lady, never saw a package, 2nd shift. No package. When my package was delivered it was delivered to the front desk lady that has cussed me out twice now. She works mon-thurs 7a-3p, my pack was delivered on a Monday at 11:18am.  So obviously she had to have done something with my package,  It's the only logical thing.  I know if I ask the lady about package, she's gonna snap off. The owners aren't from this country n don't speak much English so They probably won't full grasp my complaint/concern. That being the case, I am unsure how to resolve my issue with the lady doing something with my mail. 

I would like the product I paid for but honestly, to me, it's now more about the principal of it all. You can't just take someone's mail. No matter how much you dislike them. Plus it's COMPLETELY unprofessional.  I would like to see her lose her job, yes. Hell, I'd LOVE to show her who the real bitch is and see her charged for her actions but I'm still trying to be the bigger person (somewhat) and would like to handle this the best and most effective way possible, I'm just unsure what that would be.",25Nov2019,1

But I noticed that the last time I gave her a flower, even though she smiled, she said kind of quietly ""you really don't have to"". I took it as a sign that she wanted me to stop so friday that was the last time i did it. Then like a week ago i had asked her if she wanted to hang out. She didn't reply. When I asked her a few days later if she had seen it, she seemed apologetic, that she had been super busy with work and family reunions and stuff related to that and asked if I wanted to somettime that week. I said i was inable to that week (because of social anxiety but I didnt tell her that reason, i just said I couldn't) Then tonight i asked her a question regarding something work related. Then she said, regardingg the previous message i had sent her a few weeks ago (the one asking her to hang out) ""unfortunately i will not be able to hang out. Times are difficult"".

She's super stressed and I know that's where her hostility is coming from, but at the same time it's really affecting my livelihood.

It turns out it's all  online. Lied about that when asked. I have also decided not to do this  internship because my mom said I should just focus on writing because  that's my passion. That was all just a bit too complicated to explain to  people I am house sitting for starting tomorrow, so I told them I was  still doing the internship I am no longer doing, but I am having trouble  keeping up with my own lies...Plus I got really embarrassed when I  couldn't tell them where the BCI actually was because I'd never actually  been there. Advice? I am feeling very anxious and scared about telling  people the truth.

236,"I'm 32 years old and have nobody in my life but my wife and kids and work acquaintances. This should be fulfilling but I would like people I can talk to and just shoot the shit with sometimes. I am a social outcast in real life and apparently online too as I tend to just be lazy about keeping up with anything and anyone.

I just would like some advice on how I can make friends, preferably online friends because my real life is too busy to keep up relationships that I have to be available in person for. Part of my problem might be that I try to befriend females when playing video games and I'm probably seen as a creep but I don't put that kind of vibe out there afaik. I'm respectful and I don't want a relationship, I'm married I just want friends.

I'm at the point where watching youtube videos that feature groups of friends has been my social island in the storm. I watch things like Critical Role(now) and Zackscottgames Minecraft series from years ago and as stupid as it sounds when I watch these videos I feel like I have friends and a connection with these people but when the episodes are over its just me, alone.

You are probably thinking oh but you have your wife and kids. That is a great thing but maybe I'm just messed up but it doesn't feel like enough. I love them more than anything but I want to have some sort of connection with other people. I want people I can hang out with online that actually want to talk to me. I want to feel like I belong somewhere. I want to be a part of something.

237,"In late September I moved across the country to start a new job with the company I had been working for the past several years. A week after I accepted the position in July, I developed a rash which is now being explained as eczema (no known cure) in my genital region. Needless to say, with the constant irritation and the move to a completely foreign area, my anxiety built. I had a mental breakdown after my first two weeks (I am alone for work, traveling and visiting customers).

I came back home on medical leave for the anxiety and depression, trying to figure my medications out and see if I can get any treatment for the rash. I have seen my doctor a bunch since I’ve been back and unfortunately my depression and anxiety may be even worse than when I came back. I can’t find a medication that calms me down. The rash I have told is chronic and there is no real cure other than it may go away on its own.

I now am coming up on four weeks until I have to make a decision to return to work or to throw the towel in completely on the job. I was so excited for it, but now am terrified that going back I am going to fail. In the meantime though, I am not doing anything functional at home besides eating and sleeping and occasionally working out.

238,"I was playing tennis today. I've been playing for about 4 months. My doubles partner shouted at me a little because when he moved to one side of the court I was supposed to move to the other side of the court so we can cover both areas. 

This happened a second time and he really raised his voice at me. He was saying ""What are you doing? You're supposed to move to the other side of the court. I can't do all the running"". He didn't swear or anything. He just raised his voice. I'm not sure what else he said, but he was basically raising his voice at me. I kind of just zoned out because I was a little worried, but I knew he wouldn't hit me or anything. 

To be fair to him our matched ended soon after. He went up to me when I was putting my racket in my bag and he put his hand on my back and told me that should move to the other side of the court to cover both areas. His voice was quite then. 

My only defence is that I didn't play for a couple of weeks, I have no cadio and I was exhausted from playing. In fact, I walk 20 minutes to get to the tennis courts and that was a little tiring. He didn't know any of this, but that's what happened.

241,"[TW: mentions abuse and suicidal ideation]

I can't seem to find the balance between being used as a doormat and standing up for myself and my beliefs. I've been in a mentally abusive and toxic relationship before, and feeling so helpless and ignored led to some suicidal ideation. I promised myself I wouldn't let anyone treat me like that again, to never find myself down that well again.

I'd like to think I've come a long ways since then. I have a wonderful boyfriend to help me through it all, and he's been my rock for the past two years. Yet, sometimes the only positive interactions I get with other people are from him. I know it's not fair to him if I rely on him for all my social needs, but I'm having difficulty making and keeping friends.

I'll admit that sometimes I'm stubborn, but I try to cherry pick the issues I'm unrelenting with to things that are really sacred to me: making amends, apologizing, empathy, queer, women's, and POC issues, etc. 

My sister and I have always gotten into arguments about her not respecting queer people. I actually came out as bisexual because she wouldn't stop making gay jokes or calling things she didn't like ""gay"". She's trying to learn, but she still doesn't understand much of what it means to be queer and everytime I try to explain things to her she shuts it down one way or the other. I fear that she thinks I don't love her just because I want her to be better and now more about these things.

With college, I've had trouble with my roommates.    My first roommate and I got along really well for a while. Among other things, we disagreed about fundamental things like jokes targeted at trans people, white people dictating POC behaviour, and whether or not women needed feminism. I wanted to actually talk and learn and teach each other things, but it turned sour pretty quickly and then she moved dorms (because she had always wanted a single anyways) before we could fix things. 

Now I'm having problems with one of the other people I live with. From my perspective, she doesn't apologize and always makes excuses when either one of my other roommates or I try to talk to her about stuff we don't like. Leaving stuff in the sink, sleeping on the couch constantly, splaying all her stuff across the living room, eating things of ours without asking. She also misgenders a trans kid we knew in high school, and gave me a bunch of excuses when I confronted her to the tune of ""I don't ever use wrong name for the other trans kid we know!"" I'm more upset about the pattern of excuses and refusal to apologize than I am about any one of the incidents (aside from the trans one; that one hurts a bit more).

After so many failures, I'm convinced I'm the problem. Should I let things go? Am I being too stubborn about all of these things? I don't want to let people just make me feel like shit and like every thing I say or do is wrong like my ex did, but I'm also so tired of trying to make relationships work only to see them crash and burn because of ""irreconcilable differences"". I'm willing to change if that's what it takes but I can't stand the conflict anymore.",25Nov2019,1

I heard pounding and moaning coming from upstairs so I started calling out my brothers name and he didn’t respond so I just went upstairs and opened the door to his room and I found him on the bed having gay sex with some guy I didn’t even know and all I could say was “What the fuck?” And I left the room and slammed the door behind me and then I went to my room and didn’t even speak to my brother for the rest of the day.

Around the early 2000s, I got into finance with no experience and really got my stuff together.  I was making a little over 100k a year and doing really well, I was not afraid to tell anyone either.  In fact, I had an incredible superiority complex.  In 2009 the market killed me, I was humbled greatly.  With no skills or education to fall back on, I really struggled to live not finding any footing until 2015.  With a mostly healthy market, I am back doing very well, about 200k+ a year, working in finance again.  However, now I am much different in my attitude.  I left all the bragging behind me and I have a healthy amount of self-deprecating humor.  I feel that I now have a very good handle on things after getting some sense forced into me, my perspective is much more ""normal"" I do very well for myself and my family.

&amp;#x200B;

For a few years now my stomach has hurt and felt weird, not all the time, but a good majority of the time. It's stopped being quite so bad as of late, but yesterday it came back full force. It's like this weird gross feeling that's half nausea and half pain. The most unnerving thing is that lately it's actually my stomach that acts up. Normally when someone says their stomach hurts they're referring to pain in their lower abdomen. And while I totally have pain there sometimes, lately I also feel something weird going on with my actual stomach, further up near my diaphragm. It's almost like I can feel the food fall into my stomach and can feel the acids trying to digest stuff. Like just today I took a swig of cold brew coffee and as soon as I felt it land in my stomach, my stomach hurt. And sometimes I get so hungry at night, but I can't eat anything because I know I'll be in pain the next day. A few weeks ago, I literally had two Dorito chips at like ten o'clock just to get rid of hunger pangs, and the next morning it felt like I had a knife lodged in my gut. I used to eat a ton of food, really bad food, so I figured when I was lying curled up in the fetal position about to throw up it was because I ate a row of Oreos and a bag of M&amp;Ms in one sitting.

255,"I, (18F) and my boyfriend (21M) have been together for 8 months. I have posted quite intensively on some other subreddits because I don't have lots of friends to rely on right now. But of the friends I do still have, and the people who have responded to my forums, my boyfriends behaviour seems to be pretty concerning.

\- He is very very jealous. He told me he gets jealous of my friends when I'm ""giving them attention"" and not him. I see my friends much less often than I see him because of university and work. The other day I was going to my cousin (20M)'s house and showed my boyfriend a picture of him and his kid. My boyfriend called my cousin ugly, then a day later admitted he was jealous of my COUSIN.

\- He use to text me everyday, all day and would get mad at me for not answering him back right away. (we have been trying to work on this). He would check my location on Snapchat "" when he was bored"" but would call me out for going on ghost mode. 

\- He shows up at my house without telling me he is coming over (he's done it 3 times). I would feel more comfortable with this if I knew him for longer. But the last time he showed up I specifically told him not too because I had to do schoolwork before I went to work, he guilted me by saying ""he was trying to do something nice"" and by saying that he doesn't drop by *that* often and that I'd have to compromise with him.

\- He constantly needs reassurance that I still like him and that I'm not cheating on him.  Today, he asked me if I was losing interest because I didn't want to snapchat him with my face in it and I just messaged him instead.  I always try and keep his mental health as a priority but he makes issues that shouldn't be my issues into my issues. This is something I feel like he needs to work on with a therapist but he will not acknowledge that.

\- We honest to god don't have a lot to talk about. He doesn't do much during the day, he doesn't have many interests. I feel like I have lots of ambitious goals and I can't really talk to him about them because he doesn't have goals of his own. He was so broke he had to move back in with his parents but he refuses to slow down on his fast food consumption and cook for himself.  I feel like he literally has no drive to make things better for himself.

I really liked him for the first 6 months but then all the little things started to build up and paint a bigger, nastier picture. I think I'm just really scared to break up because I don't want to be alone. 

I would appreciate any and all advice,

Thanks.",25Nov2019,1
256,"Ive known this girl since I was 10 and I am now 18 and we have started a long distance relationship (Yeah I know it'll probably end horribly, but hell im a loser and she makes me happy. As long as I have happy memories, I dont care about how it'll end. I ideally want to spend my life with her, but I doubt she'll stick around due to our young age) But ive struggled heavily with clinical depression and anxiety, plus I have autism (high functioning obviously) and she doesnt know and I dont ever plan on telling her. And yes im ashamed of my autism. So my autism and depression mixed with my mom being in a abusive relationship with my dad and a lot more stuff I dont wish to get into, I am the embodiment of the word ""loser"" and all that made for a crippling depression that has been affecting me since I was 9 years old. And for the past 8 months ive been the happiest I have ever been, instead of being sad all the time im empty now. And I dont mean empty in the soul crushing way. I mean in a autistic way, where I dont feel anything unless a moment happens that makes me happy or sad IN that moment. But for the past two weeks shes had more and more breakdowns and ive been there for her as much as I can. But the most recent ones, she talks about wanting to not be here anymore and she hangs up the phone call. So rightfully so, I get scared and call her back straight away. And sometimes she denies the call or lets it ring out. I have to text her and say that if she doesnt pick up ill call 911. (By the way, her breakdowns are justified to me. She has had the worst upbringing ive ever seen before) and tonight she had a breakdown over what is seemingly nothing. One second we were fine and next im sitting her clutching my phone wondering if this will be the last time i hear her voice, wondering if im going to have to talk to a 911 operator and send a ambulance to my girlfriends house. And its been destroying me inside. Tonight broke me and i muted the phone and Kyled my door (I punched it) and I yelled out and just broke down and then had to suck it up in a matter of seconds to unmute the phone and then talk to her in a soft voice and talk her down from her state of mind. Its taking a massive tole on me and I dont know what to do. I apologize if this post is kind of all over the place, im typing this moments after she has calmed, but im still not okay.",25Nov2019,1
257,"Long story short my friend had to get rid of her cat earlier this year and we’re like 80% sure he’s dead. My friend has always said if she gets rid of the cat she would off herself and knowing her she was legit. She has never been in  mentally/emotionally stable state especially now with everything in her life. I wanted to make her something special this Christmas since it’s her favorite holiday and the last few Christmas’s she’s had haven’t been the best. I thought I would give her  a picture framed of her cat, but I just don’t know if it’s the right thing to do. I don’t want to cause her anymore pain having a constant reminder of him. She’s a very overly sensitive person, so I have no idea what to do. I thought if I put myself in her shoes how I would feel about it, and I would be so happy to have a reminder, but we are POLAR OPPOSITES. 

TLDR: should I give my sensitive, mentally unstable friend a picture of her possibly dead cat for Christmas?",25Nov2019,1

259,"I am a 17 year old student currently in 11th grade. I have some of the most important exams coming up soon for which I should start studying from now but the problem is, I think way too much. Yesterday, I was reading the chapter in my science book and it had nothing I didn't understand, it was just that it was impossible for me to stay present. I start reading, keep reading but also start imagining random things that are totally unrelated to the subject I am reading the book about (for example, I will start imagining conversations with any random person I know or start thinking about geometrical shapes moving or making patterns) and I end up finishing the chapter without having paid attention to even a single sentence. That makes me go back to the beginning and start reading all over again and it keeps happening. My teachers appreciate me for being ""smart"" but my ""smartness"" never helps with my grades. I don't think I know too much but some of my classmates think I know too much and so do some teachers (many of them also find it annoying but I try not to be annoying and I have seen many people here on Reddit that know a lot more than me. I can't be described as ""knowledgeable"" but just as an internet nerd). I don't see how I can be a person that knows way t0oo much and get 56% in my 10th grade annual exam. And this time I think things would be even worse since this time I have to learn even more things than last year and I just can't focus. No matter how many times I try to read a chapter, I lose focus (and start imagining) after being present for just 10 or 15 sentences.



.... don't read further if you're already tired of it.



This post is already too long but I think I should mention my other problems too just in case they might be needed. I have a weird habit of getting irritated when I am not able to answer/solve the questions/problems in my book. I give up and start doing something else to stop feeling annoyed. I always try to look for answers to the questions I can't answer myself and when I am not able to find the answers myself and keep failing I give up and start wasting my time on games or Reddit or other stuff. I like when I am able to solve all the questions seamlessly and when I am not and also fail to find a good answer, I just feel too pissed. (Wow I am repeating myself now).
Now the last few things that I think anyone who tries to help should know are that I have migraine which probably has affected the vision in my left eye. I also have a problem of losing temper too easily and anxiety (not sure if they're related) and I feel like everyone hates me when I am surrounded by people.

Tl;dr:  I have some of the most important exams coming up soon for which I should start studying from now but the problem is, I think way too much. I also start imagining random things that are totally unrelated to the subject I am reading the book about (for example, I will start imagining conversations with any random person I know or start thinking about geometrical shapes moving or making patterns)",25Nov2019,1
260,"I’ve been working at a hospital in the ER for about 4 months now. I love my job. I love the atmosphere. I work second shift. This one third shift girl, I’ll call her Stacy. Stacy comes in around 11 and I leave at 11:30 so we only see one another for 30 minutes. She’s worked there for about 2 years. Stacy is that alpha female, bigger, “I’m never wrong” type of person. Can come off very rude and mean.

2 weeks ago there were 3 of us there including myself. Stacy, my other coworker and myself were just chatting while I was sending and email to my professor explaining my laptop broke. Stacy handed me a clipboard, slapped a pen down insinuating *go do this thing.* My other coworker said, “hey you’re finishing up that I’ll go do it.”
Stacy said in front of me, “wow you’re a lot nicer than I am.”
That irked me in the wrong way.

So tonight, I was finishing up a paper for school and I was helping and running down to CDU our other ER area it's not like I was just letting the ER board get full. So Stacy our third shift person comes in and I just didn't want to deal with her and we had one patient on the board off an ambulance so I went and sat in the other desk area. She comes over there still with one person on the board and goes ""what are you doing?"" and she looked at my computer screen, does that cocky rocking her head kind of thing and goes, “yeah you're not off the clock yet hun"" and rolled her eyes and walked away in front of patients and nurses.

I used to be very overweight and while I’m still larger than I’d like to be, I’m at my lowest weight I’ve been at in years. Sometimes I get a bit of confidence and I go on apps to try to meet people but then I look in the mirror and think “who would ever want to go out with you?” and delete them. It’s like I truly don’t think I’m someone anyone could ever find attractive and it makes me sad to think so low of myself when I would NEVER think that about another person. 

It’s a horrible and toxic pattern to be in but I don’t know what steps to take to start seeing value in myself and seeing myself as someone that is even “allowed” to think that someone could perhaps find them pretty.

267,"I am a 22 year old college student about to graduate and I’m having trouble deciding what is normal and what is not normal for a long-term relationship (1.7 years now) because it is my first one! (Yikes). Before, I have dated at the most for 2 months, and either had to break up because of them being toxic or I would get scared or bored, yet either way they never lasted.

This relationship started out great, although with some fights here and then (which I also loved because they had just the right amount of passion). Yet, slowly, he was less sexually active toward me and would reassure me that, although he did notice a change, he wasn’t worried because he still loved me. Other parts of the relationship slowly changed over time as well, like texting goodnight consistently, or sending small gifts. 

I asked him about his view of love and long term relationships and he said that passion dies out but you still love the person. So am I just sabotaging this relationship by clinging on to what I think a relationship should be like? Someone please tell me before I ruin this.

What makes me stick to my mentality is that I’m not on the same page. I don’t feel that MY passion is dying out. I still want to be very affectionate, show love through small or big gestures, and be more sexually active. 

How do I know what’s normal from what’s a red flag that the relationship is just not working anymore?

269,"I use the term ""ex"" loosely, it was barely a relationship to begin with. I'll explain what happened for context. A few years ago, I started talking with this guy on tumblr, we'll call him E, and we got along pretty quickly. I'm usually not great at conversation but I really enjoyed the conversations we had, we had a lot in common and it just kinda came naturally I guess. I'd be up until 3am pretty much every night talking with him. Not long after we met I started to develop a crush on E, I was 16 at the time and he was 19. 

Then one night while we're talking he sends a pic of himself and he is soooooooo fucking cute, and in a few seconds I went from a little crush to completely head over heels. I had it real bad for him, I'd spend all day thinking about him and what we would talk about that night. We talked for three or four weeks and then he deleted his tumblr, but a week after that he found me on facebook, and we started talking again. Not long after I confessed that I liked him, and he said he liked me too and we started a ""relationship"" of sorts. 

The biggest mistake I could have made was confuse infatuation for love, and that's exactly what I did. Right away I started calling him babe and saying ""I love you."" I was young and stupid and I didn't understand what I was feeling or the things I was saying, and I let myself become a toxic person without realizing it. Not surprisingly, he became distant and we didn't really talk like we had before, and after a month he ended it and blocked me on everything. 

Three years later, I'm the same age he was and I realize now how uncomfortable it must have made him. Now I don't use facebook at all, talking with him over messenger is the only thing I've used it for in years and I haven't used it since. But a few months ago I had to download messenger for something else and I found our old chat. I never deleted the chat itself, I just deleted the app off my phone. I want to message him and apologize but I'm not sure if I should. 

To start, I'm pretty sure he still has me blocked me on facebook so he wouldn't see it anyway. Even if he did, there's still so many ways it could go wrong. What if he thinks it's creepy that I still have the chat? What if he thinks I've been stalking him? Is it even ok to message someone out of the blue after not talking for three years? I just want to apologize, that's it. Should I?",25Nov2019,1

280,"Hi there, first time posting on Reddit, sorry if this is a long read.

For some background information, I'm 17, currently living with just my father. Up until 13ish I grew up with my narcissistic mother's antics and definitely suffered a lot of mental strain from it. Around 14 to 15 I completely checked out mentally, distancing myself from everyone I knew and eventually becoming relatively forgotten within my school, family and social life. I enrolled into online school and wouldn't leave the house for months at a time, quite literally. Throughout this time I feel like mental problems manifested (but I don't want to call them illnesses without being diagnosed). My dad is also a very lonely person with no friends and very little relationship action because he has a lot of issues he's unwilling to address. Thus my dad and I developed a friendship over a parent-child relationship and tell each other practically everything, like best friends would. I would often be his counsellor for his relationship or life problems and he'd often be mine, as we had very little of a filter with each other.

 Despite having someone in my life to talk to, I let a lot of mental and emotional trauma I've experienced go completely ignored. Though my dad listens to my problems, he likes to undermine them and claim they aren't that serious. For example, for about 3 years ish my ability to think properly has completely clouded, and the best way I can describe it is as if someone is blaring death metal in my ears at all times and trying to think over it, even though I don't hear anything at all. This has greatly affected my ability to speak or string sentences correctly, pronounce things and focus (I've been told I seemed intoxicated because of this). I've also had very legitimate suicidal thoughts and have attempted when I was 11-15, which I explained to my dad but he's never visibly cared or reacted to. For about a year, I've been constantly begging for a therapist, brought these issues forth and explained them. I finally found a will to improve myself and move on and let go of a lot of hurt I've experienced in my life, but I'm completely unsure of where to start. I would like guidance from someone who's trained in the field and help me move onto a better life. I realized that my dad was the type of person to say they'd do something, but then never do that thing and get aggressive and claim you're nagging if you ever bring it up again. I don't know if this is important also but whenever I go two or three days without breaking down or being visibly depressed my dad will make comments like ""see, its not that serious"" or ""you are so much better now.""

 I'm quite confident at this point my dad will never take me to a therapist, and I'm scared I'll never have any of this sorted out. My brain has been so foggy as if i am a walking zombie and I don't want to live like this forever. He's the only person I have with authority in my life as I am still underage, and being completely numb and then get hit with waves of anger and being miserable. 

What can I do? Can I receive help on my own? Is there any way to convince my dad to acknowledge I have many problems? I have no one else to talk about this with.

Sorry if this is poorly formatted or if what I'm trying to say isn't that clear, I hope you can understand.",25Nov2019,1
281,"I currently am working as a seasonal employee for a major retailer. The season ends in roughly a month and a half. If they decide to let me go, then my decision is pretty clear, but I'm looking at this as a certainty that they will ask if I'll join permanently.

This is my first paying job. The first few weeks were fun, but now every time I leave my house to go to work I expect the worst. I expect to have an asshole customer get in my face, I expect to be put in a situation where I feel overwhelmed, and I expect to be in a situation where I just feel left out.

My coworkers are all nice people. They're nice to me, I'm nice to them, and that's that. However, I do not feel like I'm apart of the team. I feel like the expendable seasonal hire, and maybe that *is* how they see it. The only good conversations I've had were with a few of the other seasonal hires. I have no friends at this place, and, despite my best efforts, it feels like none of them want to be my friend (see ""expendable seasonal hire"" for possible reason why).

To add to this, I look at my coworkers and they've all been working here for years. I understand jumping ship constantly isn't good for a resume, or just good in general, but I look around and can't help but ask myself if this is what I want to be doing on 1, 5, or 10 years down the line.

I don’t have anyone to go with this, so hello Reddit. Any advice would be so appreciated. 

If it matters at all, which I don’t think it should, I’m a female. I’m also slightly terrified that he might read this in the off chance he has a Reddit. But I need to get this off my chest somewhere. 

I’m a senior now. But this was sophomore year, and the summer after. I had a male history teacher who I liked so much—he made me love history again. I took two of his classes, one freshman year and another sophomore year. It began with emails. I really don’t want to go back and look at them because it brings up bad memories, so I can’t say exactly what it was about. But it was related to school, I’m sure. Then the emails got deeper. And more frequent. And longer. It wasn’t just about school topics anymore—it was deeper things, like my religion and how I perceived the world. He was so fascinated in my opinion. He’d compare me to enlightened world figures and say I’m mature for my age, and wise for my age. He said he’d never do anything to hurt me. I should’ve stopped then because I knew it was wrong simply because I wanted to hide it from my parents. But I liked it. I liked him as a teacher, why wouldn’t I enjoy talking with him?

He proposed we move the conversation to another platform that is similar to texting. An important thing to note is that it was still a school platform; we never moved things off of our school accounts. But it got worse. Deeply more personal. I’d tell him my late night thoughts about the universe (cringey, but I swear it’s what I did). I told him my struggles in my family. I cried when telling him things I wouldn’t tell others. Soon, he was doing the same. He poured on me burden after burden. He acted like I was his therapist. I heard all of his family problems. I once stayed up till 2 am comforting this man. COMFORTING. I, a 16 year old female, texting this 50 year old man at 2 am trying to solve his authority issues with his child and wife. He’d ask me other questions that seriously hurt me morally and religiously, like whether I thought he was going to heaven. He radically influenced my politics. He took advantage of me mentally and I feel disgusted. How vile to take advantage of me like that. He made my life a living hell. I felt guilt like nothing before. 

I went to his house several times during the summer. He and his family left for a vacation for a month and I took care of things at his house. He also was the teacher in charge of a club I was part of. The officers had online video meetings, and I’d join in. Sometimes I’d be the first there and it’d be just me and him. It was so fucking awkward. He should’ve been like “let’s call back when everyone is ready.” But he never did. He’d just look at me. 

He bought me gifts from his vacation. I want to throw them away, but I don’t want to look at them either. I used to sit in his room in the mornings. I spent hours of my day texting him. My friends thought it was weird and kind of creepy, but I didn’t want to think about it that way. I wish I would’ve listened. I eventually just stopped telling them at all what I was doing. I should’ve known then that it was wrong. 

When I finally cut him off because I realized it wasn’t healthy or normal for a teacher to act like that, he wouldn’t leave me alone at first. He sent me more emails asking if I thought he was going to hell. He’d ask me dumb questions or try to initiate conversations. I gave him little answers and stopped talking to him. It was all done by junior year. Let me reiterate that he never did anything physically wrong with me. We never touched. I don’t think he ever had those intentions. 

But, I still feel used in a way I can’t describe. Disgusted. He should’ve known better than to treat me like that. Like wtf? I was 16. Why the hell did he turn to me for all his emotional issues. It was a huge burden on me. He put so much guilt on my life as I knew I had to hide our relationship from my parents. He called me friend—he was my teacher! He should know boundaries! I was too naive to know, but he wasn’t. He crossed a line, and he knew it. He made that year hell for me. I wish I could go back in time and tell myself not to do it. I fell for his dumb “you’re so mature and wise for your age.” That doesn’t mean I should be a 50 year old’s support system, let alone my teacher’s. I don’t think he meant harm, but he must’ve known it wasn’t right. He must’ve. 

I know I shouldn’t be feeling all this guilt. I didn’t know better. He did. But it’s so, so hard. I wish I could erase these memories. I don’t know how to move on from it. I feel like I was taken advantage of and I won’t get innocence back from me. He created a wedge between me and my family. I hate myself for listening to him. I really just don’t know how to move on.

286,"So, today, they called me over for a regular conversation. They asked me how was a party that I recently went to



 I said it was boring and my brother said that it's because I was on my phone the entire time. I disagreed and said I was only on my phone for a time where people separated into their own groups. Then, my parents went on to talk about social interaction and how I should be more comfortable with it. I said I was an introvert and that's where things escalated. They thought I was lying, and said they would hit me if I said it again. I explained what an introvert was, and they said that I wasn't an introvert because I haven't been to the doctor. Then, they said that introversion is a disorder and it's worrisome to be an introvert. 



I don't really want to live anymore with my family, but I don't have the guts to run away or to ask for help, because I'm afraid that other people experience the same thing every day. I hate this because my parents never take me seriously and hit me with my own books whenever I do something slightly wrong, or even if I speak my opinion. 




My advice is : what should I do about my parents? should I tell them how I feel, or should I do nothing, or should I just not live anymore?",25Nov2019,1
287,"An entire life is a pretty long thing to read (and type) so I’ll try to keep it as short as I can. Thank you all for coming to the autobiography nobody asked for! Even if no one reads this it was one of the most cathartic things I’ve ever done. 

I (23 F) grew up in a hoarders house (look up a picture if you don’t know what that is. Hoarded trash and animals. At one time we had about 20 cats). My dad died at the age of 5 and my mom (63 F) became an extreme shut in. She basically didn’t (and still does not) leave the house whatsoever, has been cripplingly addicted to video games for the last 19 years, is extremely emotionally volatile (has every symptom of BPD but has never been diagnosed), and to top it off is a religious zealot that does not believe in vaccines or doctors in general. Extreme neglect for herself, others, and her home. My sisters (33F, 38F) wait on her hand and foot. She actually watched her toe grow black for a year, it fell off, and she tried to reattach it with silver gel and bandaids. She still wouldn’t go to a doctor and my brother (40M) finally got her to visit. I could go on. My 2 sisters live in the house rent free. One of the sisters (We’ll call her N for the extreme narcissist that she is) has 2 children that grew up there with me that I love dearly. Growing up there was a lot of screaming and emotional abuse. 

How did anyone afford anything with no job? My dad died and shortly after his mother (my grandmother) died leaving the inheritance that was meant for my father to me (this is important later). The inheritance was pretty substantial and my mom was left as the trustee. She pulled out exorbitant amounts of money each month, but spent it all terribly. Really terribly. She bought 15-20k in broken stained thrift store furniture alone. She genuinely didn’t do any of this maliciously she is just very mentally ill and not very bright or practical. The house became more and more dilapidated. I became more and more suicidally depressed/anxious, ballooned to 300lbs, and barely didn’t fail out of high school. At 18 I decided something had to change and I lost 100lbs and me and a friend got commercial dumpsters to clean out the house while my sisters were at bible camp my mom sent them to (15k btw). I struggled severely with anxiety/depression/eating disorders and was a shut in for about 2 years in this house. I was told I couldn’t move out and felt hopeless. I inherited half of my assets at 18 and the other half will be at 35. I drastically lowered the amount my mom was spending but I also finally worked up the nerve to move out at 20. My mom chased me from the house frothing at the mouth angry I was leaving. 

I moved across the country with no plan and got a random retail job and was there for a year. I developed severe burnout and terrible health issues and after a year had to move into my brothers house to just recover. It took an entire year at my brothers just to get to a point I could get out of bed and feel stable. In the last 6 months I moved to an apartment with my niece (22F) about 3 hours from my brothers house. I’ve been living off the dividends of my account but it’s been fully supporting my moms entire house and myself for the last few years. I’m definitely spending more than I make and I’ve been worried sick about it not being sustainable. I deeply resent my mother and no longer want to support her financially, but I feel like an ungrateful monster and don’t know what to do. She owns her house outright and even in the condition it’s in is worth about 300k-400k. She has social security but all of it just pays off her health insurance which she needs. She could go live with my brother who has a much nicer house, room for her, and has asked her to move there, but she claims his wife is her “mortal enemy”. On top of all this she claims the inheritance was rightfully supposed to be half hers but that my fathers sister illegally had her Alzheimer’s mother sign a new will. She claims that if I cut her off she’ll sue me. The statute of limitations is over on that I’m sure but 1 year ago apparently my sister found out she was also supposed to be part of that will and that might renew the statute based on her just discovering it? I have no idea and should probably speak to a lawyer. 

I really do realize I’m so incredibly fortunate to have an inheritance at all and feel extremely ungrateful for even considering cutting them off but I genuinely hate everything they are and stand for. Besides that I’m finally in a place mentally and physically to work again but I’m just scared I’ve wasted years of my life and don’t have an education. I have the money to go back to school but I have no idea what for and it would be another few years of me just spending money and not working. I also know with my HS grades I wouldn’t get in anywhere without going to a jc and transferring. I have a real desire and drive to succeed, I’m absolutely amazing with people and sales, and have also dreamt about running my own business. I’m intelligent and know I have a lot of potential; I’ve just been dealing with a lot of mental, emotional, and physical problems that are finally starting to heal. I’ve come a long way. But I feel so incredibly lost and - like everyone - want a happy successful fulfilling life. I feel like I have so much opportunity due to my inheritance but have absolutely no idea what to do and feel this internal pressure to go out and make something of myself. I have no idea what to do with myself daily and have quite a bit of free time if that matters.

Advice needed: what in the actual fuck do I do? In regards to career, education, finances, family, legally in regards to the inheritance, mental health advice also greatly welcomed.

I would love any and all advice. Out of the box answers, what you would do in my situation, literally every single piece of advise you could offer because it feels like I’m lost at sea and my boat has a gaping hole in it. 

Also I know this isn’t the thread for it but AITA for wanting to cut my mom off financially? I feel really morally torn about it.",25Nov2019,1
288,"I'm in my early twenties. Last Saturday I went to my guy friend's house and one of his male friends was there too. I think the guy is like 26 or 27. don't really know his friend too well. I think it was like the second or third time I've met him. We hung out for a couple hours and then the guy asked me if I could possibly give him a ride home and I said sure. We talked a little bit about stuff and I guess I made him laugh. A couple days later I got a text from a number that wasn't saved and the text said ""hey cute girl. What's up?"" I replied and asked who they were and they responded that they he was the guy that I drove him and that my friend gave him my number. He asked if I wanted to possibly hangout with him and I said sure. I went to his house and we talked, watched a movie, and got dinner at Taco Bell lol. Last night he asked if I wanted to hangout again. So I went to his house and we hung out and chilled for a little bit. Then he started kissing and trying to make-out with me. He asked me if I was a virgin and I told him yes. I kind of hesitated at first because I have only made-out a couple times and didn't really know what to do. I did give in and I pulled his pants down and gave him head. Then he gave me oral and fingered me. I laid on the bed and did missionary and he came. Then he wanted to do kind of doggy position and he came again. I'm not on birth control and he didn't wear a condom. He shot it all over my body. I just feel stupid because I wasn't sure if I wanted it or not and think I got played. I did not think I would lose my virginity to someone I barely knew. I'm not the ""wait until marriage"" kind but I would actually like to know the person a lot and be in a relationship before we have sex.

294,"I feel like an asshole typing this but I genuinely don’t know the adult thing to do, everyone is giving different advice. 

So we’ve been best friends since 5th grade, and I know the family really well. We go to different schools (he’s at a school about 20 minutes from our hometown and I’m about 4 hours away) but we’ve stayed really close. Last week, he called and told me his cousin died in a surfing accident, really unexpected. The cousin was about our age, so we’d all gone to school together and it’s really tragic. I had the week off school for thanksgiving, so I went over their house as soon as I was home to be with the family. Since then, I’ve been checking in and offering to help however I can until I go back to school on Friday after thanksgiving.

The family announced the wake is on Saturday and the funeral is on Monday. If I wasn’t going to school, I’d go to both to support my best friend. But I’m conflicted - I’m still upset about the death (we were close as kids, haven’t talked in a few years but still) and I’m bad at funerals, they honestly make it worse for me. 

Plus, not going back to school Friday means I’d have to modify my work schedule, get my professor to give me an alternate test date, and try and convince another prof to excuse the absence (he offers a letter grade boost for someone with perfect attendance and I could really use that). 

At the same time, I don’t want my friend to hate me for not going. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do as an adult. My mom said most people only go to wakes but if my friend was upset at the funeral and didn’t have anyone around I’d feel like shit. Another friend said I should just ask my best friend if they need me there, but I think he’d say no because he knows I’m kind of obsessed with my grades and school. Another friend said they’d never forget if someone skipped their loved one’s funeral for something stupid like a class.

I’d appreciate any input. Should I just stay for the funeral even if it means risking my GPA? Will my friend hate me if I don’t go? As a friend, am I supposed to attend funerals or just the wakes?",25Nov2019,1

She’s been to several doctors and they all say she’s not got any health issues but she needs to lose weight or issues will come up. I personally am not as physically attracted to her as I was. This in no way means I love her any less, but it has affected our sex life heavily. She has a high sex drive to begin with and since gaining all this weight she’s gotten lazier in bed and has wanted me to do all the work and she wants sex every night. I’m not as into it as I used to be and I find myself saying no a lot. She’s noticed as well. I don’t want to break her heart by telling her that she needs to lose weight and that’s part of why I don’t want to have sex as often. She keeps saying she’s going to eat better and it lasts for four days or so. And she says she’ll go to the gym but then the only way I can get her to go is if I make her come with me. It’s getting difficult and putting strain on our relationship as well because she can’t do a lot of the things we used to do together because of her weight.

Me and my circle of friends had a overnight swimming weekend trip in Bulacan, we drunk all night and then this guy kept on giving a motive sexually. Time passed it was already 4am. Everybody were drunk that time and they chose to sleep already including that guy. Me and a friend were both left, my friend told me that he’s gonna go to the bathroom while waiting I decided to rest and look for a bed to sleep. This guy who’s giving a motive earlier were alone in his bed, so I decided to sleep beside him. Passed 4am when I tried to be so aggressive, I tried to touch his dick and only few seconds passed and I made his dick very hard. I took the chance, since this guy kept on seducing me earlier, I took the chance while he was sleeping. I gave him a blowjob. 15-20 mins passed then he realized someone was sucking his dick, he pumped his dick in my mouth as if he was enjoying the moment, but he was too drunk to finish so we decided to stop. He told me that we’ll continue later in the morning when we were both sober. He also told me that I’m so good, that it felt like a girl was blowing his dick. While I was hugging him, he decided to transfer room, in a more comfortable room. He asked me if I want to come, and I said okay. He made the bed for the both of us, he got us a pillow, I got the comforter. We were both under in a one comforter and we both slept. Nothing happened after, the said continuation never happened cause the sun is already out, we were both afraid that someone’s might see us. We both woke up and he told me “fuck you! Look what you’ve done to my dick, it’s so hard” pointing to his dick, he also showed me what he do every morning to his dick, he kept on stroking his dick in front of me. Few minutes passed and he asked if we can get some breakfast, he asked me if I can treat him some pourage and I agreed right away and I said I’m just gonna wakeup some to join us. I went right away to my bestfriend with a wide smile as if it was a good night for me. She asked me what happened, and I was just smiling. This guy came from the bathroom and he told my friend that I sucked his dick as if he was really proud and happy. My friend took it very lightly as we both took it lightly too. Some of our friends wokeup too and this guy and tell my other friends what happened. It was okay for me because it’s not big of a deal for me. Few of us left to get some breakfast, while some were still sleeping. We got back to our place, and it was still the topic. And a friend of ours woke up, and this friend kept on teasing the guy that a gay sucked his dick and he did nothing, he kept on teasing the guy. Because we didn’t finished the drinks last night, we continued drinking til 4pm until such time, the alcohol hitted the guy again, he was so aggressive and attacked me.

I've been working towards a career in being a Translator/Interpreter in Italy! I am an American living in Pennsylvania, and I'm working towards a major in Italian.

I don't know if this is too specific of advice for this sub, but I would appreciate any advice on a couple things.

A.) What is the most efficient way to become an Italian citizen?

B.) How do you find jobs in a foreign country from the outside?

C.) What are some things I should need to know about assimilating into Italian culture? (This can be things like fashion, manners or anything. I really don't want to be seen as an outsider in a place I want to call home)

Can anyone tell me what to do?",25Nov2019,1
307,"Warning: Wall of text approaching.

So, I’m friends with this girl online. She’s my age, I’ve FaceTimed her, etc. However, she basically treats me like a therapist sometimes and it’s starting to become a burden. 

As someone with depression and anxiety, I get the need to vent. 

I feel as if though she comes up with exudes to come to me and not get help from people who genuinely want to be vented to and/or are payed to do so. 

I told her to go to her therapist but she said that she can’t get an appointment, this I still kind of believe but there’s a lot more she’s not listening to me for. I also told her to try using 7cups. She replied “the app?” I said yes and then she said “I don’t have enough storage on my phone for that”. Then I told her to try using the website, she said “I use my data on insta.”

Then I asked “why not use WiFi?” She replied “I don’t have WiFi”. This is believable to me since some people can’t afford it but yeah. 

I’m very willing to help people and give advice but it’s gotten to the point where she’s been doing this virtually every night and I can’t take these burdens. Not to mention she’s also done what might’ve been sexual harassment to me. She’s said “my voice is hot” which I don’t mind, I always love a compliment. Then she begged me to say her name in my voice which I did. I’m honestly feeling uncomfortable around her. 

One time when she rants to me, this is about the fifth time in a row that she has, she ranted to me abo how she feels fat and I told her not to hate her body and that she isn’t that fat because I’ve seen her over FaceTime. She talked about how she accidentally stepped on her car and hurt her really bad and that’s why. I told her that mean home would hurt her cat (she sent most of these over voice messages btw while I was texting). I asked her to please text and then she said “but then there would be no emotion behind my words”. She just doesn’t seem to get that I can’t take any more of this. I have my own problems and I’m always willing to help a friend but it’s almost like she doesn’t want to get better and just wants to rant. 

I honestly don’t know what to do about this because I’m contemplating blocking her without warning which I honestly think would be rude. I feel like she would guilt trip me if I told her how I felt though or give an “oh...” because she’s done stuff like that before.

Idk... I’ve been manipulated by people I thought but were friends before and maybe j am being manipulated again, do I just attract people like this?

Also, I normally always want to help people, I always help my friends with their problems and I’m normally happy to do so. Normally a friend does get to the point of “its hopeless I’m stuck I can’t do anything” and doesn’t take my advice but I normally know how to help them out of that. For some reason I’m just sick of this girl.

We met through the comic fandom community on Instagram. 

Today we talked a bit but she didn’t really treat me like a therapist. Maybe I’m just being an asshole idk.

Sorry for the walk of text. 

So, what do I do about this?",25Nov2019,1

I am currently 19 years old and taking classes at a junior college and barely getting by. I am so frustrated at this point and contemplate if school is even for me. The daily symptoms I face are overwhelmingly disorganized thoughts, inability to remain focused on tasks, and overall just no will to apply myself within my studies. I take a form of Adderall and even that doesn't even seem to work for me anymore. Adderall just gives me extreme anxiety and makes me stare at the wall, but I take it to keep my parents happy. I am about to finish my second to last semester at junior college and all I want in my life is to move out of my parents house and attend the university of my choice, but at this point if I don't make major changes within myself and how I treat school, I really don't know what I am going to do. I am so desperate at this point and any advice would be very much appreciated, even if it is something I probably don't want to hear. Thank you for reading this if you've made it this far",25Nov2019,1
309,"I am now 21 with a home a career and an incredible husband, but my family keeps getting worse the older I get. I’m even seeing a therapist for anxiety that I developed while I lived at home. I use to be incredibly intense, paranoid, and always worried something bad was around the corner. Of course this all stemmed from their constant fighting that was emotionally abusive to everyone around. Everything that I’ve worked through has been linked to their strange marriage and how they are so materialistic. They use to let me spend thousands of dollars at a time to make up for their fights or their absence because they work a lot just to be able to blow their money on clothes, shoes, handbags, electronics.

But nothing has compared to how they have been acting lately. I quit my job for good reasons and started to think about going back to school. We asked my sister-in-law to put us on a tight budget to help us get out debt before my semester begins. I mentioned it to them and added that this year we couldn’t get big expensive presents or go shopping. Which was met with comments like “what is your husband going to think of you sitting around all day?” And “Don’t tell me it’s cause of that dumb anxiety you always say you have.” But the icing on the cake went to today when my dad said “Well if you were working your husband would be able to buy whatever he wanted.” He was talking about my husband buying something he thought was half the price till I check the receipt on got to him at the mall. They wouldn’t understand being on a budget since they live in the house my grandpa gave to them and drive vehicles outdated to not owe any money. Any advice? How can I deal with parents who are constantly emotionally draining?",25Nov2019,1
310,"So I’m going to try to make this as short as I can. My mother is mentally ill. Severe OCD, paranoia, anger issues, narcissistic personality disorder etc. severely mentally ill. My whole life she’s been controlling, EXTREMELY controlling. She’s always put excuses for it. Gain my trust, gain responsibility, show me you can take care of yourself, etc. I have tried so hard with the few chances she’s given me to show her that growing up and she’d put new excuses. Se never let me ride in ANYONES car because I didn’t have my license. Then she made it hard for me
To get my license so I was never able to get it. She never let me sleep over, go anywhere alone with aunts, BARELY let me go anywhere even with my dad, rarely let me go with friends (until I was like 17 and I had to get dropped off, picked up, and couldn’t leave the spot) When I turned 18 I knew that the only way to get some freedom was to go to a college far away (Always wanted to go to college but couldn’t since my home life caused me to get bad grades, so I knew I’d have to go to community college first). So I went to a CC and god she made it hell and so hard for me that I ended up staying there for years.  Nothing changed. She started letting me go out a tiny bit more but I had to get dropped off by my dad and she INSISTED on coming along on the ride. Then everytime we argued about this she would say I never gained her trust and she thinks I can’t take care of myself??? By 21 my depression was at an all time high and I wanted to kill myself. I couldn’t hold a full time job with school (yeah I had to get dropped off there too and picked up) so I couldn’t save to move the hell out. Fast forward to now, at 23, and I finally transferred and got an apartment at school. I tried so hard for this moment and I cried tears of joy. Weeks before my mom started bothering me, telling me I wasn’t allowed to ride in anyone’s car, I had to give her any new friends number, text her and call her 24/7, and come home every single weekend. Moving day came, my mom started making everything harder for me. Very very hard. Her other mental illnesses came out this day. My mom’s severe OCD makes her want everything perfect or else she won’t do it. It’s cost me a lot in life where she’ll back out of important things. Everything “special” must  be perfect or else she’ll freak and “have a trauma” We argued that day, and she pushed my buttons almost on purpose to the point of me exploding (I have severe anxiety from the abuse growing up) and I had a full blown panic attack. She took it upon herself to say my panic attack ruined the whole thing and affected her so she didn’t want me staying at my apartment anymore. She forced me to come back home and said since she didn’t have a happy memory of this then she didn’t want me going back to my apartment ever again. She told me to even find a new school since it’s “tainted”. I couldn’t believe it. I had to withdraw for the semester. So now I’ve been home, under her surveillance, and I can’t go anywhere without her. We’ve argued about it and now she says the truth is that she’s like this because I’m not baptized. She says if something happens to me I won’t go to Heaven because I’m not baptized. She never baptized me and never took me to do it and now she’s telling me it’s because of that and until I do it she won’t let me do crap. I’m 23. I know if I went to go do it she either will put an excuse to not go with me (apparently she has to go with me obviously cause she needs to go with me everywhere HA HA) or after I do it she’ll still be the same person. Anyways I need a way out. I can leave and go back to my apartment (because I HAVE to start school soon again) and deal with her going absolutely crazy but my issue is also my dad. He’s suffered so much and he says if I leave he’ll leave to but he has NOWHERE TO GO. He doesn’t earn enough to rent somewhere else. My dad needs to get out as well because my mother is sick and dangerous but he has nowhere to go and I don’t know what to do because I can’t be here anymore. It’s absolutely insane. 

(Also if anyone religious can give advice on this absurd situation I’d appreciate it too)",25Nov2019,1
311,"This is going to be a long story BUT I'll try to make it short as possible. 2019 has been rough, l went to college for surgical but ended up withdrawing from college and got a full time job which was great at first l started end of September and now it's so unorganized and terrible, management is very rude and berate us every day. Hell, l had holiday pay for Thanksgiving but they're not giving it to me because probationary period. Since being here I learned everyone here has a 2nd job, there's no room for advancement and I never received and employee handbook. To add insult to injury, l never really hangout with my friends and family much, l work 1230-9pm everyday but wed and thurs. Plus l drive a good hour to work too so yay. Anyways imma look for a new job but here's where I'm lost. My mom wants me to go back to school for barbering because my school offered it for 1 year (free) and l took it my junior year. Biggest mistake, my teacher was very biased, punished everyone for 1 kids errors, played favoritism, and just sat there on her phone everyday and l barely learned anything from it except how to fuck up someones hair, I learned nothing, not even the basics! Just text book questions it was horrifying. She wants me to go to an actual cosmology/barber school (Considered a trade school) thats way different and it's expensive where l might have to take out a student loan. l don't know what to do. Do l continue go full time else where and closer to home or part time and back to school? I'm 18 and a college dropout.. I get what my moms trying to do but if l hated college and had a bad experience is it worth it? I have no idea what to do with my life, l wanna live it, contribute and not be unhappy/miserable at a deadend job. I wanna make money and do something!

312,"I'm 19, a semester away from graduating community college with my associates degree, and still living at home. 

My mom hurt her foot about a year ago and it is in the process of healing. Since then, she has been up my butt about how she needs me. She tells me that theres no point in going our because she is the most important person. She says I'm too stupid to go to school and that I should stay home. She tells me that my boyfriend (of nearly 2 years) hates me and all my friends only talk to me because they feel sorry for me. She tells my brother that he is a disgrace and that he should kill himself because it costs too much to go to therapy and he has no worth to the family. I have to pay for my own therapy, and hide it from family, because if i mention anything about needing it my mom yells at me that I am faking it. I have has knee issues for literally over 7 years and my parents believe I am faking it for attention. Any time mention moving out my mom starts to cry and tell me how I'm never here for her and that she should just kill herself because she is ""not a good enough mother"" and that she didn't ""raise me right.""

And my dad doesn't help. He always sides with her, he always blames me, and always talks bad about me. I am constantly told by him that I'm a terrible daughter and that they should have aborted me when they had the chance. He tells me that I should have died when I overdosed (basically I took too many pills and ended up in a coma for a month, not sure if its still considered an overdose). He tells me I'm no good to the family, that I'm worthless. He tells me that I should drop out of college because I'm not going to get anywhere anyway.",25Nov2019,1

318,"It's been a year since I went on a date with what seemed like an amazing woman and afterwards she didn't speak to me again. Wouldn't even look at me. I know I've been in the wrong before, made mistakes like everyone else, but even after explaining it to my therapist and trying to reach a conclusion on what I could've done wrong she explained that it really isn't necessarily always my fault. I tried so god-damned hard to be sociable, to dance with her at her dance club and all, to be fun, but I just hate dancing and I struggled so much with starvation during my teen years that I know I'll never be comfortable with dancing or my body in that way and I know it shows in how awkward I was. Why of all things do girls have to love dancing? Still, we hugged at the conclusion of our date and she said she had a great time, that she wanted to see me again, and it made me the happiest I've been in about 8 years. It makes me so paranoid that I might be boring but even after the anti-depressants and even after the countless clubs I tried to join in college I still hated all of it.

I feel like such a screw up and no matter how hard I try to move on it still haunts me. Which is odd because women have treated me far worse than simply ghosting me but it wounded me so badly to get my hopes up for the first time in ages. I feel so guilty about the last person I was intimate with because every time I closed my eyes during it I realized all I could see was that other woman who'd rejected me, laughing at me or looking at me with scorn for being a failure somehow. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't feel affection or a connection to anyone, it all just feels hollow compared to that one woman who seemed so...perfect? Like a golden opportunity that I ruined. She seemed so elegant and I don't blame her for simply not being attracted to me but wow I wish I wasn't in so much pain. I wish I wasn't so awful at moving on.

I'm not really sure what I'm asking for, or what advice I need, but it's 3 AM and I can't sleep until I get these things off my chest so thank you for giving me a platform to do that anonymously.

He had met my (now) boyfriend several times before knowing we were expecting and he loved him.

324,"I'm ""friends"" with this guy. I am 23, and he is 30. He is single, introverted, crazy intelligent, depressed, suicidal and claims to have a deep-rooted fear of abandonment and rejection. He deals with a lot of self-loathing and loneliness, but he is also cynical as fuck. I am extremely empathetic, and I am drawn to people like him. Over the past year and half, I've gotten closer to him. Whenever we talk, we talk for hours. He feels comfortable venting to me and sharing personal matters of his life. I developed a strong attachment to him and admitted I had feelings for him; he didn't return those same feelings, but told me he was willing to ""play around"" if I wanted to.

I am religious and he is not. I grew up pretty sheltered and innocent, and though I am attracted to him, I don't want to be intimate with anyone until marriage. I am not one for flings or casual hookups. I can't be physical with someone unless I have an emotional connection.

This past week, I hung out with him in his office at school (he's a part-time faculty member) and we hugged (not the first time), but the hug turned into cuddling and the cuddling went past the lines of platonic affection. He burrowed his head into my neck and he rubbed my back and traveled his hands around my waist. It felt sensual. I enjoyed it, but not fully. It felt a little strange because he had already rejected me earlier. I want to be in a committed relationship; I don't want to be used in the moment, especially since he often talks about being undesirable and deprived of physical affection. In essence, it felt off. It felt incomplete.

That night, I asked if he wanted to hang out because he seemed finally willing to do that after a long time of trying. It sounds pathetic, but I have made 99% of the effort in our friendship. So far, I have initiated every conversation. I have approached him. If we text, he often will end up ghosting me or cutting the conversation short or not responding for hours. The reason why I haven't given up is because he often talks about the pain he's felt from so many people abandoning him, and it makes me distraught to be another person to do that to him. He also says things like, ""I enjoy your company."" ""Talking to you brings me fulfillment."" ""Everyone has left me, but you seem to keep coming back."" ""You're the most consistent person in my life."" ""I don't hang around people I don't like."" etc. Unfortunately, I feed on his validation. For some reason, I am convinced that deep down he does care for me and does value me and does appreciate me being in his life, but he's so traumatized from past relationships that he refuses to let me in properly.

Anyways, he asked me how comfortable I was about coming over. And me being utterly naive, I said I was comfortable. I had to prompt him for everything to get this plan to happen. I had to ask him what time. I had to ask him for the address. We had planned for me to come the next day, and I had to ask to make sure it was still okay for me to come. He took forever to respond, and all he managed to say was ""yes.""

When I knocked on the door, he sent me a text that said: ""Just walk in"". When I did, he was laying on his couch in complete darkness with the TV on and his phone in hand. I walked into his living room and awkwardly greeted him and sat down on the couch across from him. I felt so uncomfortable in that dingy atmosphere. I offered to open the blinds; I offered for us to go out and grab food, or take a walk, and he said no. He smirked at me and told me I could come over to where he was. It was a tiny couch, and he was taking up all of the room on it, so it seemed rather obvious he was offering to cuddle. I felt a bit hesitant at first. I explained I needed to warm up to the situation, and he said, ""Oh, you don't trust yourself."" And I said yes.

I guess my body language indicated that I was tempted, so he eventually got up and firmly but lovingly took my hands and guided me over to him. He laid down and instructed me on where I should go, and with a bit of fumbling, we ended up laying down on this couch together. His arm around me and my head on his chest. He started to massage my scalp as I laid there while he continued to watch TV. I hugged his body, and I gradually began to feel sleepy. It was so comfortable, and I felt snug being wrapped in his arms. Yet, I couldn't fully relax and get out of my head. Both of our hearts seemed to be beating fast.

I wanted to talk. I wanted to ask about what we were and what I meant to him, but at every attempt of mine, he got frustrated. He told me he wanted me to stop thinking so much and just enjoy the moment. We kept going in circles. At one point, he said, ""You want answers, and I'm too frustrated to give them to you."" Somehow the conversation ended up on sex. He knew I was a virgin, but was shocked to discover that I've never masturbated or used a dildo. He adamantly expressed that I should've experienced all of this at 16, and that I had been truly deprived.

When I tried to explain my beliefs about sex, he shut down everything I said and invalidated it. He told me I couldn't ""buy the car without test driving it."" He was so confident in his stance and was so consistent in interrupting me at every sentence that I ended up at a loss for words. Later, as we were laying there, he told me to lay on top of him. I accepted the offer shyly, but insisted that he put a pillow over his dick for fear that I would feel if he got a boner. Once he plopped a pillow there, I fully laid on top of him and rested my head on his chest as he started to do wizardry with his hands all over my body. He wasn't just massaging/rubbing my back and sides, no. He was caressing them with his fingertips. The pleasure was unreal. I was beyond relaxed, and I couldn't stop praising him for his skills. This guy clearly knew what he was doing.

I kept praising him. He chuckled. It felt so good, and I was beginning to drift off in another world until I started to feel a bit of air underneath my shirt. So smoothly and gradually, he started to caress the bare skin of my lower back, and I got startled. I gasped and said, ""No! No! No!"". He then completely let go and threw his hands up. His wide eyes then turned to cold stares as he said, ""I'm done."" He was pissed. He expressed that he didn't know if he could trust me and that he wasn't going to do anything anymore, to which I felt extremely bad and started to apologize. I didn't want him to stop entirely, I just didn't expect that next step. He kept telling me in the midst of his annoyance that he ""just wanted me to feel good."" He said he wanted me to stop feeling guilty, but really, he made me feel guilty for feeling guilty.

At another point, I quietly expressed that I wanted to kiss him. He quickly and energetically turned his face towards me. He was so willing. Our faces were mere inches apart as we stared into each other's eyes. I smiled awkwardly at him, my lips pursed. He kept his smirk on his face and puckered his lips jokingly for a quick second. I laughed. He said, ""You're stalling."" I expressed that I knew I was not going to be good at it, and when he realized I didn't have the guts to make the first move, he took my face in his hands and kissed me. It was slobbery and awful. I broke away 2 seconds in, saying it was terrible. He rolled his eyes with frustration. I kept apologizing and softly chuckling.

When we tried to kiss again, I remember breaking away and going over to the other couch. I sat there in silence. I felt dirty. I felt sinful. I felt used. He laid there, staring back at me and said, ""That frown is really staying put."" I didn't have the words. So far, everything I had said that night on nearly any topic made him offended or angry to some extent, and I was nervous to express anything more. More silence ensued until I finally got the courage to say, ""We can't kiss again."" I was worried about his reaction, but thankfully for once he said, ""Okay!"" in a higher pitched tone.

Later on, I ended up laying back on top of him, and he started to caress me again. Now, I was allowing him to lift my shirt and do what he did before. In the midst of this, he lifted his legs and began pedaling into my back with the heels of his feet. As he did this, he started to kiss me all over my face. My eyes were rolling back now; moans were escaping my mouth. I was breathing heavily into his ear, and I started to whisper curse words in appreciation. It was so nice.

I was there for 6 hours, and I'm leaving out a lot of details but that was the extent of how physical we were. He was so willing to go all the way, but when he realized I wasn't going to let it go further, he frustratingly complained that he ""had to be okay with"" with just kissing or just cuddling. I kept apologizing. I remember telling him I felt like I was being used as he had said he was deprived of physical affection, and he got so offended by that. He said, ""Wow. Do you really think I have no standards and that I just sleep with anyone and anything?"" Yet, at the end of the night, he admitted to me he wasn't attracted to me. I had already mentioned that I loved him and he said he didn't love me back, but that he didn't love anyone. There were various moments where he seemed to mock my values and my opinions. He didn't force himself on me necessarily, but he clearly had no respect for my boundaries as he tried to argue with me on every point. He kept trying to convince me how stupid it was for me to remain a virgin.

There were points where I just felt blissfully happy after the cuddling sessions. I couldn't stop smiling, and I even thanked him at one point for his ""service"" as I pretty much just laid there and he did all of the work. But there were other parts where I felt torn, insecure, and taken advantage of. This guy often talks about not getting any action, so I knew that there was some aspect of just wanting so desperately to feel someone. He knows how much I care about him and how loyal I've remained to him, and I felt like he preyed on that. He said to me, ""I'm poison to you, aren't I?"" I was silent then. He also stared at me again at another point as I was silent and said, ""You're going to go home and cry, aren't you?"" I said no. He said, ""'Cause it looks like you've wanted to cry for the hours you've been here."" He also said, ""I feel like the only way you'll go is if I become a straight dick to you and tell you to go fuck yourself."" I asked him if he wanted me to go and if he wanted to do that, and he said no.

There were other moments where he just made me feel ashamed, and I would be exhausted trying to debate him. He lunged down my throat when I gently tried to express my thoughts. Whatever contradicted with his beliefs, he was so quick to interrupt me, making assumptions for what I'd said and then having a quick rebuttal with a snarky, pissed off attitude. I never once tried to be rude or to offend him, but everything was rubbing him the wrong way. Every time I unintentionally made him upset, I'd go over and cuddle him again so he would be pleased. I was so desperate to make him feel good, but I couldn't give him ultimately what he wanted. There were so many moments I felt tortured and caught in desperate apologies just to smooth things over. I wished that I had just shut up and stayed in his arms the whole night like he wanted me to.

At some point, I jokingly offered for him to marry me (as that is the only way I would be willing to have sex with him) and he very seriously and quickly said no. He said he refused to accept my terms. He told me he refused to change his behavior, and I wasn't enough to motivate him to do that. He told me this whole session meant nothing to him.

Though he knew how big of a deal this all was to me and even had a sense that it would hurt me, he never apologized. He insisted he knew what was better for me more than I did. He thought he knew what I needed despite my objections. I haven't got a text from him since. I texted him earlier to tell him not to invite me back because it wasn't good for me, and i don't have the strength to say no. I told him I would remain his friend and that I wouldn't abandon him, but that I couldn't do repeat what we did again. He never responded. He never checked up on me or asked me if I was okay after that.

I wouldn't call him a predator. I never got undressed. He didn't touch my privates, and I did have the desire to do the things we did though I failed to outwardly express it most of the night. It doesn't feel like a black and white thing. I wanted to do stuff with him, but there's a difference between desiring something in your head and actuating doing it in real life.

He finally told me, ""You should get going."" As I grabbed my things to head out the door, he said, ""Do you need me to walk you out?"" I said no, and he said a quick, accepting, almost-relieved sounding, ""Ok."" and that was it.

so context: She was showing me videos of me when I was younger, I then walked off to make something to eat, she then started laughing at something so I asked what she was looking at and she turned her laptop around to show me a video of my ex step dad shaking his penis (I'm sorry about the visual) on camera and said ""Thats \*ex step dads name\* penis"" And laughed like it was funny.

I immediately walked back to my room and I am just having a really hard time processing what the fuck just happened and why she would think its appropriate to show me that let alone keep the video after they've been broken up for around 5 years.

He was my step dad for 13 years but I never considered him of the sort.

335,"First off please let me know if it is wrong sub for me to post I don’t know where else? 
I’ll tell you a preview. . Last year I was pregnant and I miscarried in November. This month I found out I am pregnant. When I told my boyfriend of 5 years he didn’t give a crap. He yelled at me said why didn’t I take birth control and I am on birth control. Then when I gave him a choice if he wants in or out he said well there’s not an option because I’m not like that. So that told me he was in. Well yesterday was my birthday, and he didn’t say anything to me. And fine. He got mad when I asked him if he forgot my birthday. Then gets more mad at me cause I was worried and texted him a couple times but he was on social media. 
He told me how I screwed his life up and that I should’ve taken  plan b if I knew I was pregnant and I told him it’s only effective up to 3 days of unprotected sex and it doesn’t work if I’m on birth control. He wants out now. 
Like fine.. I told him if he wants to be a dead beat father than he can I’m not forcing him but then he said I forced him to have sex when I didn’t. We have sex constantly cause one turns on the other and I have text messages from him asking when we gonna have sex. So how am I forcing it upon him. He knew how much damage it caused me when I miscarried last time, as I was going into second trimester. I don’t know what to do. I am only 24 years old, I work full time as a preschool teacher (no benefits) and a part time manager (no benefits) but I also go to school. I’m kinda at a loss here.. I know I can play both roles as my best friend is a single mom who works part time and is dealing with her abusive ex with court. I haven’t told anyone I am pregnant except for my job because I work with little ones 8 hours a day and need to know limits. If anyone can give me some advice... I’m just lost and upset and sorta depressed.",25Nov2019,1
337,"Hear me out before telling me all kinds of things, we're all going through motions all the time, please respect that.

So, I joined my firm about four months ago and it's been a rollercoaster of emotions.  
I'm not exactly doing  a Wall-Street type job but I'm pretty close.  
I work for my CEO who just started his fund, I do client-onboarding for now but my CEO told me that he will put me in sales soon where I'll have to go and get customers.

My background : I'd studied Computer Science and worked at an edu-tech startup for a year before moving on.

My current CEO's background : Studied Engineering and did MBA from the top three business schools in India, worked in top technology and banking firms in top roles, had a role of a Chief Information Officer for about 10 years (CIO) before starting his own shop. He's worked for around 25 years on the block.

Main :   
So, I consider myself to be a hard worker and complete the tasks I'm given. For example my second month at the firm was essentially cold-calling people and asking them to buy Mutual Funds. I hadn't done cold calling before this. There was this guy I'd replaced who apparently was here for four months too but he made only 80 calls in those four months whereas I did 230 in one. Given it was my first time out I wasn't able to convert any. I even asked my CEO for help but he was busy with things and gives some or the other explanation for my reasons not to instead of doing a couple of cold calls with me.

I wasn't broken while making all those calls because boss hadn't set a target or anything.  
I moved on from that to doing customer onboarding now and my boss gets pissed at me even for the slightest of things and instead of talking to me in a decent way he's always mad at me. I get it that he might be under-pressure to perform or maybe some other form of pressure (Doesn't look like it on the face of it) so I shut up and take in the heat.

He's over burdened me with work by assigning me to a Vice President who gives all his work to me from the smallest of things like setting up his calendar to making calls to clients and asking for a good time to talk to doing the grunt work.  
I certainly didn't sign up for this. He's capable enough to do it by himself. He makes mistakes and indirectly blames them on me in front of my boss. I don't say a word and even choke at times and this makes boss think that I fucked up somewhere. 

I honestly hadn't ever experienced an hour or more of anxiety in my life. For the first time I discovered what my friends spoke of...when your head can't function cause of someones presence or because of the pressure you wither, even the small things which you could complete with your eyes closed felt like - - ""Oh I'm gonna fuck it up, I really know I am.""

Topping it all if I miss a very small thing in a document or a word which is wrong somewhere, my boss always grills me, he talks me down all the time. Again, I don't stand up for myself, I don't say a word.

I honestly thought of quitting but I somehow almost always convince myself come Sunday evening that it is a good job to be in and that my boss isn't an evil person, just indirectly teaching me or giving me a starter course in what it is that matters and how people might grill me later in life when I go on to have bigger roles.

I'm essentially at a crossroads now :  
Feels like that part from King Arthur where his knights each choose the darkest part of the forest to go search for the holy grail.  
1. Quit, it will move me back to my comfort-zone, almost nil stress, take up a starter role at a different tech firm where you do that one thing for two-three years before you move upwards, also I can take it easy and save my brain till I do my Masters and then live the work-life that people speak of. I can live a stress free life for a while and maybe even 

2. This man is indirectly teaching me what matters in a corporate setting and how investors think and what words to use and not to use and why missing a dot or a wrong spelling matters to those at the top. He's essentially like the guy who knows what it takes to be at the top and has been for years on end..can provide me that knowledge either directly or indirectly (mostly indirectly). He's teaching me how to use tools, for example...

He'd asked me to do someone on an Excel Sheet and transfer that to a PPT, I took a good 15 minutes to make sure every dot is right and it also looks good...he called me to ask me what happened to that task he'd given, then went on to say ""Oh its okay, I'll do it"" and in literally 15 seconds the task is done. - - meaning? I need to be THAT fast and THAT precise.

Here's what I'll have to go through if I stick...high to ridiculous amounts of stress and pressure, periodically talking-down, feel like shit, investors mindset, grilling, shouting, occasional cursing, a lot of grunt work/work that you don't like. Although I don't know yet but - - How-to-become-mentally-strong.

Here's another thing - - I haven't decided what it is that I really want to do in my life and also I'm not very sure cause my mind has been foggy from the past three years but I probably am in depression.  
\*If I decide to stay\*  - - do I really want to do this in my life? I can forgo these pressures and go to something I want to do and getting shouted at over there wouldn't really make a difference either.

\*If I decided to quit\*  - - losing a learning opportunity, possibly realizing that this job was the thing I really wanted to do at this time but hadn't realised so because of all the other things. 

What would you have had done?  
What's your advice?",25Nov2019,1

340,"No matter what relationship I feel like my needs are always put down (by others and myself). 

I’m kind of a crowd pleaser - I want my friends to be happy, my SO partner to be happy. I spend a lot of time focusing on their goals, what they want and help them accomplish it. Even when I don’t have time or when it conflicts with I want I will do what makes them happy.

For example, I was travelling with friends the other day. They kept taking selfies and photos of themselves I grew tired and started to withdraw. This made them feel like I was unhappy so I obliged and took photos with them trying to be happy. My SO would always talk over me, when I bring this up I will do it the nicest way possible. Then he will just forget about it and keep doing the same thing.

I’m happy to talk about what I don’t want. I do it nicely but once it makes someone feels unhappy or awkward I tell them don’t worry about it.

342,"Basically, look at the title for the tl;dr.

I'm 23F and have been working in comms/copywriting full time for about a year and a half. I started straight after university, and I mean that in the most literal sense – my last class finished on Friday and I started the job on Monday.

At the beginning, I was filled with gusto and naive energy, but found myself gradually burning out mentally. Many work days, I walked into the door of my apartment and fell asleep straight away. Other days, I could barely fulfil chores or hold a cohesive conversation with my partner due to being drained.

Anyway, due to burning out and collating lots of annual leave, I went on a 3 week holiday. It was awesome! I went overseas and didn't have to think about work for literally weeks. I felt so free and could finally invest energy into my personal interests.

Today, I walked in the doors of the office feeling refreshed from my bream and striding with a newfound energy...and I walked out this afternoon drained and feeling like I never took a break. I just want to put away my work papers and go back on break straightaway. In fact, I'm kinda dreading going back in tomorrow.

I like who I work with, I don't find the job overly stressful, and I'm good at what I do, so I don't understand these supposedly irrational thoughts. I am also well-respected for someone of my age and have my opinions and talent valued.

Objectively, moving there would provide me with better opportunities at work, the sort that I believe I couldnt be able to get here In Cro. 

The downside is, I would be moving far away from home, family, friends, my own language and culture. I did an Erasmus student exchange for 6 months, and also lived in another city in Croatia away from home, and it was a miserable experience. I missed my social life very much, was kinda depressed. To make it worst, I find that it takes years to make good friends when you move (my own experience). 

I could also try to get a crappier job (opportunity wise) at home, and focus on the people I have here. If I had the opportunity to have the same great conditions for working at home, I wouldnt think for a second about leaving. 

Any similar experiences? How to make the best decision ? Are there better ways to meet people when youre the new guy in town and avoid being completely miserable?

Might be a different question than most questions asked on this sub. Basically, I want to get back and re develop my habit of reading books.

I am 18F, soon to be 19. I am an unemployed, high school dropout, and I don’t even have my license yet. I feel like nothing but a failure. I do nothing other than babysit my sister constantly for my mother while her and her boyfriend (that I absolutely hate) work. It’s exhausting, but since they’ve moved out it’s been less that I have to babysit.. but even then it’s too much. I wish so badly to have my own job, a license and a car. 
I don’t get paid for babysitting either, so it’s even more of an issue. I can understand some weeks that she may need the extra money for food, diapers, etc. but some type of money coming in would make the load a whole lot more bearable. I would be able to pay for things, buy myself or my honey something, like I really wish too. But I don’t see it happening unless I secure a stable job. (Or what will have me, considering I am a dropout. ) 
 
I’m looking for a way to calmly explain to my mother that I need to move forward in MY life.. but I don’t see it going over smoothly. I wish there were a way for me to offer help and also work a job, but it won’t happen. Neither her or her boyfriend have set schedules for work, they. work whenever they’re needed.

I very quickly worked my way into a position and had a huge amount of responsibility and 65-80 hours of work a week. At the time I picked where I worked solely based on pay. Now I am making about twenty five cents to the dollar compared to my old pay. I am infinitely happier and am getting far more enjoyment out of every aspect of life.

365,"I have to provide a little background to sum up the whole situation so please stick with me. I’ve watched my brother grow up but I’ve never felt close to him. I don’t understand why he does anything that he does. I’m pretty different from my family. My parents for some reason never discipline my brother at all. I don’t remember the last time he’s gotten spanked, and I was spanked up until I was 17. 

So I got a boyfriend when I was 15 and we’ve been together ever since. When we first started dating my parents would send my brother and sister (she’s 10 now) to watch my boyfriend and I. Literally a 7 and 5 year old would babysit us. So they decided anything we did was bad. We gave eachother a kiss or hugged they would tell on us and my boyfriend and I would have to be upstairs the rest of the time we hung out. This happened for 2 years. My brother would be allowed to go through my phone or take it from me. So he basically grew up thinking he’s my parent and he can do anything he wants to me. He was also allowed to actually bully me. He loves calling me a retard! :) :| whenever I babysit him and my cousins when they have a school day off and parents are working he’ll pick a fight and win. I can’t win with him because he is now bigger than me. He weighs a good 280 pounds and I weigh 103 so he can pick me up and punch me as hard as he wants. But if I do it back he starts crying.

This brings me to tonight, my mom tells me she’s going to a church dinner with my grandparents and asks if I’d like to go. I’m thinking sure I haven’t seen my grandparents in awhile. First thing that happens is my brother walks up to the door and basically invited himself into my boyfriends house unwanted. His parents don’t like company in the house and they start getting an upset look on their face so I shove him out as quick as possible. We go to the car and he jacks the front seat. Which you know I’m the 21 year old, and I’m like mom tell him to get in the back and he’s laughing and she said “sorry he’s bigger and he’ll fight back so go to the back”. I punch him in the arm because sibling things. He decided to not leave it alone and shoved me and punched me while also shutting the car door on my hand. Great start and it’s not even a minute into the dinner!! 

He proceeded to call me a retard in the car while my mom is silent as a feather. Then we get to dinner and conversation starts with my family. They’re asking me about college and jobs which I don’t have either right now. Everyone else is being respectful and just saying “ok”. My brother then shouts really loud “Jessica’s too stupid to get into college!” and then starts screaming in my ear “why don’t you have a job? Because you’re a retard? You’re so lazy” and tells me to quit smoking. He’s very aggressive about me not smoking and I’m like listen I give you until your 17. See if you can make it in this family without smoking from the stress. 

I’m honestly getting tired of his bullying and I’m not really sure what to do. I’ve tried the approach of talking to him one on one and letting him know my feelings but he just starts talking over me loudly. I’ve tried ignoring him completely and not fighting back. I’ve tried punching him in the arm to let him know to stop. Nothing. Works. I’ve talked to my parents and they just tell me “he’s a sensitive kid”. No. He’s not. He’s a straight up definition of a bully. How do I get to him? I’m going insane everytime I see family  only because of him.",25Nov2019,1
366,"Last week a few friends of mine and I popped into our local town centre to play a bit of Pokémon Go. We wandered around and did the usual stuff and decided to stop for a bit round the side of a local game shop (appropriately called GAME).

Wes stood there for about five minutes or so when all of a sudden an Xbox One controller came flying around the corner, box and everything. Manuals spilled out, everyone who was nearby was staring at it with total bewilderment, even those who were in front of the shop front and potentially would have seen where it came from.

From where we were at the side, we couldn't tell where it had come from, but it surely must have come from the shop entrance.Nobody knew what to do so we just sort of stood there soaking in the mass 'errm' what was ripe in the local population. Someone could have paid for it, nicked it, thrown it in anger in an argument, no one seemed to have any idea

Around 2-3 minutes later someone just waltzed right up to it, picked the whole thing up and started walking off. He rifled through the box, grabbed the controller, stuffed it in his pocket, and just tossed the box and the rest of the contents to one side without even looking.

Was this some sort of pre-planned theft from the game shop, or just a weird event and an opportunist? I'm totally at a loss about the whole situation and don't get exposed to a lot of crime first hand.",25Nov2019,1
369,"Hi I'm a male high school student. I just realize my habit where everytime I see a girl, I automatically look at her chest. Its not my classmate or someone I am familiar with.

371,"Hey guys, 

So I'm really worried for my friend right now. In august she worked at an amusement park as a games vendor and was dragged off by a group of men to where 'noone could hear her'

She screamed for help and a security guard came and helped her. She reported it to management but they just wanted to 'sweep it under the rug' the company is close with the local police. She's terrified to report it to police because she's scared for them to find her guilty of lying which I KNOW SHE ISNT. I've been in a similar scenario. The park even has security cameras so shouldn't that be enough evidence? 

I need help on how to move forward guys. Should we go to police even though it's been a few months?",25Nov2019,1

375,"I've had a massive crush on this girl I've known now for about 2 years! Honestly the perfect girl in every sense... funny, intelligent, social etc... I've flirted with her for the longest time and I know she's into me but not nearly as much as I to her. We kissed earlier in the year and despite this I and a lot of others think she strung me along to keep me as a friend but that's about it (which is completely normal). Earlier this year I made a conscious decision to retract myself from her and not be as close just to safeguard myself from any heartbreak or anxiety that comes with the whole situation and so that my feelings couldn't have the chance to deepen. To give some context, I'm in my senior year and next year I leave to go work across the world so deciding to halt all my love interests seemed like the best choice to avoid any complications at a later stage. I'm okay with dealing with disappointment and heartbreak but this one seems to be unique. So I chose to rather stay away and hopefully suppress my feelings in the long term. Last week she messaged me to come see me on a night out and naturally I agreed (Obviously still have feelings) and we proceeded to have an amazing time together ! Was truly great. Things however went south when I brought up to her that I was trying to distance myself because of my feelings and I ended up saying I didn't want to be her friend (Obviously I want to be her friend but I made this decision for my own ""protection""). She started crying and was visibly shocked and sad, I still feel horrible for that. The next morning I felt really bad for doing this however I didn't really have any regret because I still somewhat understood my intention. I just want to know whether I'm being a complete idiot or does it make sense to nip my relationship with her in the bud ?  She's messaged me asking me to explain while we're both sober and I don't want to make things worse. My heart says stay my head says run!",25Nov2019,1

386,"So today I felt pretty normal , well, normal in these times. I woke up today, I slept in actually until around 12 pm. I didn’t feel like getting up even though I did want to do something productive, such as church, or, the gym. I stayed in bed and watched YouTube and moped around until I had to get ready for work. Before that though, I did meditate. This was good for clearing out the mind of any negativity or anxieties. During the shower I had a good bit of an experienced mental clarity as I did the hot-cold type shower for the first time today. Work was another monster in itself. I did not want to talk to the customers, or my coworkers. I felt I had detached from that outer world in meditation and didn’t fully come back. I later on mulled around and needed to work so that dragged on itself. Also picking up trash after trash was mentally degrading in itself as well. I did not like picking up trash, and it essentially drained me. I did however get to listen to my audiobook of the source, which helped me get through it today. The rest of the work day was essentially getting through it and waiting until it was time to go. I now sit at home and realize that I have been living in distractions for a good amount of time in my life, and I aim to better understand this and do something about it. I would like to focus more and be more present in my life because I ultimately feel as if I am wasting my life away and my time throughout the day as I sit and browse the internet and ponder trains of thought that mostly are about non important things and also lead to a nowhere of meer, tiny gratification of a subject through memes or anything on the internet that I search up; or surface knowledge on a subject at best. These distractions I’ve realized are so strong that I have a very regular tendency, or urge to check my notifications, check my Snapchat stories/messages, check what had been posted on Instagram, and other forms of depth as well. I do wish to catch myself more often and completely understand why I do this, and what I can do instead. For example, when I am trying to read, or watch an informational video, my mind somehow tends to get bored almost immediately, it subconsciously reverts to some kind of satisfaction and replies to a message, for example, or browse a meme. Even partake in a total other activity altogether. I could possibly try to notice this urge, and force myself to focus more in the moment and try to learn something. Also other instances alike can also occur , at work or even social situations. Where I find an “out.” I think maybe it is some kind of escape from reality, a happy place of sorts that is filled with the instant satisfaction of opening a new post, or seeing a new message, or finding something interesting across the room and it’s time for me to investigate. 

I still have the urges to go to the gym, I want to be healthier. I want to see myself succeed in this area and go to the military. It is still a dream of mine, and even so I still subconsciously attack myself from ever getting there. I tell myself I am too tired, or I don’t have enough time, or the machines at the gym are probably busy, I don’t want to be looked at by too many people. All of this may be true, but it still shouldn’t mean anything. I have a dream and it’s up to me to chase it. However, there’s the problem of low self esteem and that’s where it comes into play. 

I feel I don’t deserve the things I want in life. I don’t consciously tell myself these things, however, I feel them. It’s weird. I  somehow will understand that I really want to do something, and I’ll also understand every problem that comes with it, every challenge that will present itself, and somehow all of that always tends to outweigh the actual “doing” of the task. When I am at work, however, there are many tasks to accomplish. I do them, and I do them well, with extra care sometimes. Just to have that little bit of integrity and hope that someone will recognize it and maybe I’ll be rewarded, who knows. Fact is, I do all of this and I have to. And at the end of the day, I am getting paid for it. It’s demeaning work, for sure, but it still gets done. 

As for my home, and my mental health, I don’t care as much or even try as hard to keep things in order. Maybe it’s because there is no one watching me there, no one to prove my integrity to (realizing sentence about integrity doesn’t make sense as I’m writing it), or no one to watch over me and no one to check my work. I don’t have the responsibility at home as I do at work. Therefore, I push it all aside and mark it “priority 2,” and later wonder why I am not happy overall or content with my decisions and place in life. Maybe I have to rearrange my priorities, my ACTUAL priorities, to see a change, to feel it. Maybe I just have to work towards that to get what I want. I did read one time , a famous line that read something like “if you want to keep getting everything you’re getting, then don’t change a thing.” Or something like that. I think that will be the thing I should focus on now. What do you think?",25Nov2019,1

392,"hi all, this is my first time posting in any subreddit ever. But I honestly need some advice.

I'm currently in a 1 year long program in college that is sort of a preparation course to allow you to be ready to enroll in whatever healthcare program you're interested in (for the following year). 

Honestly, I've never been great at school, I did really bad in highschool which is why I took the program (to get my grades improved for universities to look at). But this year I'm doing incredibly well. 

However, this year I am feeling insanely drained. I dont know how else to describe it. My finals are in about 2 weeks, and I finish the entire year in April. I dont know if I can push through till then. 

So I was thinking about taking a year off. When I'm not in school, I'm 1500 miles away from it with my boyfriend in Florida. Which is where I'd go for the year.

But my other conflicting aspect is that by the time I take that year off (April 2020-September 2021), I will be 20 years old and starting a 4 year nursing program. Which means I'd be done and into the workplace of my dreams at 24. 

I feel like that is really late. I already get upset sometimes that I didnt push myself in highschool so I could be in that program right now, and would've been out at 22.

I feel like 24 is such a late start on actual life.

Anyways, what I guess I am asking is for someone to tell me their opinion. Is taking a year off really going to do any good, or should I just push through and finish 4 years of schooling so I can start my life? Everyone I've asked has just said ""it's up to you"". Yes I know! But I need opinions so I can feel for what is right. Sounds dumb. 

Thanks.",25Nov2019,1
393,"Really sorry for the length, but we honestly don’t know what to do.  Our neighbor is a older diabetic lady who doesn’t really have any family that we have seen. We haven’t seen her the last couple weeks but her car has come and gone and the door is periodically open (last we saw was bout a week ago).  She has a cat that she absolutely loves but never lets out. Well I went to do laundry today and while changing the load (her back windows face the laundry section; outside) I heard a cat crying, I look over and her cat is trapped/smooshed between the window (jalousies) and window screen. It looks like the cat squeezed through the jalousies (
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalousie_window) and it closed behind him. He looked exhausted and the couple from a building across the way said that he had been trapped there for several hours in direct sunlight (it was about 85 degrees today) and had been panting really bad. I went to her front door and yelled her name in her apartment multiple times and banged on the door.  All the lights were off. I proceeded to do this for about 20 minutes. I then went back to the cat and opened the screen. The cat was super sweet and obviously happy to be rescued. My husband and I then yelled multiple times to try and see if anyone would answer. We then opened the jalousies and tried putting the cat back in gently. The space was so small and there was a bookshelf or something so it really wouldn’t have been possible unless the cat was super serious about trying to get through. I proceeded to carry the cat to the front, but out of nowhere he began biting me...like literally the cat was purring and making biscuits and then he was biting the shit out of me and scratching and then back to purring and making biscuits...dafuq. So now I am bleeding with a ‘currently’ happy cat yelling at her front door again. The cat is SUPER dirty (like my hands are black) and it seems to have old flea poop all over it.  We have our own cats that we don’t want to cause issues for, but we have no idea what to do at this point. We get one of our carriers and put him in our bathroom and write a note to the neighbor saying where the cat is.  What concerns us is we literally have NO IDEA when she will be back or WORSE we are worried something happened to her and she is in her apartment (she is diabetic and has collapsed in her tub once while we live here and had to be rescued).  We gave the cat flea treatment as we do NOT want fleas in our place or on our cats, but I have bites all over my arm and he attacked the shit out of my husband (to the point that I told him if it gets infected we are going to the doctor). We called the humane society and asked them and they said that we can surrender him but if the owner doesn’t show in 9 days then he will be evaluated and based on his unpredictable behavior he most likely will be put down. We don’t want that because what if she is in the hospital, she LOVES the cat...like when her door is open we saw she got him his own special chair so he can look outside.  We also cant keep him here for long cause our cats are SUPER upset and stressed.  But what if something happened to her and she is in like a diabetic coma or god forbid has passed...we thought about calling the cops non-emergency and request a welfare check, but we don’t want to over step our bounds if she just left for a couple days and the cat got into a predicament but has food and water inside the apartment?  We honestly have no idea what to do and don’t want to something wrong. Her mail hasn’t been picked up in at least a day maybe more. We genuinely don’t know what to do with the situation or this bi-polar cat.  Currently he is in our bathroom and was super thirsty and hungry when we brought him in.

4. Because I only have them every second weekend, I am paying the maximum child support and can't reduce it unless they stay with me more. It's a lot of money, and I feel like I am paying my ex wife to spend time with my kids when I would rather spend time with them.
5. Because I am paying the maximum child support, saving for my own house is pretty tough. 
6. With the pressure to both pay the child support and save for my own home, I feel like I need to work harder so I can make more money.
7. I have a girlfriend, and the commute is really getting to her, its putting massive strain on our relationship

Overall, I feel like all my relationships are strained. 

1. I am extremely angry at my ex-wife for moving out here. 
2. I am having a hard time feeling like I see my kids enough. 
3. Even though my girlfriend is really supportive and loving and has been the only person there for me, the strain that the commute puts on her makes it feel like maybe things won't last. 
4. I resent work because I feel like I am working for my ex and not me and my kids.

The stress really does feel like it's killing me. 

It feels like an unsolvable situation. Some of the options I can think of are:

1. Leave my career and find a job in the Small Town, I don't have any other skills and I would be lucky to earn half of what I earn now. I would be trading logistical stress for financial stress.
2. Try and find a remote version of my job, or find a role like mine where I only have to work 3-4 days a week. Some financial stress, but I MIGHT be able to make ends meet.
3. Move back into the City, just accept that I will only see my kids every second weekend and try make the most of that time. This is immensely painful, but will reduce the strain on my relationship with my girlfriend who is the only support person in my life, literally. No parents, no siblings etc.

399,"At the beginning of our friendship, we told each other we’d be there for one another if things got rough. We said that because of how similar we are. At first they were very respectful of my time but now they aren’t. The thing is, they’re pushing me away but I don’t think they do that on purpose. They told me that they push people away but they don’t mean to and I fully intend to still be there for them but at the same time. I don’t appreciate how they’re treating me. One example is that they rake forever to respond. It wasn’t a big deal at first cause I know life gets busy but now they do it all the time. The apology of them forgetting is starting to get old. They’ve gone through some shit these past two weeks so I don’t want to leave them but at this point, I feel like I’m annoying them. I don’t know if I should leave them alone or try to be there for them. I don’t want to annoy them. I want to be there for them in case they are pushing me away but not meaning it.

400,"Hey y’all, so I just started college recently and everything has been a train wreck from the get go. I commute to my college first off because I live with an aunt to save some money. But there have been a lot of issues with both of these things. First off, I have a very terrible winter car and we have very terrible winters where Iive and since I’ve been out here I have been in a total of like 7 car accidents (only 1 was my fault, people are bad at driving in the city). Second, it seems like my aunt and uncle do not really like me living here. IDK why but they just complain about everything I forget to do. But not even directly to me, she calls my mom and is like weird about it. So we do not currently know if I can even stay at this college next semester (My family is poor and I am a first generation college student)! Because idk if we can afford housing or can even require it. On top of that my work barely works with my schedule at all. Tbh i just really miss my family and everything has been stressing me out lately. So what do I do?

402,"So I met someone over the internet a few days ago, and they're cool to hang out with and nice, but there's one thing weird about them... they're obsessed with this thing called ""energy"". They say that they can sense ""energy"" and you have more or less energy based on your personality type, which conveniently hers is the ""most powerful"". She even told me once how she could ""sense"" that she was meant to be a king/queen, and had immense power. She continually attributes simple things such as being able to tell someone's emotions as having a powerful connection with energy, and anytime someone is angry or upset she just says that she can sense the negative energy coming from them. She even tells stories like when she was once at a church and saw a shadow ""possess"" someone she was talking to, and said that the priest manifested it using powerful dark energy. She's even sharing this with other people and, what scares me the most, is that it's actually convincing to lots of people that are depressed or lost because she helps them find the things that are wrong with them using this ""energy"". She's also suffered lots of hardships in life from what I know about her, so that may be how this all started in the first place, as maybe some kind of escape or explanation for why she's being hurt so much. I mean my life is pretty perfect but she was even able to find the flaws in my life and tried to convince me of this energy stuff. I'm honestly worried she's going to start a cult or something, as funny or weird or scary as it may sound. Is there any way to really convince her otherwise?",25Nov2019,1

404,"Ok so here is a little back story. My wife is going to college and works full time. She gets $1,500 a month from her GI Bill for an living expense and makes about $1,600 a month from her job. So she has about $3,000 of income per month. I on the other hand have a nice job and make enough to live a very comfortable life. Currently I pay rent for the place were living at, my truck note, vehicle insurance for my truck and her car, my cellphone, child support from a previous marriage, AND I'm building a house (in cash) so I'm paying for that as well. At the end of each month I have enough left over to stow away $4,000 into savings. Her only responsibility is to pay the electricity ($80 a month), internet ($60 a month), water ($40 a month) her credit card ($200 a month), and her car payment ($520 a month). That's it. That's all she has to pay for. I pay for everything else. Now, I work overseas so I'm rarely home.

Well now to the topic on hand. Last year around this time her car got repo'd while I was home on vacation. I asked her how this happened and she said she fell short of paying on it. I thought ok and paid the behind balance and a month in advance ~$2,000 to get her car back and I laid out a budget for her. I told her though that if this happens again I refuse to help her. For the past year she has sworn she has been doing better financially (I'm not home to make sure) and what do you know, she texts me and says she needs $2,700 because her car got repo'd. I didnt get mad or curse at her or anything, I just asked how this happened. She said she fell short again. I asked her how she fell short when she has a surplus of almost 2 grand every month and she didnt have an answer for me. We've been together for almost 6 years now (married for almost 3) and it seems that since we've been married she has just become very financially irresponsible. 

I guess my question is, do I help her out of this situation again, or have her learn a lesson and let her dig herself out of this hole since I've already warned her?",25Nov2019,1

413,"About two months ago I got a new roommate in my shared appartment with two rooms, kitchen and bath. She is a new studend and just got 20 years old. I´m living here after my masters degree and I´m male 37. I live here because of the low rent and friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Since two weeks she masturbates around the clock, even nights. With powerful vibrators, chains (WFT is she doing with these) and a sybian. And I´ve got to hear EVERYTHING! I hear her moan, I hear her squirt, I can feel and hear her vibrators even if I´m in bed or on the coach, even on my coach I can clearly hear how it enters and leaves her with squishy sounds. She wants me to listen and to masturbate for myself, I believe. If I fall asleep, she sneaks out of her room, beats the wall near me with something I couldn´t identify (sounds like a book or so) so that I wake up. Then she fast sneaks into the toilet and doing like nothing happened. Few minutes later she sneaks back into her room and starts masturbating again.

&amp;#x200B;

It started in november the 11th. First days I really was confused, I thought it has been another neighbour. So I sneaked around, trying to find where the sounds came from. If I get out of bed, she can hear it because the flat is very old and poorly soundproofed. So she fastly stopped and waited till I´m in bed again. Then she starts over again. But on friday or saturday that week, she was too slowly so I catched her. She didn´t manage to turn off her vibrator fast enough, so I heared where it came from. So I knocked her door, she opened and played like she was asleep all the night and heared nothing. She even stood a few minutes with me and tried to identify where the sounds came from. She played her role masterfully, so i believed her and got even more confused.

Until then I didn´t know what to do, so I started to masturbate, too. I did it loud so she could clearly hear me. She wasn´t annoyed at all (I hoped to annoy her so she stops), and she got even louder so she made me really horny and since we masturbated together. on saturday 15th or sunday 16th I heared her masturbate with her phone or laptop, I heared a guy talking and moaning. I refused to join, she said ""come on"" the guy said ""what"" and she answered ""not you"". So I got angry and left for a walk, because I felt like a tool. A few hours later, back in my room, I couldn´t control myself and joined her. She drove me to the best effin orgasm I ever had.

&amp;#x200B;

It drove me into illness, because lack of sleep, I had to take an ill week from the 14th till 22nd november. And I have tinnitus when in stress. My tinnitus got severely worse till today and I have to take strong anti depressants just to hear with my left ear.

&amp;#x200B;

In the last week (my ill week) it got hardcore. We masturbated around the clock. Wake up, masturbate, eat, sleep a little bit, masturbate. And it´s her everytime who starts it. I thought my dick will fall off. It wasn´t even fun anymore. And we never talked about it, never called a name, everything happend behind our walls. If we meet in the kitchen or so, we are best friends, no problems. She is nice, kind and so on... but we never talk about the situtation.

So last week we masturbated 24/7. I know it´s her, she knows it´s me.

And since the said saturday/sunday (I had really lost any sense of time), we mastrubate together, turn each other up till we come. She lets me take a few minutes rest and then starts making ""sounds"" again, and hell you can believe me, no man on earth can resist if he hears THESE sounds. And I really would prefer to sleep with her, but she said she has her ""red days"". Don´t take me wrong, if she wanted me I would pack my dick in wrapping paper and just fly over to her. I mean she said she likes how ""long standing"" I am in a conversation about something other, so I have the hope we can be more than neighbours.

But it´s simply TOO MUCH!

&amp;#x200B;

Today I have to work again. She knows it. But either way she startet over again at about 23 o´clock till about 1 o´clock this night. Then I stopped and yelled her to PLEASE LET ME SLEEP BECAUSE I HAVE TO GET UP EARLY. Her answer were even more squishy sounds.

At 3 o´clock I had finally enough. I was so mad, you can´t imagine.

First I wrote her via WhatsApp some messages to explain my situation, what I feel and think and so on. Her mobile phone was turned off. So I yelled I´ll call the cops if she doesn´t stop. No reaction, she got even louder.

I turned the power off in her room, so her sybian and her magic wand didn´t work. First she shook her sybian because she thought it was defective. Then she took her magic wand, shook it and knocked on it. What a relief! No vibrating bed anymore! YEAH! But boy oh boy... then she used her other vibrator (with batteries) and her fingers and she did it clearly directly by my wall. I could hear EVERYTHING like she was a meter away from me. In my anger i took my (really loud) electric toothbrush, turned it on and yelled ""I have the power! I am the master of the universe!"" Then she stopped.

So i fell asleep for about one hour. She sneaked out again, slapped the wall with somthing again so I woke up and she fastly got into the bathroom. This drove me completely insane. I knocked on her door again, she first refused to answer, but I said I´ll stay till she comes out. So she came out after a few minutes. Then I told her about my problem again, begged her on my knees to stop, but she again said she was asleep and she even didn´t ever see a vibrator. She even asked if the sounds and vibrations end if I stand up and if this makes her suspicious. I think you can imagine the situation. She can be extremely manipulative. Then she left and I finally had my two hours of sweet sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

So my dear people, how can I handle this situation? I really like her, I don´t want to have a bad relationship with her. And she makes me so horny like nothing ever before. But I have the feeling she just loves to play with me. And in the meantime it really makes me sick and endangers my job and my health. PLEASE HELP!

419,I’m 23 years old. Two days ago I went out to a local bar with my boyfriend (of nearly 5 years) and a friend of ours. We all drank quite a bit and had a reasonably fun night. My boyfriend drove us home in my vehicle where I sat in the passenger seat and our friend sat in the back. It was 3 am and I was pretty intoxicated and tired at this point so I slumped over and rested my head against the car door. I remember feeling a hand reach around and I’m thinking it’s trying to buckle up my seatbelt or maybe just pick me up from my slumped position but everything after that has trumped my understanding of what was going on. I felt someone start to touch me in an inappropriate way. I’m the type to freeze up when I feel threatened.. maybe thinking that if I stay still enough it’ll go away. But it didn’t. I remember turning my head to the side just enough to see my boyfriends face staring straight ahead with both hands on the wheel. I don’t remember when I started to cry but as soon as it was loud enough to hear is when I felt the hand slowly pull away. It‘s definitely a painful experience but I think the worst part is the response I got from my friend and my boyfriend afterwards. It was frighteningly nonchalant. My friend obviously didn’t admit to having done anything. And my boyfriend must have believed him because he then offered for him to sleep on our couch. Thankfully he didn’t end up staying. I’ve had a lot of time to think through it although I desperately want to repress it for now. My issue is that I can’t forgive my friend for something he won’t admit to doing. And although my boyfriend says he believes me and he did end up crying later that night- I expected more from him. I understand that it’s difficult for him to process as well but.. the lack of empathy and emotion from two people I cared for and trusted deeply has left me feeling completely alienated. I can tell my boyfriend is still in a state of thinking/hoping that there was room for error on my part. I would like nothing more to believe it was all in my head as well but I know what I felt. I unfortunately don’t think my friend will admit to having done anything. And I’m afraid I won’t be able to stay with my boyfriend knowing I can’t count on him to support me when I need it the most. I don’t know if anyone has any advice for this.. I know it will mostly just take time. I just needed someone to listen. If you read all of this.. thank you.,25Nov2019,1
420,"For context: I’m a waitress at a New York-style jewish deli and diner in the southeast (USA). About 90% of our clientele are regulars, and by that I mean 10+ years of weekly or bi-weekly patronage. 

(Let me preface this by saying I believe moms of young children have every right to patronize dinning establishments as much as anyone else. I’m raising two toddlers myself and wholehearted think that young children should be welcome to dine on delicious deli treats as much as the rest of the population.)

But... every Tuesday for the last two+ months, I’ve had a table of two moms, three toddlers, and one baby come in for lunch. No attention is paid to the children by them whatsoever, they pretty much pretend it’s just the two of them grabbing lunch. Every single time the baby (probably 11-12 months) screams and cries relentlessly the whole time... and they like to hang out, so this is about a 2 hour ordeal. I always get complaints from my other tables, and have had a few of them just leave because of the noise. The first time I stuck up for them. The baby wasn’t too loud those first few times, and if the other customers wanted a silent dinning experience, they could have stayed at home, or got to-go. 

But then I would see the messes they left me and the other staff. They would let the toddlers poor out the entire sugar container (like 2-3 cups) on the table so they could make shapes and draw in it, basically making it their own goddam zen garden. Looking underneath their table, I can assume absolutely nothing they ordered made it into a mouth. The toddlers throw food on the floor purposely, and run around the whole restaurant like it’s a playground. About a month ago I had to avoid tripping over one of the kids by falling flat on my face and spilling the four plates of food I was carrying (took two long showers to get all that egg yolk out of my hair, and the bruises on my forehead and hip are just now leaving). They didn’t notice it happen, but I thought if they would have, they would have felt bad and apologized accordingly, but I wasn’t gonna sweat it. Like I said I’ve got kids. And I’m also patient to a fault. 

But last tuesday was the kicker. I brought the toddlers drinks in styrofoam kids cups, as usual, and not even 10 minutes later one of them throws a tantrum and chucks it on the floor, busting it open and spilling the contents. I get down on hands and knees to clean it. Smiling and being polite the entire time. Wait 15 minutes. One of the other toddlers thought that looked fun and did the same thing. Clean it up. Finally get enough time away from them to pay attention to my other tables, have to field a sea of complaints, and then I walk by, and notice the third toddler has peed all over the fabric chair she’s sitting in, and all on the floor. No apology from the girls mom whatsoever, but the other mom gives me a half-assed “sorry you had to deal with that mess” as she pays at the counter, not even looking me in the eyes. They “made it up to me” by leaving double their normal tip.... so I made $4 instead of $2. And lost a bunch of money from other customers having a bad experience, or simply walking out because of them. After all this, I heard one of my regulars go up to them as she was leaving and say “Those are some pretty kids you have, but I can’t wait to see them on the local news.” 

I’m not a babysitter, and I’m definitely not paid to clean up your child’s excrement. 

Me and my tuesday coworker have been trying to brainstorm a nice way of saying “The trouble isn’t worth the money. Tip more or don’t come back” 

Any ideas?",25Nov2019,1
421,"tl;dr : I apparently had an attitude and it was enough for her to stop all forms of communication to 'threaten' me. I am frustrated and don't know how to deal with build up anger from years of constantly being silenced when she is content with the ending of a conversation and couldn't be annoyed with me explaining things from my p.o.v.

My grandparents just came in from the doctors and were pissed that I wrote the day but the right date on the fridge ( it said Monday the 27th instead of Wednesday the 27th even though today it the 25th).

She talked about how she got me a gravy ring doughnut while they were out, She then asked have I started cleaning my room for Christmas and I said yes and she said about how we need to clean etc, I kept saying yes cause she keeps going on about it and I am cleaning it but she keeps going on it's getting tiring, then she asked about the Christmas duvet my other grandmother got me last year and how I should have put it on coming up to Christmas when I told her how it is already on my bed. I told her it was irreversible and she said ""don't you mean reversible"" and then explained the difference between reversible and irreversible. I always feel stupid around her because I use the wrong words, I was embarrassed but I said: ""You knew what I meant anyway"".

Out of nowhere ten seconds later she told me to watch my tone. I tried to explain that I didn't have an attitude about how when they have a tone no one says anything. How the tone of my voice always changes and how I can't keep checking it. ( I have always had a monotone voice, waiting on an ASD diagnosis, she doesn't understand my autistic brother which leads him to feel frustrated, which I have been dealing with all my life because I always hated to have my photo was taken or smile.)

Then during explaining that my grandfather said about to remember who I am talking to and then my granny chimed in with ' Watch what way you are talking to us, You're not that big I was put you down to size' , I'm 22 and this is really insulting to be talked to like a 12-year-old over me saying ""you knew what I meant anyway"". Apparently I have an attitude problem and how they both have noticed it , but yet it's perfectly okay for her to get pissed off at people for not making her cups of tea at 3 am when they wake up to go to the toilet and apparently by me turning it down, she is finished with me and how I have an attitude. I literally feel like a 15-year-old rebellious misunderstood teenager.

I sat there unable to say anything after that because there was no point, the minute she said the 'Watch who you are talking to speech' there is no room for a conversation even between 2 adults, right now I am in the living room crying from frustration but it's fair that I am being cut on having a little bit of an attitude when constantly being annoyed by her but yet it is accessible for her to take full-on breakdowns over a bed not being ironed probably.

For my bro... Oh, that's really hard. he is turned on the idea of ​​subsistence farming. He studying for smth like farm manager. But not only me have no idea what to give him. He is introvert and I can't remember things about that he said ""I wanna have this""...

Please write some ideas of resolution this problem!

425,"My mother passed away suddenly 3 weeks ago. Lots of condolences which I greatly appreciate. Then there is a friend I've had for 5 years. I texted her the morning it happened and she asked what happened. I told her and her final text back was ""oh, so sorry dear."" Thats it! Since then nothing! Not even a ""hey how are you?"" This is a woman who can fill up my Messenger blathering on about her kids and divorce and body pains. But I'm suffering and nothing for me?!

426,"For the past two years, I've effectively been a NEET. After high school, I imminently went to college, but very quickly had a psychological break down and dropped out. My mom died withing about two months of college starting and I'd been dealing with depression already, so I was simply in no place to be doing something like that. I've already tried going back once, but similarly failed thanks to my mental health failing.

In the past few months, I've started taking the process of improving my mental health more seriously. I'm sick of being a leech on my father and want to actually start perusing my goals in life. I feel like going back to college would be a good first step on the path to getting my life back on track, but I don't know if I really can. I'm worried that, having failed twice already, getting back into college will be next to impossible.

Beyond this, I don't really know if I can actually do what I want to do in life. I'm pretty passionate about philosophy, but that's infamously impossible to get a job with. I'm also a very political person, but professional radical is hardly a career choice. It seems like all my interests are academic nerd shit or politics and I don't know if I can make a career out of that, especially in light of my past failures.

What steps do I need to take to right myself and get shit back on track? Any advice or tips you've got are appreciated greatly",25Nov2019,1

429,"Hey..I’m a new user and just wondering what I should do. 

Soo..I met my boyfriend my freshman year, he was a junior at the time. This was back in 2017.  💚

I’ll be 18 in two weeks, he’s already 19 and graduated as I’m still in my senior year...these past few years were beautiful and our families are very much used to each other being together and think we are still in luv the way we used to be but there’s just one thing you should know... 

we live in different cities not far away at all, we’re very used to the “long distance relationship” thing since we started dating when I moved high schools near the end of my freshman year. I see him once a week now..used to see him at least three times a week before he started working... (I understand when he doesn’t have the time) 

Just that recently we’ve been arguing and spending less time together because we don’t plan anything at all anymore....he’s my best friend and we talked things through..something just feels wrong and we both feel the vibe but we still keep holding on strong enough...

there some kind of doubt knowing we fell in luv too young but no regret? He’s always been over protective but now that I’m becoming an adult soon..he’s been more distant than ever before...there was a period of time where we got so sensitive over me changing up...(I had to deal with his Changes before any of this, he’s just more sensitive now that he’s more mature and is worried over my decisions) 

he got so insecure and now he’s so used to being independent and okay with being alone and don’t get me wrong I did as well go through this because long distance just sorta gets you used to being on your own when you aren’t together right? And honestly it’s a good feeling knowing your own worth and time. I’m just so afraid to lose my best friend it hurts to feel like we are outgrowing each other...
Once I’m 18 I feel like it’ll be totally different just knowing that I’ll be able to be with him whenever wherever....what should I say to him or what should I do about this...💔",25Nov2019,1

I spoke to her about us not spending as much time together and she agreed, she even said we should set up a time to meet and catch up. She thinks of me as a really close friend tho:/ I have no idea how to proceed, no idea how to tell her, I can handle the rejection even if it happened but I don't think I can handle losing a friend.

434,"I'm in my early twenties. Last Saturday I went to my guy friend's house and one of his male friends was there too. I think the guy is like 26 or 27. don't really know his friend too well. I think it was like the second or third time I've met him. We hung out for a couple hours and then the guy asked me if I could possibly give him a ride home and I said sure. We talked a little bit about stuff and I guess I made him laugh. 



A couple days later I got a text from a number that wasn't saved and the text said ""hey cute girl. What's up?"" I replied and asked who they were and they responded that they he was the guy that I drove him and that my friend gave him my number. He asked if I wanted to possibly hangout with him and I said sure. I went to his house and we talked, watched a movie, and got dinner at Taco Bell lol. Last night he asked if I wanted to hangout again. So I went to his house and we hung out and chilled for a little bit. 



Then he started kissing me and trying to make-out with me. He asked me if I was a virgin and I told him yes. I kind of hesitated at first because I have only made-out a couple times and didn't really know what to do. I did give in and I pulled his pants down and gave him head. Then he gave me oral and fingered me. I laid on the bed and did missionary and he came. He asked me if I wanted to ride him and I told him no. Then he wanted to do kind of doggy position and he came again.



 I'm not on birth control and he didn't wear a condom. He shot it all over my body. I just feel stupid because I wasn't sure if I wanted it or not and think I got played. I did not think I would lose my virginity to someone I barely knew. I'm not the ""wait until marriage"" kind but I would actually like to know the person a lot and be in a relationship before we have sex.

All these years later I just can’t understand those things I did and it’s affecting me as I feel i deserve to suffer now. Why should an asshole like me deserve happiness or love? What the hell was wrong with me!? If I know it’s bad enough to make me feel this way (I’ve been depressed since partly from the guilt), why the hell did I do it in the first place!?

442,"Hi, I'm a university student who has a metric ton of things to get done and recently ended a 1y7m relationship out of pure necessity. Now I'm beginning to fall for someone and it is not helping me get sleep or be properly productive. I also feel some guilt, because it is happening so soon after the end of the old relationship, just over three weeks. For two weeks I was unable to sleep at night and had no appetite, but hanging out with the person in question helped a lot and for the last few days I've been doing a bit better. I feel I'm affected in a negative way by all of that though, because now I find myself daydreaming a lot and having an unhealthy quantity of thoughts. Also, I'm uncertain up to what point those feelings are shared. I have caught some hints of slight affection, but I doubt it in general. I want to escape the state of mind stomach butterflies put a person in. 

I wish to ask for advice on how to deal with that. Ideally, either everything goes as I would like it to regarding the person or I just stop having feelings, but both are improbable. I do not know what to do and I doubt that speaking upfront with her about it would ease me, rather I assume it would put tension on the friend group's atmosphere. It feels like being a child and not knowing how to approach the whole situation. But, at the same time I appreciate what she represents and stands for as a set of views, values, tastes, etc. That happens incredibly rarely to me, liking the majority of someone's traits and I would hate to lose anyone like this, so I'd hate to fuck something up. 

I would appreciate to know how this is perceived by a spectator, so please do tell me if you care to, I'd be thankful.",25Nov2019,1

450,"Hi there, I am a final year university undergraduate taking a Biomedical degree.

I am required to enter Medicine once I complete this Biomedical degree, but with my current grades, I do not feel positive about it. My grades since Year 1 have not been the most ideal and this has led to me achieving a average GPA of 3.3 as of Year 2. I need an average GPA of 5 to be considered.

I know that I can do better. I know it. But for some reason, I always cannot seem to find the motivation - if that is the right word. This has been affecting me since high school. I have seen a counsellor during my high school, but it did not work out for me. I never seem to be able to stick to a strict schedule, as in I always make excuses to do other stuff, except to study.

I am starting to worry for myself. I have all the resources available to me and I am just staring at them, letting time pass by as I keep making excuses not to study.

On rare days where I actually focus to study, I find myself really engrossed in it, but that 'motivation' goes away once I take a break or when my parents say stuff like ""Make sure you get 6s or 7s"". 

Worse of all, when my parents are out, I find this opportunity to play games, as they prohibit me from playing any games at all. I do not dare bring this topic up with them as I know I will get the standard response. My self-control is really messed-up.

452,"Throwaway because of coursemate accounts.

I'm in my second year of a film production course and we're reaching the late stages of a project in which we produce a 5 minute film. I am more of an editor and am not confident on camera so I got a camera operator that a lot of my peers were crewing to work on my film.

My film is a psychological horror film and so had a lot of low lighting and thus the camera needed to accommodate this without having a noisy or underexposed image. The camera op was aware of these conditions.

On the shoot I kept checking in on the camera and not being overly confident in cameras specifically, when he assured me the image was only noisy on the monitors and the final image would be clear, I believed him.

Cut to now, my film looks, in my opinion, terrible. I'm trying to edit it but I can't bring myself to. It's noisy, dark and even the lighting is off. I've spoken to lecturers about the fact it doesn't look good and they've suggested reshoots but it isn't possible because my actor isn't free. Everytime I go to edit it I get filled with shame and a feeling of dread that makes me want to just give up. I keep trying to fight it back, but after all the effort I put into the script and storyboard I am ashamed of what I have produced- both for myself and my actor who no doubt would've liked the showreel material considering it was an unpaid part.

I just need advice with how to go forward, not necessarily professional film advice but more how to overcome this feeling that is preventing me from making the best of the situation and securing a decent mark despite the technical problems. Also any advice on how to communicate these issues to the actor would be welcome, thanks.",25Nov2019,1
455,"I was pretty drunk about 5 years ago and went to the McDonalds and caused some problems there, so I got kicked out. After that me and my friend went to smoke some cigars. After a little while some guy followed us and was angry because what we did in the restaurant. I cant remember exactly what happened, but this guy wanted to make sure we learn our lesson. I cant remember what happened next, did I hit him first (I dont believe because I've never hit anyone before) but I ended up on my knees and this guy strangles me with the hood of my jacket, and my buddy had to help me.

After that my buddy kept this guy and said to me 'hit him'. I know this 2 v 1 is very childish. I cant remember what did I do, but I have this flashback where I think that I dont want to hit him too hard, but I dont know is this real memory. After all I ended up ripping a piece off his shirt because I was angry about how he stretched my new jacked when strangling me. After this security guys came and said that if we dont go away they must call police.

My friend told me there was no blood coming from the other guy, but I cant remember this and so I dont know what to believe.

460,"I am pretty sure I will only post this particular one here. I just need to get it out, any help would be appreciated. Sorry for the longer read.

I have been diagnosed officially with severe depression and anxiety, and thanks to meds and a ton of therapy I am showing less symptoms of the former. The thing is, while not officially diagnosed as all of the following has only just come into the light, I show nearly all the symptoms of PTSD including and especially psychosis aspects of it. I hallucinate visually and audibly, and disassociate to the point that I forget my name, current action and history. I feel like I have lost touch with reality. I sometimes question what really happened to me, my memories of the events. Often, actually. Lucky (and unlucky) for me is that I have evidence that some of it did really happen. Triggering and grounding content. Such a fucked up paradox.

**Here is a trigger warning for anyone sensitive to child sexual abuse or sexual violence in anyway, as this is part of my explanation**: I can't give too many details as I am paranoid of a specific person reading this and putting lots of little details together and I can't risk it despite this being one of my most anonymous presences online- probably just brain being brain again but oh well.\\

For context, I am a teen girl, the abuse occurred during this year as well.

A family member passed away coming up to 2 years ago and was a catalyst for a variety of underlying mental health issues to rise to the service albeit delayed. At the time this family member passed, I was extra vulnerable and allowed a predator (not that I realized until it was too late as I had been groomed for just under a year prior) to sweep my desperate, lonely self into his open arms.

We met under the impression of 'being in love' and I remember a distinct moment of horror as he walked up to me and wrapped his arms around me. He was at the time, a man around 30 years my senior. In that first meeting things went further than I had planned, even for a sexually curious teenage girl clouded with delusions of 'soulmates' and 'age is just a number if it's true love'. I will admit I was sexually curious. It is a topic of contention in my mind every day and despite telling myself that it doesn't matter what I did, that was not ok in the slightest, I blame myself. The logic brain concedes these battles. I went with things for fear of not only the loss of his 'adoration' but also the realization that this was a grown man who could hurt me, knew where I lived, knew my deepest secrets and all that jazz. I was so lonely, and I thought for the first meeting if this is what I put up with to get that validation, ok. Can't back out now. Oh how I wish I had. The first meeting was tame, in a secluded but still public setting. Hands only.

The second meeting he was bolder, oral and what I can only call forced dry-humping without clothes in between. I didn't want to go that far but I remember his hands on me, holding me, pinning me. I at first liked his touch, when it was just kissing, yet another cause of the immense shame and guilt I feel. I just wanted to be loved.

After that, I snuck him into my house. I won't detail how, but he stayed in my room (I was a very private teenager, always had my door closed and music on etc) for days at a time, leaving only rarely to sneak upstairs to the bathroom. My family has hearing impairments and generally blared the TV, also had very predictable schedules. 

He proceeded to use me from the moment we 'had sex' (I call it that, I was scared and in pain the whole time) up to 10 times a day with various sexual acts. He refused to stop touching me, sexual or not, always close, always there. He would message me if I left my room just to let me know he was there, he reminded me all the time. When he wasn't in my room secretly using me, he was video chatting me for up to 16-18 hours daily including overnight, plus constant messaging. If I didn't reply, he would 'casually' leave rows of 7 messages in a row in an obnoxious space of time. This triggers me to this day, casually or not. It would be a ""hey"", then a ""love you"", then an image from another social platform that he thought was sweet, then a ""thinking of you"", then a selfie with perhaps an update on his current activity, like cooking or something mundane. The idea goes on. Perhaps sweet out of context on it's own, but awkward at the time. 

During this time I began having blackouts of memory, entire lapses, sometimes even when he was there. My schoolwork and mental health takes a hit, I blame it on the passing of family member, which cut deep also but wasn't causing the trauma responses. I was delusional at this time at what was happening, deciding my fear and terror was excitement and nerves and love. It was not. 

I got out of the 'relationship' by the graces I can't explain because if the abuser in question were to read it, it would be a dead giveaway. I can't risk that as I am not sure what to do in the future regarding possible legal proceedings etc. I may want to or have to pretend to be his friend to collect further evidence and/or identify his location.

That's the thing. I don't know how I want to handle this. In our last bit of contact he essentially said that if I were to go to police, he would have to 'tell them everything', and saying he would tell them everything about me and blackmail me. Police wouldn't care, but there are some things I don't want my family knowing, such as an ongoing eating disorder that is currently known by me, him and now the whole internet. 

I also have a heavy distrust of the court justice system and the way I have been warned of being torn to shreds on the stand. Being a victim or a minor, it seems, will not protect me from the vicious bullshit of a defense attorney, unless of course he pleads guilty and gets a plea deal or I get a confession from him. The confession part was suggested as a possible course of action by police when I discussed the base ideas with him. I don't know if I could hear his voice or see his face again.

471,"I need advice. I had bought two floor tickets to see the Lumineers for my friend and I. She knew upfront the date of the concert and the cost. She seemed really excited to go. On the day of the concert I texted her and asked her what time she wanted to meet up for it and she responded back saying, ""Meet up for what?"" She said she had completely forgotten the concert was today and that she couldn't afford to go. I tried to sell the tickets on multiple sites to no avail. Mind you, we messaged at around noon when the concert started at 7:30 PM. 

I am really confused by this because I have been messaging her the past week about the concert and I also saw her on Friday and we spoke about it. How should I handle this situation moving forward? I have not messaged her since she told me she couldn't go.

472,"I've been looking for jobs recently but I don't feel like doing anything at all that don't require an education. But I also have no energy to study something boring (and I know how depressed I was in school, but mostly because there wasn't interesting subjects and it was something I had to do, not what I wanted to do). 

I recently found a school that teaches something I reeeeally want to work as, and it's not 5 years free like it usually is, It's 1 year but it's a bit expensive (for me). After that I'll be certified interior designer. 1 year distance education feels like NOTHING compared to the normal university here.

Should I give it my all and really try with this, even though I will lose a lot of money now and I have to get a dead end job to be able to study at the same time?

My confidence has grown so much that I think I can do this and turn myself into something great, and not be stuck in a dead end job for the rest of my life. This education opens up so many possibilities and it's really only for creative minds, which I certainly am. For the first time I feel hopeful about my future but, at the same time I'm still not sure.",25Nov2019,1
473,"So, some context, I was diagnosed with being a bit depressed, I have alot of dark thoughts and this friend of mine I met online 3 years ago, she has been with me through my ups and downs and I havent been able to help her much with her problems even if I did try hard.

We usually roleplayed... ALOT... every day, it was alot of fun, but lately the last couple of months to a year as my parents wore getting divorced and I was being an emotional wreck, my conversations with her started becoming really bad, because I wasnt ok, I still am not ok, she knows all about this, and im affecting her with all this, because she suffers too with mental health where her hewd thinks a part of her body is hurting BADLY but in reallity is not, she is trying to treat herself and she is faily ok, still not fully alright but better.

But the last days it happened again, I had two mental breakdowns where i was just crying and wanting to kill myself, and our rps flopped again, its been stressful to keep them up, my characters keep turning into pussies as she puts it, and we cant have ships without them ruining the rp (It was our thing, we used to ship alot of characters together and it was fun... at least for me, I dont know anymore about her, she wont answer me well enough for me to understand).

I try to talk to her but It's all being so bad... she is sick of me forgetting stuff, we have nothing to talk about and she doesnt wanna do rps anymore because they end up sucking.

So, first question, what should I do to save our friendship? I truly dont feel well at all with the thought of us breaking it, we talk every day, It's almlst religious, she is one of the reasons I am still alive...

And second, how can we better our rps? How can I make my characters straight, not too straight we like gay characters alot, I mean not turn them into pussies because I make them really soppy stories and edgy, It's stupid.

475,"I'm not quite sure how to put this together, but I'll do my best to explain what I'm feeling right now.

English isn't my main language, please forgive me if I made mistakes here and there in my possibly messy post.

I'm currently 19 years old. I come from Indonesia, my ancestors are chinese immigrants. My family isn't crazy rich, but still makes enough to get by. My parents broke up around 10 years ago, and I ended up living with my mom. I still keep in contact with my dad every now and then. 

I procrastinate a hell lot. I think I have decent grades throughout my early teens but I hate studying.

I'm currently a sophomore in university, and I'm studying overseas in Taiwan. I major in computer science. I'm an introvert, but I still have few friends, although I'm not really close to them. Hell, even sometimes I feel so fake when I'm with them. I'm acquainted with a lot of people though. Here comes one of my problems, I used to enjoy programming, but I may have lost that spark of interest and right now, I feel close to no enjoyment finishing assignments. They feel like a chore sometimes. Drop out? I would have nothing to shift to and I would feel guilty towards my parents, so I thought that I must power through, at least until I graduate. My grades are certainly dropping, but I have lost the will to care about them, I'll just try my best to pass for now.

Dreams? Motivation? Aspirations? I don't have any. This is the main problem, and I'm desperate to obtain one, although I don't think it'll be that simple. I feel empty. I want to be successful in life, but I think it is too general of a statement to count as one of the three above. 

I have a lot of interests, it's laughable to look at, but it's true, I just like a lot of things simultaneously. I'm just a curious person.

To top it off, I love playing computer games, but I recently started to doubt myself with the sentence ""what if I'm just playing games as an escape from reality? The same reason as to why some people do drugs?"". My family have always kind of view games as a bad influence to us, so I guess it affected my mentality a bit? Even so, I still play a lot of games.

I like music. I've always wanted to learn the guitar and piano. I can't afford courses, but self learning is an option, so I'm currently saving up for a guitar. Using computer to play with music also seems interesting but I don't think I've reached that level yet.

Other computer skills, such as photo and video editing, have recently came to my interests, and I plan to pick it up (at least the basics) by the start of next month. I have a slight worry that it'll end up like my interest to programs, but I hope that it doesn't, because the feeling sucks.

Cooking seems fun to me, but my rented room has no kitchen, so there's nothing I can do about it. If there are alternatives to learn cooking, please do tell.

Although I have all these interests, what should I do now? I'm running out of time, and the thought of sitting in an office doing something that I don't enjoy from 9-5 is kind of frightening.

I'm not sure if I'm currently on the crossroads of my life, or on a path that's leading to a dead end. I want to get these feelings off my chest but I've always been bad at expressing myself. 

I don’t even know, is this a plea for help or advice? I want some kind of outside intervention to help me somehow, I know in the end I’ll have to make the changes myself, but it may lead to failure. I feel dumb, I feel that I've trapped myself, but I didn't put in effort to free myself from it, and just stay put and accept everything that's thrown to me.

TL;DR: I'm an idiot who can't get myself together, no dreams, no aspirations, no motivation. Empty. I don't think I'm depressed, but I may be getting depressed. I don't know. I need help.",25Nov2019,1
476,There have been other formals at my school that I haven’t gone to because I want to save my own formal for the first one I go to. I’ve heard people talk about the formals and they sound awful. The awards especially sound degrading and rude. There’s an award for “top shagger” which basically is just slut shaming girls. There’s another for “most depressed” which is just shaming people who have been going through a lot of shit. There’s also “most hated” and “most forgettable.” It’s fucking sickening me how these people find this funny. Just humiliating these people on days that are meant to be enjoyed. I don’t get it.

477,"At first I just wanted to do whatever I could to help, but now I'm freaking out. It's just hit me how huge of a responsibility this is. I was chosen for this because I don't have a job and I've got a lot of time on my hands. I also don't want to let anyone down and I want to help my family as much as I can whilst we mourn.

I (F23) live with my fiancé (M23) and my parents in my family home. My parents have had this house for over 15 years. I met my partner at uni and once we graduated we moved in with my family (about a year ago). We've been trying to save up to find a place of our own ever since.

Logically, moving out and into a house with my fiancé is what I want to do. It should be so exciting but I'm so terrified. I'm worried I've just made a huge mistake.

First off, it means I'll be spending most of December away from my family, and this is the first Christmas we'll all be spending at home since my mum had her stroke. I'll be away from my sister, my parents, my cat; I don't know if I'm ready to be away from them. I don't have a job but my partner does and he'll need me to drive him to and from his workplace because this house is a lot further away than my parents house.

We're going to be living in my Great Aunt's house for up to 6 months, maybe less if the house sells sooner. It's a long time to be away from home but I don't know if it's long enough to feel 'at home' in a house that doesn't belong to us. I was there today to visit my Great Aunt's daughter (she's staying there at the moment but lives in Ireland so can't stay) and it was lovely to see her but being in the house felt strange. It's a gorgeous house and has an amazing garden but I found it so hard picturing myself living there and going about day to day life.

I'm just so nervous. I don't feel ready to say goodbye to my Great Aunt and I'm not ready to leave home. I know I should be, but I'm not and I don't know why. I want to know what I can do to make this less terrifying for myself. I need to do this but I also need to be able to cope with this. It's not a situation I ever thought I'd have to deal with.",25Nov2019,1

480,"I'll preface by saying that I haven't even had a week between the relationship ending and this exact moment in time, we broke up peacefully, but things turned sour as she decided that she didn't want me to be near ""her"" friends anymore, saying she never had friends before and doesn&amp;apos;t want to lose them to me.

I told her that it was a childish point of view, that I don't intend to put them against her in any way and that we met these people together, so no one was ""more friends"" with them than the other, that they are not anyone's property either and a lot of other stuff, she not only kept her point of view, she also tried to act superior to me, which really soured and counter-acted any sorrow I had from the breakup as she was treating me really bad while I tried to always be respectful.

Fast forward to the weekend and I'm talking to some random people from my town when I get to know this one girl who seemed to take an interest in me, we exchanged numbers and started talking through whatsapp. She is way above the really low standard that I try to keep, and she has took real interest in the troubles that I have just as much as I took in hers, so I feel this could become something.

Problem is: I don't know if I'm ready for another leap, I'm not very emotional and as such it tends to take a while for things to get to me, so I haven't even had time to feel lonely, to think about what I did right and what I did wrong. Talking to this girl gives me anxiety as I'm not very confident either and everything I do feels like it could annoy, bore or whatever else that's bad.

And to top it off, I want to try new, different things too, to enjoy life a little more, because things have been, even before the breakup, generally bad, just complete and utter boredom with work, housework, family, etc, and this new person has been upfront about trying new stuff herself, so there's that too.

Should I take this chance?

481,"I am 19, male. Here’s a backstory about me so you can make an idea of what I am confronting with.

For as long as I can remember I’ve been passionate about computers and tech. I also loved the automatisation that certain gadgets can bring. I was playing games, started to modify their files and customize the game to my desire. I’ve even developed some cheats for games by myself(self taught programming).
When I reached the age of 16 I got into fitness. I loved it but I didn’t leave the tech part, I was doing it as a hobby. I’ve also built my own website where I promote and keep my audience up to date to the things that I do and the progress that I’ve made. I am making customized game servers for certain games, I have a great community. I also make websites, script and develop scripts that make things easier. Recently I’ve been working on a project, a smart touchscreen mirror that is compatible with Alexa.
I’ve eventually finished high school and with the pressure of my parents I got into the top level university of physiotherapy in my country with a scholarship. After half a year in, I feel like I don’t do what I really want. I’ve joined this university for the sake of my parents because they don’t really conceive  that their son doesn’t have a college degree. (My family is full of doctors/lawyers)
The thing is that I am still passionate about fitness but not as a thing to do for a living. I love doing tech stuff and I’ve been thinking for the past week to leave the university and do this server/smart automatisation/IT for a living. I already have a big client that’s a lawyer who pays me to make his website.  University takes so much time from me and is so hard to keep up with the things that I want to do.

Tl&amp;dr: I am very passionate about tech stuff and I also do some developing but got into a top level university where I don’t do what I really like. 

What should I do? Leave university and do this full time and dedicate myself to it? Or leave it as it is and see what the future got for me? If I leave, how do I tell my parents that?",25Nov2019,1

But I tried my dress on yesterday and cried last night because I’m not excited about it (I’m even considering going shopping again at this point). I never thought I would plant roots, so while I have gotten excited about the house we are looking at, I can tell there’s an underlying fear inside of me. I think I’ve realized that I need a different career or a different path to go on, but idk what to do, and I don’t know how many steps back I would have to take to get to the same pay in a different field/area (I’m in IT). I also have really heavy imposter syndrome with this job. In addition, I’ve decided (after many therapy sessions) that for my mental health I need to create boundaries with certain members of my family. 

This is probably the first time that I’m actually focusing on what I want and what I need and I don’t know how to actually do that. I’m starting to feel overwhelmed by it all and I’m scared that my insecurities about some things are bleeding into other aspects of my life even though there’s nothing really “wrong”.

483,"On Saturday, I looked over my mom's shoulder while she was on the phone and saw her text messages with an unsaved number saying ""I love you"" and then the person texted her something that she later convey to someone else. For clarity, let's say she said  ""John told me that there is a shoe sale tomorrow"". I later asked my Dad who ""John"" is because I didn't recognize the name and he said it's one of my mom's coworkers. I can't imagine a context in which it would be appropriate to text a coworker ""I love you"" so I think she must be having an affair. There are other factors that add to my suspicion: 1. My mom always reacts pretty extremely when she thinks I'm looking at her phone screen. 2. My mom has been encouraging me to move out lately and seems unhappy with my decision to live with them for half of next year. Her reasoning is that ""I seem unhappy here"" but now I'm wondering if it's because she wants me to leave so she can also leave. I'm unsure of how to proceed with this suspicion. Should I ask my mom about it? Is that my place? Is that a good idea considering the repercussion might be that they would separate? I might have decided to just ignore it if it weren't for the fact that my parent's relationship is awful and laden with emotional abuse and I don't think it's right for my dad to endure that for/with someone who is disloyal to him. My current plan right now is to just ask my mom if she's having an affair and explain why I think she is. But, I'm not sure I would actually have the courage to do that (my relationship with my mom isn't great) and I don't know what I will do if she answers yes.

485,"Alright, there's a bit of a story as to why she blocked me.

I know this girl for almost 10 years. We went to the same elementary school. We weren't exactly friends or close or anything like that, but we didn't dislike each other. At some point we lost all contact, until a few nights ago.

It was rather late and I was bored. All my friends were offline except her. So I send her a message and she responds. We chat for some time and everything seems to go great.

A day ago I message her and ask her is she wants to go out and a grab a drink with me. She responds sure. And we continue chatting. But the conversation turns very sexual. And I'm not even kidding, she's the one who starts it. I was sure that she was messing with me, but I decided to play along. Out of nowhere she asks for a dick pick. In fact she was quite persistent about me sending her a picture. Now, I don't really like taking photos of myself anyways, but for 40 minutes she was practically begging me to send her one. What's interesting was that she wanted me to show my face in that picture. She said to prove it was me and not me sending her a random photo from the internet. I didn't want to show my face because I didn't know where this photo could end up. 

I decided to send the photo. However, I took a piece of paper and wrote her name on it and took the photo and sent it. That piece of paper proves it to be genuine. Not 10 seconds later she blocks me on all social media.

I was disappointed by the outcome, but not really all surprised. 

The problem comes here. Me and her often go out and hang in the same place (A bar that my friend works at) and I'll most likely be seeing her there sooner or later. What should I do? When I see her should I go and try to say hello or just ignore her?

The thing is, I'm not really mad at her or anything like that. None forced me to send to send that picture, it was entirely my choice. And maybe she just didn't like what she saw? Who knows?

What should I do?

Most of my course leaders and lecturers seem to think I'm doing well but there is certain parts of my course that I feel are just impossible for me, for example,  interviewing anyone which is a pretty important thing for a journalist, and I don't have the confidence to write much in my spare time or post things online. I don't feel like I have any real chance of getting through this course. 

The problem is that if I do fail or drop out I don't know what to do. I've never had a job, the anxiety makes me feel so afraid of most jobs, and I don't know what kind of jobs I could even get or how I could get them. Also, if I did drop out of Uni I can't imagine that's going to help my already bad mental state.

As it stands I currently work retail at two different shops but that's ALL I do. I spend maybe half the week working and the other half at home fucking around on my computer. 

Broke up with my girlfriend a couple months ago and only see friends on occasion as I live quite a distance from them. I don't drive due to my epilepsy at the moment. I'm vaguely trying to wake up earlier and go on regular walks because my fitness is deteriorating.

I've always wanted a job in uniform but was rejected by the Navy a few months back due to the fact that I am still taking medication for my epilepsy. I am also going on a working holiday to the United Kingdom in March for up to a year. I honestly have no idea what I'm going to do when I get back, I'm hoping I gain some perspective while I'm abroad.

I've also been thinking about the police force as it is another job in uniform which I've put serious thought into as you only need to be two years seizure free to be eligible for in my state. I'm extremely lost right now. I see all my friends from school and uni nearing their graduation where it feels like just yesterday we were hanging out at school.

Every day, I shower by washing my hair with shampoo and then my upper body with body wash. I wash my legs, genitals, and anal region twice with the same body wash. After showering, I thoroughly dry off with a towel that is cleaned weekly. Next, I apply antiperspirant to my underarms and put on clean clothes. Then I brush my teeth and am out the door for the day. 

I don't see anything I am missing hygienically. Is there something else I should do? Are their other ways to minimize and prevent body odor? Thank you for any advice!",25Nov2019,1
500,"Hi, 

I’m a student and I live with all girls. We rented this house under the premise that no men are allowed and I thought it was a good deal as I have had recent bad experiences that living with only women makes me feel safer.  Under no circumstances are guests allowed to stay, and I’m sure the landlord has told neighbors to keep an eye out as this is a family residential area and we are the only student house. 

We all have separate rooms and a large kitchen, living room, and dining room, alongside 3 bathrooms. 

One roommate, let’s call her E, is notorious for inviting people to stay over, although she has blatantly told me “we are not allowed to have guests”, which I already knew as per our contract. In the 3 months we have been here, she has had about 6 guests. She does not request our permission or ask if we would be ok with it, she just informs us via text that a “friend” is coming to stay. 

Her boyfriend has just stayed with us for a week, and yesterday he returned to his country. Also yesterday, she brought a random man over for drinks and he stayed in her room. 

Last week, she informed us via text that a “friend” of hers will be staying with us. I didn’t reply to the text but the other roommates did, saying ok. This woman was sleeping in our living room, and using our utilities. I didn’t speak to her because she seemed to ignore the rest of us, and I noticed my roommate also didn’t speak to her. Strange.  If they are friends, why would they not hang out together or talk?

I made the discovery today that E has a Couchsurfing Profile and people have left reviews (including the woman who stayed last week), saying what a lovely host E and how welcoming and clean her home is. 

She is putting the other 3 roommates in danger by inviting strangers into our apartment just because she wants to meet “locals” and practice the local language. She can do that in a bar or wherever. 

E has not lifted a finger to clean since she moved in, it has been 100% me. She won’t even clean cooking messes she herself makes or follow our cleaning schedule. This irked me. When she is not here for a few days at a time, the house remains clean. When I clean the kitchen, within an hour she destroys it. 

So essentially she is “subletting” (Couchsurfing is free, so I use this term loosely) our apartment which we pay to live in and to have use of the utilities. 

I am thinking of telling the landlord. Should I talk to her first and find out why she has done something so sneaky?

I don’t know what to do, do I approach her first and talk to her about it or go directly to the landlord? I am not a confrontational person and it would hurt me to tell the landlord.",25Nov2019,1

503," This has been eating away at me for the past year, and I feel like I finally need to make a decision.

 

TL;DR Within the last year, my brother-in-law has been sexually and emotionally abusive to my older sister, and a lot of my family are either oblivious or passive. My younger sister doesn’t know anything and has a positive image of him, and I’m considering telling her a few of the things that have happened. But I’m not sure if the abuse is even still going on so I’m scared of giving her a bad image of him when the situation could be over.

&amp;#x200B;

I have 3 siblings: There’s the oldest sister (24), my brother (22), me (20F), and my younger sister (16). We grew up as a fundamentalist Christian homeschool family in the southern US. My family is basically southern Baptist, although I deconverted and am now atheist.

My family was super into purity culture and was always weird about dating. Basically that meant none of my siblings dated in high school. When she was 20, my older sister met a man who became her first boyfriend. They dated and were very serious about their relationship.

Two years goes by and they want to get married. They set the wedding for early summer of 2018. My older sister and I were both at home that year for chronic illness reasons. So naturally, neither of us being able to do much school or work, we got really close and built up a lot of trust.

 That spring of 2018, she opened up to me about her relationship problems. She said they were engaging in pre-marital sex (something she already felt guilt over because she’s Christian), and that he had pushed her boundaries. She was hesitant to use the word rape, but the more she talked about it the more she began using that word. And when she went into detail about what happened, I concurred. She was definitely the victim of a date rape situation.

However, she “forgave” him and wanted to stay in the relationship. I thought she should break up, but I didn’t want to be controlling. She was an adult and I trusted that she could make her own decisions. I should add that I was 18 at the time and was incredibly naïve, as I was isolated my whole life and indoctrinated into conservative Christian teaching.

She talked about how they just needed to hurry up and get married, and how their long-distance relationship was messing everything up. Unfortunately, I believed her and, although I cautioned her that rape is extremely serious, I also wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt that she knew what she was doing. 

Around this time both my parents and my brother found out about the first instance of rape. They all agreed it was serious but were also very passive about it. Being Christians, they were quick to forgive and overlook what had happened, trusting everything was part of “God’s plan.” Not to mention that he appeared to be a very strong believer. He’s a pastor’s son and is in seminary to be a pastor himself.

&amp;#x200B;

So he and my older sister got married. And everything went to hell.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically my older sister was only confiding in me. She has trust issues and since I was so passive about all her problems she thought I was a great person to get advice from. I was not.

She told me about their honeymoon, how they were having very rough sex and how she thought she must be on her period. She was not. She eventually admitted she was bleeding from abuse.

They both have high sex drives and had agreed to have sex twice a day. However, him being stronger and being sexually repressed for so long meant that he was raping her every day. Multiple times a day. He didn’t spend time to give her pleasure. He didn’t want lubrication. He just continually raped her day after day.

She made tons of excuses for him and tried to laugh it off. She told me that he “has a sadistic side” with a chuckle. She told me that he woke her up one night and threw her into a scalding hot shower and was “laughing sadistically the whole time.” I told her she should call the cops.

I told her over and over again that it was domestic abuse and that she needed help. Around this time I started having a nervous breakdown. Being the only person she was confiding these things to meant that I carried the weight of everything she told me all on my own. I started having intense anxiety attacks and told her that I couldn’t do this anymore.

So, with the overhanging news that I would no longer be available for advice, she decided to tell him that I knew what he did.

Apparently he became furious. After he cooled down, she told me that he apologized for hurting her and that he told her she should stop telling other people about their “sex life.”

So she stopped telling me anything. And honestly that was a relief because it was doing severe damage to my mental health.

After this, she said that “things are a lot better now.” Which sounds great…. except that I can’t really trust what either of them says. Especially since he knows about me now and could be controlling what information gets let outside.

Things might be slightly better than they were, but that doesn’t mean things are good. I have no way of knowing if things are still bad or not. However, when he is over visiting, he seems to be pretty controlling and doesn’t seem to respect her, which does make me suspect there could still be abuse going on.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my current problem:

Everyone in my family acts like nothing ever happened. They use “God’s plan” as a crutch and just “forgive” him for everything he’s done. Mind you, only me and my mom know about the marital rape. My dad and brother just know about the date rape.

My younger sister doesn’t know any of this. She loves our brother-in-law, likes to hang around him and joke about him and overall has a very positive image of him. She knows I don’t like him and try to avoid him and our sister, but she doesn’t know why. 

And I’m wondering if I should tell her. I know there’s a trend in Christian circles to not expose abuse, which leads to the abuser hurting more people. Do I think he is a danger to her? I don’t know. And that’s the problem. 

If I knew for absolute certain that he was still abusing our older sister, I would tell my younger sister in a heartbeat. But I don’t know for sure. What if he actually has changed his ways and is trying his best to do better? Would I be slandering him by telling my younger sister about bad things he’s done? Do I have the right to expose some things he’s done when my sister told me these things in confidentiality? 

At the same time, what if he’s not a safe person? Should he even be around children? I hate to assume, but he’s already done some heinous things. I guess what I’m trying to say is I’m not just concerned about my younger sister’s safety, but what could happen to others if she trusts him.

So my current idea is to tell her some things that have happened, and not tell her any assumptions. Just tell her the plain true facts and not let my imagination of his character get carried away. 

However, I’m aware that I’m still extremely naïve and really need outside input. 

Anyone have any advice or insight?",25Nov2019,1
504,"I'll keep this short; my 55-year-old mother is beginning to show early signs of diminished mental faculties. To put it mildly, she is forgetful.

Stories she's told a hundred times (typical mom behavior) now have major details changed, like she's misremembering where/who/when. She sometimes cries hysterically and doesn't know why. It's hard to witness.

506,"So my boyfriend and I have been together for almost two years now. Ever since I learned that he hooked up with another girl when we had already started seeing each other (over a year ago), I can’t seem to trust him as much and I tend to let my insecurities get the best of me - starting arguments, thinking about worst possible scenarios, and thinking how I am not good enough. 

For example, a bad toxic habit I picked up since then was checking on his following on instagram, and profiles of random girls he follows and like - I know this is brain poison and I’m trying not to do this. But at times I get super insecure when he’s out and my mind started to think if he’s talking to other girls or making moves, so I started feeling super insecure and checking his ig religiously. However, I do wanna improve and change for the sake of our current relationship. 

Things are going quite well but I’m scared we’re at a turning point.  We occasionally fight because I feel like I’m not good enough, or that I think about what if I’m another girl (like one of the girls he follow) and that he would treat me better, etc.  When my emotions get the best of me, I tend to blow up and bring up old issues like the girl he hooked up while he was seeing me at the time and so on.

The difficult thing is, we are currently doing LDR til end of year. So I do want to keep this relationship healthy and stable til I see him again.

528,"There were four very drunk people and six sober or pretty much sober people. One guy in particular was struggling to walk and we got to the bus stop and he was vomiting and I was looking after him and others saw how much of a mess he was. 

Four people then decided to go on the bus to the leavers party area anyway and the only people left were three sober people, a drunk girl having a mild panic attack but pretty much fine and me and the guy with alcohol poisoning. I applied first aid and was made to call an ambulance at the same time even though three others could’ve. 

Those three people left with the girl with the very minor ‘panic attack’ without telling me and left me there. At that stage the paramedics told me to get him on the bus to the party area where there would be first aid specifically for alcohol induced teens. I struggled to carry the guy but another school friend helped a bit. Then I stayed with the guy with alcohol poisoning who was in and out of consciousness. 


I know my first aid well and felt with him well. That’s fine I don’t mind taking care of people and I am going to pursue a medical career. However I was obviously angry at all my friends for leaving me. 

Even worse. I got home and all the people who had left me were there and had the nerve to yell at me for saying a sassy remark about the guy ‘being fine with no thanks to them for ditching us’. That’s all I said. I feel like I should’ve yelled at them and said a lot more but that was enough for them to yell at me and a guy grabbed my arm and pulled me when I tried to go to my room because they had put the panicked girl in there.

I also later found all there half eaten ice cream bowls in the front room as they’d been watching movies and eating ice cream which I bought(obviously not too worried about me or the other guy).

Then they all went to bed and I was the only one who stayed up to wait for the guy to get home from medical.

534,"For my university, CS graduation requirements are based on # of credits, so I have the option of graduating in 7 academic terms vs the regular 8 academic terms, allowing me to graduate after spring 2020 (finish school in August 2020) vs winter 2021 (finish school in April 2021).

I am currently headed to an internship at Microsoft (in Seattle) as a Software Engineering Intern and I've heard the chance of receiving a return offer for fulltime is very high (basically you are almost guaranteed a fulltime offer, unless you goof off).

However, otherwise, I also have the option of tacking on another internship after Microsoft, which would enable me to gain more experience/perspective and also give me potentially more leverage to negotiate for fulltime with a counter-offer. I've already done a few internships, so I have some diversity of experience, but I feel that Microsoft will help me get a higher response rate for my final internship (if I were to choose to graduate normally) and therefore have a greater chance of moving into a better job.

On paper, graduating early appears to be the optimal choice - I get to save on tuition and get a legup in the workforce by starting fulltime earlier. However, I am still unsure on how beneficial graduating early would actually be. I'm not in any particular rush to finish school and disrupting the normal timeline would mean I am separated from my friends and connections I've formed in university - if I graduate early, I feel that my social life would definitely take a hit, which was never the best in the first place, but would be worse if I leave the university environment early. There are still many things in university I have yet to try out and I will never be immersed in this environment again. As well, I am unclear on how ready I am to navigate the ""real world"" in merely half a year from now and think that another year would help me mature more.

536,"Apologies in advance for the unnecessarily long post. I know the title makes this whole thing seem pretty self-explanatory. The issue is that I’m really not a confrontational person at all, in fact I hate confrontation so much that I will actively avoid it at all costs. I’d rather just suck it up instead of saying anything. This often leads to me getting taken advantage of, as is the case with washing dishes. 

I live with 3 other girls, 2 of which are my close friends, but they’re definitely closer with each other than I am with either of them. 1 of them was my roommate last year, and we never had an issue allocating responsibilities; she always kept things clean, even more than I would, so I’m not sure why it’s gone entirely downhill this year. The 3rd girl is almost never here, and when she is, she literally barely ever eats/uses any dishes or silverware, but when she does she always washes them right after she uses them.

With that said, the 2 roommates I’m close with almost NEVER wash their dishes, or even throw away their trash for that matter. Not only is this becoming increasingly frustrating, but it’s honestly downright disgusting at this point. 

They’ll cook rice in a pot and leave the leftovers on the stove for weeks on end, legit until mold starts forming and someone else (me) takes the initiative to throw it out. Dishes will pile up in the sink until no clean ones are left, and it’s always me who takes care of it. I’ve only ever seen them load and start the dishwasher twice between the 2 of them. 

You’d think that since I’m the only one who constantly loads the dishwasher, they’d be kind enough to unload it and put everything away, but no. Not only do I have to wash all the dishes, but I have to put every single one away by myself. 

I should probably just end my rant now, as I’m sure you get the point. It’s really annoying and honestly hurtful. I feel used, but I’m so bad at standing up for myself and I don’t know what to say or do.

And now, two days ago all of a sudden she popped into my mind and I immediately started shaking and finding her attractive...it wasn't lust, it was happiness first then sadness then just nothing and it is repeating.

I thought I was just horny but honestly, post-nut clarity isn't helping either. Truth be told I haven't had sex in two years - I got so disappointed in my ex I lost all interest in dating or even looking at women as sexual partners. I am told I am relatively good looking and funny and I can usually talk with anyone. Now if I think of her I just get anxious.

Those of you who had a sudden feeling of ""having a crush"" (for the lack of a better phrase) what was it really? I don't know what to make out of the emotions. I am positive I am going to meet this group again and I will talk to her but until then I am afraid this sudden surge of emotions is a herald of some deeper mental issues rather than having a crush because I am always in check, even if I drink but now...I don't know. It feels like I lost all balance all of a sudden without any previous signs.",25Nov2019,1

540,"I (23M) may come off as an asshole here.

I lost a lot of weight recently and now considered good looking. Now I'm getting a lot of attention from women, and when I've been out to clubs, I've had lots of women aggressively hit on me, pretty obviously saying sexual things too. Also on Tinder, they've been upfront.

Now I'm no incel, I don't hate women and I can see why they weren't attracted to me.before, but since this has happened, **I'm feeling a lot of Nihilism, essentially a lot of meaninglessness**.

I feel meaninglesness from this. It's not destructive or anything, but sometimes I feel a low level of annoyance towards these women.

At the risk of sounding pretentious, **I feel like Superman from Man of Steel (2013).** He is gifted with great power but sees it as a burden. 

I'm not one of these guys who can have a good time with these girls and be grateful. I see it as a burden because I feel nihilism.since it started.happening. Why should I be happy and smiling? I've had sex with some of them.but only for the pleasure.

542,"I've been dating my boyfriend for nearly 8 months now and he's a great guy and my first relationship and I'm his too. Everytime we go out he always says at least once or twice, 'damn, look at her titties' or 'shes so hot etc. And usually I'm not the type to care because most of the time he'll point them out and I'll pretty much say the same thing, because, women have to appreciate other women and hype them up, its how I've always been.

But lately, its been getting to me, we went out with with a few friends the other night and someone pointed out the necklace i got him (he said he wanted something for his chain to look not plain) it was a silver and gold cross. The friend looked at it went 'thats cool are you Christian or something?' or something like that and my boyfriend, instead of just answering straight proceeded to talk smack about it and say it was ugly. Obviously I got upset and really angry and he kept apologizing and hugging me infront of everyone saying he didnt mean it but i kept telling him not to touch me. Also throughout the night he kept making comments on other girls about their boobs, saying how big they were or making comments about their outfits and how 'slutty and revealing' they were, which he loves but i dont wear that stuff because im not confident in wearing stuff like that because of my weight and insecurities. I got mad and told him I was going home, he came with me, not wanting to leave me alone, my friend drove us home, she knew id KILL him if we were alone. When she dropped us off, i just ran into the house and cried, and he didnt even know what he had done either, it did take about an hr for him to sober up and realize what he did and he apologized and we spoke about it a little before falling asleep.

Fast forward to the morning after, I spoke to him again about it, the comments about the other girls, and this dickhead, his reponse to me about it was, word for word, 'Babe, I'm a 24 year old male, we have needs.' I honestly wanted to break up with him right there, i got so angry and told him that was the most stupidest and f***** up excuse in the world and left the room.

Now we've had these conversations in the past, because I have brought them up before and he says that even though he makes those comments, those girls wouldn't make him happy, because he's happy with me, and I dont think he'd ever cheat on me, and i do trust him.

I also spoke to my friends (they are more mine than his) from that night, all said the same thing, 'I dont think he realized that him talking made you angrier, it was most likely the alcohol because he does adore you.' But that's just not a good enough excuse for me. I should be enough for his 'needs', he shouldnt be doing this to me and it affects my mental health.

Look, i really dont know what to do, i Love him and i want to sort it out but it seems like everytime we talk, he doesnt listen. Help me out people of reddit.

543,"I want to start this by saying I am really forgiving when it comes to gender differences. I usually give people the benefit of the doubt and if there’s a reasonable explanation, I usually tend to believe it rather than assuming things are sexist by nature. This is my first encounter with something like this that is actually really messing with my head. 

We were out for a senior lab member’s birthday and talking about how awkward my PI is when my lab mate said, “A few years ago, (PI) was showing another PI around the floor because she was interviewing for faculty. She noticed our lab had only men and (PI) said ‘yeah I hired them all when I was first starting out. And being a new PI, I couldn’t really afford to make any mistakes’”

544,"It is difficult for me to find romantic partners that I actually want to date long term. That part is fine; I know finding an amazing partner will take some time, and I think I know how to facilitate the process. But I seem to have this like...need for a romantic connection. I have dated a string of partners that were more out of convenience than anything else, and I consistently found myself getting bored and ending the relationship. It's a lot of drama that bears no long term fruit.

So I'm being patient and meeting new people, but right now my heart aches and I feel lonely. I'm 25, overall I'm really happy, and I struggle with insecurity. I have friends, hobbies, and a job that I really enjoy. I even have a fwb (though I don't see her often) and two people I trade massages with. I journal, write poetry, and meditate.

547,"Firstly, some background - I am a software engineer, working as a 'mid-level' developer. I guess I am a 'difficult' employee, I've made some mistakes in letting my personal life and depression affect my work, etc. Also I've been told my communication skills are not so great. At least, I think I am good at getting my tasks done, I also try to help my coworkers, and I try hard to better my communication skills.

&amp;#x200B;

I was recently passed over for promotion but I got a salary increase. I let my manager 'Alice' know that I am feeling underappreciated because I think I am already taking more responsibility than my role requires and that I'd be happy to take even more responsibility because I'd like to advance in my career.

&amp;#x200B;

I am working on a very demanding and stressful project that often requires long working hours and I am having a hard time managing a work-life balance. Also recently I got in some sort of a conflict with my manager Alice because of the working hours. She said I may be labeled as a slacker if I don't work long hours along with the others and then she denied she had said it. Admittedly, it may have been a miscommunication. She's also helping me take more responsibility in a visible way, as I had asked her.

&amp;#x200B;

In particular, I'm seeking advice because this morning I heard my coworker 'Bob' telling other coworkers in the kitchen that he has been merging code. Then another coworker was joking about merging with Bob. I get the idea he's been saying so to everyone who'd listen.

&amp;#x200B;

In truth, I had proposed we'd do a git merge instead of manual copy/paste (don't ask). Also I had done the git merge mostly by myself and Bob contributed by helping me resolve the merge conflicts, e.g. telling me which parts of the code he wrote we should keep. I had asked another coworker Charlie for advice on merging because it was the first time I had done a git merge. So I have screenshots with Bob telling me he doesn't want to do the merging, then with me asking Charlie for advice, and then with me asking Bob for a call to help resolve the merge conflicts.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I right to think Bob is taking credit for work he's been only helping me with? Should I tell something to my manager Alice?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to 'rat' on Bob. I don't know how that would reflect on me. Bob is generally agreeable, though he's often slacking off. I want to have a good working relationship with him. At the same time, I feel that I am not getting enough credit for my work as it is.",25Nov2019,1

Then while looking around this girl side eye glances at me then starts making her way though the crowd towards me. She points at me and extends her arm and I confusedly do the same to pull each other closer. Because of the loud music she leans in and tells me “your the cutest guy I’ve ever seen.” I was honestly take aback, I didn’t know how to respond. She was really pretty. I complimented her back.

552,"To make this as easy to read as possible I'll be brief. 

A very, very close friend of mine recently moved to the other side of the world with his wife. Before he left he introduced me to his little brother (16). 

His brother (we'll call him Alex), took a sort of shine to me while we were all hanging out together, he was interested in all my hobbies and wanted to learn from me, I was more than happy to help, while showing him some of my work I caught a glimpse of a scar or two on his arm, it was brief but they definitely looked self inflicted, I would know, at 16 I did the exact same thing (I'm now 25).
My friend asked me if I could keep an eye out for Alex and make sure he's looked after and doesn't get led astray by negative influences etc. I made a promise that I would, it was an emotional goodbye. 

I don't often get to see Alex because I live away from my hometown now, but whenever I visit I check to see if he's free, often our schedules don't work out, one night when my own brother had some friends round he messaged to say he was free, he came over and we had a few drinks but we didn't get to talk too much because of the other people in the room, we talked about very general things (yes I regret not taking him elsewhere for a one on one talk).
Anyway, I'm heading home today for a while and he's coming to see me for a catch up in a couple of days, we'll be alone and I want to take this chance to get him to open up a bit. 
The problem is I'm really bad at these sorts of things, I'm that very typical masculine guy that's terrible at opening up personally so I have no skills or clue on how to get him to do it, or where to even start or how to bring it up or anything. My stomach always twists up during emotional conversations so I tend to avoid them.

I have bio oil in my backpack and a pack of elastic bands, these were things I used during my dark period, that's as far as my plan goes, this is how poorly equip I feel. Should I even be messing about with this? I've been there myself and I shared it with literally nobody and stopped self harming after a year, although I still keep bands close by after 10 years. 

Can anybody advise? 
Do I mention it/leave it, talk about my own experience? Am I being a complete idiot for thinking about mentioning it?

Now Ted is a really nice guy, he has his issues but overall I like him, however Karen is not. Karen really is a Karen, which is why I picked that name, so she really pisses me off sometimes.

I'm a busser so I'm already kinda low on the ranking chain but I do my best to make things go well. I try and go above and beyond for customers to make sure they come back. Karen for what ever reason hates this. This one lady comes in with 7 kids and orders a bunch of food, so she have a bunch of trays. 

We don't have severs so customers get food them selves. I was already out in the front checking tables and stuff and I notice she has more trays coming. I decided to take it to her and she thanks me and sits down to eat. When I get back behind the counter Karen chews me out saying ""You don't need to take food to customers, they can get it themselves you are a busser not a server"". I just said ok but that comment got to me.

562,"Hi Reddit. First things first - I want to preface this by saying I'm not feeling remotely suicidal at all, just feeling really lost with life right now, and could use *any* suggestions you have how to make things better. I'm just getting little joy from doing anything, and no fulfilment from my life/career. Sorry if this goes on a bit long, but I just want to give you the full picture of where I am right now.

So, about me. Turning 30 next year. I have always been someone that worries too much about random things. Live in London, home for me is about 3 hours away (much more rural). Good relationship with my parents, so very much enjoy going back to see them. London is quite hectic/fast paced compared to there - I came here about 9 years ago to study TV/Film, then worked jobs in that field since. Made various friends, from different walks of life. 

Back when it came to choosing a degree to study, I really didn't know what to do... my parents suggested (maybe hoped) something stable, like law, or accountancy. Problem was, I had a really tough time at school, not just personally, but also academically, so I didn't leave with the best grades. As such, though I did have an interest in TV/Film, it kind of felt like my best/only option. I enjoyed my studies, and did very well academically (though I felt a bit of a fraud, because it seemed quite easy to me compared to school). Finding work was tough - I initially started freelance, but after I didn't enjoy the uncertainty, went to work for an agency for about 6 years. A kind producer at an ad agency really took me under his wing, and I learned a lot from him, eventually specialising in a fairly unique part of it (the legal side). Can't say I enjoyed it particularly, but enjoyed being the guy who could be relied on for things. At the end of last year I went freelance (because things at the agency had changed, and they wouldn't budge to meet my fairly basic salary request). So I was doing the exact same role, but for myself, feeling like I knew it well enough to make a good living from it. It's been a rough first year of ups and downs, but is starting to show promise now. Ironically I went back to work at my old agency (but freelance, they needed me during a busy period), so it was nice to feel validated there.

Home wise, I've lived with flatmates before quite a bit, I've also lived on my own (or with a landlord, so effectively so). I've kind of gone between the two states (after living with flatmates for a while, decide it's time to live alone, do so, get lonely, want to live with flatmates again, repeat). Personal side of things, I haven't really been in anything you'd call a serious relationship. I've dated, just haven't found anyone I really have a connection with. As such, I've kind of lost interest in it TBH. I worried for too long if maybe I wasn't the right kind of person personality wise to attract a partner (I wouldn't say I'm unattractive, nor out of shape, but always wondered if that was why) - but have just started taking care of myself better, physically and mentally.

That brings me to this year. So, had started out freelance again, was living with some nice flatmates at the time. Come March time, I had a quite bad ski-ing accident. Jump went wrong, hit my head. I remember none of it, though according to my parents I came close to dying - but made a fairly full recovery (except short-term memory, but they said that will come in time). After I got back from the hospital, I went through a *really* heavy period of reflection - what makes me happy? Job, life, etc. I just didn't know. I honestly couldn't tell you what I'd do for fun. It occurred to me that my previous job had really become too much of a part of who I was. Which led me onto this real state of worry. I have no purpose.

At this time I was due to move into a new house with the current flatmates (and a couple more friends) - because I was so unsure at the time I said I'd move in wherever with them - but said I really didn't mind. They found a place, though it really wasn't anything like what I wanted - but because I said I'd move in (at least for a bit) I felt obliged to. But, I really panicked, and because I didn't know what I wanted, said I couldn't do it any more. It annoyed them initially, but they moved on without me. 

I found a place to live on my own with the intention of moving out at the start of next year, and maybe moving near home to do something else. But since then, things have got better (at least work wise), I have alright work stability, and I feel like I could keep going for a bit, and having friends to still see in London makes it worthwhile.

What started me on this whole train of though, was when I went to the old flatmate's new house yesterday to catch up, play some games, etc. And i realised how much I had missed it, and that I'd made a really big mistake. I miss living with friends. Obviously it's too late now to suddenly do a 180, they're settled in their new place, I'm settled temporarily in mine, (though ready to move on should the time come). Naturally I've come to regret not moving in with them, but at the time it just felt like too much.

The work is starting to come in more, so I could stay here. I do have friends here. I don't really want to be doing what I am for the rest of my life (even if I was making good money), so have started to explore what other careers I could parlay it into that are something similar - but can keep going for the time being. I've started seeing a psychiatrist to talk about my other issues (it's early days, but It's been a good move, I feel silly for putting it off for so long, thinking I didn't need it).

So, that's where I am. I have a place to live, a job to do, but it's just quite depressing at times. I have good days and bad days. I guess it can be quite a lonely existence - even if I do still see friends from time to time.

I just don't know how to fill those empty nights, I used to enjoy playing video games, or watching a good TV show or movie, but even that is of little interest to me as of late. I just sit there, browsing Reddit or Facebook, until it's time for bed. I feel like I'm wasting my life, the life I'm lucky to still have.

How can I find what I enjoy doing, both for work or pleasure? Should I leave this current career path, if it's not making me happy? Should I move on somewhere, and start fresh? Make new friends, a new career, a new life...? Some have suggested trying moving abroad for a year, has anyone had luck with that?

I saw some old school mates the other day at a friend's engagement party, and everyone there was the same. Either getting married, or progressing in leaps in their careers, or accomplishing great things. I know I shouldn't compare myself to them, but I find it hard not too.

I just feel like I'm drowning, and it's all getting a bit too much. Any thoughts, no matter how small, or what part it relates to, greatly appreciated.",25Nov2019,1

The thing I look to most is when I turn 18 and do whatever I need to pay for myself and not let ANYBODY beside my SO have any affect on my life or happyness. how can I be happy until I turn 18?",25Nov2019,1
567,"For starters, English is not my native language so sorry for any grammar incorrections. Now that we have that out of the way, hello, i am 18 years old (female) and to help you understand a little bit more i'm gonna tell u a bit about my childhood. My father was abusive, he harrased both me and my mother, physically, sexually and mentally but for quite some time my mother didn't want to leave him cuz she thought he was going to change (spoiler alert: he did not). I remember that a lot of times when my father was aggresive i would stand between him and my mom to try and protect her, i remember the times we had to run away, sometimes without any spare clothes, food or medicine. I think that made me and my mother very close, i dare to say now - too close.  Finally when i was 8 years old my mom got strong enough to divorce him. When i was about 13 years old i started noticing that something is wrong, soon enough i realised what it was - i am gay. And when i was with my first ""girlfriend"" (ofc it wasnt serious- we were literal children) dumb little me thought it was a great idea to tell my mother, she loves me she is going to accept me what could go wrong? Everything went wrong. She did not accept me, she started saying how dissapointed she is, crying that she wont have grand children and to this day she sometimes acts like i was straight (says things like when you find a husband etc). I remember her telling me that untill i move out i can't be in any relationship. Throught the years i had many crushes but not a single relationship, i was scared that i would be a dissapointment to my mother yet again. I still am. The problem is that about a year ago i met this great girl, very soon i discovered that she is an incredible friend that i really loved, about 5 months into knowing her i started to realise that i didn't love her only as a friend but also something more, didn't act on it though because she was in a relationship, a toxic one that hurt her but still in a relationship. A month ago she came over to my house for the first time and lemme tell you... something changed between us, i have NEVER felt so happy before that day. A week later it turns out she also likes me but she thought i was outta her league so she never told me before thinking that i wouldn't give her a chance and instead she stayed with that toxic girl cuz she was afraid of loneliness. Eventually she broke up with the abusive gf and i guess you could say we are kinda dating now. Two days ago she visited me and again it was one of the best days of my life. Recently my suicidal thoughts started appearing again, i also have more and more panic attacks almost every day and overall i feel like sh\*t (for the first time since my childhood im going to go to a psychologist, i have an appointment in the end of 2019) but when i see her can't imagine feeling better. I think i really love her. The problem is that i am totally scared that my mom will find out and be sad/mad/i dont really know. After the girls first visit my mom told me sth along the lines ""shes really loud"" and when i asked what she means she said she heard us talking about girls, i felt sick and when i went to my room i started crying and panicking again. Didnt sleep that night at all. I really want to be with that girl but i am so scared and so stressed, i can't eat, i can't sleep i feel really bad because of my mom. What do you think i should do? Try to forget about loving anyone so my mom can stay happy or try to make it right with that girl so both me and her can be happy? My mom is really important to me but i kinda want to start finally living for myself not for her. I will definitely talk about it at the psychologist apointment but its too far away in time for me now and i really need some advice or words of courage asap.",25Nov2019,1
568,"A friend of my best friends has become a big-headed brat. I used really enjoy spending time with the 2 of them but lately her friend has become really stuck up and full of herself. She only talks about how amazing she is and how much she's accomplishing while putting other people down in the process. I'm happy for her and all she's done for herself at age 22 but I'm tired of hearing her talk badly about people because they're struggling in their journey to success or don't have the same opportunities that she has.

570,"I'm a freethinker.

My very religious aunt died some time ago. Her teenage children, also raised the same way, are coming over to my family's home for a family gathering. I have prepared a card for the children and I want to write a message with the intent of honoring her memory/legacy, as the gathering doubled as a birthday celebration she never lived to see.

I'm unsure of how to write said message. If I were to write religious messages or extracts from scripture, I feel that I'm respecting their faith but I feel in my heart that I'm so fake since I don't even practice their faith anymore.

I can also word my message in a secular way, showing my true self, but I'm concerned that their family would be fussy for not putting a religious tone to my message.

I don't want to mull so hard over this because the children are still grieving and I don't want to cause any drama. I'm the only freethinker in my family and a rift at this time over something like this is unimaginable.",25Nov2019,1
572,"
So I (f21)don’t know what to do. I moved too quickly with my boyfriend(m18) and now we live together and I am seeing a plethora of issues... he snooped through my phone and hoot upset over the amount of nudes I had taken before him(I hadn’t deleted my Snapchat camera roll in years until this happened.) and said that how can he trust me if I have been with so many guys, he wonders how many guys around where we live haven’t seen me naked and that I’ve had too many exes and been with too many people. (7) and then I posted a gif of Johnny Depp in Pirates if the Carribean because he’s hot and he asked why I posted it and I told him the truth that he is hot and it was the end of the world. He said that he thinks it’s gross that I still find celebrities attractive while in a relationship and he doesn’t find anyone else attractive even celebrities because he’s in a relationship and that it’s disrespectful and weird that I posted that gif and I just don’t know what to do. I’m not a robot, I still find other people attractive. I still find regular everyday people attractive and I’m not ashamed of that because I’d never even think about cheating.... I’m just lost. Also, anytime we do end up in these arguments he always ends up saying shit like “oh you just hate me, I’m just an asshole, do you even still love me, I’m a terrible boyfriend” no matter how big or small the argument is. They’re also little things that get to me like he sleeps till we are leaving in like 5 minutes and he never gets lunch ready for work and wants to go out to eat all the time despite trying to save money and he doesn’t keep the apartment as clean as I want, he is super immature in the sense that whenever we are doing stuff he always has to make it inappropriate like he makes drug jokes or sex jokes like he turned Christmas song inappropriate while we were decorating the Christmas tree, while I was happily singing them the normal way. But he also can be super sweet, he always goes out of his way to care for me, he always cooks my food and gets my drinks, and if he has an opportunity to do something for me he will, he loves to cuddle and he is always loving on me, he makes me feel beautiful and he is always complimenting me, well slow dance in the kitchen to our favorite records, we could lay together and watch tv forever, I just idk....

574,"I took a job after an internship, and pledged that I would finish my degree online. However, after about 1.5 years in the job, I don’t know how much more I can take. I need one more class to graduate, and it is only offered online in the summer of 2021 (I am away from campus). The job is in the sport industry, which is incredibly hard to break into, and that’s why I took it with little hesitation. However, it’s terrible. I’m bored by the subject matter, frustrated by the constituents, irritated by the management, and our online system does not work, so my workload is immense because I’m doing many tasks manually. I have two options. 

1. Continue in this job, and graduate in the summer of 2021- again, this job is in the sport industry, with a globally recognized sport organization (for anonymity’s sake, I won’t say which). Success in this job would set me up for a long career in sports. My managers are well connected, and they took a chance on me as a college senior without a degree. I do feel loyalty to them for that. 

2. Leave this job when my lease is up (July), and go back to school and get my degree- my main concern is that I don’t yet have my Bachelor’s degree. If I had it, I don’t know that I would stay. I have connections in my college town, where I could work for 1 semester, and finish my schooling. At that point, I would be free to pursue other opportunities. I only consider this an option because of how I DESPISE this position. I leave work every day extremely frustrated, and there are not too many bright spots. I don’t like to quit, but my manager asked for 2-3 years when they hired me. July would mark 2 years and some change. 

This is a huge decision, and everyone I talk to has an bias of some kind (good or bad). This is a crazy short summary of the situation, but any objective opinions would be appreciated.",25Nov2019,1
575,"Hey All, 

I work part time at a pizza place. Theres a co- worker of mine who isn't nice and pretends that he's the boss (aka trying to boss people around).

 Honestly, he is a jerk and I've noticed him being really creepy towards the younger female workers. Not only that but his behavior has been getting worse since he started doing meth (he brags about drugs all the time.) 

Ex. Threatening to fight other workers for no reason, falling asleep while doing dishes, messing up deliveries and threatening to hurt coworkers as if it was their fault. 

Also, it turns out hes a pedofile and on the list for knocking up a 15 year old when he was in his late 20s.

Now my boss knows this but, seemingly doesnt care. They just say to ignore him but,  his behavior is making our turnover rate exponentially high with morale low.

 I dread working with him and I know others do too. It's even to the point that no one can go to the cooler or stock room without an escort due to him following the female staff in and being ""creepy"".

How do I deal with this? Im not even sure what to do.  I don't want to quit as I do enjoy my job. 

Any advice?

576,"**I've been noticing this for a while now, and am seriously wondering if maybe there's something wrong with me?**   
TL;DR For Context: My life, to be blunt, sucks. I'm 19, no notable parental figures, in a shitty living situation, my job screwed me over, and just generally my life is not where it should be. I'm graduated, looking for schooling opportunities, but am so busy trying to be self sufficient that I can't pursue anything as of current. And then on top of that I found out recently that I have some serious heart problems, and may be needing surgery soon for a correction. So just generally thinks aren't going great.  


But I've never cried about my life, hell I barely even get upset about it despite acknowledging it's pretty sub par,  I don't think I can recall a single moment where I've cried from anxiety or anything similar. I don't feel sad for myself, I didn't even really think that was something people did? I mean I tear up at frustration and the like in the moment, but never properly get sad over my living situation, no matter how bad it is. I just kind of accept it, even though I know it's dire and within the next 3-4 months I'll likely be homeless if I can't get my act together.  


So why is it then, that when other people cry, I do too? Or if I'm watching something emotionally charged, I cry /really easily./ Like I have to hold myself back from sobbing about people I don't even know, who's issues don't even seem to be as bad as mine. (Not demeaning them and their problems, just an observation from my point of view.)   


I honestly don't know if this kind of thing is normal, but from talking to my girlfriend and my sister it seems like they get upset and break down sometimes about personal issues, and I just... Don't? Is this a normal thing? I was trying to research it and couldn't find much pertaining to the topic. Seriously wondering If I have sociopathic tendencies like my biological mother and should seek some kind of counseling for it.",25Nov2019,1

Last time I paid for half her ticket and half of everything we did over the weekend. I paid for half her ticket this time too, but I just feel like we’ve drifted a lot and I kind of regret it.

She always takes days to answer my texts now. She’s making decisions I don’t really approve of and I feel like she’s lying about some of the things that are going on with her life. 

I’m kind of over it already because it doesn’t seem like she’s going to be moving back here anytime soon, which she originally said she would. She has a new guy there, some new friends, and she’s living with a friend for free. She really doesn’t have a reason to move back besides me and I just don’t feel that important anymore in her life.

First and last time I did this was when I was around 14-15 years old (didn't know this shit was a thing at that time). I could have just wait and go another day with some friends. But for many reasons that would make this post too long if I explain them, I didn't. I remember that even the woman who sold me the ticket would look at me in a certain way I can't really explain right now. Curiosity? Pity? She didn't even think about any of these? Wdf knows. But I was literally the only one (or so I remember it) to be alone that day. I didn't give a fuck back then, but when I told my friends they kinda made me see that people just don't do that. Then I started having these Vietnam flashback about the whole night and realized their explanation was pretty accurate. I'm 19 now and I would rather trick a friend into going with me than going alone.

Since then my parents have paid thousands of dollars in bail and lawyer fees and my brother hasn't paid them back or changed his habits, the case is ongoing. My mom even tried enrolling him in school and he skipped so many classes that he was no longer enrolled, wasting even more money that we don't have a lot of.

587,"Hello! So I would like to start off with some background. My boyfriend and I are both young and just moved in with each other. Everything is going great. He is about 340lbs and I’m around 115lbs. 

Over the years I have developed a eating disorder after being in a previous very verbally abusive and mind fucked relationship as well as a unhealthy living environment. I began abusing my body by starving myself and the little that I do it. Most of the time I throw it up. I hate myself for this and I have kept it a secret, especially from my boyfriend for quite some time. 

My boyfriend on the other hand has a very close and unhealthy relationship with food too. Just the complete opposite as me. I genuinely love him for him and I KNOw he is so handsome and good looking! I know he does not feel the same about himself. 

This makes me so sad because I just want to see him heathy and happy and feeling great about himself. As he should. He has told me now 4 times that he will begin going back to the gym and eating better. But he always seems to fall off track. 

I love him for him, and his weight honestly does NOT bother me in the slightest. But I know it bothers him. I would love to keep him on track and keep him motivated with his meal and exercise plans. I just don’t want him to ever feel judged by me, so I am hesitant to voice when I see he is gaining and eating very unhealthily and I’m very large portions.

592,"Hi r/advice. 

The past 2 weeks have been a lot for me. I had a depressive episode and talked to the wellness chair at my sorority about it, and she called the police (which I don’t blame her for, she did the right thing). I didn’t want my friends to get involved, I never intended for that to happen, but the police talked to them and they got upset with me for putting them through that. I feel terrible about it. 

The police sent me to a mental health hospital where I did an initial assessment. I opted for traditional outpatient treatment, and I’m waiting for the place to call me back to set up my first appointment, but they told me it will take about 6 weeks to get in. Or I could do intensive outpatient and start this week, but it will be an enormous financial strain on my family and I can’t bring myself to put my parents through that. 

Two of my roommates left a note on my desk. They don’t want to live with me anymore. I have been very emotional and I got very upset. I stopped going to the sorority and I started staying at my boyfriend’s place. He always encouraged me to come over so I thought it was okay, but I have been pretty clingy and insecure this week even though I try my best not to be. I didn’t say anything to my roommates because I wasn’t ready to talk. I never got nasty with them or even passive aggressive, but me not talking to them upset them more. I wasn’t trying to be mean, I just wasn’t ready. Finally I texted one of them that I felt the note was very insensitive as they know I’m going through a lot right now and the note felt very targeted. It said that I am hurting their mental well being and degree progress. But I tried so hard not to get them involved because I didn’t want them to go through that. I never meant for this to happen. I  said I’ve decided to drop the sorority and will be moving out this week. They were very angry at this and essentially said they’re glad that I’m dropping. 

This upset me a lot so I gathered my things and went to my boyfriend’s place after asking him if it was okay. He told me he thought I handled the situation poorly, which I agree with. But I’m also very hurt and confused right now. I’ve lost two friends and I will be going through a lot of changes. I’m trying to repair so many relationships at once, while worrying about finals, the process of dropping and moving, and starting therapy.

He got more frustrated and said I need to stop using him as a therapist. He said I need to find good friends to rely on before I can be in a relationship. He also said I should have known things would turn out this way, and I should have considered how my episode would affect others before it happened. I know he’s right, but it also was hard to hear that. So I reached out to some friends from high school, and some other friends on campus, and set up dates/times to see all of them. I want to be a better friend and work on improving myself. 

We also talked about our relationship. We’ve been together for about 3 weeks. He told me that his nature is not to be empathetic, and he can’t tell me what I need to hear. He said he doesn’t think he is capable of falling in love with anyone. I asked him why he is dating me and his answer was he enjoys spending time with me. I’m afraid of working so hard to make this relationship work only to find three years down the line that he will never care about me as much as I care about him. I feel stupid for spending so much time at his place and becoming dependent on him so quickly. I thought it was okay for me to talk about my problems with him, because he also opened up to me very quickly and has told me about his struggles with depression and relationships. I understand why he’s frustrated. I’m questioning now if the relationship is worth continuing, but if I’m honest with myself I’m really afraid of losing him and my friends at the same time. I really do think things will be better once I’m less emotional and I start therapy, but now I am afraid I’ll never be able to talk to him about my problems or feelings. Can I date someone who I can’t talk to and who I’m not even sure has the capacity to love me? He said he will give me a week to basically get my shit together and show him I’m not dependent on him. But I couldn’t tell if that was a joke or not. He is really hard to read sometimes. Either way I’ve decided to stop coming over for a while and I’m not going to talk to him about my depression or problems for a while either, because I know he is getting tired of it. I’m still texting him normally. 

Things are so hard right now. I feel like I need someone to talk to about all of this. Everything is changing for me all at once. I’m so stressed and anxious. I can’t eat, I can’t get out of bed. I can’t go to the sorority and face my roommates.  I’m staying at my biological sister’s place right now, but she is very busy with school and I don’t think she wants to talk to me about these things. I need to talk to someone, but therapy is not an option until the semester is over. I don’t want to be a burden to my friends, I don’t want to use them as therapists. But I can’t continue keeping all of this bottled up. I feel like I’m losing my boyfriend, and the worst part is I know it’s my fault for being so unstable and putting all this on him lately. I know it sucks to date someone who is depressed and clingy. I want so badly to be better and to be a good friend and a good girlfriend. I’m terrified of losing everyone right now. All I want is to be able to tell a friend how I’m feeling and hear that it’s gonna be okay. That maybe not all of this is my own fault. I just want to go home and see my mom and dad. I just don’t want to feel this way. I wish I could go talk to a therapist right now but I can’t. I don’t know what to do. I feel so trapped and alone. 

TL;DR I had a depressive episode and I lost two friends because of it. My boyfriend is getting tired of hearing about my problems. I feel like a burden to everyone. I can’t start therapy for 6 weeks and I feel like I have nobody to talk to.",25Nov2019,1

that problem made me feel very unconfident about myself. i mean i kind of know i am not bad looking and stuff i have many friends and also some girls that were pretty interested in me. another problem with that because of the fact that i always think i am not as good as others i always think i’m not good enough for them and i remain to fell unconfident. even one time i made out with a really beautiful girl and my hearth was beating like shit i was so unconfident about what i was doing i always thought like am i doing it wrong am i good enough? some minutes later when we came even closer and took our clothes off i wasn’t able to get a “good” erection. ( it wasn’t my first time having sex at my first time i had kind of the same problems but it worked out after a while)  that accident even though i saw a pretty girl relay likes me didn’t help me with my confidence as this was a pretty bad situation for me and i was kind of lost and stressed.

another thing is i get really ashamed when someone mentions a bad point of myself and i also get very ashamed for others when they do something “wrong” for what they cold be ashamed for.

as i know i have these problems i built a pretty strong wall around my self a wall of what it looks like to others confidence but it’s fake as i am not confident. 

yea i hope somebody actually ready this and can give me some advices :)

edit: also i don’t really know how to behave towards that girl as i saw her pretty frequently",25Nov2019,1

595,"He’s quite literally twice my age, but it has been one of the most fulfilling relationships I’ve been in. He’s never dated anyone significantly younger than him, either. I’ve noticed a lot of criticism, which I completely respect and understand. So, I guess my question is - to the 30 somethings here, why wouldn’t you date someone significantly younger? Do you think there could ever be someone so young that would make you change your stance? Also, if you see an age gap couple in real life, what are your first thoughts? I know relationships will always be met with some opposing force, but I want to understand the other side.",25Nov2019,1
596,"Hi all,

So I'm part of a discord server and we specifically have an NSFW channel for anything that is sexual. I post frequently in the NSFW channel about ideas for fanfic and stuff like that. The channel also has a pop up message that says you have to be 18 to participate and asks you to confirm that you are.

Its recently come out that one of the people participating in that channel is only 15. I'm not a mod on the server so I cant do anything and no one else seems to have a problem with it. Should I stop participating in the server or channel??",25Nov2019,1
597,"Hey everyone. I'm going through a rough time right now and could really use some reassurance or advice on this.

My GF (21F) and I (20M) had sex this past friday. My dick was inside her without a condom for the first minute or two (I was not even that aroused since we barely did any foreplay, so I am not that concerned about precum). But I proceeded to put on a condom and we fucked like usual. After cumming in the condom, I pulled out. But this time, the condom fell off after I pulled out (the condom was NOT stuck inside her, it fell out too when I pulled out). This is the first time this has happened (we've had safe sex for a few years now). Also, an important note, we had sex roughly one week (give or take a few days) before her expected ovulation date. I have researched pretty much non-stop about the female reproductive system for the past two days, so any fact you throw at me I will most likely already know (sperm living inside her for up to 5 days in ideal conditions, the fertile window being the highest chance of her getting pregnant, and this probability increases up to her ovulation day, etc). At worst case scenario, we had sex within 4 days of her expected ovulation day, and at best case, about a week before (were using clue to track her cycle). For what its worth, I found a range of probabilities of her getting pregnant given our situation, ranging from 30% (at best) to somewhere between 1-10%. However, at the end of the day, while the low probabilities are pretty much the only thing allowing me to sleep at night, the probabilities themselves are absolutely meaningless. She is either pregnant, or shes not. 

I am not saying I know all these facts to sound hubristic, as any advice you guys have would be greatly appreciated. I just say it because I am admittedly, ***10000% paranoid.*** I can barely get through doing one math problem without thinking I may be a dad in 9 months or frantically googling something I already have 12 times in the past three days. My mind simply cannot rest no matter what I do. She has however agreed to take a test about 5 days before her period begins (which is expected around the 10th-14th of december), which is the absolute earliest you can take one (she'd be taking the clearblue one for what its worth). So before people say ""oh you don't even know if shes pregnant dude take it easy"" I know. Believe me when I say I am trying my best here and I realize that she might not even be pregnant. In fact, she most likely isn't pregnant. Still, I've reached out to some friends of mine for advice and they all say there probably isn't anything to worry about. Even my GF says not to worry and its going to be okay. I also go to therapy so I'll be seeing my therapist a week from today. In the meantime, I meditate religiously, workout 6 or 7 days of the week, eat healthy, and god knows I have plenty of school work as finals are coming up, so I am trying to stay plenty busy. It is the simple fact of not knowing that drives me absolutely insane. 

I have read a million horror stories online about people getting pregnant and I should stop, but its driving me up a wall. I don't even really know why I do this, perhaps to find ***some*** comfort at all seeing people say its going to be okay. Why do i get reassurance from strangers saying its going to be okay, when they are commenting on an entirely different situation? I do not know. But I am trying to find anything at all to lean on to for the next week and a half. It sucks I cannot talk about it with her (this is my rule since I don't want to stress her out) so I talk to literally anyone else I can about the situation. I also realize worrying will not change the outcome. But try telling yourself that when your life could turn entirely upside down for the next \_\_\_\_\_\_\_  ***years.*** 

Now for the real dagger: She is not on BC and refuses to get an abortion or take the morning after pill. We love each other very much, not sure if we want to get married one day but its been on our minds. I would die for her, and she's told me she would die for me too. So we have a strong relationship and the child would certainly grow up having a healthy relationship with his/her mom and dad. We both said if she is pregnant we'd love the fuck out of that little guy/girl. Anyways, if she were pregnant, she would ***undoubtedly*** have the child. For those that want to say ""just convince her to have an abortion bro"", believe me when I say it isn't happening. She is the most stubborn person I know and she told me, just yesterday, she would not be able to deal with the emotional pain of getting one. So that is entirely out of the picture. Even if I wanted to, I cannot force her to do anything she does not want to do. 

Before people jump to say things like oh you should've held the base while pulling out or if you aren't ready to have kids then don't have sex, I realize all of these things are true. I'm sure many of you will question my maturity. However, if it were up to me, I would have had her take the morning after pill and she'd be on birth control the day I asked her out four years ago (we are actually both each others firsts for literally everything... virginity, kissing, bf/gf, you name it). Ironically, I only now question her maturity as she just seems to be like ""eh"" if she were to be pregnant. She's told me shed be scared shitless too, because we don't know what the fuck wed do if she were pregnant, but the fact that she wouldn't even consider plan b (when I brought it up she was absolutely irate I even considered it as an option), its made me extremely stressed out. Its a terrifying thought that cripples me. Every hour of every day since last Friday.  

I'm just scared shitless because I am in school right now not working because my major is hard as hell, and she works around 50 hours a week. But if she had the kid, she'd have to be the one taking time off obviously, as the only thing we'd be able to rely on is my degree whenever I get out. For what its worth, I plan on going into data science so I could land a decent job out the gate whenever I do graduate. I realize it would not be strictly impossible raising a child throughout all of this, but holy shit it would suck to say the least. 

I don't say the following to brag, but we are both incredibly determined individuals and are great with money. I realize we'd be broke as hell trying to raise the kid, but I suppose I'm rambling...

Does anyone have any advice at all. I mean absolutely anything. Just ***something*** that might help me get through the next week and a half before she takes the test. I realize I might sound like a pussy if  I cannot last that long, but this shit is driving me insane. I do not want to talk about it with her either because stressing her out will only delay her period if she isn't pregnant. So I don't talk about it with her. Anyways, I thought I'd reach out for guidance. If anyone has gone through this before I'd love to listen. Even if you haven't but have something to contribute I am all ears.",25Nov2019,1
598,"Not even my current job but every job I’ve had. I don’t know what’s going on. I was a straight C student growing up but I never went past high school. Well I tried but I failed about 3 years of education. I wouldn’t say I’m particularly stupid. I have a good vocabulary, my mental arithmetic is really good and I have good basic knowledge on things and to top that off I would say I’m a good person and I’m honest. I always try to get on with colleagues or whoever and I’m maybe too nice at times. I guess I lack confidence at work I find it hard to assert myself which has been brought up in this job. I am also probably the slowest postman in my office. I still make mistakes but I don’t know if this is more than the norm but my guess it probably is excessive. My probation is being extended but this is my dream job so it would be a shame to lose it

This isn’t the only job I’ve struggled in. I think a lot of it is to do with my personality. I’m very quiet at work and I will just do as I’m told. I am certainly not management material and there’s been some jobs I’m terrible at. I honestly can’t look at myself and say what assets I have that will make me a good employee anywhere. I think I’m average at most things but every job it’s been proven I’m not. I’m not even going for high calibre jobs. I am going for literal bottom of the hierarchy, just about survivable wage. 

I was unemployed for 2 years with bipolar disorder, I am on medication now though and i have improved a lot mentally speaking. I feel like I may stay stable if I continue with meds as there’s been nothing bad going on in that retrospect. 

I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’ll just always get fired or want to quit out of frustration as I have been.

He seems to never make time for me. I mean he has been there when it truly, truly mattered , but not much collectively.

He will says let's get a video game and play it together, then we get it and he will either not play or play without me practically beating the games.

I say let's go on a trip somewhere, he says he's down until the very last minute and then says he can't go through with it cause of money or time. This has happened several times, fortunately we've never booked something but he always bails right before.

He says I should visit him and when I ask when he says soon he's busy. Then I find out other friends have visited him. 

He takes a lot of his time with his girlfriend, which I totally understand, I'm not gonna be one of those friends who bitch their friend is spending more time with their girlfriend then with their homies.

He takes hours, sometimes days to answer texts but I've been with him, we used to work together, he's on his phone constantly.

605,"So my mum has been told she has pre-cancerous cells in her breast. She had these removed last week and is awaiting word on whether these have spread.  Either way she will get radiotherapy.

This is a huge deal because we have a family member who had cancer throughout her body and died in agony. So my mum is terrified.

Anyway, my aunt and cousin both called my mum the night before the surgery to tell them that:
- they knew someone who went through same thing
- that the surgeon (apparently the same one despite my mum not knowing the name of the guy) butchered the operation resulting in the woman's breasts being deformed
- because the surgery was botched, the cancer spread
- the woman had to have chemo as a result.

I'm going to be honest, they were kinda cheap, but like the others had no problems so I was lowkey sure nothing was gonna happen to those that I had bought a few weeks prior.

The problem is: Every time I turn them on, they work like they're supposed to for like 10-30 mins (I'm not sure if it's accurate, but I've noticed that they keep on working for longer when they're green and less when they're red), every color works, controller responds correctly etc and after that period of time it shuts down, like I pulled it from the plug... 

The thing is, if I do actually plug them off for a couple of mins, they start working again, but the same thing keeps on happening.

I'm 17 (aka on the cusp of dreaded adulthood) and I have no money! :) Except for the pocket money I sometimes get. Which if converted to other currencies, will be very, very little because the currency exchange people seem to have a personal vendetta against me :)

And since I'm trying to move back to lgbt safe spaces (aka the Wild West) I sort of, need, money for that. This lead to me trying to save up enough for 6-7 months AT LEAST.

So, I decided to freelance online and do odd jobs here and there while getting paid a decent sum. The problem is, it being **online**, I need a bank account. Which,, I don't have...

Now, I *could* use PayPal and connect an account to it later, when I have one. But PayPal requires you to be over 18 ~~i'll lie yeehaw~~ AND *it isn't available in my country* (:

610,"I am a 16M and was recently at a party. A song played, and for some reason (in short, because of my friends) i started to film the dance and song. When i returned home, i watched the film and something caught my eye. It was a group of 3 girls, call them A, B and C. Now, girl A looks at the camera, looks away and seems to point out to her 'group' that i am filming. Girl B looks at me or my camera and while she is, Girl C 'grabs her head and turns in the direction she was initially facing. Immediately, Girl C bends backwards while laughing  and i am pretty shure that B too laughed (B's back was towards me but C was laughing looking at B).

The next thing I see is that B looks nervous to me. She repeatedly brushes away her hair, tries to dance normally and looks sideways a couple times while trying to avoid eye contact.

611,"Hello, so me and my bf, have been together for a couple of years. James is an amazing person and Im just so lucky to have him. However he recently got diagnosed with depression and is going to therapy for it, according to him, he's been depressed for about 3 years, and ever since I met him he has told me about these feelings and how most of the time he just feels empty. I've tried to give him my full support through everything, be there for him and be someone he can count on.

However, unfortunately this is a battle he is losing (his words), and he's starting to push everyone away from him: his friends, family, and especially me. He goes days without leaving his house, rarely answers my texts, and in general he seems to not care about his life at all. He means the world to me and seeing him like this is really taking a toll on me, Im not sure if this is some sort of phase that he will bounce back from or if this is him now, and either way I dont like it. I wish I could do more to help him, but I cant unless he stops pushing me away.

How do I get to him and convince him to let me in his life more?

613,"So I’m going to spend thanksgiving with my gf this year. I love her family and all her relatives are super chill EXCEPT for her older sister who is kind of an elephant in the room. The reason I said so was because she was extremely rude and selfish towards my partner (let’s call her Amanda) and I over the years. Her sister had also been in and out of rehab facility (don’t get me wrong, addiction sucks the soul out of everyone and it’s awful for those who suffer from it), and bouncing from one housing to another. While she’s not able to work with her condition, amanda would spot her because that’s just what siblings do. Amanda felt used and taken for granted after a while after all the second chances she gave her. Over the summer they had a fight about it, and her sister accused Amanda for being cruel (for not paying her rent/bills like Amanda was “supposed to”). Amanda has never asked her sister for anything,  yet she kept being used and accused when she doesn’t do EVERYTHING she’s asked to do. They hadn’t spoken since June and she had blocked Amanda and I on the phone(I assume she thinks I talk behind her back as well to Amanda). I know I’ll see Amanda’s sibling later this week during dinner and I don’t know how to handle this awkward atmosphere. I know Amanda and I aren’t the ones to blame. We didn’t cause this drama, it was just her older sister who had a tantrum after being confronted). I just think that the whole situation is really childish, her older sister is 26 and doesn’t seem to understand responsibility.

We broke up last month because even though she loved me, she had a crush on someone else too and felt like it was unfair to me if she kept on dating me while she had feelings for someone else. I have a long problem with mental health, so I just cut myself and then it passed.

I still kept thinking about her and one day I asked her if she still has a crush on me. Turns out, she does. I asked her then why can't we date and she gave me the reason that we live far away, but she still said she wanted to date me, but she wanted to date the other girl as well. 

So I told her to think about it and let me know what she decides. Every day she told me to ask her the next day, and finally I told her I would prefer a no over never knowing and after 2 days, she said no today. We were already broken up, so it's not like we just broke up. The problem is that I can't seem to cry, even if I want to, so I have no way to let out my emotions other than self-harming, which I don't want to continue doing. I can't go see a therapist because I live in India.

619,"An entire life is a pretty long thing to read (and type) so I’ll try to keep it as short as I can. Thank you all for coming to the autobiography nobody asked for! Even if no one reads this it was one of the most cathartic things I’ve ever done. 

I (23 F) grew up in a hoarders house (look up a picture if you don’t know what that is. Hoarded trash and animals. At one time we had about 20 cats). My dad died at the age of 5 and my mom (63 F) became an extreme shut in. She basically didn’t (and still does not) leave the house whatsoever, has been cripplingly addicted to video games for the last 19 years, is extremely emotionally volatile (has every symptom of BPD but has never been diagnosed), and to top it off is a religious zealot that does not believe in vaccines or doctors in general. Extreme neglect for herself, others, and her home. My sisters (33F, 38F) wait on her hand and foot. She actually watched her toe grow black for a year, it fell off, and she tried to reattach it with silver gel and bandaids. She still wouldn’t go to a doctor and my brother (40M) finally got her to visit. I could go on. My 2 sisters live in the house rent free. One of the sisters (We’ll call her N for the extreme narcissist that she is) has 2 children that grew up there with me that I love dearly. Growing up there was a lot of screaming and emotional abuse. 

How did anyone afford anything with no job? My dad died and shortly after his mother (my grandmother) died leaving the inheritance that was meant for my father to me (this is important later). The inheritance was pretty substantial and my mom was left as the trustee. She pulled out exorbitant amounts of money each month, but spent it all terribly. Really terribly. She bought 15-20k in broken stained thrift store furniture alone. She genuinely didn’t do any of this maliciously she is just very mentally ill and not very bright or practical. The house became more and more dilapidated. I became more and more suicidally depressed/anxious, ballooned to 300lbs, and barely didn’t fail out of high school. At 18 I decided something had to change and I lost 100lbs and me and a friend got commercial dumpsters to clean out the house while my sisters were at bible camp my mom sent them to (15k btw). I struggled severely with anxiety/depression/eating disorders and was a shut in for about 2 years in this house. I was told I couldn’t move out and felt hopeless. I inherited half of my assets at 18 and the other half will be at 35. I drastically lowered the amount my mom was spending but I also finally worked up the nerve to move out at 20. My mom chased me from the house frothing at the mouth angry I was leaving. 

I moved across the country with no plan and got a random retail job and was there for a year. I developed severe burnout and terrible health issues and after a year had to move into my brothers house to just recover. It took an entire year at my brothers just to get to a point I could get out of bed and feel stable. In the last 6 months I moved to an apartment with my niece (22F) about 3 hours from my brothers house. I’ve been living off the dividends of my account but it’s been fully supporting my moms entire house and myself for the last few years. I’m definitely spending more than I make and I’ve been worried sick about it not being sustainable. I deeply resent my mother and no longer want to support her financially, but I feel like an ungrateful monster and don’t know what to do. She owns her house outright and even in the condition it’s in is worth about 300k-400k. She has social security but all of it just pays off her health insurance which she needs. She could go live with my brother who has a much nicer house, room for her, and has asked her to move there, but she claims his wife is her “mortal enemy”. On top of all this she claims the inheritance was rightfully supposed to be half hers but that my fathers sister illegally had her Alzheimer’s mother sign a new will. She claims that if I cut her off she’ll sue me. The statute of limitations is over on that I’m sure but 1 year ago apparently my sister found out she was also supposed to be part of that will and that might renew the statute based on her just discovering it? I have no idea and should probably speak to a lawyer. 

I really do realize I’m so incredibly fortunate to have an inheritance at all and feel extremely ungrateful for even considering cutting them off but I genuinely hate everything they are and stand for. Besides that I’m finally in a place mentally and physically to work again but I’m just scared I’ve wasted years of my life and don’t have an education. I have the money to go back to school but I have no idea what for and it would be another few years of me just spending money and not working. I also know with my HS grades I wouldn’t get in anywhere without going to a jc and transferring. I have a real desire and drive to succeed, I’m absolutely amazing with people and sales, and have also dreamt about running my own business. I’m intelligent and know I have a lot of potential; I’ve just been dealing with a lot of mental, emotional, and physical problems that are finally starting to heal. I’ve come a long way. But I feel so incredibly lost and - like everyone - want a happy successful fulfilling life. I feel like I have so much opportunity due to my inheritance but have absolutely no idea what to do and feel this internal pressure to go out and make something of myself. I have no idea what to do with myself daily and have quite a bit of free time if that matters.

Advice needed: what in the actual fuck do I do? In regards to career, education, finances, family, legally in regards to the inheritance, mental health advice also greatly welcomed.

I would love any and all advice. Out of the box answers, what you would do in my situation, literally every single piece of advise you could offer because it feels like I’m lost at sea and my boat has a gaping hole in it. 

Also I know this isn’t the thread for it but AITA for wanting to cut my mom off financially? I feel really morally torn about it.",25Nov2019,1
620,"I like kinky shit and so does he.  I like a wee slap on the face now and then during sex. Last time it felt  ever so slightly harder than usual. It was not deliberate AT ALL. My body was literally just a bit more sensitive because I was due my period so it's pretty common and that was that. I told him instantly that it was too hard my eyes started to water. He made sure I was alright and after he  apologized. Now a few weeks on he sometimes makes a joke about me feeling like it was too hard and once playfully mocked me. He does it in a playful manner and I honestly wasn't offended by it but  I can't help but feel that it's not really okay to even play or joke about that?

622,"So I've known my online friend Jack for 4 years now. Long story short, I recently confessed I didn't love him and he's devastated. I think it's been the final straw that pushed him over the edge. He's always been very depressed and suicidal, and it's gotten way worse the past few months. He told me yesterday he wants to kill himself. I truly think he'll attempt sometime soon. I have the names of his parents and I messaged them both on Facebook messenger and let them know their son is contemplating suicide. The messages sent but I don't think either of them have Messenger because the messages were never read. What the hell do I do? I even googled their names and tried to find their phone numbers to text them. I've gotten no replies.

I can't call the police or a suicide hotline number because I CAN'T be tracked down. I've been catfishing Jack for 4 years (lying about my identity) and he has no idea. I seriously can't be tracked down and investigated for being his friend. Or for lying. The only reason I've stuck by his side all this time is to help support him because he's very depressed. I didn't think I was making his mental health worse, but in actuality I probably was. 

I'm really worried for him, but at the same time he's taken a big toll on my mental health the past few months. I've become depressed, anxious 24/7, and I stay up late at night until I know he's sleeping safely.

Please help me. How do I tell his parents?",25Nov2019,1
623,"Backstory: known her for about six months. In general, she's in completely different social circles than I am. However, over the past couple months, we've been seeing each other regularly as part of a community discussion group based on some shared interests we have. I didn't think much of her at first, but the more we've talked, the more I've realized we have a lot in common. Every time I talk to her, I leave wanting to know more and more about her. Disclaimer: I don't necessarily want to date her at this point, just find her fascinating and could see it being a really nice friendship.

Lately, her and I have been texting fairly regularly, mostly related to the discussion group (she organizes it and I help), though I did ask if she'd want to grab coffee together sometime (she was receptive to the idea, no solid plans yet, busy schedules lately). So after the last discussion group, I left feeling very anxious due to some of the topics we discussed. Not really knowing where else to turn, I texted her letting her know how I was feeling and to my surprise, we ended up talking on the phone for half an hour, debriefing about the meeting, and having some pretty deep conversation given that we'd barely ever talked 1-on-1 before. 

I was shocked with how easily I could express myself to her. It was near the level of conversation I have with my very best friends. I reiterated my interest in hanging out together and talking more and suggested we touch base when she's back in town (she was going home for Thanksgiving) to which she agreed. That was nearly a week ago. Neither of us have reached out to the other since then.

Here's where I'm having a problem: I feel an incredible magnetism toward this person, but given what I know about her, I imagine she would have taken the time to talk to just about anybody who was having a hard time (one of the things I find admirable about her). I'm not trying to glom onto her just cause we had one meaningful conversation, but I also want to build on the connection and don't want it to fizzle. I feel like I need to express to her how much that conversation meant to me and how comfortable I felt talking to her, but am worried she's just being nice and doesn't feel the same way I do.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.",25Nov2019,1

632,"To make a long story short, I have a brother in high school whose grades aren't looking too good (B's, C's, one or two D's). Our parents don't understand how he's like this now since he used to be a straight-A student back in Elementary/ Middle school. I, being the older sibling, understand the struggle of trying to get great grades, especially in high school.

I will admit though, he's doing worse than I did at that age. He spends a lot of time playing video games, on his laptop, talking to friends etc. I did the same things but for some reason, he's performing worse than I did. Regardless though, he hid his report card and my parents found out. They're talking about punishing him, taking his door away, taking his games etc. etc. but **I just feel as if there's a way around all of that. A way to facilitate things and have him do better without all of the harsh punishment, yelling, arguing etc.** 

I told my mom what if she and my dad try doing things like checking his grades online (weekly, so they won't be surprised when/if he brings a bad report card home), have him do his homework at the table, look over/study the work for the classes he's struggling with (2-3 times a week), and so on rather than resort to punishment.

At first, my mom shot that idea down but she then came back to me and asked for me to put together a list of things they could consider doing in order to help him, rather than doing the typical ""Yell at you, take away your stuff, see you're doing better, give your stuff back"" pattern that they always follow.

633,"*I’m using a throwaway*

Little backstory: my parents always have an early thanksgiving gathering the weekend before, because my brother and 2 sisters work thanksgiving day. On Saturday we had our gathering at my parents house. I’m 21 (M) and I still live at home. My brother and sister in law just had a baby, and I haven’t ever really cared for her. My brother makes a stupid amount of money with his job, thus his wife makes it known that they are wealthy and walks with her nose in the air and acts like she is above me and my other siblings. She has always been mean to me, and even told my brother that if we wanted to hang out, it would have to be at my parents house because I would dirty their house, because I am 5 years old, after all. Anyway, the night of our gathering she had asked my mom where she could breast feed, and my mom told her to do it in my brothers old room, the room next to mine. She excused herself a few times and fed my nephew. During family gatherings, I always close my bedroom door, usually because it’s really dirty and I don’t want it to be an eye sore when people walk by it to use the bathroom. 

My sister had gotten me a poster from her work for my birthday, and I went to go put it in my room, and when I opened the door my sister in law was sitting on MY chair in MY room, breast feeding my nephew. She literally screamed as if I had brought 3 of my friends to watch her. A, it was an accident and I had no intention of trying to watch her take out her boobs. B, she was in my room, I don’t think I have to knock before I enter MY room. My brother came to her rescue and she started screaming that I was a pervert and that I was probably waiting for the right moment to walk in on her. My brother asked me what my problem was and I said that I had no idea she was in there and that she was supposed to be in his room. She then said that my recliner was more comfortable for her to sit in. She then kept calling me a pervert and disgusting, so after arguing with them and pleading my case she and my brother left. Now I feel like she’s gonna be telling people that I did it on purpose, and she will probably spin it and say that I tried to take pictures or something. I have a girlfriend that I see naked so I wouldn’t want anything to do with her anyway. Not sure what I should do. I still have to see her for the remainder of the holidays, and even though I didn’t do anything wrong, it’s really bothering me. 

TLDR: my sister in law was breastfeeding in my bedroom without my knowledge, so I accidentally walked in on her with her boobs out, and she proceeded to scream at me and call me a pervert",25Nov2019,1

635,"I live in a condo on the 2nd floor with my husband. About a month ago, a family moved into the condo on the 3rd floor right above us. Since then, we started hearing a lot of stomping, screaming and crying from that unit. One day, my husband came home and told me he met two kids who live upstairs, the boy seems like he's about 7/8 and the girl looked 14ish (so they're both school-aged). We also assumed the kids live with a single mother because we would only hear a woman screaming and yelling.

A few days ago, we noticed our ceiling was leaking water. My husband went upstairs to check what was happening. He knocked on their door, a man answered the door (probably the woman's husband or boyfriend). And my husband found out their washer broke down and drowned their unit (hence our ceiling leaking). My husband said there were four kids mopping and cleaning the mess and that they had pretty much no furniture at all. The man was very nice and apologetic, but the woman was VERY, VERY rude toward my husband. She said, verbatim, ""don't fucking ask me. I don't know what the fuck happened. I was napping"" in front of her kids. I was quite irritated by that, but okay, cussing and being rude in front of your kids isn't illegal, I should just mind my own business.

Anyway, the screaming got really bad in the past week or so. We heard her screaming at one of her crying children at midnight and the screaming would start again at 8 in the morning along with VERY loud stomping and dragging (?) noises. I'm worried that she's physically abusing her children. The thing that makes me very concerned is that my job is fully remote and the desk that I work at is right by our window where I can see people going in and out of the building. I don't recall EVER seeing her or her husband taking the kids to or from school.  One could argue that they're being homeschooled, but I literally don't know anyone who does that.

I have been thinking about calling CPS to check on the kids, but they would know it's us because we're the only people who can hear what's happening in their unit. And judging by the woman's attitude when my husband told her about the leak, I'm worried that she would retaliate. 

Should I follow my gut and call CPS anyway or am I just being my usual worrying self?",25Nov2019,1
636,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

Don’t get me wrong- I am straight. I fall in love with girls. I have sex with girls. I miss girls. I date girls. I am going to marry a girl one day. 

But I have a lot of close guy friends. Ever since middle school, maybe the end of elementary, I would always kiss my guy friends. Everytime they would say “thats gay,” I would say that’s what best friends do and girls kiss all the time. For some reason, I am very good at convincing people of these types of things. The only few times where a boy has refused to kiss me was usually some jockey person with a fragile masculinity. 

But in high school, I started to genuinely fall in love with other boys. Straight boys. I would never date them or ever call them my boyfriend. But we would kiss, say “I love you,” be intimate, etc etc. This happened with around 3 of my guy friends. I had a girlfriend from time to time- but it didn’t stop me from being with these boys. I wasn’t cheating, at least I don’t think I was? My girlfriends never did. Well, if they knew. I never really talked about those guys with my girlfriends, or, anyone. It seemed like it didn’t need to be talked about.

This is still continuing into my adulthood. I’m 21 now. I don’t have a girlfriend at the moment but I am with these other boys.

643,"So,  i have several interesting points from my childhood but since i dont really have money for therapy i may as well ask this to a bunch of stranger from the internet.  I really want to know if these memories of mine indicate a deeper problem than i have previously thought.  

One memory that stood very clear is the fact that i really hated my mother when i was around 5-10 years old.  Mind you,  now i love my mother very much and will do anything for her.  But at that time,  she was the worst enemy of mine. One of the earliest memory i have in life is me crying while my mother angrily scolded me for something.  I remember i kept a diary when i was around six or seven and it's full of entry like 'i hate my mom,  she is cruel i hate mom.  Is it better for me just to not exist?' not exactly worded that way but the meaning is approximate.  I also remember quite well how i feel lacking as a daughter,  like i could never make my mom proud and is always a disappointment but i can't quiet remember why i feel that way. I remember crying in the toilet with one of my cousin asking her stuff like 'is it better just to never been born?  I've disappointed my mom so much i think she will be happier having a daughter like you'.  Is my memory indicative of  psychological trauma?  Or is it just a normal feud between mom and daughter? 

Other memory which i remember vividly in particular is one between my mother, my father,  and me.  My father worked far from home when i was little so he was away most of the time (6/7 day i spent with my mother).  Due to him being hardly ever home,  i was very attached to him and will do anything just for him to praise me. But there's this really really clear memory of my mother talking to me in a cold and harsh way saying,  'you are such an attention seeker, i know you are behaving well just to gain your father's attention. Stop that!' she said it in such a way that i immediately felt like i've been flirting with my dad which obvisouly is not the case since i was no more than 10 years old at that time.  That memory stood very clear in particular somehow.  I don't really know the extend of how my mother's words affected me growing up but i suspect me being hesitant and awkward around my father (even now) and me being extremely tomboy until i was in high school have something to do with that.  What do you think? Does it count as childhood trauma?  

To end this long post i just want to say that my mother is the best in the world and i would have her no other way but i am not blind to how she is prone to bouts of hysteria.  I am afraid i too am very pathological in one way more than the other (i may have no depression or anxiety but i have some very peculiar character traits and emotion). I wish i can talk about this with a certified psycholog but since i dont have the money i guess reddit is my best (and free)  shot.  Ofc it would be terrifying to dig deeper into yourself to find out how much your childhood has damaged you in one way or another, but i am really really curious and i hope i can learn from this to be a better parent myself someday in the future.",25Nov2019,1

645,"M(19) first off I’m in understanding that I’m in control of my life, and feel like I have a pretty good understanding that my hardships in life right now have little to no hand In the trajectory of my over all life. 
         
Recently I have come to a point, where I need to make a decision or at least in the past few weeks it’s felt like I’m looking at my life in different optional ways.  I’m 19 and if I spell it out it looks like the typical space , a lot of people around this age come to. On an internal level I’ve reached a peek in depression and social/physical anxiety letting my spd out of hand. 
          
To re account for my year , I’ve felt this down-spiral since December of 2018 ,maybe add a few months prior.  the weeks leading up to the New Years where probably the most stress filled of my entire life so far . My SO of around 3 years now , and I were in a state far better off than currently but still at an all time low .To add I had just graduated a year early from HS and was really feeling like I had the jump on life and regardless of the state I was in felt pretty good with my outlook post school .

Then I was hit with urgent news I couldn’t really handle. My relationship with keeping up to date this my fathers status of health and well being was very poor, as had been our entire relationship. Out of contact even once he had started undergoing chemotherapy for a high stage of pancreatic cancer , we had not  been on frequent speaking terms since I was 8 years old. Now brought to it me it was very evident his state of life was deteriorating 
I felt like I needed to be on good terms or use his time left to fix all he had broken about me , instead things got rapidly worse and I took care of my dying father untill his day of passing on his birthday, New Years.

 Traumatized and emotionally gone, the months after I nearly ever spoke to anyone , let alone anyone about how I felt . I let the conversations with my significant other , push my feelings and mental attitude around his passing into a corner . Her hatred (In her words ) for what feels like all men allowed my self to only validate the violent emotion I had prior. 
My true one and only friend now (A), lives city’s away ,fleeing  from our hometown in an abusive relationship on track to start at a university . Their entire situation has changed and they are all behind helping me make some of my own critical life decisions.

Now I currently attend a community collage three terms in, on track for a transfer degree for my bachelors at a university, I live with my mother and her partner(given) more than ever I feel all the pressure to move out , my partner wants us to be okay enough to move in together . Awhile her reasons to move out and stressors from home life feel like they pile on me, I understand my privilege and opportunity to help them . It just feels like even if she loves me , I’m being used  violently used as a step up to stability in life (her words)(to A)she’s got nothing in her pocket to show for the abuse we have put one another through .
She feels I have harmed her this entire relationship but by the way she has presented that and become so radically verbally abusive to me I feel she is, even though I understand and validate the reasons she vocalizes everything

The abuse she feels I’m putting in is mental and I understand what I’m doing I’m taking space on technology from her while both of our schedules become more stressful so we rarely see one another(typing this )  it’s my word over hers but all our relationship has been is her telling me how I feel and how to do differently and me immediately apologizing witch is invalidated already . 

Im allowing my self to sure come slowly to failure , (as I write this skipping my first class of the day) . I have zero desire to attend school at this point ,over that the feeling it has given to my life feels like something I don’t want to persist in .I really do love my job , I have great co workers and it’s a place I can Unregretfully be my self ,witch sistuationally feels like it damages my schooling and relationship:ie drinking after work or perusing relations with my co workers.

Currently I don’t know what to do I want to drop everything drop out and move to where my friend is living at the moment to assess my better living of life. I also really love this person I’m with but even after typing all of this it seems evident we will come to an end I just want to keep on loving them in the right way which I understand may not happen.

649,"Hello everyone,

my fathers has his own small ""garage"" company where he manufactures parts for various other firms. He has CNC EDM and EDM wire cutter also milling machine. He has done things ranging from electrodes to whole plastic molds (or modifications of these molds) for Siemens.

Sadly when he gets some work, which is scarce these days, he sometimes doesnt get paid. He recently had contract and payment for it was due this week. Email arrived that he wont be getting his money soon. (6000€)

We are really desperate but father is always cheerful on the outside. Always saying stuff like: ""We will endure."" or ""It will get better soon and in the future we will have big company."" Deep inside he is getting depressed and despaired. I know it wont get better soon and maybe he will have to give up his dream. We have been unlucky for few months now, be it payments, costumers or just everyday life.

&amp;#x200B;

I really dont know what to do to help him achieve his long time dream. I really want to help him. But I dont know how to get him work or make us living... I am still student.

So what should I do? Advice, work offer or just words of encouragement would be appreciated.",25Nov2019,1

I've started having panic attacks last year, and doctors suggested I do daily meditation and conscious breathing. I've tried it for about a week, almost cried, felt an overwhelming tiredness weight on my body, almost committed suicide (reckless driving and it's actually a miracle I'm still here today), and I've quit meditation since. Truth is I'm not getting better, and I'm too scared of my own possible actions to dare continue meditation (if it actually does anything and it's not just all in my head). I feel sad, I feel alone, I don't want to die, but neither do I have the strength to keep studying until exhaustion. Today I had a motorcycle accident. Nothing dramatic, only a blinker slightly damaged, but it's the first time I fell to the ground on my bike. It was kind of a shock. I'm tired, and I can't cry even though I feel like I need to deep inside.

659,"So I'm currently in college working on a group project with 6 other members. This project was assigned a month before today (the due date) but being college students we delayed the work until the last week to completely finish this project. Our project consists of 2 parts: A presentation and a report. We tried to split up the work as evenly as possibly but we all know it's not possible for everyone to be able to contribute evenly.

In the end, we did the work somewhat like this:

ME: Do half of the paper, some minor calculations, the design, and making everything look nicer in the presentation.
Guy 1: Do some minor calculations and work on most of the PowerPoint presentation
Guy 2: A little bit of everything and a hard calculation.
Guy 3: The MAIN calculations.
Guy 4: Designs and simulations
Guy 5: Proofreading and a tiny bit of everything
Guy 6: 1 REALLY easy paragraph 

On Thursday, Guy 6 said he was busy on Friday and Saturday but would be free all of Sunday, but only showed up to work on the report at 10:30pm on Sunday with no work done before Friday.

I tried to split up the work evenly saying that Guy 6 should do a few paragraphs on the report and help our with some calculations, but he only completed ONE paragraph in the report by 2am, when the assignment was due at 8am, and hadn't responded to messages around that time. BUT at 11pm we got in a group call with him for him only to join, say ""hi"", and leave in less than an hour without saying anything.

So we have to present our work in class today (Monday) and he hadn't shown up to class, so our professor will subtract 5 points from his project grade for not attending class today. We still haven't presented yet but will soon in the future but I'm not sure if he'll come considering he hasn't responded to anything and because of his work ethics.

Our professor told us, when he announced the project, that group leaders should decide whether or not to add group members' names based on how much they contributed, however my other group members want to keep his name so we don't ""scum"" him and so he doesn't need to retake this class IF he fails. I don't want to add his name or I want to let the professor know since he's gonna get all the credit for the project even though I spent more than 12 hours working on this and Guy 6 has only spent less than 10 minutes on it.

My group members say that he should be the ""clicker"" of our presentation and since he's already lost 5 points so that's good enough but I'm the only one in my group who thinks we should not let him even come up to present since he really did little to none for us.

662,"(Throwaway account or probably new one since my previous one was recognizable)

A little background info in order to understand my situation.

I'm 27 y/o and I come from a small European country. I graduated in Computer Science and found a job in another European country. My salary is considered really good and I've been able to live a very good life (travels, eating out 3-4 times per week etc) so far.   


The problem is that I'm starting to feel miserable at my job. I never hated CS but I never loved it either. I could never find a passion for it. Only reason why I chose this field of study was because I *had* to apply to some University (due to social pressure by family and society) and I always liked computers. The 9-5 schedule is starting to make me feel sick and I feel like I'm wasting my time everyday. I see the fact that I have to write code every day as an obligation and not something I enjoy. Sure, there was a time that I did enjoy it a bit but that was mostly the first 6 months of me getting employed for the first time. Maybe I was also excited by the fact that I moved to another (better) country and started making good amounts of money and not the actual job itself. I also need to add that my work conditions are pretty good and I don't feel pressured by that.  


I've reached this point of misery/complaining that I've started to think that maybe I should change something in my life and maybe start doing things that actually make me feel happy and fulfill me. So, I started to wonder what (if there's anything) that made me feel happy and then I remembered that  since I was very young until end of high school I used to engage in all those artistic activities like drawing (digital and traditional), video editing and special effects. I used to write small stories and edit them into videos with special effects and upload them to YouTube. We were actually a small community of people in the earlier days of YouTube (2007-2010) that we would follow each other and inspire each other to make content (sometimes using copyrighted material and that's why this community is now dead). I'm not saying that my work was phenomenal but still it was something that I loved doing and a group of people loved seeing as well.  All those hobbies ceased to exist once I started attending University.  


So, my contract ends sometime soon and I have the possibility to maybe extend it for a little bit. My initial plan since the day I got employed was to extend my contract as much as I could and then try to get a better job/position in the field of CS. Lately, I've started thinking that maybe I should take a turn in my life/career and do something else. Maybe, follow my passion for digital art, animation and video editing. That would require me not having a job for quite some time, even more than 2 years, and live from my current savings (which are pretty okay due to my current well paid but not enough to last me forever). Which also means I would have to accept that my lifestyle is not going to be the same anymore. I don't care about restaurants or buying fancy things but traveling is one of the most important things in my life. I understand, though, that sacrifices have to be made.  


So, I was searching for potential places where I could get some expertise on those fields and I found some that really caught my attention but most of them, if not all, required a portfolio or at least some creative experience. Mine is close to zero at the moment, since it has been more than 8 years that I last did anything mildly creative. That means I would have to take some time off and work on my skills from zero. To be honest, that sounds really frightening 'cause I would have to take the leap and trust myself that I can make it in that field and make a hobby profitable at some point. At the same time I would have to still afford accommodation as going back to my parents in my home-country is not possible right now, and I don't want to anyway.   


My question is, should I take that leap of faith and invest most, if not all, of my savings to try something completely different from what I currently do? I know there were many people who aspired to become artists or animators and they ended up failing and that scares me.",25Nov2019,1

667,"My sister's sort of gone off the deep end. She's been in a horrible relationship for about 12 years now with a guy who purposely isolates her in different states, sometimes leaving her alone wherever they are while he goes on 'traveling assignments' (he's a traveling x-ray tech by choice because he gets 'paid more' and his assignments are never longer than a year at a time). Recently he convinced her to move to New Mexico for a job assignment that he mysteriously 'lost' and then turn around and immediately left for California for 7 months before they were even settled, leaving her in a state she's never been in by herself with two young kids. Not to mention, he came back with NO money and they were actually in the hole when he returned because he'd spent everything on food, room/board, and a rental car. He's extremely controlling and won't even let her visit her family without having to come too despite having no relatives in our state. I can't remember the last time I saw and talked to just her without him lurking around; he even insisted on coming with us to get pedicures once during one of their few visits. 

It's gotten to the point where I'm starting to see her as a lost cause, but I don't want to abandon my nieces who are still pretty young (the oldest is 12). My sister terrorizes my oldest niece CONSTANTLY by calling her names and projecting HER insecurities onto my niece who is so sweet that she just takes it, but I'm afraid that one day my sister will break her. I swear, every time I talk to my sister, my niece is on punishment for something--she was even punished once for something she didn't even do; my younger niece admitted to breaking whatever it was when it happened but my sister STILL punished my oldest niece for it for reasons I still don't know.

 I try showering my oldest niece with love every chance I get, but my sister is so manipulative that she won't let me talk to my nieces without talking on the phone to her first, and that usually consists of a few hours of her screaming at me,  yelling at my niece in the background, and generally being upset before I finally have to get off the phone. It's gotten to be too much for me lately that I don't bother answering the phone or texts anymore, but I don't want to abandon my nieces because I love them and I'm scared for them. They don't deserve to be punished because their parents are horrible. The last time I saw them in person was this summer and my parents and I spent the entire time smothering them with so much love that my oldest niece actually broke down crying and saying she can't feel anything at home.

672,"Maybe this belongs in /r/offmychest but here we go....

My boyfriend of several years is a wonderful, funny and smart individual. I care deeply for him. However, he has had some serious issues with his emotions and rage throughout our relationship. I feel that this is in part due to his mother being in and out of prison throughout most of his childhood (starting around when he was 2 months). She was incarcerated 5 times for writing bad checks (that we know of, though we suspect more). His parents divorced when he was around 10 or so. He adores his mother, and I have absolutely no problem with them being in each others lives. His sister refuses to speak to their mother any longer. His father is a Jehovah’s Witness and hasn’t seemed too interested in his sons life. He never calls/texts or invites us to anything. He also seems emotionally distant from his children. 

She claims she is “done with doing bad things”...though, we’ve witnessed some questionable behavior. After only
meeting her one time, she asked if I would add her to my credit card so she could raise her credit score. She is rather awkward, which doesn’t bother me too much, but I feel as if she is never genuine. She doesn’t work (besides a few odd jobs here and there). She has adopted a little boy, now 4, from a family member who was into drugs and lost custody. There is a clear lack of discipline with this little boy, already. He seems cognitively behind and has terrible tantrums - all the time. 

As far as my significant other (27 years old), he has severe trouble organizing, focusing and controlling himself. I would say he likely has the emotional capacity of a child. He has rage outbursts. He breaks things, calls me names, grabs me, pushes me. Now I know some of you are thinking “just leave him, you idiot!”....but I’m not ready to give up on him. He has no goals. He has no car, no bike, his mom pays for his cell phone, I pay for the majority of our things/food. He thinks it’s ok to only work 25 hours each week at a low paying job. He lives in filth. He practically refuses to clean or do dishes. He literally needs his hand held with every little task. He recently opened his first checking account, with persuasion from me. He goes months without doing laundry. I’m trying my best to teach him the life skills his parents never taught him. I do believe his mother being gone has had a lasting effect on him. I believe he feels neglected. Perhaps depressed. 

When we get in an argument or fight, he mostly just interrupts me instead of letting me calmly explain my viewpoint. He doesn’t know how to discuss anything rationally, in my opinion. He refuses to see both sides of any argument. Very stubborn, like a child. Often, he will threaten suicide so I don’t leave (though, I’m nearly positive he won’t ever kill himself). He is never wrong in his mind. 

I’ve offered to pay for anger management and counseling. I don’t know if it will work. But it’s worth a try, in my opinion. He has admitted several times that he believes he needs help.

He tells his mother things about our relationship. Especially negative things and now she doesn’t like me. I feel that she enables him. She’s rather see us break up instead of helping him progress and come up with a solution to his issues. She tells him there is nothing wrong with him and he should just break up with me. I try explaining to him that I only ask for him to try counseling out of concern and love for him. I think she just wants to stay on his side because she doesn’t ever want him to stop talking to him...she wants him to feel like he can do no wrong in her eyes. 

There is a lot of good in his heart, too. I hate only voicing the bad stuff. He is an excellent artist, he is very smart and mechanical (food with puzzles). I know he is capable of so much, but he just has no motivation. 

How do I get my boyfriend to see that I only want to help him, without him feeling embarrassed and hurt? Should I confront his mother about his behavior?",25Nov2019,1

Her father and twin sister were in a bad car accident, and are hospitalised. The father will need surgeries on his leg, and her sister will need multiple oral reconstructive  surgeries. My question is, I was thinking about ordering flowers to have delivered to her sister and father’s room to support the family.
 

I originally thought it was a good idea, but I didn’t want it to look like I’m trying too hard, simply because I’m now courting, or “talking to” her, and I didn’t want it to be taken the wrong way (using her father and sister’s injuries as an excuse to send them/her flowers, which isn’t true).

1. N : There’s this friend of mine that is very arrogant and pushy.

He keeps blocking me and leaving calls whenever he gets tired of me but then goes to talk to me when he has no one else to talk to, and I am always acting very politely and as nice as possible to him (as well as to every other person around me) . 

He always ‘asserts his superiority’ over me, either by simply saying something immature like “Shut up, I’m the best , you’re just a hater, I’m so much better than you” or just mocking me in various ways, often being about  him mimicking my shyness and my word stumbling, him calling me a “sir fangirl” (replacing the teacher’s name by ‘sir’) because I have very high respect for teachers , especially for ‘Sir’, someone I care a lot for , just minor things like that that become slightly hurtful after being repeated numerous times. I’m tired of it.

Sometimes at school he even tells me to get out from his way because he doesn’t feel like staying with me.

The other ‘friends’ are just simply immature (making mundane jokes like ‘haha penis poop so funny’ or spitting water in their food at the cafeteria ) they’re basically considered the ‘weirdos’ of the school, not to mention they’re really mean as individuals, and are almost impossible for me to engage with  in a conversation , which frankly makes me wonder how I grew up with them and became friends in the first place. 

I tried to escape numerous times but then I have no one to stay with, and am considered as ‘weird’ by students , as well as teachers. 
I don’t want to come off as weird to ‘Sir’ , either. He’s the only person I genuinely care about in this establishment. And he’s only person who cares about me here, too. I’m grateful for that. 

No, I cannot make new friends as I already know everybody (here before 1st grade, this school is composed of both elementary and high school ) and my class consists of sassy kids and bullies. 
The only people  I truly got along with are , well , school counselors and teachers. That’s about it.

And it’s always so hard to get out of the group because everyone is a part of one. I tried to get out of this group long ago but realized that by doing that I isolate myself from everybody. *Everybody.* It was nice for a while, but not until people started noticing.

I find it complicated to take part in a friend group, especially one that doesn’t consist of  true , nice friends. I’m sad that I always get dragged down by them and looked as an ‘inferior’, yet they still want me to stay under their lead for them to stomp on me everytime.  I’m irritated that I have to compel to a standard in order to stay with people. I don’t like that. I want to be understood.",25Nov2019,1
682,"Hello. This is a wall of text, and I apologize. This is a repost, after adding some info.

TLDR at the bottom.

My girlfriend of two and a half years broke up with me just the other day (Both in our early twenties). She said she had seen it coming for a while, but for me it came as a huge shock, and I honestly don't know how to cope. When we talked, she said she still loved me, and that she wanted us to be friends, and maybe one day we could be together. She has some personal issues she's working with, and I understand she needs to face them alone. Though I felt very confused, and not sure how to handle the situation, I let it happen. My main goal has always been to make her happy. As far as I can remember, we've never been in any huge fights or anything like that. She had however mentioned that she had a few crushes on some people we both know. Nothing out of the ordinary. I guess a lot of people imagine themselves with people sometimes? This happened in the morning, so she headed to uni, while I took care of some other business before going down there as well. We live extremely close, so we've basically been living together the last 2 and a half years. 

Here's where I need advice.. She hadn't eaten anything that morning, so on the way down, I popped by the store and got her something. Taking care of her had become somewhat of a routine for me? Anyway, I go to the room where she always works, which is a small room, and what do I find inside? Her and a common friend of ours, that she mentioned she has a crush on, who has a crush on her too. They weren't doing anything special. I just said hi, handed her the food and swiftly got out.. We did talk after that, and after a lot of tears she told me she didn't really think we could get back together, and that she was falling in love with said common friend, but she also said she still loved me, and didn't want to lose me. If she actually did leave me for herself, I'd be fine. But if she gets together with this other guy, can I even get out of this situation and still have respect for them at all? Do people deserve to be treated this way?

It was the same story with my first gf, but I saw that coming from a mile away, but this time is different. I don't think I can handle being the second choice *AGAIN*.

I am absolutely heart-broken. The entire situation is so surreal, and all I feel is an immense cold and loneliness. I've talked to multiple friends of mine and my parents, but all I've been told is that ""You've been such a perfect couple, I'm sure you'll get through this."" I don't think I will be able to see her, or the common friend in the eyes again for a while. I am just completely stuck with the image of them in the room in my head. I've just been crying my eyes out at every opportunity when I'm alone. I haven't been able to head to university the past days either, and we're on top of the exam weeks now. To me this just feels like a horrible nightmare, and it's all so surreal. I'd like to avoid seeing a therapist, and rather get through this on my own with the help of my close ones, but I know I have to start with myself, but not sure how. She had definitely become a part of my lifestyle, and I spent massive amounts of energy to ensure her mental health was improving.. I don't feel entitled to anything because of that, though... She was my everything and I gave her everything.

TLDR: Gf broke up with me out of nowhere, says she still loves me but also likes a common friend who likes her back. I find them in the same room same day as the breakup. Need help getting over this mental image and situation.",25Nov2019,1
683,"Ok, here is an example of a cycle I seem to always experience when it comes to befriending people:

&amp;#x200B;

I meet someone, get to know them, spend a lot of time with them (messaging, hanging out in person, etc) for a good few months, and then approximately four or five months later I just become so irritated with them seemingly constantly. Like, I know they mean a lot to me and I enjoy being their friend, but for example I'll see a message pop up from them or a post from them online and I'll just be annoyed? I think hate is a very strong word but I always feel like I grow to ""hate"" my friends, even though I consciously know I care about them and enjoy their company? Is this normal? How do you get over this? I swear I love my friends with all my heart but I can't help from feeling this way sometimes.",25Nov2019,1

686,"Hello! I am reaching out to you all this afternoon because I have recently came into a very bad situation. 

Walking into French class this morning (I’m a fresh at university), I had *without thinking* patted a girl on the knee, as a gesture to say hello, nice to see you, etc. This was taken as an inappropriate gesture by the other girls in class. While I, admittedly, walked out of the class with her to formally apologize, because I truly did see this gesture as inappropriate, she informed me that the other girls in the class were going to stay behind after class and talk to the professor to inform her of the *OTHER* times I had also touched them “inappropriately.”

I’m a very touchy guy. I hug all my guy friends, and usually give high fives to those in classes, shake hands, or pat people on the back. I have never once done an inappropriate gesture that was poorly  intentioned. 

I believe the other girls are over exaggerating as I believe the physical contact they are referring to is the pat on the back. Which I always saw as a friendly gesture, so I don’t understand why this is being blown out of proportion. I firmly believe that a pat on the back should be seen as still is within the bounds of acceptable behavior with those you have gotten to know over five months of being in class twice a week. 

These are folks that I saw as my friends. 

Please, anyone, correct me if I simply just ignorant and I’m missing the point. Please put me in my place if I truly did something wrong. Like I said, I acknowledge what I did this morning was inappropriate and a truly do regret doing so as it was a lack of judgment and poor thinking. 

Let me know what everyone thinks. Thank you.",25Nov2019,1
688,"It's a long one! Buckle up... 

&amp;#x200B;

**A little backstory:** 

**A little over a month ago i lost my best friend. We had been friends for over ten years, were roommates, i'm talking a sitcom kind of friendship. My friend dreamt of settling down in life, meeting a woman, marrying her and becoming a dad and if anyone deserved it, it was him. He came really close, finding a wife and she got pregnant, but the marriage burned down and the baby passed away due to the mother being less than responsible fairly early in the pregnancy.**  

&amp;#x200B;

Now, on to today. My friend passed away and is long gone. Today i found out that the girl (let's call her A, she's 19) he was seeing at the time is pregnant. She didn't have an abortion due to her family's religious beliefs and is now planning on giving the baby up for adoption. Now, that on it's own doesn't seem like too much of an issue, better that than the baby growing up with a mother that resents her, right? 

My issue lays with the fact that she doesn't plan on finding or being involved in finding a suitable family for her baby. She plans on handing the baby over to the system upon her being born and never looking back. Now, without insulting people who work in the fostercare/adoptionsystem. I'm worried about her ending up stuck in the system, bouncing from home to home and potentially being abused. 

Now, upon finding this out i did step out of my place (i'm fully aware that i don't have any right to) and pointed out that it might be better to actively find a good family, etc. When i did so, she shrugged and said ''Why don't you take it then''. My initial response was ''fuck no'', i have two kids of my own and i'm already a single mum. I work fulltime and i'm about to start a new job, but i have been mauling this over all day and i default to making ''lists'' when faced with a decision. 

So: 

Why it would be an option; 

\- I am more than capable in every practical way to raise another baby. (I have a well paying job that would technically speaking allow me to take care of more than 3 kids comfortably , i have a suitable home, childcare for when i'm at work can be sorted, etc.) 

\- I know what raising a child entails. I have two kids of my own, I know exactly what i'm getting in to. I know it's going to be difficult, i do NOT underestimate the consequences this decision will bring to me and my family. 

\- I would know for a fact she is well taken care of and safe. That she'll grow up with every opportunity available. 

\- If my friend would have had this baby (because i know for a fact he would have taken full responsibility for her) when he passed away, i would have taken her in anyway, just like he would have taken care of my children if something happened to me. 

\- I could make sure she knows where she comes from, who her daddy is. Up until this point i have kept emotion out of it as good as i could, because this is a decision that not only impacts me but my children and the baby in question as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Why it wouldn't be an option; 

\- I really don't love the idea of starting over again. The milk, the diapers, the endless doctors appointments,... But at the same i don't feel like this ''inconvenience'' is worth the risk of a child ending up in a shitty system, yet it should be considered. 

\- I'm afraid that she'll grow up feel less loved than my biological children. Obviously i would do anything in my power to treat and love them equally, but the parents amongst us know that there's nothing and no one you can love as much as your own children. There's no way around that and even though i would NEVER do anything to even imply that, but part of me is afraid she'll know anyway. 

\- I fear it might be hard on me, emotionally to watch the daughter of the friend i no longer have grow up without him being right there with her. Those aren't emotions i'd want to reflect on her. She deserves to grow up as ''normal'' as possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some additional information: According to my lawyer she can ''easily'' (i use this term loosely) sign over her parental rights to me, making this ''permanent'' and protecting me from her changing her mind in about 10 years. I would not have to go trough the adoptionprocess and I would effectively be the ''parent'' in the eyes of the law. Other than that i know for a fact that neither his or her family (grandparents, brothers or sisters, etc) are even near interested in adopting this little girl. Fostering her untill a good home is found has been considered, but knowing myself i wouldn't have the heart to watch her leave, i barely do now. 

 So, reddit. 

What would your opinion/advice on this be?",25Nov2019,1
689,"Hi reddit! Throwaway bc my s/o knows my account.

Some background, my s/o doesn't have the best history with the holiday season, his birthday was earlier in November and a few of his gifts had shipping issues. He buys everything he actively wants within a few weeks of wanting it, and doesn't talk much about his wants anyway.

I've been wanting a ps4 for a bit over a year now, having given mine up due to moving states on somewhat short notice.
Last night we were scrolling together and I asked the cost of one i saw for sale online on his screen, hoping it would be a bit cheap because I work through black friday and was considering getting one.

He went ""welp, since you already know what I'm looking at,"" and revealed he was getting me a ps4 + red dead redemption bundle, a suuuper nice razer headset, and a vinyl for the ps4 of one of my fave games in my fave color, coordinating w the headset.

I'm extremely grateful and ecstatic and I want to get him something to make him feel the same.

He's super into pc gaming, tactical gear like folding knives, and hiking/travel/camping/vanlife/tinyhouse things.
He has a huge community of gaming friends online that are likely to get him gaming wants he may have, but his fave games are League of Legends, Rainbow Six Siege, Dark Souls, and For Honor. He says he mainly plays them for the time he can spend with his online friends, the main one of which already has his own xmas plans iirc.

He's very specific abt the knives bc he already has a collection- needs to be weighty, compact, not assisted-open, a high-quality brand, and have a unique feature. (he's got plenty with window breakers, seatbelt cutters, sharpeners, fancy handles/clips, etc)

He wants to hike/camp more! He talks more about wanting to do it than any specific gear.

His fave stores are 5.11 Tactical, Sierra Trading Post, and Duluth Trading Co.

His tertiary interests include NASA/space, indie/lo-fi music, and field medicine (we're both in training to become paramedics, he's the type that keeps a fully equipped medkit in hIs EDC)

He likes gifts he knows he'll use, too

694,"Title basically says it all. 

Background info... I'm a 15 year old Brazilian girl who's lived in the United States from 3-14 years of age. I met my dad's side of the family 4 months ago and have been living with my grandparents ever since.
I got kicked out by my mum because I snuck out of the house to get laid and came back drunk + tried to kill myself.

 Everything's been really great since then, except for a few fights with my dad but that's to be expected from me (I can't not fight with everyone).

Except on Wednesday I made out with my cousin. 

I've been crushing on him a little from the beginning, and I annoyed him too much this night by stealing his boot... I genuinely wanted to try on both of his boots but he only let me try one on so we ended up wrestling on the floor at church.

And he closed the door once everyone else was gone, said that we needed to talk, eventually ended up asking if I liked him and wanted to kiss... But I'm a horny teenager so yes of course I wanted to kiss
Like. An. Idiot.

On Friday I was at my uncle's lanchonete (mini restaurant type thing) with my dad and my cousin showed up because he works there. I forgot he works there. 
So I kept texting him that we need to talk
And I kept insisting
So he went home because I'm an annoying bitch.

We fought over text at 1 in the morning and then I cried while walking home in the rain, as you do.

I spilled my guts out to my dad because I was heartbroken (and frankly still am).

Saturday morning I told the bishop of our church what happened.

That night, my dad told everything to my uncle.

Yesterday (Sunday), the bishop made me reconfess in front of my grandma.

Today, my uncle read the argument between me and my cousin +, showed my dad the texts as well. Plus my grandma.

Grandma said that if this is too serious, I'm moving to São Paulo to live with my other grandmother because she's not keeping me here.

My dad texted me saying ""we gave you a chance to start anew..."".



And that's that. I'm utterly destroyed and have no idea how I lost my entire family AGAIN.  I swear to God I've been getting better as a person--- and people have told me this... But I fucked up too much.

They were giving me nearly 35 hours, which IMO, is a bit much for a pre-nursing student trying to get As in science classes. About 2-3 weeks ago, I got hired at another retail store. The job itself isn't bad, but the hours are horrendous. This week, I was only given 11 hours for the week. Next week, I was only given 9.

697,"I graduated college a few months ago and moved from the east coast to the west coast for a job in healthcare. I took this job to experience living in a new city/working before applying to med school this upcoming May-- this means that I won't actual matriculate into medical school until 2021 (two gap years). 

My main goal during this gap year was to study for the MCAT and take it in March and hopefully do really well. With this in mind, I'm debating just moving back home to study hard and make that my only priority. I'm starting to think that maybe moving out here just gave me more distractions. I feel like I'm wasting time when I could just be at home and sacrifice a few months to really buckle down and just study. Right now, I work 9 hours a day and that takes away from how much studying I can do. Additionally, I've been having some mental health issues that I feel like are heightened due to my drinking/drug habits right now. So I'm thinking that it might be good to move back home, re-center myself, go to therapy, and get help. 

On the other hand, I'm worried that if I move back home I'll regret it because I live in a small suburban town (I would be more inclined to move back home if it was in a city). Additionally, I don't really have any friends at home anymore so I'm worried I'll be lonely and get more depressed. However, I feel like I should just really make this sacrifice to reach my end goal which is to do well on the MCAT so I can get into medical school. Moving back home would just be temporary compared to my long run goals.

I’ve been with her for 7 years and I am 24 years old and I intend to stay with her forever. I don’t need a break from her or anything, I want to be with her forever, but a boys trip to Thailand sounds fucking fantastic. Once in a lifetime experience. Being in a relationship the entirety of my youth has restricted me from ever experiencing life solo. I’ve never gone to a bar and talked to women, hooked up with them, had one night stands, or even just met people by myself and not have to account for myself to anyone all night. That’s fine most of the time but the thoughts and desires are always there. I’m not oblivious to the thought that I’m getting older and one day I’ll be old and have never experienced what most people get to in their 20s. I didn’t get to in college and as it looks now, I never will. 
That’s being said, I don’t care to have an open relationship, or meet people locally. A vacation where I can cut back and just be free with my friends that I have neglected for years sounds just fine. Almost every older guy (dads) I know have gone to Thailand; when their wives don’t really care what they do and would rather them go just so they can have free reign at home or go on a vacation of their own. Perhaps that would be my case in the future, but I am not interested in being an old geezer in Thailand. Right now I’m youthful and at my prime. Right now is my best opportunity in life. Older white men with young Thai hookers is disgusting. Sorry if that is you lol. But I am not that guy. Meeting other young people as a young Individual, and staying in hostels is fun. Hookers are not fun and I really have no interest in that.

I am very healthy, I exercise almost daily,  I am vegan, I limit my sugar intake, I spend a lot of time outdoors and  in nature, I drink plenty of water, I visit the doctor as necessary, I  help out people whenever possible, I try to live as ethically as  possible, I have great and healthy hobbies, I live in a great area with  awesome people, I regularly volunteer and help with charities, I clean  up public and natural spaces whenever possible, I have a loving and  caring family, I spend a lot of time with my pets and do fun things with  them, I am very friendly around people, I have great friends and  regularly spend time with them, I do well in school, I am smart, I  travel quite often, I visit local businesses and farmer's markets, and I  am a part of a few great clubs at school (including the swim team on  which I am pretty good).

However, If I died tomorrow I wouldn't care at all (not that I'd have much choice). I **DO NOT**  make any active effort at killing or harming myself, and I try to look  after my mental health as much as possible. But I don't really care  about myself much. I don't share much with people because I figure that  they wouldn't care much about it, because I know that they wouldn't care  much about what I'm talking about because everyone seems so self  absorbed. I also hate boasting, or talking about myself, and I much  prefer to listen to other people and what they have to say as it seems  far more interesting than what I have to say. However, I have been told  that I am very funny and I find it easy to make people laugh. I also  have a very relaxed sense of humor and I find lots of things funny  (light, heavy, dark, PC, slap-stick, etc. humor of all kinds) and I love  to laugh.

But  like I said, I don't care if I live or die. I'm not scared of death  either, I feel like it's a silly thing to be scared of. While driving, I  often think about what would happen if I drove into oncoming traffic or  something like a barrier or wall. Tasks require a lot of motivation to  complete, but I can find the motivation and I get stuff done, but I am  constantly getting distracted by other things. I feel like I don't ever  fully connect to people and that they all find me weird. I never want to  be a bother or burden to someone else or interrupt what they're doing  or future plans, so I don't like to text or talk to people over the  internet much. I also distrust the internet and what I do on it (but  that's unrelated and more a paranoid socialist type thing).

I  have a tendency to say really dumb, or do really dumb things that I  think ends up hurting and distancing people, but I never try to, and I  hate making people feel bad and distancing them. I hate developing  romantic relationships with people as I don't want to be attached to one  person and tend to have more friends with benefits type relationships  and platonic relationships, as well as regular friends. I feel as though  I never develop true connections with people and I also tend to hurt  and break relationships really easily without meaning too. I tend to go  in waves as to how often I talk to or interact with someone, which sends  mixed messages and makes for weak connections but I seem to do it  regardless of how hard I try not to.

I  also have a hard time reading my own feelings and regularly feel kind  of empty instead, so I force myself to do other things and ignore those  feelings. I struggle to determine if I'm feeling happy, or anxious, or  mad, or sad, or excited, or romantic, or comedic, or lazy, or full of  energy, etc. so I usually just show or act how people would expect me to  act, because I don't feel much (good or bad) so I figure that I should  show something. I spend a lot of time with other people, and they seem  to have fun with me, but I always feel that they're hanging out with me  out of obligation or pity and that they have a million different things  that they'd rather do. Most of my friends don't share the same interests  as me, and the people who do are people that I find really weird, which  makes me nervous that that is how I'm viewed by my friends even though I  know that I am very different to them.

I  have lots of hobbies that I do, that I enjoy (I think), like candle  making, cooking, baking, running, swimming, cycling, programming, doing  techie stuff, gaming (video games and board games), eating new things,  exploring places, brewing kombucha, hiking, and driving. I do a lot of  those to relax and try to focus on ones that make me healthier and  happier.

The world also seems like it's becoming such as terrible, dystopian  place, and I really want to be able to make it better and help other  people in less fortunate situations than me (such as becoming a doctor,  working for a charity, or becoming a politician that actually works for  people, not corporations), but at the same time I feel like I would be  less of a burden on everyone and the world if I died and didn't have to  consume anything else or have the potential of hurting more people and  the planet.

I  don't know if any of that stuff is related, but like I said before, I  don't care if I live or die. Either one seems just as great to me. I  feel like no one except for my immediately family would even notice if I  died or left. I don't know if that is normal or not, and if I should  seek and professional advice for anything.",25Nov2019,1
713,I have known this girl for about 6 months and we have been talking to the point where we are best friends and she’s always been there for me and vice versa. It’s just that I caught feelings for her and she doesn’t feel the same way. So I told her the best thing I could do was to distance myself with her and eventually those feelings will go away. But things have been hard since I’m always used to texting and snapping her. The issue I have is that she tries to talk to me and she often snaps me and stuff and I don’t want to seem rude that I’m just not gonna talk to her. It gets tempting when she talks to me because I’m soo used to talking to her on a daily basis. I just constantly try to distance myself but it’s just that I really miss her as a person and I don’t know what to do anymore.,25Nov2019,1
714,"Okay this one should be obvious, but I’m in a real dilemma here. It is also a little rant cause of the confidentiality and I don’t have that many to talk about this with.

So I work as a personal assistant, and my boss is 50yo man. Me I’m 20yo and female and I really do enjoy this work despite what is going down.

This man has a condition that makes him have these involuntary erections. Okay, fine I’m a care giver, I can deal with that. But sometimes(1-3 times a month) these erections HAS to be relieved or he will be in great pain. This sounds like BS I know, but that is what it is. His previous assistant have helped him, with hand job I presume but I wouldn’t be surprised if they did it in other ways too. Me, I’m not into that. A hand job? Sure. But he says he HAS to touch and feel and all this that crosses a line with me. I told him and he respected it. He said it was no obligation to getting the job BUT it will limit his day to day life. So I got the job, and now two months later he says it is becoming a problem. He has basically told me if I cannot so this for him, he will have to find a new assistant that can after Christmas and in a sense of course I understand.

Now, lay aside the thoughts of an old man grooming a young naive female. I’ve heard it. I know and I’ve accepted it. But I do need advice on how to move on. I’ve signed a lease for a place that is usually seen as expensive but since I had this job it was no problem. But now that my paycheck might not last that long, I need advice on how to proceed. Is this legal? What do I do? If I agree to do it, I whore myself out for money( witch is fine if you are comfortable with it, but I’m not) and if I don’t I loose the well paying job.

He also kinda called me not ambitious because and in his words “if you want a high paying job you will need to sacrifice. Weather that is pride, your “moral compass”, body or service”... 

So legal? What do I do? How do I proceed?

717,"So I have a very odd way of looking at life.

 I just don't give a fuck. 

I don't know why people care about the earth or human race. It's useless. I don't want to kill myself or anything (although if I were to die it wouldn't matter), but I want to know some valid reasons why I shouldn't. 

This way of thinking has got me to overcome fears and get out of my comfort zone because if something happens, who cares? You're gonna die, at some point the human race will be extinct and the earth will explode. Why should I care? People are always saying ""save the earth, don't litter, global warming blah blah blah"". Who CARES. 

I know what your thinking, ""if you don't care about anything than why do you care about this?""

Since we moved in months ago, they've only ever kept (and restocked) liquid and powder fabric softeners and ""scent enhancers."" They've never cleaned the dryer vent. When we moved in, I was surprised it would still function with that much lint in it, or hadn't started a fire. I don't think they use our laundry soap, or leave the lint due to laziness - I genuinely think they don't know how to do laundry. Most friends I've asked say it's too invasive to tell an adult how to do laundry. It hasn't caused problems with the machines or our clothes, so I've just tried to ignore it. But, I feel like if I were in the same situation I'd want to know. My partner thinks a ""how-to do laundry"" poster would be too passive aggressive. What do you think?

721,"Welp i actually made an account for this. 

for some context. I am a 20 year old guy who has struggeled with self confidence in the past but and it is still not at the highest level, the friend in question knows this.

Well a couple of days ago i went out with a good friend of mine and a friend of hers that i have met a couple of times before. When we met up i was the only one that was already tipsy, they were still sober. So first we had some beers and while we were having those beers, my body finnaly noticed that i had worked all week and all day ( first full time work week). So i didnt really felt like going on anymore so i was doubting to go home, because i didnt really wanted to go on anymore, but otherwise i would just be home being tiredand they are really nice people so i let them convince me to go get some pizza and i could decide afterwards. 

So in the pizzaplace we had some pizza and we were having a conversation about what they wanted to with me the rest of the night. I said i kinda wanted to go home after the pizza, and they starting convincing me that i should come with them because they would start the process of making me a womanizer. I was still not really looking forward to it because i dont even really want to be a womanizer, but i still not really wanted to be home alone ( it was still like 9:30). So they kept trying to convince me by stating the all the benefits of being a womanizer. And they were also saying that i otherwise wouldnt find a proper gf and that i would end an incel ( involuntairy celibate), and then stating that i was basicly already an incel since i was still a virgin. And they kept trying to convince me that i should come with them eventhough i didnt really want to. But being easy to convince/influence (which the friend even talked about in the convo) and being drunk at this point i went with them. 

( the acquaintance was doing most of the actual ""pushing"", but she aggreed to al his points and statements with created pressure to go)

After that they tried to get me to loosen up and start dancing. So we did 6 shots, nothing happened there but i still didnt really feel comfortable after what happened in the pizza place. Then we deciced to leave cause the music sucked and when we where outside i said i was leaving.

After that we had a convo ( ill do my best to translate it)

Me: Yo, i have to say thati thought that tonight wasn't really nice nor comfortable and i can't really a appreciate that you were pushing me that hard, eventhough you knew i wasnt in the right mood and that i am a person that is really easy to convince/ walk over me.

Friend: Ehm OP, i dunno. But i didnt push you. acquaintance did, i only tried to give you a another perspective and see if you might like it. I didnt push through so to me you shouldnt bitch/complain and i really cant apreciate this.

Me: well okay, if you think about it like that fine, but to me it felt like puhsing. Not as hard as acquaintance but it felt like it. Everybody sometimes had the problem that they dont come across as they intend to. If you think you werent pushing it is fine, but the next time can you tune the ""giving me a perspective"" down. 

the next day i send her a message if she was still angry. She hasnt responded to it yet.

So i have 2 questions i do something (majorly) wrong here? and i can i try to fix this without crawling back to her like a lapdog?

It got worrisome just a couple of days ago.  My friends and I decided to get in contact with his little sister and ask where he’s been.  She then said “now that I think of it, I haven’t seen *name* in over a week too”.

727,"F(18) here, 

Me and my sister (20), have always had a bad relationship. 

To kind of sum it up, she's 'popular' in the sense of her sucking her way up to the top (not really?? uh she's uneducated, doesn't have any life skills.. she can't even speak formally - she uses 'pacifically' instead of 'specifically'....) BUT people find her attractive for whatever reason, because she presents herself as 'pretty' and a 'bad gyal' (murder me for using that.. terminology..?) on her instagram. I am always irritated by her, but on the days that I feel like being kind and helping her out, e.g this morning where I made her breakfast and asked if she were doing okay, since she just disappears in the middle of the night without saying a word, she thanked me but the moment I get a lock installed for my door - This is because she has a history of stealing my belongings like my underwear, bras, clothes, toothbrush, loofa (YES, I have to hide my loofa in my room because last time she used my things without telling me I caught ringworm.. Not even FROM her, from her ex boyfriend,, WHO ALSO CHEATED ON HER ALL THE TIME BACK THEN so i dont even know if that ringworm was HIS,,,,,, 

I hope you understand my frustration?? Like, I am scared of catching anything else because she lives like a fucking a troll. I constantly feel like I am being WAY too paranoid or that I'm being greedy etc. Maybe I am overreacting? I don't know lolol.

I'm nowhere near being done. 

Her attitude towards me is disgusting, even though I am her younger sister I feel like I'M the only that should be setting up an example. She had always chosen her friends over me, completely shuts down anything I suggest or advice her simply because I am younger than her??? She always projects her insecurities onto me in the weirdest ways. Like, I always feel as if I'm walking on ice talking to her. Any word I say I say with fear, fear of being picked at, fear of her nitpicking at all my insecurities because regardless of her being like this to me, I always used to confide in her, seeing as we are both from a dysfunctional family. Wrong. She absorbs all of my weaknesses and uses them against me. For example, I have always been insecure and have been struggling with an E.D (and many more), She steals something out of my closet, and I confront her about it and she tells me ""It doesn't fit you anyway"" or ""You're too chubby for this"". She knows that I struggle with the shit that I do, but she continues to bring me down anyway. I really envy you people with siblings you can get along with. Must be really nice lolol.

Anyway, there's more comments about my history with self harm, hallucinations, depressive episodes and etc. You can already imagine the shit she'd say to me. 

It's really hard trying to barely get by with depression, but to have someone like this on your back, constantly, is much worse. 

I try to observe my sisters' behavior pattern as I would observing an animals'. But due to my own mental health, our relationship is something I am not able to maintain as stable or even non existent. I've tried ignoring her, and not saying anything but her words will hit harder if I don't defend myself. 

I have gotten my 'justice' a couple of times in the past, I've pulled her hair so hard and punched her drooping tits in, but I only get reminded of how much I am like my father. 

I have more reasons to hate her, not only does she treat people like shit, but animals too.

In the last 3 years, she's had over 7 cats. 

She would get one of the guys that use her for her body to get her a kitten

She never stayed home to take care of the kitten, she'd leave it to shit and piss everywhere, for it to starve and die of heat exhaustion. My mum had always been sick of her bullshit but it keeps repeating itself. My sister would pretty much only takes pictures with the kitten, post it on her instagram or snapchat, whatever, but after that she would neglect it further.

My boyfriend actually rescued 2, one of them which had developed some sort of territorial habits and some pretty sad stuff. The other one is perfectly fine and thriving because I was there to take care of her. But now, thankfully, she lives with the other cat at my boyfriends home. 

Sadly, the other 5 didn't make it, and have all suffered.

I think I might be going off track, but I just can't stress how much hate I have for her.",25Nov2019,1

I’ve been feeling really down lately, like crazy depressed, so naturally i was like ok time to get drunk out of my mind and forget about my problems for a bit lol. 

I was comfortable doing this because one of my friends was DD and my other friend doesn’t drink, so the both of them tend to keep an eye out for the rest of us (i had already told the both of them i was planning on getting completely wasted and they said it was fine). 

Fast forward to after I had like 5 or so shots and was drinking coolers throughout the night (i’m a lightweight what can i say), and i was on the verge of being completely fucked.

I’ve been on off seeing this dude, we had a casual thing going on, and he’s at the party. i don’t remember too much of this, but my two sober friends were with me at the time and they told me he kept saying “damn babe you’re fucked huh? yooo guys look how fucked she is!! haha she’s completely out of it! can you even stand? hahaa you’re so wobbly... etc” so he knew how drunk i was and was just advertising it to everyone else as a joke.

he started making out with me and stuff, i mean i tend to be really affectionate when i’m drunk so i don’t really mind that. he then took me to a room upstairs and according to my friends he came back down immediately and left, my sober friends thought he took me with him so they assumed i was safe and stuff. (i texted him afterwards and asked if we ended up doing anything and he said he just brought me up there cause he didn’t want me making too many bad decisions and that he thought i could get some rest.)

but the thing is, i woke up the next day and i was completely sore in areas, like, it felt like i had drunk sex. dude, i started freaking out, i went out and the host was like “oh look who’s up, i called your friends and they’re coming to get you right now” and i just started freaking out. i was like “was xander here? was he with me last night” and she just shook her head saying i was completely knocked out when she last checked. 

idk what happened, i texted all my friends and the the guy i’m seeing and they’re all freaking out too. i feel guilty cause they all blame themselves for not taking better care of me, but i blame myself for allowing myself to get that drunk. i don’t really know what to do at this point, it’s been 2 days.",25Nov2019,1

Anyway, my problem started when I was younger and I thought glasses were cool for fashion (never wore them though). Then growing older, my vision started getting worse because I was always reading in the dark. When I told my mom I needed glasses she told me I was lying and only wanted them to look cool. Even when I got tested about 2 years ago, the optometrist lady told my mom I had something out of 20 vision and I was going to need glasses, my mom said I faked the test thing. It's ironic, I inevitably doomed myself as a kid because I thought they were cool and now I truly need glasses. What should I do?",25Nov2019,1

740,"Not sure if this is the correct place for this but its worth a shot.

I am a small youtuber and own a website and have contacted by a PR agency asking me to do a review of a product.

They stated the terms would be 2 weeks to prepare the review and finish it and then the product would be collected.

I asked whether it would be possible to keep the product in return for the review / exposure. They said no, its too early to allow me to keep the product and that they suggest I do a minimum of 3 reviews before I can keep the product.

How should I deal with this? I don't think I should be doing any reviews for nothing. That feels as though I am being taken advantage of. Should I ask for payment or?

I have around 550 subs &amp; a website that I run that reaches around 30,000 views a month.

Okay, so it's actually a series. I'm an actress and I've recently been in a series on the most popular network in my country (Imagine BBC). All episodes are finished and are currently being released one by one. Credits are very important to small actors like me. If someone wants you they need your name, and if you want to work with me you need to be able to find me.

But then they started going out even when they don't have their bikes with them. 

Then I asked them to give me a snapchat shout out (I just wanted to meet some new people, I know it's a bit sad but I have no other way really of meeting new people) and they said sure and here I am a month later after asking them a few times and they still haven't done it, but they keep saying things like wait and I'll do it later. 

I'm not sure if I'm a loser and they are embarrassed of me or something. I don't have many friends apart from them either, which leads me to believe this.

746,"My daughter\[15\] recently got a new phone and her face was glued to it our entire family vacation abroad.

We'd been shopping for a bit when I became famished. When we were parked outside a restaurant, my daughter says she's going to stay in the car and message her friends. I tell her we're a family, we're going in and having dinner together. She says she isn't hungry, that she thought we'd be eating later. Some background info, her older sister was hospitalized for an eating disorder, and she's a thin girl who often turns downs meals. All signs she might have an eating disorder too.

The fact that she's refusing to eat is a red flag. I tell her she's coming in, she keeps refusing. Eventually I start raising my voice, and she gets scared and promises that she'll come in, but still says she doesn't have enough of an appetite to eat.

Now this is where I start getting pissed, we start arguing. I want us to have dinner together as a family, and for her to have a healthy relationship with food. She has an attitude, is acting like she has a right to be alone in the car in a foreign country, is disregarding my authority. She starts yelling at me that she's moving out and emancipating herself once we get home, I ask her if she thinks that I care. I tell her father to take her out of the car and shake her. He refuses, saying that he doesn't want to be arrested abroad.

Eventually she promises to eat, but the mood is heavy after all the arguing. I go up to the hotel room and she and my husband leave to get the food. They come back with meals, we all eat in silence. My daughter conveniently has to use the bathroom right after eating, a symptom of bulimia. I tell her she's not going unless I can look at her go. If she has nothing to hide...

She calls me a pervert and refuses to pee. She says it'll be my fault if she gets an infection from holding it in. This goes on for an hour, and I can tell she really has to use the bathroom but is refusing to. I tell her she can go if she doesn't flush the toilet, so we can look after she goes. She tells us we are disgusting. I tell her father to spank her for misbehaving, he says he's not spanking a 15 year old.

In response to the pervert comments I storm out of the hotel room. She tries to stop me but I push her away and yell at her that she was a trashy skank (not my proudest) and said I was leaving for good. I was done with spending a fortune on a vacation and that goes to shit. I went for a long walk, according to my husband she was crying and hyperventilating the entire time that I was gone.

When I got back things were tense and quiet, but the next day things had eased down and I tried to treat it as if nothing happened to enjoy the rest of the vacation. I feel like she is not willing to compromise for the sake of the family, it's all about what she wants to do, when she wants to do it, she's disrespectful of our time and money that went into this vacation.

748,"So I basically have a problem at school where I perform poorly or mediocre (used to be above average) because I don't have any motivation or work ethics to make something good in school. It's a long process from when I was younger where I didn't have to work as hard to get good results but as difficulty and dedication needed to make something good increased I didn't feel like working as hard. Another problem is that I have had too much free time and now can't live without it. I also tend to get more and more demotivated with every bad grade I get in school which has drastically decreased my motivation and work ethics over the years. A whole mess of things that together brings me to where I am now. I don't feel like putting effort into anything unless it's rather simple and because of that I perform poorly and feel like putting even less effort into anything and I don't know where to start with improving myself or how either.

749,"So I'm an inconsistent friend, and I find this really annoys/pisses off a lot of people, and actively prevents me from making new friends 

So to explain what I mean:

I will typically make a friend, and get their number. Some cases, it just stops there. I'm too awkward to text them out of the blue as I never know what to say or if they're in the middle of something. Cut forward, person fades from my life.

On the off chance I actually talk to them, we'll hang out for a few months, get a regular groove, but then I just won't want to be there. I'll want to be alone, and will start making excuses. I'll miss things, and forget things, and soon the person gets annoyed with me and fades away.

Now I've always been a loner. I'm an only child and grew up in a pretty isolated location so I didn't really have a choice. And to be fair, I have consistent friends. Several actually, who understand my tendencies and are cool with it. This is also not a problem with significant others, who for some reason I have no problem making time for and what not.

So I guess my question is, what is wrong with me? Why do I just... ghost? I can't seem to help it, and it's cost me a lot of social fun I would've liked to have. I enjoy being social. But it's like it's just to charge a battery and then boom, I slip away back to my room with my cats and my s.o.

Jedi fallen order : Even worse, i'm a fan of star wars, not a fanatic but you get me, i played it for 10 hours then never touched it. (i watched the gameplay on youtube afterwards because i wanted to know the lore/ how it ends, so i wasted 60 bucks again)

My boyfriend said it was probably just carpet cleaner or new carpet smell (our carpets had been replaced before we moved in) and my bf asked me to wait a little while and give the smell a chance to go away before complaining. Months later and the smell is still here. It’s concentrated around the edges of the room where the carpet meets the wall and mostly in the living room. The apartment says it’s impossible that the floors could smell like pee because the baseboard was sealed and we have new carpets. I’m dubious because MUCH of our apartment was shoddily done - faulty wiring causing power outages and burning outlets, doors and windows not screwed in properly or put in sideways, deadbolt that malfunctions, etc. I’m paying over a thousand dollars a month to live here and I expect it to be nicer than it is.

I tried my best to help her, talk to her and tell her to seek help ; she listened and is seeing a psychiatric (is this how you say it ???) So hopefully she will get better. But she still has phases where she says on social media that she wants to commit suicide, and I still very concerned about that. She tells me it's ""for the meme"" but I'm not too sure about that lmao

Unfortunately, I started having feelings for her, and at a party we even exchanged kisses, and even more after it was over. I was like cool, maybe she wants to be with me or something ? But i'm a bit too naive she just wanted to fuck.

I know she doesn't want to have a bf for now and I totally respect that, it's not like I'll force her to anything, but I'm afraid a part of me just wants to help her to then ask her out.

My guy best friend knew that i liked her. round about 3 weeks ago, the girl was thinking about breaking up with her boyfriend. At that time my guy best friend fooled around with this girl one night ( also relevant for later.) and about 2 weeks ago this girl told me she liked my guy best friend, this was a heartbreaking moment for me as I thought she was amazing. If you think this is weird only 2 weeks after a relationship, there relationship hasn’t been very loving for a while so she wasn’t emotionally attached anymore. So about 1 week ago this girl told my guy best friend she liked him and he said he liked her as well.

A girl I met just before college and became very good friends with in college started sleeping together on a very regular basis. She’d often stay at mine I’d often stay at hers etc. We were both the very “nah no relationships for me don’t wanna deal with that” types. Over time This continued and we became even stronger friends and basically best buddies with each other.

it Went on for about 2 or so years and then we also both moved out and decided to get a flat together (2 bedroom sleeping seperate from each other) and continued having sex. As time went on the sex was less frequent just as we mainly had very different job patterns. Eventually we got to a stage where she actively decided she didn’t want to have sex (she put this down to body dysmorphia as she had gained some weight and just really didn’t like seeing herself naked and ive no reason to believe this wasn’t the reason.)

recently she opened up to the idea of a relationship in general and started dating a customer from her work.

1.) She told me she broke up with her ex. Like she just brought it up out the blue without me asking.


2.) Don’t know why, but she constantly asks me to tell her how she looks in her photos.

5.) This just recently started, but she would call me nicknames, threaten to hit me(with a smile on her face), called me lame, etc

771,"(Anonymous for reasons...)

I've been at my job for about a month now. I am a host at a restaurant inside the mall in my area and I feel like I'm being treated unfairly among all the other employees that we have. Ever since I've began working and things have began getting hectic due to the holidays coming up, I've been forced to take on many roles that servers have. I'm constantly being forced to bus tables, give customers their drinks, and take care of them like I am a server. Note that a host's responsibility at my job is to wipe tables, seat people, say hello, and to tell them about our rewards system. Nowhere in the training videos or anywhere else does it say I need to give customers drinks or even bus tables. I'm constantly losing customers due to the fact they dont see anybody up front, so they decide to leave because it's been taking too long for me to seat them. I'm allowed two minutes to sit someone and greet them, that time triples by the time I am done bussing the tables. It constantly stresses me out, the restaurants losing money because of me and I can't really do anything about it. My managers force me to bus tables so I can't talk to them, and every time I ask servers to bus they give me an attitude and take even longer to do it. I feel like they expect me to be the only one capable of doing these things and it frustrates me to a full extent. I've been scheduled on Sundays which are super busy, the wait is 45 minutes to an hour sometimes, and last night was the absolute worst.

Then i get yelled at by managers that I need to seat people instead of bussing. Yet they're the ones who asked me to bus in the first place.
I really want to know what to be able to do, I cannot quit and go to another job because this job I'm at now was hesitant to hire me due to me being at another job only a month as well, so the next job i apply for will be even more hesitant due to I have two jobs I've only been at a month.",25Nov2019,1
772,"Tldr at the bottom.

Background on us and the living situation: 
My husband and I along with our 3 kids are living with my inlaws. They are pretty well off and do not want us to pay rent, we buy most of the groceries, I cook for everyone and mostly it's just me that cleans. We all pitch in for the yard up keep. 

Background on my inlaws:
They have the idea that they have to be exactly fair with both my husband and bil, if they help one they have to do for the other. So since we live with them, they give him money for his rent and groceries. My mil is the nicest person and wouldn't say no even if she wanted to. 

Things that are not my business but adds to how I see my bil as taking advantage: 
They, mostly my mil runs errands for my bil, delivers requested groceries, goes to his place to babysit while he takes naps, babysits so he can come spend time with his goats that are kept at his parents house, takes care of his goats when he can't or just doesn't want to. &lt;The only time we ask them to babysit are for rare date nights and I always cook dinner for them and have the kids ready for bed before we leave, or if absolutely necessary&gt; They have given us x amount of money, that we tried to refuse and felt horrible accepting because they were asked by my bil for x amount of money because of their financial lifestyle choices. 

Things that bother me: 

My bil does not see this as our home just his parents house. He is very inconsiderate over here, he'd never be ok  with any of the things he does here being done at his house. He comes to hangout after work in his dirty scrubs &lt;we have a newborn&gt;, we didn't even get to meet our niece until she was 6 months old because he didn't want our ""dirty boys"" to go to their house,  even though my husband and I were not invited alone either, he does not take his shoes off after being out back with his goats &lt;we have a crawler&gt;, will help himself to groceries while he's here, when no one is home will just hang out here all day eating and watching TV and will leave dishes, will show up with or without our niece at inconvenient hours &lt;dinner or bedtime&gt;, when his daughter is over she just yells at our boys and cries, he uses our diapers and wipes, etc. Etc. Etc.

Our efforts: 
We've tried talking to him,  he has no idea why we have a problem with any of the things he does, he outright said this is not our house and he can do whatever he wants. 
We've tried talking to my mil about it, her solution is just to replace what he used or ate, or to clean, or to do more so he can do what he wants and she can cover for our inconvenience which makes me feel so ungrateful. 


Tldr: live with inlaws, is it my business to try to set boundaries for bil and how?",25Nov2019,1

It's been 3 weeks prior to the diagnosis so he only has about a week left to live (he can live more than that but I have my doubts). Even before he was sick, my sister and mom have been somewhat hostile towards me for any little thing I do, but now that he's dying, it seems like they've worsened. My mom yells at me and calls me lazy, while I go to college for 5 hrs a day and then work 30+ hrs a week and she constantly complains just because I can't drive. She then compares me to my sister who only has 2 hrs of college for 2 days out of the week and works less although she's full-time and says she's having a harder time. My depression has significantly worsened since my dad's diagnosis and I've just mentally slipped in and out of lectures and have very little motivation to get anything done, and my grades have suffered. Due to the circumstances I just feel like the walls are closing in on me due to their constant berating me for anything. I'm secretly planning on moving out once my dad dies and cutting all communication with them, but still thinking over whether I should go through with it or not. Since I was a kid, I've always felt like she always favored my sister over me. For example, my sister has stolen about 5k from my mom to pay her debts and she doesnt bat an eye but if I sit down after coming home from work, she loses her shit.I've always been excluded from any conversations, no one listens to my opinion, or any comment I make for that matter even if they asked a question before. I had even been having suicidal thoughts also but my sister just said ""are you sure you're not doing this for attention?' when I had supported her through her anxiety problems.

F (25)
There’s a few reasons why I want to leave my job. 

I was hired as a Bilingual CSR, spanish is my native tongue. 

I started at $15 an hour, plus a lousy commission. 

in my interview the owner, we will name Jerry, said he wanted to have ALL of his CSRs being bilingual eventually.  He hired another guy, John, 2 months before me. He is not a native speaker. He used to be a spanish teacher. His spanish is ok but not like mine obviously. 

I work for a company that makes products, that work well with soft filtered water. Our customers are the water salesmen who sell their filters to their customers. Then their customers call us to place their orders. We answer English and Spanish calls all over the United States, sometimes Canada. 


I noticed a few months into the job, maybe 4-5 months that John stopped answering spanish calls. Leaving me with all of them. We answer calls all over the United States, English and Spanish. But I’m the only one doing the spanish calls now since he stopped doing them. He told me lately his spanish has been rusty. When I’m about to take a vacation day he looks kinda stressed or anxious that he’s gonna HAVE to try to answer them. However when I come back the next day, my email is full of spanish voicemails of people complaining that “no ones answering the phone”. 

That stresses me out a lot that he was hired as a bilingual and doesn’t take those calls anymore unless he has to when I’m gone and stillllll doesn’t take really answer. 

Lately they’ve got me translating things for our catalogs and I’m even being asked to do PowerPoints and narrating everything, like training for the Spanish salesman so they can better understand our products in order to close their deals. I’ve been helping the other sales directors (who make a crap ton of money) call potential customers to join us. The training I’m doing would also bring in a lot of money bc obviously they’ll be able to learn more about the products to sell their equipment better to people. If I move up to be one of the sales directors I’ll be making  a 3 figure income. 

I was eagerly waiting for my one year anniversary of working here to go up to Jerry to ask him for a raise. I let him know of all the projects I’ve been doing and he was happy and excited. He gave me a dollar raise after he realized I had been there a year. I had wanted more but he implied that I should watch his motivational videos he makes and we will “talk later”... so I didn’t ask for a higher raise bc I agreed I’ll watch them and learn more. 

So I did that for the next few weeks and continued doing these spanish translating training PowerPoints. 



I went up to his office again and I let him know of the next programs I’m about to do in Spanish and that I’ve been helping the sales directors call and try to get more companies to work with us. I also did NOT complain about John not answering any spanish calls but I said, ‘john has been doing other things and I have been the only person handling the spanish side’ 
Then I calmly but assertively asked that I get paid more for the work that I’m doing. 

So then he gets worked up and says that I’m not doing those things for days, maybe a few hours of the day. I reminded him I’m doing presentations to bring money into the company and that I handle all of the spanish calls. he is a very very good speaker, and he would not let me interrupt or have a moment to speak. He kept going about how a dollar raise ($16) is good enough and “I should’ve had you do those PowerPoints in English to see if you did them correctly” as if I haven’t been here over a year, speaking to customers about how our programs work. He asked me in a super rude way “so you even have a degree in Spanish?” 
I don’t. I said I didn’t, and asked if that’s what he needed, he said “no no, but see you don’t have that. I only hired you bc your English is exceptional, that’s the only reason” 


SO... I found the original posting for this job and the starting out pay from my calculations is not $15!! 
The pay said $32,000-$50,000... he said he’d start me out at $15 which is not even $32,000. When you do the math that’s $16.66 an hour starting. 

Let me also add that one of the sales directors I help makes snobby, rude comments about the people who buy our products who give us thousands and thousands of dollars.. she gets so annoyed that she can’t speak to them because of their broken English. 
Like,  coming from a family who’s English was not great at first, trying their hardest to provide for their family, really brings me down. 

She told me a few days ago “our competition has a similar name to one of our products and we Iaugh so hard about how these people don’t even know which company they’re buying from LOL!” 


And I just smiled and played along but I now realized she’s been such a bitch from day one the way she speaks to them while I’m translating for her.

795,"I just moved back to my hometown 2 years ago and I live about 20 minutes away from where I actually grew up and went to school. So far it’s been pretty decent, except these past couple of months my partner moved down to the EXACT CHILDHOOD TOWN that I had the bulk of childhood spent. I had some things go down in my current home where I want out, and I wanna move in with my partner. So really it’d be like moving back home. 
The thing is, while I love my childhood hometown so much and it was my dream to be able to eventually move back and make it my adult home, I also have some REALLY bad memories of this place. All of them revolve around me being bullied relentlessly to the point where I got withdrawn from school for a semester, attempted suicide, and then eventually had to move away. 
Now that I’m back, I have never really had agoraphobia this bad before. I live in a town where you either make it all the way, or you never escape. Being able to get away and then come back is actually somewhat of a miracle. And most of these kids that played with my life as a child, unfortunately have stuck around. 
Its been a solid ten years since any of that madness actually happened, Yet I’m always terrified that I’m going to run into one of those old classmates. The worst part is, I know they remember every detail of me and how I was when we were classmates, and they still hold that image of me in their heads as an adult. Yet I know that the minute those memories would be brought up (doesn’t matter if it was me or them) they would portray to take the higher ground and say “nahh we were kids back then you need to grow up!” (This has actually happened before when I came down to visit once, so I know this is a possibility to happen again). So not only were these people aware of what happened to me, they’re unwilling to own up to it and apologize; they just chalk up their responses of growing older and maturity as “well I’m older NOW so I know better NOW and I know damn well the repercussions of how i treated you NOW but I still refuse to apologize because I was a kid THEN”
Still doesn’t help the fact that I’m still mentally recovering from it all but whatever. 
I’m not trying to get rid of my past bullies. I’m not trying to rewrite my stories of what happened in the past in this place. If anything, this town has changed so much in ten years, and I would like to say that I have changed a lot within these ten years too.

803,"As a warning, this is going to be a long read so there will be a TL;DR included at the end. Anyways, here goes:

Where do I begin?

I guess I'll start where I feel it is most appropriate. To start my brother is my step sibling; I am the son of both my parents, but he's the son of only my mom and not her current spouse which would be my dad. His dad and my mom divorced way before I was ever born so he essentially grew up without a father for most of his life. Fast forward about 10-12 years after my birth and things are hectic and chaotic as they have been.

My mom and my brother have been at each other's necks for since as long as I can remember. If it's him needing to use the bathroom while she's currently occupying it, (which is what I'll come back to later), or them disagreeing on some minor conflict, things are never settled, thus resulting in growing tensions until a major argument breaks down weeks, and if lucky, months down the line. His relationship with me and my father have been relatively well, but have also sliwly detoriated over time, but not to the extreme that is between him and my mom.

Fast forward to a couple of months ago, (June to be exact), and one of the most stressful arguments/events in my entire life occurs. One night when he comes home, he tries to commit suicide with a knife, but then hesitstes and tells me to hide all the knives and to not tell my parents. Terrified, I did the exact opposite and the next day a big argument broke out to the point where he loses my trust and curses everyone to damnation. After a week goes by, everyone agrees to settle and talk for about 2 hours and afterwards, everyone agreed to leave the past behind while he also promised to change. It was at this moment I thought things would go back to normal, but sadly they didn't.

The week after the peace settlement, the tension began anew after some petty conflict in the kitchen occurred. This hatred and betrayal from my mother began again and from this point on its as if hes been bottling everything up to go at it one last time.

The last fast forward of this story goes to last night when my brother and mother lashed out at each other after my mother had instigated it. Recall the event that I had mentioned earlier, (thr bathroom one) from my first paragraph. To elaborate a little more on it, my mother had to use the toilet, but my brother wanted to get his contact lens. Because she was in there before him, he grows impatient starts saying the typical ""Oh boy, wtf"" which causes her to begin shit talking his misbehavior while inside. To add further salt to the wound, she purposefully stays longer. After she's done, he goes in, hears her adding more fuel in the kitchen to the fire, which at that point he raises his voice and confronts her.

He calls her every deragatory term you can think of: ""You slut, you whore, etc"" Along with ""You should have aborted me when you had the chance."" Afterwards my mom calls the cops to peacefully evict him while also taking the keys from him. After several hours I get a text from him asking what's going on; I reply only saying: ""Nothing. But I wish you the beat of luck. You're on your own now. What you just did theres no turning back from."" Midnight I get a text from him begging to be let back in, but I dont reply because I was asleep. This is where I ask for your input, reader.

I genuinely feel that a lot of this could have prevented and that somehow this is my fault. I genuinely feel sorry for my brother even though I had nothing to do with it; the fact that he needs help and support in a time like this makes me feel worthless. He could have committed suicide for all I know or god knows what and his last words to me were to let him back in. He's had a troubled childhood, and had an unstable relationship with my mom, but in the midst kf all this I feel somewhat guilty, and distraught at thr same time. My parents have done everything in their power to try to give him a place to live and eat, but he takes it for granted.

So in conclusion, what should I do? I feel so lost at this moment in time and I feel that its only a matter of time before the trauma kicks in to my studies at university and my performance at work? Any help would be much appreciated.

TL;DR: Brother got evicted last night and got keys to house confiscated. He pleads and begs to be let back in at midnight when I was asleep so I didnt reply back, but too many second chances to improve his behavior have been given only for them to lead nowhere. I feel guilty thinking that I could have helped in some way and that he may ha e committed suicide or god knows what.

He's had a long history of arguments with my mom but not me or his step father, (my dad). What should I do? Can I do anything at all? How do I cope with the situation?",25Nov2019,1

Happy to say with confidence that I have moved on, even began casually seeing another very sweet girl!

816,"My best friend, we'll call him Jake, is becoming an alcoholic and I don't know what to do.

I live in Florida, I moved here about 5-6 years ago. Growing up I didn't have any friends until my junior year in school. I was bullied to the point of almost dropping out, until Jake and I started talking. Me an Jake became brothers. So close we tell each other we love each other and don't feel weird about it. Not in a homosexual way, I'd do anything at the drop of a dime for him and fully believe he would for me too. 

Once we hit 21 he started to drink a lot. I wouldn't have called him an alcoholic at the time though. We were just 21, always partying. The drinking got a bit heavier when our other close friend John moved states. Then a few years later I moved aswell, from ohio to florida. I heard stories about him drinking a lot but he always said he had his drinking under control. 

For my 25th birthday I flew to ohio to see him and I noticed he was drinking more, but I played it off to hes just celebrating I'm here. We went out to the bar with one of our really close friends, everything was great until the next day. We went Alex's house the next morning and found him dead in the garage. He had huffed freeon and killed himself. That's when I think Jake's drinking started getting worse. We went on a week cruise a few months later and he spent the entire cruise drunk. I talked with him about it and he told me he was just enjoying the cruise and free alcohol. 

Fast forward a year, I've been hearing alot about his drinking. Our friends have told me some nights he doesnt make it home, just passes out at the park. He lives in a party house now. Yesterday John flew to ohio to meet Jake and another friend and Jake never arrived. His girlfriend had to call them and tell them he wasnt coming because he was blackout drunk.

I subtlety asked him how things were going and how hes been handling drinking. He bold faced lied to me and told me he drinks a beer or two a week, when I know for a fact he'll go to a friend's house to hang out and plow through a 6 pack in 30 minutes by himself. How do I confront him about this? I don't want him going down that path. Our friends have asked me not to bring up what they told me because they don't want him mad at them but I feel like that doesn't matter. He spends every night at the bar, this is a slippery slope, and I'm almost to the point of selling the rest my belongings just to get a ticket to go see him and knock some sense into him, set up an intervention with our friends and maybe seeing me show up across the country will solidify how much we care and are worried. He's family and its killing me to know he's living like this. Something has to be wrong, he cant be happy like this. 

How should I handle this situations? Is there anything I can do, or is this his choice? Would I be wrong to throw my friends under the bus and confront him? I find myself almost resenting him for bold face lying to me about something so serious effecting his life.",25Nov2019,1

I live in Tennessee and have a TN drivers license. (obviously) I was looking for a project car and found a 96 Mustang GT in Georgia, a little north of Atlanta. So we set out to buy it. I called the insurance company and got liability to drive the car home, well of course with no tag yet, first cop pulls me over, show him the title and my proof of insurance, well low and behold the insurance policy would not take effect until the next morning for some reason or another. I did it all online, anyway, but at this point I’m still ok with it as i should’ve read everything even the small print, my car is impounded in Georgia by the police and i have to book a hotel room, and show proof of insurance to get my car out the next day. Got home from that point with no issue. Me being out of state. Every lawyer seen their opportunity to gouge me with prices and it just ended up cheaper to drive to Georgia and goto court since it was a mandatory appearance. I showed my proof of insurance to the court, and was given a fine to pay and another court date. When I call to pay the fine I was told if i pay it its an automatic guilty plea and will result in 3 months of license suspension (i work on the road and that’s just not a damn option). Also, as it turns out the next court date was also mandatory, i explain to them by phone i can not afford the time to keep coming back and forth to Georgia (I’m in Memphis so it’s a 6 hour drive) over a damn no insurance ticket that’s payable by a fine (with  proof that you now have insurance) in my state. They didn’t give a shit, suspended my license anyway for failure to appear. And are now telling me my only option is to come to Georgia (i guess they want me to ride a bicycle) or hire an attorney to come for me (remember why i didn’t do this the first time?). So now, here i am. Technically can’t drive, so i technically can’t get to work. Even though i still do because, yeah i still have to earn money, and it will take a couple weeks to be able to come up with the money for cheapest price any lawyer has given me, i don’t have thousands laying around. Resulting in me taking a bigger chance of getting stopped and piling on another charge, bond money, more fines, and more bullshit like this. Other than taking my chances and coming up with money for the attorney, does anyone have any advice on how to go about handling this. Since technically I’m not supposed to be driving a company vehicle like I’m doing, and will probably lose my job if I’m stopped and have a suspended license.",25Nov2019,1

826,"I'm really not sure where to post this.

Last year I applied for a community college in a different city. By a certain date you have to drop your classes if you don't want to have to pay fees and have it reflect on your grades. I ultimately decided not to attend this specific college, and so I logged in and dropped my classes. Well before the final date where I'd be charged a fee. 

A week or so later I got a general email sent to students reminding them of the deadline to drop classes, so I attempted to log in to double check. But my password had apparently expired (which, I'd just set it up 3 weeks prior) and I was unable to reset it. I emailed IT about it and let them know that I had cancelled my classes and was wondering if I couldn't log in because I wasn't going to be a student? They told me to call them for a password reset but I figured since I knew I had cancelled the classes I could just let it be. 

Well I'm enrolling for classes in my new city and I cannot enroll because there's a hold on my account. I apparently owe the other college an outstanding balance which I can't find the amount anywhere and have to call their office. 

But I never attended their college? I don't have any friends or family that went to college that I could ask this question to, but is there a way to appeal this? I can't afford practically anything as I'm paycheck to paycheck. (My tuition will be covered by grants and loans). I am so confused and have tried calling their financial office but it's been closed every single time I've called, so while I'm waiting to finally get someone on the line has anyone been in a similar position? 

I know I should have had IT reset my password so I could log in to double check and I'm absolutely kicking myself for it. But I'm also a little upset because I know I dropped the classes, and locking my account immediately after just feels scammy. 

TLDR; dropped college courses before the date which I'd have to pay for them. Account was locked shortly after, and I did not do the wise thing and get back into my account to double check. Now I owe a mystery balance to the college that has to be taken care of before I can go back to school. Is there an appeal process? Or am I screwed into paying whatever they say I owe?",25Nov2019,1
828,"This going to be longer than I anticipated. Part venting, part sanity check and organizing my thoughts, part asking for advice.

I've known this guy for a few years. We met at work, became good friends, and eventually became roommates. We live in a high cost of living area so having a roommate is very helpful from a financial standpoint. I would really be stretching my budget if I didn't have a roommate, but soon I'll have my student loans paid off and that will free a good bit of my budget so I could probably live alone.

My roommate, his girlfriend, and I met at around the same time and we all became friends. The two of them started dating, everything seemed all hunky-dory. Soon, however, she started to confide in me when they had issues. I thought, whatever, we're friends, if she wants to vent I can lend an ear.

I was never totally sure how I should I respond to her, though. I didn't want to get too involved in their relationship because I felt like it wasn't really my business. I didn't want to tell her what she should do or have too much of an influence on her decisions. I was pretty honest with her when I thought he was being a dick, but I never said anything like ""jeez you should break up with him"" or anything like that. I'm wishing now that I would have said more earlier, because I'm realizing that so many of the things she's told me are big red flags for emotional abuse. I'm having a hard time thinking how I'm going to structure this post and keep everything coherent because there's so much I want to say but I'm just going to list some of things that she's  told me. These may not be in order, my memory is a bit fuzzy.

* From very early in the relationship, he would get very jealous any time she spent time with any other men. The earliest instance I can remember was when she ate lunch with her team at work. We work in a male dominated field, so unsurprising her team was all men. She messaged me saying that she was crying because [roommate] made her feel so bad about eating lunch with her team instead of him. This is a common theme that would continue throughout the relationship. He even told me himself that he only wants her to have girlfriends, and not hang out with other guys.
* We were eating lunch once with a group of people. Apparently, [girlfriend] was laughing too much at one of the others guy's jokes. [roommate] gave her so much shit over it afterwards that he again managed to make her cry.
* The jealousy has extended to me as well. He's accused her of being too close to me. We have never done anything inappropriate together (unless you consider her venting to me to be out of line?)
* He drank too much at a party, made an ass out of himself, then the next day told her that she should break up with him and that he was going to kill himself (and also accused her of getting coffee with me the next morning, we did both get coffee but didn't go together).
* Accused her of breaking out one of his dog's teeth. It was a puppy tooth that fell out on it's own. As is typical for him, he was pissed about this the whole day and wouldn't let up.
* He will often try to guilt her (and sometimes me) by saying that he is depressed, anxious, whatever. I can't find the message right now, but I remember one particular instance where he was acting depressed, saying bad things about himself, and said something about how he has guns back home (as in his hometown, not the apartment we live in now) and if she wants to shoot him then she can. I really wish I could find that message again because that is mega WTF. In general though, if we try to confront him on anything or ask him for anything he'll just say things like ""I'm so stressed out"" over and over.
* He has threatened to end the relationship to force her into acting a certain way. For example, he has said something like ""why am I so good to someone who ignores me? you better be careful because the last girl that did that to me I decided wasn't worth shit""

There has been so much more but I can't remember it all. I know all this is true, because she actually sends me screenshots of her conversations with him. Jealousy, trust issues, and isolation really seem to define the relationship. The two of them hardly talk to the rest of our friends anymore. She *never* does anything without him, unless she's only hanging out with other girls (and even then that's rare). He seems to expect me to act like a liaison between him and friend group at this point, because I actually talk to them regularly. I think I'll touch on this more later.

I'd also like to say that he is just generally sexist/misogynistic. Some examples:

* The old classic, he believes women are worse drivers. I have told him that this is wrong and sexist, and he responds with ""no! [girlfriend] agrees with me! she's admitted that she's a terrible driver too!"" I have ridden in the car with her driving probably hundreds of times, her driving is absolutely fine. In fact *his* driving is shit, he's an asshole driver. I'd say she is much more calm and cautious when she drives. Anyway, I believe this is another way that he puts her down, by insulting her driving.
* I know he has a specific (old-fashioned) ideal of what he wants his future wife to be like. Imagine the way that wives were expected to be subservient to their husbands in the past. That's what he wants. To give a specific recent example, he has been pestering her to make him a pie since it's pie season. He has specifically refused to learn how to bake himself, stating that he wants that to be his gf/wife's job while he'll be the one to cook steaks and such. I believe he's trying to force her to conform to this standard.

I'm going to talk about his behavior towards me as well for a bit. I know this post has been very critical of him so far, but we are friends. We have shared interests, we've had lots of good times together. He has, at times, encouraged me and supported me. It definitely hasn't been all bad. Some things have just rubbed me the wrong way, though. In no particular order:

* Our mornings. When we first moved in together, we had decided on a time that we were going to leave in the morning for work (we carpool). He was always late. I would be ready to go a good 30min before him, every day. I tried to remind him what we agreed on, nothing changed. I gave up, and starting getting up later (what's the point of waiting around for 30min in the morning? might as well get some more sleep). Over time, my sleep schedule changed, I adjusted to getting up later. Recently, suddenly, he has become very frustrated that he wasting so much of his time in traffic. Without discussion, he's now trying to get up earlier and leave earlier. He would pester me in the morning, texting me as I'm getting ready: ""are you ready?"", ""are you sick?"", ""almost ready?"". As I'm wrapping up, he's walking out the door. Making me feel rushed, making me forget things, etc.
* Our afternoons. In the same vein, he decides when we leave work. He will message me ""let's go"" then log off immediately and leave. Acts mildly pissed if I couldn't leave right away because I was still working on something or had to use the restroom.
* We work out together. For the most part, it's been great for me. He convinced me to start, and I become much more fit and I'm proud of my progress. I'm not as devoted as he is, however. Sometimes, I'm feeling down and can't bring myself to go to the gym. Sometimes I miss a week because I'm sick. Sometimes I make plans with other friends and prioritize that over going to the gym. Nearly every time, he acts like I've quit for good. Every time I tell him that I'm still going. It is very discouraging.
* He was the reason I tried my first cigarette. We were out drinking with another friend, having a good time, very drunk, he mentioned that a cig would nice. I'd never tried one, so I figured why not? One can't hurt. We would then smoke occasionally on weekends. I have to take responsibility for this myself, but I ended buying a JUUL thinking that if we were going to smoke sometimes that vaping would be less bad for me. I became very addicted to nicotine and struggled with it for over a year. I would also share my JUUL with him whenever he wanted a drag. Here's where I get pissed: he made it so much more difficult for me to quit. I don't even know why he acted like this. Several times I tried to quit. Every time, he would say ""why are you quitting? it's just vapor. it's not bad for you"" (of course this is bullshit). I would tell him that it was the cost. I was spending about $80 a month on JUUL pods at one point. We make about the same salary, so he knows about how much I make. He would say ""that's not that much! think about how little that is compared to your paycheck"". A month ago I threw away my JUUL and it's been a week since my last cigarette. I feel totally fine right now, no withdrawal feelings at all, no cravings. I'm hoping this is it.
* Did I mention he is extremely devoted to working out? I've tried to be supportive, but it's like an obsession and has caused problems. It's one of the main reasons he doesn't hang out with the rest of our friends very often. He won't sacrifice a workout day for a happy hour, ever. He will never eat at the places we go to, it doesn't fit in his diet. We end up being late to everything that he goes to because he has to eat somewhere else first. Often times, he just doesn't go when he's invited somewhere. Remember how I said that I'm like a liaison? That's because our friends don't always invite him out anymore, because he usually says no anyway. So he expects me to know what everyone is doing. He bitches that no one wants to hang out with him, but if you want people to keep inviting you places you have to say yes sometimes!
* Here's a recent story related to the point above: A few days ago the group all went out to a brewery. It's a bit far away and we went in two groups. Me, roommate, his gf were one group (which is typical when those two participate in the outing) and everyone else was the other group (about 5 people). Roommate doesn't usually drink much, due to his diet. So, he often ends up being DD (when he isn't coming along, I usually uber). We hadn't discussed the driving situation yet, but I assumed we were all going together like usual. So, his gf and I are waiting for him to get ready. When he comes out of his room, the first thing he does is looks at me and says ""what are you still doing here?"". I was kind of taken back. Maybe he was joking? Then somewhat sarcastically he says ""oh! you're driving us then?"" I'm still confused. Is he joking or actually trying to be a dick for some reason? Implying that I'm assuming that he'll DD? I basically didn't respond. We walk outside and he walks over to my car. I tell if he wants to drink more than usual, we can all get an Uber. It's a bit far but split between the three of us it wouldn't be bad. He finally lets up and walks over to his car, ""jokingly?"" he says something about me being mean. We get there before everyone, he's hungry but doesn't want to eat anything there. I tell him the others are 20min out, he mentions going to get some food nearby but doesn't for some reason. Everyone else shows up, we have a grand time for a few hours, then my roommate tells me he wants to leave and go get food nearby in about 30min. He says I can either go with them or get an Uber home. I just say ""okay"" and a few minutes later get another beer. Right after I get back, he and gf get up, say that he's leaving to get food. I'm not going to chug an IPA so I guess I'm Ubering. Everyone is kind of shocked that they just left me there to take a $50 Uber on my own so the insist I cram in the backseat with them. I apologize the whole way home for making the ride uncomfortable.
* Remember how $80 a month on JUUL pods was nothing according to him? Well, after a year our internet bill went up (as it usually does, going from new customer pricing to normal pricing). It started at $80 a month, and went up to $100. Split between the two of us, so $40 a person to $50 a person. It's in my name so I have to pay it and ask him for his portion. For MONTHS after it went up, he gave me shit about it. Every time he says ""that seems high!"" and every time I explained what happened. So it was fine for me to spend $80 a month on JUUL pods, but an extra $10 from him for the internet is so outrageous? He acts similarly with the electric bill each month. He thinks my showers are too long, but he also does several loads of laundry several times a week. I honestly have no idea how he goes through so much laundry.
* His gf wanted to carve a pumpkin for halloween. He just generally bitched about it the whole time. Poor girl just wanted to carve a damn pumpkin for christ's sake. She carved it at our place and wanted to do it inside because it was cold outside or something. That's fine, I don't care. It's really not that hard to clean up, and she hardly even made a mess anyway. Roommate kept telling her that *I* wouldn't want her to carve it inside. I kept saying, ""no, really, it's fine"". But he kept saying that I didn't like it, shifting the blame to me when really he didn't like it. Then he made a big show of it when he was cleaning up after. ""Ugh I had to clean up all this pumpkin by hand"". There was hardly any mess, and he could've used the swiffer to get it done in seconds.

I could go on, but I have to wrap this up at some point I guess. Here's my problem: I feel like I should've blown the whistle earlier on the way he treats his girlfriend. I was afraid of sticking my nose where it doesn't belong and betraying my friend. I'm certain at this point that I won't be living with him anymore when this lease is up. Problem is, we have like 7 months left and that feels like a long time. I can't afford to break the lease early, so I feel like I'm stuck here. If I tell his girlfriend that I think he's abusing her I'm afraid he'll find out that I did and that she shares so much with me. I don't know how he would respond to that, but it wouldn't be good. If I tell our friends all about his shitty behavior, he'll find out that I told them and again I'm sure he won't respond well.

The cherry on top is that his girlfriend just interviewed for a job in his home state. I think she's hoping that will make him happy? Moving back to his home and being together? I can't imagine why else she would want to go there specifically.

Do you think I'm right that he's abusive?

Do you think I should stay out of it? That their relationship is their problem to sort out?

Do you think it's wrong that she shares so much with me about the relationship? It feels wrong that we are talking behind his back, but if it is a call for help I don't want to ignore it.

Should I say something now before the lease is up and deal with the consequences? Is it okay if I wait for my own financial security? Am I just being crazy and shouldn't say anything at all?",25Nov2019,1
829,"Ever since I was young (M20 now), I have always loved my mother more than anyone else in the world. She, on some level, loves me too, but situational circumstances and misunderstandings have created a toxic relationship for both of us, and I can't take it anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

For some background, my family is South Indian, and all of us work in tech (I'm still in college, but I study Computer Science and Math). Moreover, we also tend to define ourselves with our jobs in tech. My mom's the foremost software engineer at a NY-based consultancy, and my dad's an engineering manager/ex-entrepreneur who once made millions with a startup gone big (he lost most of the money to the same startup, but that's a different story).

&amp;#x200B;

In a nutshell, I always craved spending time with her, but she spent more time talking with my dad, his brother, and her brother (all three are very successful in the tech world) about their careers than she did with me. This upset me over and over again, to the point where I began to resent and hate all the other men in her life. In HS, due to mental health issues caused by obesity (not ongoing), bullying, and Asperger's Syndrome, I didn't really accomplish much in the way of grades; to push me forward in this vein, she compared me to my cousins and family friends (all of whom did pretty well) and made me feel as if I wasn't up to par. This essentially resulted in alcoholism and ridiculous amounts of weed for some time, but at the end of HS, I decided Iwas sick of this lifestyle and decided to make use of my knack for coding to become successful in college.

&amp;#x200B;

I worked myself to the bone every night to explore every nook and cranny of Computer Science and Math that I could while in college for the first two years, and ended up with an internship ata globally-known tech company that's comparable to Google or Amazon. At that point, all my friends were essentially worshipping the ground I walked on, because it was hitherto unheard of at my university for someone in their 2nd year to do this, but I just wanted my mom to be proud of me. I went home and pressed the point on her and everyone else who would listen that that company is paying me more for an internship than most college students graduate making in full-time, but only really because I wanted my mom to like me, respect me, and accept that I'd accomplishedsomething; she gave a very humble ""good job"" a couple of times, but this reaction eventually reduced to ""Haha, imagine flexing this much with this small an amount of money! Your dad and I have seen a lot more money than $X/mo. in our lives; this isn't impressive.""

&amp;#x200B;

I was devastated to get this reaction from her, since all I wanted her to do was acknowledge that I had accomplished something and that she should be proud of me. I'm the youngest in the family, and every time I have an opinion, there's an implicit bias against it because I'm considered to be all talk and no accomplishments (even though I work myself to the bone and make sure to keep from). Not only that, the job at the company went really bad - had a toxic manager who didn't communicate well and verbally abused me, and ended up drinking away the pain of having to face her again as a failure.

&amp;#x200B;

She recently came back from a trip, and I broke down crying about all this; she accepts that she was wrong to compare me to my dad. She admitted that she was holding me to standards that were impossible by any measurement, but just said that she didn't want my ego to skyrocket from what I'd already done.

&amp;#x200B;

How can I fix this relationship with her? I've had 3 emotional breakdowns in the past 24 hours about this, and the pain is getting harder and harder to bear. I literally just want her to acknowledge that I've accomplished something nontrivial in my life, but every time I try to get her to admit that, she just invents a standard even more outlandish and more unreasonable than the last, all the while believing that she's protecting me from an oversized ego by making me want to drink myself into a coma.",25Nov2019,1

So I’m gonna condense this as much as possible. Started working with my now or at least used to be best friend about two years ago. Over time we began a really good friendship. We’ve both been through a lot together and have become very close. I’m away from my family and so is she so naturally we became very important in each other’s lives. 

A little while back I told her that I though I had feelings for her, she said she had felt that way for a while but didn’t want to ruin our friendship. Anyway we decided to act on these feelings and try to make something work. 

Through mistakes that both of us made, things were a little more difficult than they should have been. Working together sure didn’t make it any easier. We’ve been not really the same for a couple weeks now and last night we had a conversation about it. She said she just didn’t feel that way anymore and it just wasn’t going to work. 

I can’t stand to sit around and watch her be with somebody else. I love her, more in a friend/person kind of way than a romantic way but still. I can’t stand to not have her in my life, she’s my closest friend. How do I handle this situation from here?

838,"[TLDR At the bottom]

So about 4 months ago I met a girl at my work (I’m a waiter 24m) and we hit it off really well and she kinda claimed me as her best friend. Now I had not been in a relationship in a very long time and everyone that had seen us together told me that she was totally into me. So of course I get excited and we hang out a few times and I ask her out, no biggie right? BIGGIE. She told me she didn’t really feel that way for me and that we should try to be friends. 

   So of course I was like yeah sure absolutely, but classic me I had already fallen for her super hard. But I was still happy to have her as a friend. 

   Fast forward 2 months and we are still pretty cool with each other we are hanging out a little less but now she is really seeming to be into me. Idk if she just is super flirty or what but I was convinced that she had a thing for me. So I kinda eased into asking if she liked me again. Bad idea. Now she’s sure. I spend about a week or two being heartbroken and still having to see her every day at work. 

   After those few weeks she stopped talking to me outside of work, stopped texting me, you know, the works. 

  Fast forward to now. She unfriended me on Snapchat, and I have texted her earlier this morning asking her if she wants to talk it out rather than just blocking each other on social media and having to work together every day in misery. She had not responded or viewed my text.

Idk what to do. I’m pretty sure I still have feelings for her and I’ve never been heartbroken before and idk how to deal with these feelings. 
I really like her as a person and she and I were pretty good friends. 

   I guess what I’m asking for is some advice on how to deal with these feelings and if you think it would be feasible to repair out friendship?

840,"I am in college and had a class with a girl my age. She laughed the hardest at stuff I say, smiles a lot at me and to stuff I say. She said hi when she saw me ask what's up. We had to do peer reviews and she came to my table sat next to me at my table. She sat between me and a woman Im friends with, talked to her she said something, smiled at me and looked deep into my eyes and didn't stop smiling and it felt awkward, if I didn't break the eye contact she probably would've continued.

846,"**PLEASE NOTE** This post isn't exactly light hearted, I'm going to mention some personal things that aren't so great—proceed at your own discretion.

TL;DR if you want it: I didn't ask a girl from class out because I don't believe I would be good for her. I'm not in the right mind set to have a good-meaningful relationship due to depression. But, nonetheless, I do have second thoughts about my decision.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

So today, not even a few hours ago, I effectively finished one of my college courses. I say effectively because this was just our *last in class day.* Well, upon completing the class, I had a short walk with one of my classmates before going our separate ways. I'm going to call her Jamie for this post. I would describe my relationship with her as friendly. We know a few minor things about one another—nothing too personal. We joke sometimes and talk about our interests. We've also worked together on a few assignments. Honestly nothing too special.

I really wanted to ask her out mainly because I'm genuinely interested. Jamie is intelligent, kind hearted, sweet, works hard &amp; also very pretty. All around, she just seems like a girl anyone would be lucky to have in their life.
      I'm not 100% sure on how she feels about me, but I'd bet it's a favorable opinion at least. She's willing to initiate conversations for instance; throughout the course I often caught her glancing at me multiple times, which is followed by looking away. (It almost seemed deliberate at times). But I try not read too much into things, fail as I may. Other stuff included the usual eye contact, body language, and so forth. So yeah, I assume positive at least.

So why didn't I ask her out? Because of me. Without going into too much detail, I'm not in the right place of mind right now. I'm depressed, I self harm and was genuinely going to attempt suicide a couple days ago. I'm alright today, but I am saddened by this conundrum with Jaime. When I think about me asking her out and assuming she said yes, I wonder what would follow. Let's say things go well and we get closer, how long before my mental health starts impacting the relationship? How long before she's dragged into it? I wouldn't want to bring Jamie into my world because I think she deserves better. A partner who would be more able to be there for her night and day; a partner she wouldn't have to worry about one day losing because he saw no way out.

So that's what I'm thinking. I feel it was the right decision. But at the same time, it's not an easy decision. While we may longer have in class time, there is a chance I could run into her just on campus. Either within these last remaining days of actual school or potentially next semester. IDK, maybe Jamie would be great for me, maybe I could be great for her and we just end helping each other . . . I'm doubtful though. Maybe I could just try to keep in touch at least and see how things go?

She is an extremely manipulative person who adores making herself seem as small and fragile as humanly possible, and my father completely buys into it. Her doctor even said that she wouldn’t have gotten into the mess with her meds if she hadn’t always exaggerated her issues to her doctor and expected the medicine to fix everything, but my dad just said that the doctor was being cruel.

853,"This girl I went to High School with and still keep up with on social media had been posting very frequently about attending the same university as I do for Nursing.  She posted that she transferred in the Spring of 2018 from another local university.  I haven't seen her since High School, but she recently married the older brother of another one of our classmates last June.  They had only been dating for less than 3 months.

My friends and I were talking about how we were somewhat surprised that she had gotten into our school for Nursing because of how competitive our program is.  In addition, they don't take transfer credits, so she'd be setting herself back at least a year and a half.  We even joked, maybe she was lying about the whole thing... well, this led us to start digging into some of the posts she had been making.

Long story short, we are 100% positive that she is lying about attending this university.  Just to name a few things that gave this away:

She's not in the student directory - something you can't opt-out of.  She listed her university email address and not only was it in the incorrect format, but it bounces emails back - it's fake.  She posted her class schedule which had her advisor on it - the person she listed is not an employee of the university/ does not exist.  She listed that she was on the prefect 4.0 list every semester - that is published publically and her name is not on it once.  She posted a screenshot of an email for her acceptance into the university and it said she was pursuing a Masters of Nursing, everything after that has said undergraduate.  She says she's graduating this semester; however the classes she has said she had transfer credit for, would not be taken by my university, and she would for sure have at least 3 more semesters left given the time she transferred in.  We even had an employee of the university look her up in their database which shows every single student who has ever sent in an APPLICATION to our university - she's not in it.

It gets better (worse?), she also says she's attending Med School in the Spring after graduation.  Said Med School DOES NOT HAVE a program that starts in the Spring.  Nor will she have a degree from the school she has been telling everyone she attends.  However, her and the new husband have plans to move 4 states away in the next month so she can attend there.

There are plenty of other things that gave her lies away, but that is just a few.  This girl has gone as far as to drive to our commuter lots JUST to take a Snapchat so it looks like she's on campus.  Her lies look believable to someone who does not attend here but were obvious to me and my friends once we actually started looking.  Because the younger brother of her new husband was in our graduating class, and some of my friends' parents are mutual friends with them, we know for a fact that her new inlaws believe that she attends our university, will be graduating in December and is headed for Med School in the Spring.  As far as me and my friends can tell, her husband has no idea either.  

I feel somewhat of a moral obligation to tell someone about this; however, I also feel (and have been told by many) that this is not my place as I am not close with anyone involved (except the husband's brother who I used to be good friends with in High School).  On a real level, the pessimistic part of me is incredibly concerned she will either get pregnant or fake a pregnancy to avoid the fact that she isn't actually going to Med School.  I'm aware that's just speculation and I know I'm not the person doing the lying, but the potential of bringing a whole ass person into this world for a lie is hard to sit by and watch.

Ultimately, just wondering if I should be morally obligated to tell someone about this, or should just ride it out like everyone keeps telling me to do.  I've also considered sending an anonymous email to someone, but idk who I'd send that to either.  I used to be close with the brother, but I know he is going through a lot right now and don't want to put the burden on him either.  Could use advice.

TLDR: Girl is saying that she goes to my university when she doesn't.  Her new husband and inlaws all believe her.  She also says she's going to Med School in the Spring and is moving there with her husband in a month, but that's also a lie.  Do I tell someone?",25Nov2019,1

TL;DR My white friend has all black coworkers who on a daily basis are mentioning race and making inappropriate comments. Everyone is close friends with one another including her manager, supervisor, and coworkers so she doesn’t know what to do. 

My friend worked really hard to get this job at a hotel and is almost daily sharing her experiences from work. She feels very isolated and uncomfortable in her position due to this and is already looking to apply for other jobs but I have pointed out that this makes for a very toxic work environment and anyone who fills her position next is likely to deal with the same issues. 

My friend, who happens to be white has coworkers who all happen to be black. Daily, she has a coworker bringing up skin color, to a point where it’s as if they are trying to make her uncomfortable. I told her if it continues, she needs to talk to someone in a higher position about it because it’s making the workplace a toxic environment for her. The problem is, her manager, assistant manager, supervisor, and coworkers are all very close friends with each other and she is scared of what will happen if she says something. 

To give a few examples of what she’s shared: when she first started, she had all of her coworkers mention that they were all black. She even had a coworker come up to her to ask “So, were you surprised that we were all black when you started? And “how’s it working with all black people?”. Some more comments that have been made are, “you don’t know because you’re not black” and “that’s a us people thing.” 

Today she casually asked a coworker if the area she lived in was safe because she’s looking to move around that area and the coworker just said “they are all black” to which my friend replied “okay, but I’m just wondering if the area is safe because I’m looking at houses there.” According to my friend, it has become a daily occurrence that racial jokes are being made and I believe at this point it’s race baiting. All of her coworkers have gone out of their way to make her feel left out. 

So, what should my friend do?",25Nov2019,1

My kid's have a friend that doesn't have the best home life. I'm debating on whether or not to invite him and specify to his parents that they're not welcome to come. I don't have any respect for his parents and the way they treat the kid. Their kid comes over to our house everyday after school and begs to come over on non school days. The kid has kind of become our adopted child and our home is the kid's safe haven. Even if I don't get the chance to pick him up directly from school, the kid will walk over from school to our house. The parents never even really care where he is. The kid's parents are the choosey beggar type and expect free handouts 24/7. I know if I ask them to just have their kid over, they'll pull the ""what about poor us"" card. I really don't want them at my house though. The mother is on disability (mainly due to obesity and mental insufficiency) and the father is an abusive prick. I haven't seen the father abuse the kid physically, but there's definitely emotional and verbal abuse. The parents are also hoarders. This kids home life is miserable and I feel he would love a friendly family environment on Thanksgiving day. Will I be the asshole if I only invite him and not the parents? How can I invite only him without making it seem I'm purposely omitting the parents? I thought about casually inviting the kid over for a sleepover Wednesday night and conveniently forgetting that Thursday was Thanksgiving.",25Nov2019,1
861,"Hi well there's not much to add.

I live in a one room apartment, the wall seems quite thin and I can hear my neighbor specially when he calls someone (He's Italian and they are LOUD talkers it's just a fact), and when he listens to his tv. I usually don't care when it's during the day because we all have the right to live but after 8 or 9 pm it really bothers me, specially because he has a two room apartment and could just go in the other room.

I'm a quite shy person, I don't want to bother him and start a neighbor war or something so I never asked him to stop but I'm sick nowadays and it's just too much. And I don't think it's fair because I barely do any noise to respect him and the other neighbors.

863,"I have a really close male friend I met a few years ago when I was studying abroad (I am female). When we both went back home we kept in touch and remain really close friends, and we still talk almost every day, but aren’t anything more than friends - we’ve both made that really clear with each other. He had a girlfriend the year after we met and she hated me but I never really had any interaction with her - she mostly seemed to hate the idea of me, which, to be honest, I can kind of understand - I can see how someone would be wary of their partner having a close friend of the opposite sex who they text every day.
Fast forward to last year, he was in graduate school and I went to visit because I liked the place he was studying in and also wanted to see him. By complete coincidence, one of the girls who was living in his apartment grew up in the same area as me and all three of us thought that was incredibly cool. This girl and I got along great when I visited - we were the kind of friends where it instantly felt like we had known each other forever and I was really sorry when my friend and I went on a weekend trip and she decided not to join us. She said she was sorry she couldn’t come too and I thought she meant it. She and I kept in touch a little for a few months after I came home and I thought we would stay friends, but one day she seemed to have deleted a few of her social media accounts out of the blue. I asked my friend if she was ok because she left so suddenly and he said yes she was fine, just needed a break from social media.
Fast forward again to this winter, when both my friend and his friend are finished with grad school and back where they each grew up. He tells me one day that they are dating and have been for a while. Instantly a bunch of stuff makes sense after this but I still am struggling with the fact that he waited to tell me this until after they were both separate. I can’t help thinking that maybe they were together when I was visiting and maybe they were making fun of me when I wasn’t around for thinking our relationship was anything other than it was. I didn’t think that, but of course it’s possible that they thought I did.
Even though I’m sad for myself I’m really happy for both of them; ultimately I want him to be happy and if she is happy too, then great for both of them. I was initially excited when he told me she was back in her hometown, because she was living so close to me I was so excited to have a new friend around. Not a whole lot of people I grew up with or went to college with live around me, so I don’t have a ton of friends right now and I was so happy to have another person to do stuff with. I reached out to her and told her how excited I was that she was back in town, and maybe we could try to get together, and she said sure and that she would reach out after she had figured out some things. I didn’t reach out again because I figured she would and didn’t want to bug her if she needed time to figure out whatever it was, but she never reached back out. I asked my friend about this and he said maybe she just needs time, so I waited a little longer, but still never heard anything.
Fast forward again to last week; I was looking through old pictures on my Instagram and found one I took of the two of them when I was visiting. I noticed that her Instagram handle was still showing as tagged in the picture even though I thought she had deleted her account, so I clicked it and her Instagram profile picture showed up but the page also said “user not found”. I checked online and apparently that means that person has blocked you. I don’t really know what to do with this info. She was so friendly when I visited, and when we kept in touch afterwards she was still very nice, and I haven’t had any interaction with her since she said she needed to figure things out. I don’t even post very often on social media, so I’m having a really hard time with why I could have been blocked.
I am heartbroken and angry because she was so nice and friendly to me when I met her in person and for months after, and I figured a friend of my friend is my friend - especially one that lives so close to me. I am mad at my friend for ever letting me believe she and I could be friends in the first place if she clearly didn’t want to. From the time I spent with her she really, really didn't seem like the type of person to get jealous or be cruel or act like this, so I feel really confused.
I want to say something about it to him but don’t want to drag him into this problem that isn’t really his, but the whole situation makes me so sad. Is it better to ask him about it and see what he says, or just accept it, forget her, and move on? I can’t imagine cutting him out of my life but I am not sure what the best way forward is.",25Nov2019,1

866,"To present the full story, I need to go back in time a little bit. About 3 months ago I started a new job. First job out of college so honestly I am learning the ways of a job in the “real world”- while I worked during college, it’s so much different now. Two months ago, I had a training that myself and two coworkers needed to attend, and it was in a city 5 hours away. My boss decided we would rent a car and the three of us would share driving responsibilities. We quickly realized I am the only one out of the three of us who has a driving license, so I would be responsible for all the driving. 5 hours each way, plus a 8 hr training, meant this would be a long day. I originally agreed to the plan, went home, thought about it, and changed my mind. I didn’t want to be responsible for my coworkers safety when my mental capacities might be affected by tiredness. I went into work the next day with the intention of re-opening the conversation with my boss. I ran my plan by one of my coworkers (X), a part-time assistant who had worked there for much longer than I. He heard me explain the situation, stood up, told me he would handle it, and went to talk to our boss. He never even gave me a chance to say no, I would rather do it myself. The situation devolved, my boss was mildly upset with me, but I thought we patched everything up after I got a chance to explain myself. 

Cut to two weeks ago, when I learned from coworker X that apparently my boss told X that I am high-maintenance because of the way I handled that situation. 

Cut again to today, when we had an all-staff meeting. We were discussing systems of operation within our office that could be adapted to produce better results. I work for a university, so we operate on a semester schedule, and our semester is coming to a close. A good time to take stock and think about changes that could be made. Out of the X says “Someone recently complained about the office coffee,” while looking directly at me. A few weeks ago I mentioned to him and a few of my other coworkers that I was going to stop drinking the coffee because it upsets my stomach (a very acidic roast). I jump in and say “I think complain is far too harsh of a word, I just mentioned that I don’t like the coffee and stopped drinking it.” My boss, clearly frustrated, then launches into a line of questioning, asking me why I had never brought this up before. Being put on the spot, I couldn’t think and just said the first thing that came to mind- I didn’t feel confident it was a valid complaint that needed to be presented to him. I just quit drinking it, easy solution. Anyway, my boss then started going off about how this is how communication breaks down and we need to communicate these things to him because otherwise we’ll never find a solution-which is true, but I did find a solution- I quit drinking it! He was obviously frustrated with me, and multiple coworkers told me afterward that it was very awkward to witness and he was obviously upset with me. I’m just completely confused about the whole situation- I mean, it’s about coffee! I’m wondering if I should sit down with my boss and explain the situation more fully, or if that is not necessary? I don’t want him to think poorly of me because of this, and I don’t want it to affect our relationship.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated-I’ve been given some advice from coworkers &amp; family and it all differs, so I’m really at a loss as to how to handle this.",25Nov2019,1
867,"Just typing this is making me tear up. Ugh.

I've always had a tough life. My childhood was complete shit. My mom was neglectful and abusive. I was sexually abused by a family member for years and I'm still trying to deal with that trauma. Ever since I've moved in 2017 to Pennsylvania, things have been worse. My mom's control has been out of hand. Due to her irresponsibility, she didn't register me in school before the deadline. Which means that I had to do online school. My mom promised that she'd pay for it so I could get my highschool diploma, but she didn't. Instead, she started making late payments and ended up not paying at all. She owes them about $1k for tuition. So, I don't have my highschool diploma. So then I had nothing to focus on. I'd be inside for months because my mom made sure that the groceries were delivered to us. She made sure to never give me transportation money to go anywhere because I needed her permission first. So, I didn't have a social life. I didn't have friends. Didn't go outside. The only time I went outside was when I was throwing out the trash and checking the mails. It felt like a prison. In fact, she's so controlling that she'd literally tell me what groceries to get and what to wear. She was like this big wall that blocked me from having a life. I couldn't work because she conveniently lost my documents. I couldn't have friends because I didn't have transportation and had no way of getting money to get transportation. She also didn't want me to have friends because she said that they'd rape me, or they'd kill me. Which has not only made me fearful of going outside, but extremely socially anxious.

&amp;#x200B;

But, it's not about my mom. Again, backstory. So, I met a friend online and was his friend for only a month. He heard my story, and offered to take me in. I took the risk of living with a stranger than being with my mom because my mom was making it impossible to live her. My breaking point was when she threatened to stab me with a knife for standing up against her blatant disrespect and overall bullying.

Now, my roommate is nice and isn't a creep but he's definitely a slob. I have never met someone so chronically lazy until I met him. He doesn't clean but makes messes. He's very passive aggressive and likes saying things under his breath. He's extremely sarcastic, and unable to hear any form of criticism. He's a man-child. He's a baby in a grown man's body. He's... childish. So childish that his mother comes over nearly everyday to clean up after him, sometimes cooks for him, and washes his clothes.

I try to bite my tongue and try to tough it out because he's paying for everything. He pays for the electricity, food, and rent. He doesn't require me to pay a dime because he understands that it isn't easy to get on your feet. But, I felt like he didn't realize that I'm an entirely different human being. I think that he's very inconsiderate, very obnoxious, and very irritating. I told him that I'd be an expense before I moved in with him. I told him that I'd try to be as little as an expense as I can but I do have things I need. But I felt like, ever since I moved in with him, it's like he tossed his hands up and no longer helps. It's like he thinks that because he pays for the things that he benefits from, he doesn't need to help me any further.

So, when it came to getting the documents I needed, I had to suck up my pride and ask my mother for money because my roommate wasn't helping. When it came to getting transportation to get my ID, I had to ask my mom. When it came to paying the fee to get my ID, I had to ask my mom. When it came to getting transportation to go to the Social Security Office, I had to ask my mom. And as a result of me having to her, I've been belittled, degraded, patronized against, and humiliated.

You see, when it comes to asking for money from my roommate, I rarely do it. Again, I don't like being an expense. But when I do ask for help, it's always a negotiation. So, if I ask for $20, he'll say $10. Then we'll compromise on $15. If I need transportation to go somewhere, he'll make an excuse. And if he does agree, he'll say ""next paycheck"" or, he'll say ""I'll pay for the uber and give you the details"" despite knowing that I know how to use uber and lyft. It's almost like he's looking at what I'm using the money for. When he knows I'm not into anything sketchy or bad. It's kinda like control. Instead of giving me the money to just pay for my own uber, he pays for the uber. It's ... ridiculous. So I hate asking him for money or anything because he's extremely unreliable. But if its something that he benefits from, he has no issue of paying for anything. It is his money, after all. So I brush it off.

And then I got this job at Forever 21. A minimum wage job. A friend of mine vouched for me to get the job and I got hired the same exact day. But I thought she'd help me out a bit more when it came to transportation since I was 15 minutes away from work. But, she didn't. So, I had to quit. And quitting that job made me want to die. I'm not lazy. I want to work. I want to get my own money so I don't have to ask my roommate for anything or my mother. And when I had to leave that job, it hurt because now I go right back to asking my roommate and mom for help again.

I just want to be in a position where I'm okay. I want to be able to financially take care of myself and be okay. And it's just hard because I'm trying to get my GED. I'm trying to not be an expense despite me needing things. I'm trying to not depend on my mom so she doesn't lower my self esteem lower than it already is. I'm trying and trying and I feel like I'm not getting anywhere. I feel like a failure.

And I fucked up recently. I really did. I was venting to my friend about my roommate and I think he overheard so I think I might be kicked out soon because he's been distant and he's been ignoring me. So.. I don't know. The reason I was venting about my roommate is because I felt like a slave. My roommate has this thing where he'll ask you to do things he's fully capable of doing. Now, I clean up after myself. I do my part. But it's like he wants me to do everything. He wants me to clean up his messes and has no remorse. He wants me to sweep, mop, vacuum, take care of his pets, and smile while doing all of it. And I feel like a slave. So, I finally told him that I didn't want to do any of that anymore. That he'll have to clean up after himself. He agreed. But then he wanted me to get the clothes from his mother. There's literally a laundry area downstairs in our apartment building. He's so lazy that he doesn't even want to wash his own clothes. He wants his mother to come over, take the clothes, wash the clothes by her house, and bring it back. Her house is like 10 minutes away. Its been getting cold out so.. she's been asking me to do it. So, I told my roommate that I didn't want to do that anymore. I asked if I could do all of our clothes in the on-site laundry area in our apartment building. He said ""No. That'll be too much of a hassle""

So, I responded with ""Well, I guess you'll have to get your own clothes because I'm not going to walk that walk every time we have to get our clothes washed.""

He didn't like that response and said, ""I'm not going to pay an arm's length for laundry each week. My mom has been nice enough to do our clothes. So, I guess I will walk to get my clothes."" 

And I responded with, ""Well, I guess so. I'll do my clothes here and make sure to handle my own clothes.""

He didn't like that and called me ""Difficult."" 

He then came to a compromise and said how he just has to go to the bank and take out money in cash for the money exchange (you need quarters to wash). 

But I was upset by all of the passive aggressiveness. So, I called my friend and was talking about my roommate. I got tired of him. I can't go to my roommate and say ""Hey, can you not do this?"" without catching an attitude or dealing with passive aggression. I cannot ask my roommate for a thing. I cannot express how I feel. So, I needed to vent before I hurt my roommate's feelings. And now I regret it because my roommate was eavesdropping and he heard things he didn't like hearing. 

&amp;#x200B;

And now I think I'm at risk of being kicked out because he's been quiet. He's anything but quiet. So thats really a bad sign and I cannot go back home. I'd rather die than go back there. So I'm fucked. I just.. I just want to cry. I should've kept my thoughts to myself. I should've just been way more thankful and appreciative for the things my roommate has given .  And I just had to fucking talk. I had to vent. I had to just.. run my mouth to a friend. All because I couldn't deal with some inconveniences. 

I just feel like I'm failing at life. I'm failing because I don't have my GED or highschool diploma. I'm failing because I don't have a job. I don't drive. I don't even have credit to my name. I don't have money. I don't even like myself . I just feel so defeated.

I feel like I'm a fuck up. Like I'm doomed.  Like I have some curse on me or something. Because my life is shit. It really is. Everything about my life is hard and I just.. I just... I'm over it. I'm tired of fighting or hoping things will get better. They never do.",25Nov2019,1

871,"It's a story.  No TL/DR, just read on.
So, August of 2018, a friend offered to add me on their contract so they could get the 4th line discount and I could get a new phone. The phones were BOGO free and she gifted me the free phone. Since we had been friends for a couple years, I figured that rocks, thank you and went ahead with the new phone,agreeing to pay my portion of the bill. I even offered to pay a little extra for the phone every month,to help her out. She refused the extra payment, and I thanked her for the phone many times. It truly was very kind.
Now, I did not add my name to the contract, I have not given my ID, ssn,or anything. Just had my number ported to this new phone. And new phone delivered to me when it arrived.

Fast forward  to this month, and due to a falling out between us, she (the account owner) didn't want to 'help' me anymore because  'she only helps friends.' Fine. I offer to continue paying my portion of the bill until August 2020, to compete the 2 year contract and then find my own plan. 
She said she would let me know what she wanted to do, and I said great, just let me know so I can make arrangements. This was on November 8th (2019). I had heard nothing more from her. 

On November 11th, I woke up at about 9:30am to no phone service, and 2 voicemails from an Ann at att, calling on behalf of the account owner to have my number/line removed from her account and that I'd need to call some 800# to finish the transfer.  Obviously, I was unable to make the call (I tried) so I went out (in a snowstorm that was just hitting us, mind you, and I don't drive) to get a prepay phone. I get this phone, set it up, and try to get my number ported to this new phone. Was told I would need to go to an ATT store for that. Said whatever, not in this weather, I'll just keep this new number and since there was no service to the contract phone, I shut the power off and set it on a shelf. 

Fast forward to the 22nd when I happen to plug in the contract phone to erase data, remove Google accounts, etc and up pops a whole bunch of texts and voicemails, all from att. ( since everyone has my new number now, no personal calls or texts were on there.) Phone service to my line had been restored on the 21st apparently, and now I'm getting automated pay your bill calls from att and one from an att store rep on the 21st alerting me that  ""the account owner gave me financial responsibility  to take my number and put it in my own name, so i would just have to make a payment, then I can go in to any att store with my ID, speak to the manager, and there is a priority note on the account saying ____ has given me financial responsibility. "" 
What? How? 


What I would like to know is : 
What the heck are my options here? Do I wipe the phone and return it to att and say thanks but no thanks or return it to the 'friend' so she can have the phone and do with it whatever she wants? I have zero desire to assume any responsibility for this line, as I did not agree to this nor was I informed this would be a thing, it just happened. Is there any way this can be shoved off on me without my permission or consent? I really don't want to screw this chick over, and did offer to continue paying my portion, but since she abruptly cut off my line, I did not pay. And nor do I plan on paying for someone else's gross error. I have not used the phone, nor do I plan to.

Advice is MUCH needed here. I would like to just br free of this, that woman,and move on with my new number and phone plan.

Thank you in advance!",25Nov2019,1
872,"So my mum's been an alcoholic since I can remember, attempted twice right in front of my eyes when i was 4 and 8. I didn't really know what was going on since I was so little still, but i knew that something was wrong.

She was an alcoholic and a heavy smoker, and has COPD, a fatal illness which only gets worse by smoking.

When i was around 12, I realized that she had a problem. At age 13 she was admitted to the hospital, and many times after that.

In 2016 she started to get a hold of herself, was doing great. Stopped drinking and smoking all at once. I threw a one year sobriety party.

2019 on january 20th, my birthday, i found her drunk on the stairs, smoking. And it's been going on since then. She's afraid of the hospital and i don't know what to do. My older sister got her into hospital back then, and my mother has resented her ever since.

874,"One job that opened up was a billing position, but the department thaat opened up never had somebody looking it over. I said I would help out in this departments billing until they found someone permanent.

Over the past couple of months of helping out here I realized there were so many problems. I started doing much more than billing and it’s helped out so many people. 

I spoke to the boss about assuming this role while maintaining my current role. I came up with a great plan and he was enthusiastic about it.

Fast forward to today and we sit down to salary.

I came up with an additional $13 an hour, knowing i was going to be underpaid but I didn’t want to push.

Boss comes back with a max $5 extra an hour.

Now they can hire someone to do billing, and pay them $20 an hour for 20 hours, other 20 hours are doing other finances and admin work.

They can hire someone to oversee the entire department, my guess is $25 an hour for 40 hours.

I’m asking going from $23 to $36 while maintaining my current job plus taking on an entire department.

What should I do here?

Notes: I’ve been doing this extra work for free for two
Months. And can add it into my work flow easily, it doesn’t add more than a few hours of extra work for me. And yes my current job is literally 40 hours, I’m just extremely good at working efficiently.

875,"Context: I'm in college and over the past couple semesters I've managed get rooms that no one wants. Couple people noticed this so I got put in a room with a guy I sort of knew  at the time(not necessarily a friend). 
I got sick and he helped me get to the hospital, my folks came to visit and he got their numbers because he said he was a friend (i don't know how this thing works roommate=friend).

So couple weeks have passed and I notice my folks are sending me money a little too often now (college costs a lot and I usually feel weird asking for more money). So the other day my sister was like ""hey does you friend waste money on random stuff"", and I'm like ""I don't know, why?"" And It turns out they are sending me more money  because my roommate would ask for money and they think we both need cash so they send us both some.

He is a nice guy who thinks of me as a friend and I don't want to come off as an asshole but to me he as just some guy who I happens to be in a room with me till the end of the semester.(side note: one time he hugged me, freaked me the fuck out)

I don't really talk much so I still haven't asked him why he is asking for money from my family and not his own(I mean they seem well off) 

How do I bring this up in an conversation? 
How do I communicate to him that hey we are not close enough for you to start asking my family for cash?",25Nov2019,1
876,"Dream, Friends or school?

I‘m dreaming of becoming a streamer. The odds that I‘ll ever get there are low but it’s been my dream for a long time.
 I know that if I don’t try I‘ll never stop thinking about how cool I‘d be to be a streamer. If I try to be a streamer than there going to be a very sad and depressing phase where I might lose friends, hobbies and good grades. Once I‘m out of that phase because it’s actually working out I‘ll be living the dream but I might never get out of this phase. I might die alone with nobody there when I speak my last words and when I‘m burried beneath the earth forever. But if I don’t try I‘ll probably always think about what I’m missing out and if I‘d succeed than I‘ll be a happy man. 

Here comes the edit: I have been doing this for two years now and I always start streaming and I see how my social life, especially my family, starts to change. One of the problems I have with streaming is: My setup is in an open space where my sister hears everything I say. She’s usually learning since she is in her last year of school and I have to be quiet and I’m also very awkward when streaming while somebody from my family is listening. They all hate gaming.

880,"This may seem like a strange request for advice, but I don’t understand what has happened? Me (F) and my coworker (M) had a real good connection since the day I started working, feeling like we could share a range of things to each other (from family, secrets, dating, etc). I will admit I may have some feelings for him (he’s even stayed the night at my place, even though we didn’t sleep together), but I’ve always believed he didn’t look at me that way. So since we talked about everything I told him I had started seeing this guy, and since then he’s changed. 
The thing is that I had hoped that there was maybe something between us, but then my other coworker told me they had been sleeping together (one time before he stayed with me and twice after). I came to the understanding that he saw it as only friendship between us, but as the title says, he’s been really distant, can sometimes become rude, and comments are often about this guy I’m seeing. 
Last thing that i don’t really get is that when us colleagues went out on town one of his friends told me that “I think you should be placing your bets on my friend, and not the guy you’re seeing”.

888,"Me and my fiancee were living in a house with another couple and their daughter. They were the ones on the lease we just rented a room from them. They were absolutely disgusting and lived like animals. Trash everywhere dishes piled in the sink with mold on em. We just stayed in our room when we were home and ended up doing our dishes in the tub. Just filthy people. It was an old house and one night we had a small electrical outlet fire. Called the fire department they came out gave the all clear and told us we had to have the house inspected to be sure it was up to code. City gave us 6 months to fix the issue. Fast forward 6 months later. We notice them start moving their stuff out little by little with no word. Fine cool we will call the landlord and sign a new lease. We call the landlord and inform him of the situation. That's when he tells us that he sent people out multiple times to inspect and fix the problem. That they wouldn't let the people in to fix it probably due to the house being an absolute disaster. He also tells us that he is taking them to court for 6 months of unpaid rent. Because they were on the lease we paid them and they supposedly paid the landlord but didnt. Now due to being burned in the past we paid them in money orders in the landlords company name because that's what the landlord said we could do. Write the money order in his company name. Still to this day I have no idea how they cashed these money orders but they did because we tried to get our money back with the receipt. You know because if it's not cashed they will return the money if you have a receipt. Ok so the landlord told us let him think about it and he would let us know in a week. 3 days later the house was condemned due to unsafe living environment and we had to be out that day. 12 hours is all the city gave us to get everything we owned. We ended having to leave half of our stuff there, all of our furniture everything. So basically now me and my fiancee are homeless living in a tent in fucking october. Delaware btw so not a warm state in october. We are on waiting lists for apartments but they can take up to a year to get in.

889,"Hey, tl;dr my housemates are cishet (straight and not trans or non binary) and keep going to the local LGBT+ club. Should I tell them not to?

Under this post I’m gonna address some of the common arguments I see about cishet people going to gay clubs (and also lost some circumstances where I think it’s fine). My mind isn’t gonna change.

But yeah basically when I first moved in we had a housewarming and I suggested I take then to the local gay club (I’m a lesbian). I wanted to show them that aspect of my life, they agreed to help wingman me, seemed wholesome. It was only four of us, I think it’s fine to bring a small number of cishet people if they’re aware they’re guests. One of them ended up inviting a load of friends so there were like 15 of us in a gay club, me the only queer one. I felt uncomfortable with this but even more uncomfortable saying something (I have to live with them for a year this was 2 days in, I didn’t know them before moving in).

Also, our local gay club is atm having issues with becoming too straight. Guys keep hitting on me when I go there, sometimes most the girls I speak to will be straight, it honestly often feels like a straight club and it makes me feel anxious hitting on women. There was an incident recently where some cishet guys tried to bathroom police me (the toilets there are gender neutral, I went into the urinals (which have toilet toilets in) bc the queue was long, this is perfectly allowed and acceptable in a queer space, men use the non urinal toilets all the time). Probably my worst night was a couple nights ago, there was an lgbt festival then we went to the queer club after. It was great till about 2, I was dancing sluttily and really enjoying female attention, then about three cishet guys eyed me up, were visibly excited, tried to speak to me. They didn’t harass me, but I felt disrespected and like my ability to comfortably express my sexuality was robbed. 

I’m fine with bi/trans guys hitting on me. Obvs you can’t know someone’s sexuality but it’s just obvious that so many of these guys are cishet. There’s a presumption from them that I am there to get with them. Bi &amp; trans guys understand I am probably there to hook up with girls and just don’t act as presumptuously. Cishet guys act as if a guy hitting on a girl is the default. It’s not. If not in a gay club I def don’t act like lesbianism was the default and flirt with girls in the same way I do at queer clubs.

I have three housemate. First is a girl and doesn’t really go to the gay club. Second is a cishet guy and goes with his cishet friends and cishet girlfriend sometimes. Third is a single cishet guy who goes there to pull girls (???).

I don’t want to talk to the third housemate. He’s a white cishet guy and gets upset when people draw attention to this (I’m talking really minor things like a brown guy was round and said “you have an excuse not to handle spice, you’re quite” cos he was joking how he felt ashamed that he couldn’t handle spice then the white guy said “I’m the exact same”). The second housemate I believe would be more receptive. The first I think it wouldn’t matter if we disagreed (she’d feel fine), and because she’s brown I could probs explain it by making analogies to race (if she went to a BAME space that was full of white people I’m sure she wouldn’t like it).

I’m just unsure whether I should. I don’t like them being there but it feels wrong to act like I can decide where they club. Also I’m unsure how I’d bring it up.

CIRCUMSTANCES PPL BRING UP

If your gay friend invites you - fine, but understand that you’re a guest

To escape creepy men - if you are a cishet girl with a group of queer friends and you explain the situation then they invite you, then fine. If you are going with a group of other cishet people, no. Queer women on average suffer more sexual harassment than cishet women (so we do empathise a lot), but ultimately, you’re getting rid of your problem by creating a new problem for people who are queer. Also a lot of non binary people and gay men have reported harassment from cishet girls before. It’s not that different, to us, to if a bunch of men can’t into a women’s only space. It’s not fair, and this situation isn’t forcing you to go to queer clubs (so many cishet girls have the same issue and still choose to respect our space).

You’re bicurious - yes please come.

You’re “queer” in another way. You’re a cishet man who is maybe quite effeminate, doesn’t identify with traditional masculinity, has a “queer” side of you that you want to celebrate but you don’t identify with any of the LGBT+ labels or the LGBT+ community - I would personally invite you. You’re going there for self expression (same reason as us), not to hit on girls. I doubt you’ll treat this place like a cishet space. It’ll also be a safe space for you.

“You can’t know if people are cishet” - correct on an individual basis you can’t know (which is why we have no power to stop it). But we can tell when the atmosphere of our space changes, becomes less welcoming, and I know for a fact my housemates are cishet.

“Everyone has a right to go where they want” - yeah you have the legal right, but it can still be disrespectful / assholeish to go to a queer space when you’re not queer.

“Stag do / hen night” - meh. If this was the only time cishet people came I wouldn’t care.

“I’m bisexual and going with my partner, we look like a straight couple” - of course that’s fine. I don’t get angry when I see guys getting with girls (I sometimes experiment with queer men in gay clubs), I get annoyed when the environment stops being queer. You are queer. You are not the disrespectful cishet people I am directing this at. Your presence doesn’t mean they aren’t there too.

“My partner is bisexual/queer, I’m not” - sure also come.

“I’m asexual” - again you’re also queer. Pretty much the same.

“Not everyone is there to pull. What about girls in relationships? Should they not come too? Is that what you’re saying?” - not what I’m saying. I don’t believe girls exist for me to get with and I don’t mind if I go out and I can’t pull (happens all the time lol). Not everyone uses queer spaces to pull. But some people do, and I at least should feel like I have the option to try to pull. If too many cishet people are there then that stops being an option for me, and also it ties in to being unable to express myself etc.",25Nov2019,1

But lately I’ve been *so* depressed to the point of having suicidal thoughts. This isn’t entirely new—I’ve had on and off depression for several years and was on anti-anxiety medication for most of my early twenties. Last year I went through a terrible break up around this time and I was sad then, too. But this feels different… I struggle to get out of bed in the morning and if I wake up in the middle of the night (I often do) I start thinking about all the terrible things in my life and I can’t go back to sleep. My favorite time of day is when I get to go to bed because I know I get to turn my brain off. Like I mentioned, logistically I don’t have much to complain about… But I feel like I’m going nowhere in my career, I don’t know what I want to do with my life, I’ve made some terrible financial mistakes (lost over $1200 recently) and I just don’t like myself or think I’m a good person. 

I’m not fully suicidal—the thoughts have just started to come up and I think, “man, it would be easier if I didn’t have to do life.” I’ve had these thoughts throughout a great deal of my adulthood, so much so that I thought occasional suicidal thoughts were just part of life.. But now I have them 3-5x per day at least. I don’t tell my boyfriend—he knows I’ve been going through a rough time but he thinks it’s because I was unemployed for most of the summer. We’ve only been together 9 months and I also don’t want to scare him away from dating me.  It’s so hard to be hopeful about anything because I don't see my life going anywhere. The happiest I am is when I’m with my boyfriend or receiving validation in the form of compliments/praise. When it’s time for me to say goodbye to my boyfriend after  we spend a weekend or night together, I don’t want to leave because I know the second I do, I won’t have any distractions from my dark thoughts. I can’t imagine telling him the even though I wonder if that would help. 

I’m just so angry at myself for being dumb with money, not taking my career as seriously as I should have in my twenties, or knowing what to do with my life. People would be shocked to know this about me—I'm literally described as one of the happiest/sweetest people. But it all feels like a lie. 

I have a therapist, and I tell her that I’m depressed, but I’m afraid to tell her I’m having suicidal thoughts because I’m afraid she’ll inform authorities or my parents or something, and I REALLY don’t want them to worry. I'm honestly afraid to tell anyone.

896,"I have helped out regularly at my church along with other people.

I set everything up in the morning, but one of the deacons usually asks if I can do extra stuff like taking the stuff back up when other people usually do that.

Lately I’ve been trying to just avoid him and a few times I said I’ll help him take the stuff back up but never did and made an excuse like you were busy talking when he would confront me, and he would  just chuckle and look at me dumbfounded.

I’m tired of serving so much and I can tell he’s tired too and I see anger beneath his surface.

898,"**Long post ahead, my apologies, but you have been warned.**

So my mom is... well, I don't want to say abusive, because I don't personally think it's that bad, but let's just say that she (and sometimes my dad) can get rather incensed, and regularly say or do things to me (19M) or my little sister (14F) that I *really* don't appreciate.

Some context - I'm a uni student, living at home, and my parents are not charging me. I do help with general cleaning, chores, errands, and I do have a part-time job on the side. My sister just started high school, and my family is Indian, which is of some relevance. We live in Canada (and have since I was 3).

If you don't know, Indian parents generally have a different approach to discipline than the average North American parents. I know when I was younger my mom would drill me for subjects, sometimes slapping me or shouting at me if I didn't do them fast enough or correctly. I once got beaten by my dad (at home) when I picked a chili off a plant in a garden centre. The general attitude towards my education has continued long into high school, and only in university have they really stopped (according to them, more out of apathy than because they trust me or whatever).

When I didn't win any student awards at my Gr.8 graduation... things weren't pretty. No hitting, but a lot of crying and shouting from my parents, and they continue to remind me of this almost randomly when they get upset and start lecturing, regardless of what the original reason they got angry was. On that note, they do this *a lot*. I've complained and tried to tell them that I don't appreciate them bringing up random events half a decade ago as fuel for an argument, but it's pretty much been ignored.

Another thing to point out in that vein is that they regularly twist my words (or my sisters words) against us. Usually its my mom doing this when explaining things to my dad, presumably to turn the opinion against us. And of course, I don't get much of a chance to argue, otherwise I'm looking ""disobedient"" or ""rebellious"".

Another good example is when it came time to pick a uni during Gr. 12. Originally, the plan was for me to take a bio course (preferably something that could lead into medicine or something). I should point out that both my parents said prior to this for several months that they really didn't mind what I did as long as I was happy. Seems fine right? Well, at the last second (a few days before we accepted an offer), I had a change of heart. I realized that, based on how my Gr.12 science courses went, I'd *hate* doing that for a career, and I enjoyed business and whatnot more.

Needless to say, they still aren't happy, and bring it up as often as they can. My sister tends to stress about things far more than I do, and she hasn't realized that when asked how she did on a test, the only acceptable answer is ""good"" or ""great"". Saying ""I found it a little difficult"" will often result in lectures the next day and complaints as to how we clearly didn't study hard enough, and if we're lazing about on our phones or gadgets too much, of course we'll fail, unlike all our totally smarter friends. Yes, I hate that too - I really hate being compared to my friends for almost anything, and my parents get mad if I point that out.

I think you're getting a picture here. Needless to say, I've tried to argue with them. Not only have I yet to convince them of anything, I often tend to add more fuel to the fire. Mind you, I don't yell - I'm not all that confrontational to begin with. But regardless, I'll find the things I've said tearfully repeated to make me seem like the bad guy, while accusing me of ruining their dreams and wasting my life away like some of my cousins (one of whom got arrested for molestation, and let me tell I don't like that comparison at *all*).

It doesn't help that these mood swings are unpredictable. One hour, my mom'll be perfectly kind and helpful, the next I'm getting an earful (or as my sister found out yesterday when she was ""caught"" spending an hour on her phone in her room rather than studying, having her phone thrown at her and accused of sending nudes or some shit).

Disclaimer - my dad tends to be much more quiet on average, and I'm hesitant to blame him these days, as he spends most of his time at work (mind you, helping pay for everything since my mom is a SAHM), and regardless of the fact that all his knowledge on how we act comes through our mom (he doesn't much care to actually listen to what I say), he forgives us pretty quickly.

Look, for all this, I want to point out that I feel like they are right to compare me at times, or feel upset. Compared to some/most of my friends/kids my age, my grades aren't as high (though still satisfactory for me), I stay at home on my computer (which in fairness, is where all my work is done), and my sister does tend to mouth off more than I think she should, and spend a fair bit of time on her phone. She's the one getting the most of the anger these days, and while I defend her as best as I can, I often find that regardless of what I say, it only makes things worse, so I'm stuck. I'm not exempt, mind you, but the majority of the hate, is through snide remarks while they're lecturing my sister, like ""we don't want you to end up like him (me)"", or ""look at what happened to him"" (as if I ended up in jail or something).

I'm just really stuck, folks. I can't leave home because I really can't finance school + living on a single part-time job ATM (or at least I don't think I can), and I doubt any of this is something the police or protection agencies would be able to act on, so I'm kinda just left to suck it up at this point.

I know it's his birthday today because he mentioned it on our date (I guess I have pretty good memory) so today I went up to him, greeted him and gave him a hug. My intentions were just being friendly, because he's a nice guy and has been helping me with school since we share a class together. But later today he texted me saying he'd love to go on a date with me.

So i literally just lost about $2,500 for literally no good reason just because im dumb and indecicive and impulsive. I applied for a study abroad program but the closer it gets the more I feel like I dont really want to go. If i withdraw now i will have to pay $2,500 for nothing or I could go and pay $4,500 but at least get the experience. I just feel like im not in a good place in my life emotionally or mentally to go but should i go anyway just so that I dont loose money? I’m sure I’ll end up enjoying it somewhat and part of me knows its a great experience that I’ll miss out on. I just feel really dumb and i wish I hadnt applied on such a whim. Also I know I have the $2,500 in my savings but idk if I will have the whole $4,500. Also do you guys have any tips for me, I seem to get myself into situations like this a lot like I’ll do something on a whim and then I’ll freakout and want out.

907,"I (21f) am going to move overseas to Australia in 2 months to be with my boyfriend (21). 
We met 1.5 years ago when we were both travelling. We've lived in each other's countries for a few months each. We decided that if anyone I will be the one to make the permanent move. For my uni course I have to do an exchange semester so we thought this is the perfect opportunity to see if we work out in day to day life. Kinda like a trial. Everything is paid for and organised and I'm leaving in 2 months. 

I thought long and clear before I made this decision and I thought it is the right decision for the following reasons 



- I like Australia 
- I love my boyfriend and I want to give us a fair go.
- I need to do an exchange semester anyway. 
- I'm only 21 if it doesn't work out I can come back 
- either way it'll be a valuable experience. 

I was excited for the most time but lately I've been having doubts. I'm really anxious about going and I'm not sure if it was a mistake. But I also really love my boyfriend and I think I'd have regrets if I didn't st least try it for these six months. 
But at the same time I keep thinking what if after these 6 months I'm still unsure. And it makes me so anxious.

909,"Background info:

I have worked as a nurse assistant /in-home caregiver/ restorative nurse assistant (kind of like a physical therapist assistant, in long-term care homes) for 9 years since I've been 17, but I still want to learn more! I'm in nursing school for my RN, and while I've been working at my current job at a post acute care facility (basically where patients are too healthy to be in the hospital, but need more help before they go home) for 2 years. I've been working hard to be the best I can be. I've learned how to train body mechanics courses for the hospital (basically how not to hurt yourself when taking care of patients), the charting system (I'm the only one who teaches this), as well as I've learned how to train a program for monitoring hazardous patients (those who may injure themselves purposefully/unpurposefully)  that we're one of the hospitals piloting for the entire corporation (others have learned how to train but have no desire to train).

Tldr: I try my best to be an asset to the company and learn more in my field.

However, recently, I've had a very troubling experience with the company as a whole. More or less, I'm having an insurance dispute regarding a necessary procedure that I've been planning for the last 11 months and sunk $4,000 USD into. 

Our corporate HR has been very unhelpful and I spoke with my manager regarding my frustrations. While she's sympathetic (she's really great) there's nothing she can do to help me. 

But the fact that our company as a whole is generally treating me poorly makes me so mad and stressed that I have no desire to help our local facility. They're awesome people , but ""the company"" has been screwing over awesome employees left and right. ""Streamlining"" our processes and sacking loyal employees all over. Giving the rest of us the responsibility to pick up the slack!

Note: No matter how poorly the company treats me, I'll never treat my patients differently. But should I help my local hospital when the corporate offices treat me and others so poorly? I have enough stress (full-time work, school, battling with mental health issues and new home ownership) without caring about them...

He doesn't drink, he doesn't gamble and as far as we all know, he's still faithful to my mom. So we're missing about $12000. Which has got my family depending on me a LOT more than ever. So far they've borrowed about $1500 for bills, grocieries and my brother's car repair. Today I got an NSF fee because they drained my account shopping for Thanksgiving stuff (food and decorations. Now my mom is talking about having my dad's name removed from bills because of the alzheimers. Thing is, that requires a lawyer's advice (in her opinion) and guess who is going to be paying for that?

The thing is, I have a $75/month recurring charge because I go to therapy. Its the only thing keeping me stable rn. I work only part time and I'm saving everything I can for classes. I'm down $1000 which means rather than take 3 classes next semester I can only take 2. It also means I'm not moving out on my own.

912,"My friend's father was very abusive to my friend when he was a child until his mother divorced him and he moved away. Since then my friend not only had no contact with him, he doesn't even know where he lives. Needless to say, he doesn't want to anyways.

Recently, my mother told me that a member of her church community claimed that my friend's father had another son with another woman, way before my friend was born. My friend never told me about this, even though he told me a lot of other things related to his family. So if he knew about it, I think he would have definitely told me by now. At first, I was sceptical about this and labeled it as a shallow rumor, so I asked my mother to find out more information about it next time she would see her again, which she did.

From what she then told me, it seems to be true. Apparently, the church-goer used to be  close friends with my friend's father, which is why she knows about her firstborn son. She even gave my mother specific information about him, apparently he is 30 years old, lives in a villiage not too far from ours and works in a certain car workshop. And apparently, she is not the only one who can confirm this information.

I'm still not sure if I should believe this story but it's not unlikely either. It's possible that my friend's mother either didn't know about this or that she kept it a secret from her son. It would 
fit since she (rightfully) has a very low opinion on her former husband, trying to remove him from their lives as much as possible and only referring to him as the ""begetter"" of my friend, never his father.

Nevertheless, I think that if the story is right, than my friend has every right to know about his half-brother. So I'm looking forward to tell him about it as soon as I have enough accurate information about this. The thing is that I don't really know how I should approach that. I have no idea how my friend will react to this if he really doesn't know about this, but I'm sure that this is hard news for him, so I want to avoid giving him the information to suddenly. What makes this harder to achieve is that I didn't have any contact to him for a year and we just recently started spending time together again. So I don't know how I should start such an intimite conversation or if it's even appropriate.

The place is a brand new build and is unfinished and unfloored. I've signed up with the electricity company, signed up for council tax and internet and I've done my electoral registration.

So far I have a bed, two beside tables, a chest of drawers and inbuilt wardrobe. I have a couch, a book shelf and a coffee table. I have an induction hob for cooking whilst I hunt around for a new oven.

Right now, I need a fridge and freezer, an oven, a washing machine and I need to get the flooring done. The plan right now is to get vinyl flooring in the kitchen, bathroom and utility room as those places will be exposed to moisture. Then I can think about getting carpet.

The furniture and stuff I have right now is just going to be temporary until I can afford to get round to decorating with things of my choosing rather than those of necessity

Am I missing anything important and is there any sources of inspiration that I can use to help me choose my own style.

I (fresh 19yo M) can ""change personalities""(pretend) depending on who I accompany  -- most of the time I am kind, easy to talk to, who gladly listens to problems. But deep down I am a **huge introvert** who enjoys personal space, time spent alone, having fun online (games ofc) and **worrying a lot about what people think about me**. Overthinking even the smallest problems and worrying about everyday stuff like mum  tells you to do something and you forget it -&gt; Boom anxiety for a week even tho she forgets about it an hour later.

""Standart family"": Older sister, graduating next year, hard working, no problems at all, but we rather spent time alone doing our stuff. Dad, a little workoholic, graduated from IT, supports me in hobbies. Mom also a little workoholic, doctor. Raised with care and kindness.

During highschool got pretty close to commiting suicide just from tossing pencilcase around and getting shot by paper from rubber bands. Told parents by paper since I was unable to tell them for +- 2 months. Graduated from highschool this year and got quite high in placement to IT college. Here I am a college student. Unfortunately throughout my studies I needed only a few hours to study. We got untold policy at home that I can do whatever I want if my grades are good in some way. So I am mostly playing games instead of studying or programming.

I'm acting like everything is fine but it isn't. Gave up already on 1 subject and now can't afford to fail another. And now after some math I'm unable to acquire needed points in next 3 weeks to even get to university exam.

**I know it isn't a new thing that someone gets kicked out of college, but I have no idea how to tell my parents**. This is totally my fault. Now they see me as a hard working student. Then might blame me for gaming instead of stuDYING(most annoying thing that exists). Will they restrict me from pc for indefinite period of time? (I spent +- 8 hours a day online, but it isn't addiction.... I just don't have better things to do, always home, always there when needed). They wouldn't kicked me out of the house. Then there are few friends that also study (different colleges) what will they think about me afterwards.

I just can't put it over my head.

Imagining all the different outcomes and  possibilities that might happen after I tell them. And every day it feels like it's getting worse. And it has been only 2 days since I know and it's driving me insane.

The job market in my town requires me to be 18+, have practical skills, and be present mentally.  I do not for their standards. I still apply, but to no avail.  So I decided to work hard in school.  Turns out I have focus issues beyond my control.  The only way I get some control is by taking supplements.  The money I used to buy supplements came from my father, who is no longer speaking to me due to my odd behavior.   Caffeine is barely doing the job. 

I am failing bad and I can not for the life of me focus on my work.  My therapists, as in multiple therapists, claim that I am depressed and am not trying.  They may be right about the depression (even though I think I have ADHD), but no matter how hard I try I can not do my work.  Not completely anyways.   I have no idea what to do.  Almost every time I attempt to do work, even after my 8th cup of coffee, I can not do it.   

What can I do?",25Nov2019,1
943,"I’m on a weight loss journey but due to many factors my weight fluctuates a lot. I’m not obese, but I’ve got a big stomach, thighs and love handles.

My stomach and love handles are my biggest insecurities and I’ve mentioned it to him before. He once tried to reassure me that I’m not fat by saying he’s not attracted to fat or chubby girls, therefore he wouldn’t be attracted to me. Well... okay but.....I’m chubby...????

A few days ago we were chilling on his bed when he started doing the usual touching, but when he got to my stomach I froze and almost started crying. It was that time of the month and I was bloated, and immediately started thinking he’d get grossed out because he doesn’t like fat girls....He tried telling me he likes every part of me &amp;stuff and refused to remove his hand, trying to prove to me that there was nothing wrong with me. Well, didn’t exactly work, as now I’m filled with even more self doubt. 

Recently he started randomly pinching and poking my stomach, squeezing my love handles when we hug, etc. and it’s making me very uncomfortable. I don’t want to tell him, because I’m not expecting him to tip toe around my insecurities, but after what he said about fat girls I’m starting to feel???Unloved in a way. As if he’s subtly trying to tell me he doesn’t like that. While he probably means well. But he’s not into chubby girls, then why the hell would he be into me?",25Nov2019,1
944,"So the relationship between this friend and I isn’t anything thaaat special, we’re not best friends, but we are in the same friend circle and we get along great every time we see each other. He’s commented on my posts as of recent and he’s always been nice to me. I’d absolutely consider him a friend. We share things in common, we laugh and have great conversation. However over the last few days, he has unfollowed me on Instagram. It’s extra weird because he follows 4,000 people!

Now let me make this clear, I don’t really care if someone doesn’t want to follow me. But when it’s a friend, I can’t help but take it a bit personally. Like I did something wrong, or that our friendship wasn’t nearly as legit as I thought it was. I have other friends that never followed me to begin with and I could care less, but when they go out of their way to unfollow me, yeah I take it a bit more personally. 

So what do I do? Should I act as if I have no idea? Do I confront him? If so, how do I bring it up?

On top of that, my mother in law mixed pills and alcohol and was messed up the rest of the wedding weekend, calling me the wrong name multiple times.

How do I move past having a bad wedding? I’ve felt depressed for two weeks and am not sure how to get out of this mental state.

My friend has recently been seeking closure on her ex, she is worried for her as her ex was in a pretty bad emotional state before they broke up and she was wondering how she had handled the breakup. After messaging her she had noticed that she had not been online for over a year, even before they broke up. She is deeply worried that her ex done something to herself before they broke up, or if she is in danger. I tried telling her that the most likely option is that she was previously inactive on the messaging platform and deleted it after their breakup, but she is convinced that her ex is dead. It sounds overreactive when I say it but it's very serious to her and I want to help her as much as I can. Any advice on what I can say/do to help?",25Nov2019,1

953," 

Tagged nsfw due to rape, just wanted to be safe. I had this previously posted in a different sub-reddit but it was removed. My first post on reddit ever

Last year I was really close friends with a girl (Lets call her Tammy) who had been dating a boy for nearly 2 years at the time, and continued being friends with her around 3 months after they broke up. Things turned really rocky in our friendship after she broke up with her boyfriend and eventually, after around 4 months, I was completely cut out of the group. I was incredibly upset at first ( I unfriended her on snapchat to avoid seeing pictures of the group hanging out and she was PISSED at my for doing that) but after a while I realized that it was good that I got out of the friendship. Especially now that the girls in the group are turning into toxic thots 

Rumors began to spread around the school about Tammys ex (lets call him Ron) and the rumors were that he had raped her about a couple of weeks after they broke up when she went to his house to give him some of his items back. She didnt tell anyone about what supposedly happened until about 5 months after they broke up. I don't believe her at all since I knew Tammy and Ron before, during, and after their relationship and I don't think there is absolutely no way this happened. Whats worst is that shes telling every single person she knows what Ron did to her, even people who she barely knows.

**I want to know if there's any way that her accusation can be proved or dismissed. Should I tell a school administrator? Could I go to the police about it and ask them? Should I ask a doctor if theres some sort of test they can do 5 months later? What do I do about this???**

 I don't want Rons year to be ruined by Tammys rumors. I want something to be done because accusing someone of rape just because they broke up with you is incredibly disgusting and I don't want her to get away with trying to ruin someones life.

*ps: After knowing Tammy for a year and a half, as well as dealing with her wrath after I left the friend group, I have an incredibly bad opinion of her. She's done many little things that are incredibly wrong towards her friends and people that she doesn't even know. She's admitted to me multiple times that she was thinking about poisoning a girl who had broken their friendship off and told me 2 plans she had including a type of oil that the girl was severely allergic to as well as laxatives.*",25Nov2019,1
954,"I (18f) dated this boy (18m) for nearly 2 years in high school. He broke up with me in the last few months of our senior year, and it honestly broke my heart when he started going out with another girl a week or so later. They never made it official and only lasted a few weeks anyways. At the beginning of the summer we started talking again and developing a friendship, I really cherished that because I did still care about him, even though I wasn't interested in getting back with him at the time. We texted a lot and hung out a few times, he even gave me a really thoughtful birthday gift just before he left for university. (We had planned to go to the same university a few hours away from home, but I changed my plans after the breakup). Early in that summer he asked me to meet him at the park near our houses and he asked me to get back together with him, but only for the few months he had left in town, which really hurt my feelings, and I turned him down. I told him that it wasnt because I didnt care for him, but because I couldnt handle having my heart broken twice. He seems pretty upset over that. One day a few weeks into school, he blocked me on EVERYTHING. I was pretty upset, as I'd just lost a very important friend, but I let it be for awhile and tried to move on. It worked somewhat, I've nearly dated two other people since then.  Both ended up losing my interest and I broke it off. I realised that the reason they lost my interest was because neither were nearly as ""cool"" as my ex. He was very interesting and we had a lot in common, and other people seem boring in comparison. I tried messaging him once over text that I missed his friendship. I dont know if he ever saw it. Recently it has been hitting me really hard how much i miss him. I really want him back in my life whether it be as a friend or more. How should I approach this situation? To get ahold of him at this point would be difficult because all of my social media are blocked, but I really want to talk to him again. I know he is coming back into town for Thanksgiving and his parents house is only 5 minutes away. Should I even entertain this, or should i keep trying to move on?

959,"So, yesterday I got into a slight altercation at university.

This fat girl sat next to me in the lecture theatre. I registered her in the corner of my eye and sighed internally, bracing myself for the next hour I'd have to sit next to the living monstrosity.

She absolutely reeked of perfume - an obvious sign she is trying desperately to compensate for her horrendous natural smell, which still managed to creep through slightly, mixing with the perfume into an alchemic poisonous impending nightmare fuel which splurged out of her greasy pores like stale onions.

After about ten minutes, I couldn't take it anymore. I turned, got up and moved to a new seat with a better view.

That is the way to deal with fat people: avoid them at all costs.

Sidenote: there is an exception to this. If it's winter and the air cons aren't working, fat people are a much needed lifeline; their bodies are essentially organic radiators with huge output, meaning you can stay perfectly warm if you're sat next to one - you just have to get over the horrific smells!",25Nov2019,1

Front desk said they’d look into it. Later we received an email with a picture of the damage (linked)They said they spoke with housekeeping and that they were sticking us with the charge. We’ve already contacted our credit card company informing them of what’s going on. This a fairly expensive and well known hotel with multiple locations. What other legal avenues should I take?

962,"I cannot talk to people as casually as other people and often have huge anxiety over phone calls to the point where I don't call at all. I have terrible self-confidence and it holds me back from talking to other people. I become a people pleaser or don't talk at all, or I blend into groups without my own personality and only based by what others like. If I had to describe myself I wouldn't know who I am. I used to harm myself when I was overwhelmed but I stopped after I realized the consequence and how enraged my parents would get. Everything's so boring and now I'm not as excited as I was when vacation starts. At the end of the day I constantly beat myself up and I cry alone every night. That I'm such a piece of shit and that no one would truly care if I disappeared. This month I've been contemplating suicide even though I know I'm too much of a coward to actually do it. I look at the pills on the counter and wonder how much I would have to eat until I overdose. I wanted and still want to get better and learn to develop my own personality, get rid of my fear of reject, develop deep bonds, and boost my self-confidence. I want to do this as early as possible so I would not have to suffer in my adulthood, but yet I don't even know if this is just normal teenager behavior. But for safety measures, I wanted to take therapy because I can't do this by myself. I've tried for the past 2 years of my life and nothing has worked out. Not even my mom's pep talk has worked. So I asked for therapy. And they laugh. They laugh, the family laughs and they say, ""What do you have to be so sad about? You have such a great life, tell me what's wrong."". I tell them and they say it's all normal behavior and they don't see what's wrong with me. Now they've started mocking me by smiling and laughing whenever I ask for help. Even today when I went to the doctor to ask. Maybe it's because I'm not feeling sad all the time. Do I need to feel sad all the time to get help? Is that how it is? I want to know how to convince my parents to get therapy. Otherwise, maybe at a tipping point I feel like I'll impulsively kill myself when I'm not afraid.

964,"So I've felt this way for around a year now, mostly as a nagging feeling at the back of my mind, but it struck me somewhat earlier today when I left for work and all the while I felt as if I had a lump in my throat. My eyes were welling up and a few moments after I'd parked I just started crying.

I'm doing alright at work since I know practically everything we do, but the lack of staff is slowly wearing me down. I'm looking for other work but it's come to naught as of yet. Whilst I'm there I do enjoy the company of most of our patrons but I've come close to using excessive vitriol when confronted by stubborn ignorance, when usually I'm the best one there to deal with those situations.

For the past year I've felt vaguely numb, but over the last couple of months or so it's either progressed to or been exchanged into a crushing sense of apathy, coupled with being extremely fed up, irritable and having to fend off bitter second-thoughts. I'm so tired all the time but I can never seem to fall asleep when I want to, only after a couple of hours laying there in the dark. It's always too hot or too cold or I can't stop thinking. Sometimes I resort to taking painkillers in order to fall asleep.

Most days are plagued with small existential crises that I have to brush aside by taking up some kind of task or pass-time, but I'm finding it hard to truly enjoy anything. I've been on some amazing holidays to the furthest corners of the world, which works as a temporary escape, but I get back and it doesn't take long for my enthusiasm to drift off.

This is all compounded by the fact that I live with a relative who requires everything to be done for them. Can't cook or clean; can't operate the simplest of useful technology etc. So I get home from work, a part time contract where I'm having to do double hours because we have almost no staff, and then do every necessary task, then not five minutes after I attempt to relax I'm called for again. I know they can't help it; it's 100% not their fault, but there is a building bitterness that I don't like and I don't want to think that way.

I've tried to bring up at least the start of a conversation with family but the topic is never entertained and no one is aware of any specific details beyond the final paragraph since I thought that as the former was so easily dismissed there was no point in bringing any of it up.

I was confused and he also sent me screenshots of a girl thanking him for the money. I gave him my Paypal on an adrenaline rush but then he asked for a nude NSFW pic. He sent an example and it is very explicit...no face included though.

I am not sure if it is worth it honestly but +900$ is a lot of money. I considered being careful about it, I have sent nudes before but only on Snapchat and not for money.

I wouldn't post it on Imgur, I would probably make that goes kinda like this; 1.I send you a mild nude pic and you pass half of the money. 2.If I see the payment then I send the actual pic you want and you give the rest.

Still, I can’t stand seeing him on a line. He gets so excited when someone opens the door, and he’s constantly looking in at us.

My mom, however, doesn’t especially like dogs. She makes comments on how cute or well behaved he is, but turns down my ideas about taking on the commitment of house training him so late in life. (He was an indoor dog when we first took him in, and the only reason she put him out in the first place was his “excitability”: i.e. she didn’t want to train him and apparently her child couldn’t train him quickly enough for her liking.

Her reasons, I guess: *”he would tear the house apart” *”he would chew on things” *he was never house trained *he isn’t fixed

Does anyone have any advice as to how I can persuade her to consider the possibility? I have convinced her to get me some things, since she knows I enjoy working with him and has seen me training with him outside. My current approach is convincing her that he’s well-behaved and could easily learn anything needed to get him inside.

I know that I’ll have to make a serious commitment and get him to a point that she feels is worthy of letting him indoors, but he’s a joy to work with and a great dog.

I slur my words and will comes out without the 'i'. I kind of just say ""WL"". To make things worse, my boyfriend's name is also one syllable and starts with R. So I confused their belongings, their names ect. My boyfriend knows about my speech problems. But I think he's getting jealous. Does anything else have speech problems  like this?",25Nov2019,1

984,"I am a broke performing artist. I just got out of a tour opening for a pretty big act. It was extremely beneficial, and I got a lot of new fans. However, opening slots don’t pay very well and I financially broke even. I don’t have a job right now because of this tour. I have two shows in California in December where I will be gone for a week. I was planning on applying for some jobs tomorrow since I am done with my tour, but I just found out I am getting sent to a famous studio in LA to record a project in January for another week. 

I have no idea how I am going to be able to pay my bills. I cannot back out of any of these music opportunities because it truly feels like I am on the brink of being able to make a living within the next 6 months. I just need to know how I can make some money until then. I’m not sure if any job will take me if I need 2 weeks off within the next 6 weeks. I am willing to do absolutely anything to make all of this work. 

I don’t have any savings. I’m barely 20 years old. I don’t live at home. I don’t make money from my streams right now because I’ve been having to invest all of it on music related things. I have accumulated over 1 million streams this last year so I think I really do have a chance to live the life I want. Like I said before, I just am looking for some temporary solutions. 

Does anybody have any suggestions?",25Nov2019,1
985,"I have information on an independent film producer that I believe should be exposed, but a part of me that has stayed my hand is the very distinct possibility exposing him will destroy his life. I'd like to know how I should treat this whole situation, by sharing key facts and hearing what you have to say.

* When a film he was producing was in production, he started lusting after a makeup artist. It was an on-location shoot, so the cast and crew stayed in a hotel. He bombarded the MUA with texts by saying he knew she wanted him. She went to retrieve something from her vehicle, when he cornered her and physically made a move on her, prompting her to repel him. He followed up by bombarding her with texts about how she was finished and that since he paid for the hotel rooms, he could just grab a key and get into her room. Take note that there were several other people in the room, reading these texts over the MUA's shoulder.
* During said film, he insisted for reasons that he drive the lead actress to the set with his car - alone. She became intimidated and made the ultimatum that either he not report to set during her scenes or she was not going to cooperate with the production.
* A number of other women who have worked with the producer confided in the person who posted the expose that he intimidated and harassed them, threatening them with their careers. It worked, in the sense that they looked for work outside of the film scene. One individual claims he actually raped her.
* This was made public in the local film scene's group, but the producer has not only threatened all of the victims with legal action, but he has mounted a non-stop suppression campaign, complaining to any sites, such as IMDb, until they take the info down.
* Court records show that he physically abused his domestic partner years ago, warranting a restraining order. He violated it multiple times and tried suing her, to have the restraining order removed.
* He bankrolled a film by defrauding several business owners in Las Vegas. They sued him shortly after the film had a very limited theatrical release and won the case, putting him several million dollars in debt. They have not gotten their money back, as the film was SyFy/Asylum-level bad - the business owners are now in financial ruin, like the producer. This information is not publicly known; only court records show it. He continues to counter-sue, to have the judgment overturned, to no avail.

He has ruined the livelihood - and lives - of multiple others. Does exposing him count as ""An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind""?",25Nov2019,1
988,"I’m sorry this is so long, but I want to get it right. I met a girl a few months ago. We hit it off and we grew pretty close. We say we love each other, compliment on looks, all that good stuff. The thing is, we want to meet for a date, but that’s where I need help. 

We were gonna meet a month ago. She had to reschedule to a few days later because of something she had to do. The night leading into us meeting, I accused her of cat fishing me. We met in person, but we live in a state with a huge human trafficking issue and my parents made me paranoid about her. She FaceTimed me (along with many other times up to today), but she got her feelings hurt badly over my accusing her. This happened a few weeks after meeting.

Her mother was angry at what I did, but my friend only said something like “he blocked me because I didn’t want to show my face.” This led to her mother declining to let us meet the next couple of times that we tried because I’m “negative.” My parents say that my friend said that her mom is pissed as cover up, because she’s not allowed to date, even though I have proof that she did date a lot with her parent’s approval. I know this might all be because of what I did that one day. 

My issue is, how do I work on this? My parents are getting into my head with their theories, when I kinda already know they’re false. Her mother didn’t know why I did what I did. I probably just sound crazy to her and that’s why we can’t meet. Should I try and ask to speak to her mother, what could I say? I know talking probably won’t fix things given our age, but maybe it’s worth it? My parents say I shouldn’t even bring up speaking to her mother. She always tries to find ways for us to meet, and so do I.

Thanks for your reply, I don’t know what to do. 😅",25Nov2019,1

990,"I have this fetish called ""ballbusting"" wherein a male derives sexual pleasure from the idea of having his testicles hurt by an attractive female. The thing is, I really get aroused by the idea of specifically non-consensual ballbusting, wherein a female hurts a male's testicles without his consent. Like, whenever I see or interact with an attractive woman in public, I always find myself thinking something along the lines of ""what would it be like if she kicked me in the nuts right now?"" or ""what would I have to do to get her angry enough for her to hurt my testicles?"". To be clear, I wouldn't actually want to say or do anything mean to a woman just to get her to hurt me (that would just be rude and uncalled for), but the thought does often cross my mind. Anyway, despite the fact that I really get off to the notion of ballbusting, I'm sort of ashamed of the non-consensual element that I get sexually aroused by, because it blatantly contradicts with my notion of morality (at least one of the parties would have to be in the position of abuser in this situation). But, I can't really help the fact that it turns me on, and it really underlies my entire sexuality, so I'm not quite sure what to make of this dilemma. Is this something I should really be ashamed of? And if so, what can I do about it?",25Nov2019,1

Advice?",25Nov2019,1
992,"I should start with the fact that this isn't new. it's just getting worse as time goes on. I'm in highschool and I need advice. I don't know how to communicate that I want to commit atrocities upon myself. I feel as if I am not good enough and I tend to avoid work completely because I am afraid to fail. I have drawing as a hobby. so I draw all the time because it makes me happy because people like to see it, since it...isn't another 27 in math. And if it sounds like I have that grade because I am doing jack shit then you're right. I don't do anything. I *Can't* do anything. because I know I don't know how. and because I don't know how I lose interest. and I do something to replace the lost interest.

It isn't that i don't want to do it when i start. It's that I can't sit around and do it because it bores me and I can't listen to the instruction. I could be taking notes then I zone out completely. I could be listening then and there but It's going in one ear and out the other. and when I do voice my issues it's after i get screamed at for not doing it. god forbid I say something about how i can't do it. I'm already about to fail the grade since I know it wont get fixed. But even worse I know my aunt doesn't want to deal with it or me anymore and if she found out she'd pass me off to be my father's problem. I don't want to be a problem. I would gladly kill myself but then i'd be a bigger issue. because of the funeral and stuff. this is the opposite of beridding problems but if it persists then i know that i'll eventually make the regetting/upsetting choice.   


TL;DR  
I can't zone in enough to learn and preform tasks expected of me and it's getting to the point where it's threatening my health and current home.",25Nov2019,1
993," 

Hello,

I'm a senior in college who is interested in pursuing a student affairs masters. I applied for a resident assistant position (RA) but was given an alternate role. I believe part of the reason I did not get it was due to having strict preferences but have changed that so I might be offered more openings now. The trouble is I currently work an office assistant job, and today after hearing that I am an alternate said I would have to decline it or they would hire someone else. I really don't know what to do. I have no way of knowing if I'd get hired but the idea of closing that door makes me so sad. I've been trying for a long time and it would help me with my career goals. I've also been decreasingly motivated at my job due to lack of interest and there just not being that much work. I feel that I may have gained all I can from it and was looking forward to no longer doing it if I received the RA position. There are not many alternates and I feel based on some of the connections I made I might be high on the list.

My mom is encouraging me to take the sure thing but I really don't know. While some extra money would be nice I don't know if it would be worth ending the possibility. There's a chance I could get another part time job but it probably would not pay as well.",25Nov2019,1
994,"So my ex and I started dating Jan 2016. We were work friends ish and she asked me to be her drinking buddy over fb one night. I was pretty much a shut in before that and never had a gf before. I figured it meant that she was interested.

I asked her to be my gf a couple weeks later and she said yes. She was my first everything. Sex, kiss, partner, everything. I told her I wanted to wait to have sex till we were sure we wanted to be together so we waited a month or so and yeah.

 She had 2 young kids and they liked me and I liked them and we were good for 2 years. We each loved with our parents and then we decided it time to move in together in our place. 

She always said she wanted another baby. I always told her I didnt want to have one till we were stable. After we got a house I asked her to marry me and she said yes. Now I know before that she said she wasnt the marrying type. I thought that since we were together so long she would have changed her mind or told me no. We had sex that night and she told me a couple weeks later she was pregnant and I was so happy. 

It's been a year and a half and we had our son who was born with basically extreme sleep apnea. Cchs. And back in August I noticed she was distancing herself. Didnt want sex. Wouldn't even come to bed. Looked kind of annoyed when I wanted a goodbye kiss when she was going to work. It made me super depressed and I kind of isolated myself and slept a lot because she wouldn't tell me why when I asked. I confronted her early September and she said she loved me but she wasnt in love anymore. 

I'm still broken up about it but shes acting like we were just some fling. She wont even say what made her unhappy and didnt want therapy or to give any reason other than she fell out of love. Now I dont know how common that is, but i can't help but imagine that there was another guy because as soon as she broke up with me i started noticing more and more snapchatting and messaging with people I didnt know and i didnt even know she had a snapchat. 

I'm so upset that she wont talk to me and i can't seem to move on because I'm so alone now and anytime i want to see my son i have to see her too which hurts every time. 

She's been seeing multiple people from what I hear, and it hurt to think about her acting like that when it not only affects her, but the kids. 

Do you all have any advice for me to move on? I've tried talking to people but I already have few friends and I try to get out and go for walks in town and use dating apps, but no such luck.",25Nov2019,1
995,"There’s this one kid I’m friends with. It’s something where he’s constantly talking and interrupting and anywhere you turn he’s standing right there next to you without any room to breathe. I don’t really know what to do but I can’t get any work done when I’m around him because he just continuously talks to me even after I tell him to stop because I need to focus. At this point I can’t stand it anymore and I want to tell him to back off and leave me alone. 

At first it was just a minor inconvenience. He was clearly socially awkward so I understood but now it’s just another level of inconvenience because he literally follows me everywhere I go. I don’t feel threatened or anything, but it’s rather annoying. Especially when I want to be left alone. 

How can I tell him to politely back away and leave me alone so I can work without interruption, but say it in a way that doesn’t come off as being an asshole?",25Nov2019,1
