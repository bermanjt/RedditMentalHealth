0,My daughter just dropped that bomb on me out of nowhere. I want to explain it to her but don’t know how to do it age appropriately. All I said so far is that it’s how babies are made and I’ll talk to her about it more in private later. I need to gather myself and figure out how to do it the right way. Please help lol.,29Aug2019,2

3,"As a foreword, I'm Canadian, 19 years old , and saving up money for college. I don't have a driver's license as my mother gave up on me (Her words, not mine.) And I'm forced to work at this job or else I get kicked out of my parent's house. I live out in the country and I get a lift into work at 6AM with my father. It takes us 30 minutes to get to work every weekday morning.

Okay, so I work as a Mechanic Shophand for an oilfield company (I clean up the shop, do various tasks, and assist mechanics when they need assistance.) And while I may not be the happiest with my job as it's not what I want to do with my life, I do my job and I try to do my damnedest with every single task I am given. I do listen to music during work as it helps keep my mental state in check so I don't get angry/breakdown easily. The job is (I think) non-unionized. 

My boss however, is where my job goes over the edge and makes everything boil over and makes me breakdown constantly. He currently is harassing me and threatening my position in the company if I don't do ""Swamping"" which is where my hours get really wonky and I have to go help Rig Movers move the rigs, (keep noted that I have no ride into town to get picked up by the drivers), Whether just on the same lease, or across my province. I have no interest in Swamping as I want to avoid Oilfield work as much as possible, as it consumed my father's life and he wound up never really being there to properly raise his three kids, however if I don't do this my position at the company could be terminated as he wants ""versatile"" workers. So if I don't do this I could be fired for not wanting to do a job that I did not sign up for. I'm not certified to go on these moves to swamp.

So I'm almost being forced into a position that I not only told me boss initially that I'm not interested, which he threatened my job for doing. And it's really weighing down on me because I can't find a new job, I can't say no to being harassed by him, and I can't do anything to try to change this really shitty situation that I find myself in without getting kicked out and having no place to stay.",29Aug2019,1
4,"I’m teenager, male and I like to wear skirts/dresses because they feel more comfortable/less restrictive. A few times when I’m home alone, I try on my Mom/Sister’s dresses. I have no idea whatsoever how my mom would react if I told her, So I haven’t. And my paranoia has me feeling that they would somehow figure out that I do it if I’m not careful. I’m just looking for some advice on what to do. Thanks!",29Aug2019,4
5,"Ever since he lost his job in 2013 he's been relying on his children to support him (four of us) bills, food, internet you know what I mean. He refuses to do any kind of financial work or have to put himself in any kind of level of stress. If we, so as much, have a ""tone"" that he doesn't like he acts like a child and refuses to do what we ask of him, very simple things like walking the dogs, washing some dishes or accepting deliveries that we ordered. 

Our grandfather was wealthy enough to afford this house and give our dad everything he needed AND wanted, even when he was in his 30's He was still supported by our grandfather, all the way until he passed, but my dad never did anything but spend the wealth our grandfather gave him and now he has nothing but this house. We aren't rich, we are just barely getting by but getting by nonetheless.

He used to work, and I really loved that version of him, he really was like a father then, that was his peak, he was selfless and humble, independent and..happy. He provided enough to keep the house going until we eventually got out of college and found jobs. But ever since He lost his job he started to change.

Like I said before, we aren't rich and we are just barely getting by, we can't even afford to get a car so we all commute. I feel like he abuses everything we do for him, he doesn't show us any respect, he treats us as if we are just his slaves, it's like he's lost all his decency in him. All I want him to do is respect sometimes and acknowledge there are things we cannot afford.

We ask just small things like turning off the air conditioner when it isn't so hot, but he retaliates and refuses to do any compromise. When we go grocery shopping, he gets angry that we can't go over the budget and he insists that we buy what he wants, he complains that our budget is too low (it's actually very generous since he usually eats everything but ok). Our bill has been increasing a lot so we suspect he's been using the aircon behind our backs (please remember all four of us work, so we aren't in the house half of the time). He keeps eating food that isn't his, taking things that isn't his and taking bits of money that were meant to go elsewhere (Internet money, bill money, food money).

For 6 years, his days have gone like this, he wakes up very early to go for a run then he ""exercises"" for an hour, and the rest of the day he is just on Youtube, sleeping, watching TV and eating.

Our family is as torn as it is already, and I feel that he is making it worse. For me, it's like he isn't my father anymore. It's like he turned into this man-child with no financial stability and keeps biting at the hand that feeds him. Anything he says is absolute. Anything we say is wrong.

I know he is self-conscious about his life right now, and I think that is partly why he gets so defensive and angry when we argue with him, but he refuses to reason with us.

To tell you the truth, we never really complained about his actions. Like doing nothing and lounging around all day, just him being our father, alive and well was good enough for us. But the way he treats us has really been pissing me off lately. All I want is respect and decency and he treats and talks to us like slaves. 

The amount of disrespect he keeps showing us is really getting to me. I know how hard my siblings work so It really triggered me seeing the way he speaks to them. As if they were dirt.

I love him, I really do. We are all that he has left, his 4 children, so I don't want to leave him. His family tree doesn't give two-shits about him. Our mom left him long ago and the only people that supported him are either dead or have cut ties.

I want him to change or go back to the way he used to be.

If things keep going the way they are, we are going to leave him, not to die, of course, I'm not cruel hahaha, but we would give him an allowance to keep the house going and to answer his needs. No longer his wants.

Thank you whoever took the time to read this :)",29Aug2019,2
6,"First of all, I am 17 years old and I'm part of a pretty poor family. Last I saw, my parents were about 27k of OUR CURRENCY in debt. The past year, I've been sort of searching for a purpose, or a hobby... I'm not really sure. I saw these two amazing violinists make hilarius, entertaining and to some extent educative videos, which made me think ""Hey why not music?"". About a year ago now I recieved a keyboard from my parents, after my constant nagging about it... And well suffice to say it was the cheapest thing they could find... I wasn't very satisfied. After a few months of playing around not really knowing anything about music theory I also joined a metal band, as a bassist. During my time with the band I learnt quite a bit, not from them but from other sources. I decided I wanted a violin and so a couple months later my wish came true, my brother's friend gifted him a violin which was gifted to me... And I thought that was amazing but I really underestimated the difficulty of playing a violin. In the meantime I also learnt some simple riffs on the guitar, like the intro to Master of Puppets. All that being said, I think the keyboard part is the thing I got most into, but expressing yourself without any dynamics in music is impossible. So I need advice if I should ask my parents if they would buy me this digital piano, cheap but good, which would maybe put them into more debt, seeing as if they go for 12 month rates, it's ~300 a month, even though there's a very high chance that they'll just shut me down saying I have multiple instruments and that I should just learn on them. I know this is sort of selfish of me and everything but I really really wish to get a digital piano...

TL;DR: Poor family, I want a digital piano, they might say no, should I go for it anyway?

P.S. If there's any other info you may require, I'm willing to give it.",29Aug2019,1
7,"I'm (24, F) the eldest of the family and usually when we were kids, we used to share stuffs. But now that I'm almost adult or adult, I bought stuffs with my own money. Gadgets, shoes, clothes... I always tell them to ask permission from me whenever they want to borrow something. Last month, my youngest sibling (14, F) broke my Bluetooth speaker. She never asked permission frome me, she just took it from my table. Last week, my New Balance shoes is also unusable, it was torn. I really got furious this time because that is the only shoes that I use for jogging. So I never really wear them everyday and I just knew it last week. She admitted of using it. Now, she took my new slippers. 

Please anyone, can you give me advises on how to deal with the situation? Everyday I remind them to ask permission from me first and still they didn't listen.

Am I being greedy?",29Aug2019,1

10,"I'm 16 years old. School starts in about a week. 
I feel so anxious and so scared. I don't know what to do...

I failed 9th grade twice and now I have to repeat 9th grade again. I have emotions and mental as well as Health issues. I was diagnosed with epilepsy, ADHD, tourettes Syndrome, depression, anxiety etc. And I feel like there are other things I have that I haven't been diagnosed with yet.

I'm socially awkward and have social anxiety. I don't have a single friend, nor do I know how to make any. 

Whenever I go to school I feel like having a mental breakdown. I feel like passing out, crying, screaming out in anger, acting violent, etc. 
And I feel even worst when someone in my school does anything or says anything to upset me.
I fucking hate my school. People are so loud and obnoxious. I also feel a lot of envy and anger towards teenagers who make out in the hallways because I wish I could be in their position. I wish I could have partner to make out with and even have sex with.  

I'm not Intelligent either. Im terrible at every subject and I can't even pay attention. I also don't have any confidence. I have NOTHING to my advantage. And the worst part is that I don't have anyone to talk to.
I feel so worried for my future and my safety in school. 

Also if you're gonna recommend a therapist or psychiatrist please don't. I already have those and it's not a quick fix to my problems. I already told them and they're working on these issues with me. So don't fucking bother bringing that that shit up. I'm tired of countless people telling me to see a therapist and/or psychiatrist.",29Aug2019,3

I just want to know how I can possibly enjoy this holiday with my parents despite not even being able to have a good conversation with them.

To make matters worse, her mum has terminal cancer and is not receiving treatment. Also, her father has had a falling out with his own sister, and they haven't spoken with each other in 3 years. All these people are supposed to be at the wedding. 

I get that it will be hard for him to attend, but he is a generally selfish person and likes to create drama. 

Needless to say, I'm furious. My fiance just wants to enjoy the day, but her dad is making a mess of everything. I want to drive over and tell him what's what, but she wouldn't want that. I have his email but no phone number.

I spent months in school completely on my own, alone. I walked around like a loner and it was embarrassing. I tried to text this guy to confront him and call him out because he was talking shit about me even after I left, but he basically didn’t reply, he just shared the text with his friends and laughed at me. This happened months ago by now so I think it’s too late to go for a phone call or something, but it still makes my blood boil. People who told me, who claimed that they were my best friend, just didn’t give a shit, they immediately sided with the other guy even though he was being an asshole.

I eventually found new friends and it’s helped a bit, but the heartache and pain still burns strong.

27,"Day 3- Skagway comes around, it was a quick port day. In at 7am out by 3pm. I had gone mountain biking with my family in the morning and was dressed in the most ridiculous \*Warm\* outfit for the Alaskan cold air in the mountains.   I had not seen Mr. T all day and was worried he was mad about the elevator from the night prior. I made a lot of friends by this point and so we all decided to get rip roaring drunk together since both myself and my other buddy both struck out with our love prospects and decided to share in the failed comradery together!!!... WORST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE! About 10 shots deep of day drinking since coming back onboard, our bar tender loved  testing random shots to knock us all on our butts. The corner of my eye noticed  this greek god,  statue of perfection, strut to the hot tub... ! Im so drunk i cant control my volume nor can i control anything about myself especially my love for this man.  My buddy tries to wing-man for me and tells him im ""DTF""... and i was BUUTTTTT im not an insecure girl who just opens her legs at any point you need to ""woo"" me to get anything passed a kiss. Mr. T Either was too love struck he forgot, or he wanted a Fk buddy in that moment and that is just not me. i wanted a cruise fling with the man of my dreams.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for how long this is... Thank you to anyone who actually reads it all.\~\* 

Long story: My parents and my extended family went to Seattle for one of my cousin's wedding. We made a whole vacation out of it, extending a short trip into a long one up into Alaska. We sailed on the Norwegian Bliss for the first time, and i discovered what ""Love at First Sight"" was! every cell in my body felt the pull towards him. i cannot even describe the feeling... it was simply everything i ever understood about the world, all just aligned when i looked into his eyes... it was like watching a bon fire, late at night. His voice as swwet as honey, and his intensity owned the room. I couldnt deny how much i wanted to get to know him and i spent the majority of my free time away from the family, looking for this beautiful man. Well call him Mr. T

This cruise was the first time in 6 years that ive been able to sit back and relax, with 0 stress about time, people, money and work. I could take this vacation as fast or as slow as i needed and my family just wanted the mornings and meal times to be shared together... anything else is a bonus. I was traveling with my 2 under aged cousins,. who cannot drink and my parents/aunts and uncles all in their 50's+ and we decided to splurge and get the premium drink package.. which soon became my demise. 

&amp;#x200B;

Day 1 of the cruise: Seattle Home port, I saw him. Standing with a group of his friends who Mr. T was sailing with his best friends/ neighbours. Mr T's Piercing eyes look deep into the soul, his fire sign is so apparent and his control of the room was unlike anything i had ever seen or felt before.  I noticed him while my family and I were in line correcting an issue with our cabin keys. My whole body froze. Every cell in my body forgot how to work and i couldn't breath. I couldn't believe i had this \*Love at first sight\* feeling. Everything in the world; all the stars and planets had aligned. His beautiful eye brows, his smooth skin and intense eyes had my knees weak, and my whole train of thought went away.. I pretended to still keep talking normally  for \*show\* and explained to my parents what happened once we left the Atrium/Front Desk. I was smitten...not crazy!  

Day 2- Juneau  Mr T and I  bump into each-other at the back of the Deck 17 by the hot tubs, where he and his cabin-mates had taken over the hot tubs all day drinking. He came and sat down beside me, with his female friend Miss J. We start casually making conversation and it was all flowing beautifully. His friend Ms J and her husband were traveling. Those eyes caught me off guard and i decided to play coy and build up his interest. He loved talking about himself and i was so happy to listen and enjoy his company. Unfortunately we were both quite drunk, so both of our conversations were full throttle awkward... but we both had our weird topics/laughs so i felt so at ease in the awkward, with no limits in conversation social norms. He disclosed he was a poet who enjoys writing, hes going back to school to better his life and is currently in the US Navy. a gentleman who wears his heart on  his sleeve! we spent the majority of the evening talking, and going to a show at 10pm called iHavana. It was great, everything went so well... until he invited me to go dance in the center of the atrium.... I have 2 left feet and panicked!! The last thing i cared to do was embarrass myself in front of this perfect male specimen on such a simple activity... So when the elevator going up arrived, and one going down to the atrium arrived, i jumped into the UP! and he looked upset when i waved good bye. 

\*\*\*\*\* In my head i thought it's not a big deal as i had been talking about the many adventures i got into with strangers from elevators earlier that day and the night prior. I had won 100 dollars with an old couple in the casino and met some truly wonderful people by just striking random conversations in the elevator. When you're a solo traveler of your age group you tend to have to jump in or you'll be bored\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Day 3- Skagway comes around, it was a quick port day. In at 7am out by 3pm. I had gone mountain biking with my family in the morning and was dressed in the most ridiculous \*Warm\* outfit for the Alaskan cold air in the mountains.   I had not seen Mr. T all day and was worried he was mad about the elevator from the night prior. I made a lot of friends by this point and so we all decided to get rip roaring drunk together since both myself and my other buddy both struck out with our love prospects and decided to share in the failed comradery together!!!... WORST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE! About 10 shots deep of day drinking sincew coming back onboard, our bar tender loved  testing random shots to knock us all on our butts. The corner of my eye noticed  this greek god,  statue of perfection, strut to the hot tub... ! Im so drunk i cant control my volume nor can i control anything about myself especially my love for this man.

Mr. T Either was too love struck he forgot, or he wanted a Fk buddy in that moment and that is just not me. i wanted a cruise fling with the man of my dreams.

 Mr. T decided to enjoy the hot tub, im assuming to play aloof and coy... So i brought him one of his fave drinks the Mudslide.  Mr. T invited me to join him for the comedy show at 930. I was so excited! My friend hyped me up got me so excited, my anxiety took over so my buddy said before you leave do the ""Black out"" shot!... So i surprised him with it... and both of us almost puked it was so potent. 

&amp;#x200B;

Worst timing ever... the fading in and fading out started to happen once we walked to his cabin for him to change out of his bathing suit into normal clothes. Once he changed he changed the plan and just wanted to stay in the room and play around. I was so consumed by my pheromones, I grabbed him by the collar of his t-shirt and accidentally broke his necklace!!! I tried to be sExY but that just translated into a bulldozer... I felt so awful, and i couldn't afford to fix it right then and there... 300 dollars was a lot! I told him i would try to make it up to him.. but i could feel the tension in the air was so bad. I suggested to leave and go to the comedy club and get our minds off what happened...maybe flirt some more and then hook up.. but he was so head strong and ultimately upset that i broke his necklace. When i told hm i needed a bit of cat-and-mouse chase; since my head isnt it in it anymore, i tried to convince him out of the room to change the energy and cheer him up. He was so mad he didn't follow. i forgot to look at his room number, couldn't find him and left.

&amp;#x200B;

Later that night we randomly found each other again, and he had my sunglasses. I thanked him for bringing them to me and he asked me if i wanted to grab something to eat as his stomach was hurting. We went to the Local Pub, on the ship (open 24 hours) at this point i was completely Gone i have no recollection of us going there.. But i remember cheering him on for needing to use the bathroom... and meeting up with my cousin whom i promised to take out that night. I made a buffoon of myself and was shouting and over the top excited to see everyone whom i had met all over the cruise that day... and i remember the man of my dreams walking towards me, then walking passed me and never came back after his bathroom stop...i waited at the local for 3 hours with my cousin, and he never came back. I was so drunk i felt awful how badly i embarrassed myself and probably him...

&amp;#x200B;

I searched high and low every day for this man for the rest of the cruise. I bought him a rose with an apology note, i dropped it off at his door, I called his room twice. First time i left a voicemail about the deal or no deal game, that he never came to.. the second time i called he answered and just told me ""i will see you when i see you"" he wanted to play his schedule by ear... On the last day i finally bumped into him while he was leaving the bar... after professing my love for this man and how much i thought he hated me for breaking his necklace... to Ms J's husband, Mr. T struts another girl front of the bar and up the spiral stair case... locking eye contact with me... My ego has never felt so rejected and yet i cant stop myself from thinking about him and how perfect everything could have been had i not been a drunk buffoon making the most out of my unlimited drinking package... 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*\* Now i know i ruined everything but the guilt of breaking his necklace and Ms J's husband told me it was his birthday last week, before the cruise... and his mom JUST fixed that necklace (\*Broke 3x already before me)... I just want to make it up to him some how or save up to fix it for him, but i don't even know anyone's last name let alone contact information... the only info i have is their first names, job and their cabin number. I just need advice because im heart broken and hate thinking that someone who is so amazing and wonderful, hate me so much!",29Aug2019,1
28,"So for reference, I'm entirely straight.  I talk to my girlfriend for 4-3 hours nearly every day. Over about 2 years I definitely picked up a more feminine voice which is something I do not want to keep.  Here is a reference for instance.  Is there anything I can do to entirely get rid of it?

I feel like my brain has been on the back burner for the last two years and I am not really gaining anything from this position anymore. I have been searching for a job for the last couple months and I have been getting denied from every opportunity because “lack of experience”. My job doesn’t have very many transferable tech skills because their platform is totally internal and not used in any other company. I find myself getting denied because of lack of corporate experience and no one wants to hire someone with operations experience.

31,"So I’m an 18 year old female, about to head off to college but I’m working for a pet sitting company before I leave which is in about a month. So basically, the lady who owns the pet sitting company does kitten rescues (she takes in abandoned kittens and finds homes for them), and whenever she’s out of town, I take care of her animals. 

She has a neighbor, we’ll call him John, who I think is in his 50s. John has a key to my boss’s house, and he also works for her. He has a dog that likes to play with Wendi’s dogs, so he comes over a lot. When I used to watch the animals when my boss was gone, Mike never came over. But now, he comes over EVERY TIME I’m there. I go twice a day for an hour each time. He’ll usually come over and let the dogs out and feed them and whatnot but he also mingles with me a lot and I don’t know, I get a weird feeling.

Some things he’s done:
-Sometimes comes over shirtless to go swimming
-Lingers next to me while I’m taking care of the animals 
-Shows me stuff on his phone (like cute animals)
-Once he asked what my plans are for the rest of the night
-Will always say “Well, looks like it’s just you and me while our boss is gone”

Honestly, I’m not scared of him. I’m 5’11” and consider myself to be pretty strong, he’s pretty short. But he just gives me a weird feeling and he really really annoys me.

I’ve starting picking up on when he’s not home and going during those times. When I see his car pull up, I leave.

The problem is that I’m supposed to stay for an hour and since I don’t want to be around him I leave within like 20 minutes, and I’m scared he’ll tell my boss.

I think my boss likes him a lot so I’m also scared to tell her that I don’t like it when he’s over. I’m pretty rude to him now, like I only give one word answers and I never look at him. If he makes a joke I won’t laugh, once I rolled my eyes (didn’t think he saw) and he asked if everything was okay. 

Okay, I’m ranting too much. Do I sound super stuck up or do you guys think he’s actually creepy? Any advice? Or should I just wait it out until I leave for college and never see him again? I don’t think he would actually touch/hurt me but I still get uncomfortable. 

TLDR: can’t tell if my boss’s neighbor is being creepy, don’t know if I should say something",29Aug2019,1

40,"Well.... kind of. I'm a 27 year old gay female who is very comfortable and open about myself. My ex of 4 years is not currently out of the closet and never was during our entire relationship, and we're now broken up.

We've somehow managed to remain close friends and I still hang out with her, her brother, and their group of friends frequently. The only problem is that even with us broken up, she still doesn't want anyone to know my dating preference in fear of them assuming we were ever together. This includes anything from lying about my dating background to even keeping all of my social media private, which I hate doing.

As much as I want to be sensitive to her situation (she has had HORRIBLE experiences with the few she's chosen to come out to), I can't help but feeling like I'm living a double life still. I had a hard enough time lying about who I was while we were together, but now it's just making me super bummed out... I'm not ashamed of who I am, and I don't want anyone to ever suggest that I am.

41,"My partner and I have been together for a few months now. Every time we're together we hook up. The sex is great, but there's one catch -it normally lasts two hours (or longer). Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy it. But the only time we've taken less than an hour was because he had to go to work. I'm starting to feel drained because every time we hang out I know I'm going to be very late to bed and extremely exhausted, which is coupled with less sleep and a draining next day at work. (Due to work and making supper after, etc, we usually end up together at 8, and I usually leave around 1:30 in the morning). 

Part of this is because I haven't exactly gotten there yet with him, but the added pressure doesn't help. What are healthy ways to approach this? It's not that I don't want to have sex, I just don't want to spend the length of a Harry Potter movie doing it every time.

44,"I feel entirely lost. I don't have friends and my family doesn't really talk to me about these kinds of things.

I'm 27 and I finally bought a house. I wanted to say things were going well, but they're not. The job I have, as a store manager of a major cell phone carrier, is about 30 miles away from the house I bought and I'm not doing well. The store is low volume and my boss has made it very clear that unless I'm blowing my numbers away, I won't get to move up. It pays enough, when I'm working 48-52 hours a week, to support my life and commission is a nice little bonus if I hit it. As of the last 2 weeks, they demanded I cut hours back to 40 because I was working 10 hours more than anyone in our region. At the beginning of August, they changed our commission to make it nearly impossible for me to make good money.

I decided to get a roommate to help alleviate that stress, knowing it was coming, back in July. She's coming out of a bad place and her son lives with us now. She just got back on her feet with a job, so she can help pay bills. Problem is I had feelings for her and while we established that nothing was going to happen, it feels like she is constantly pushing the boundaries. She doesn't want me to be a father figure for her son, but she wants me to watch him while she goes on dates. She wants me to be drop everything and come thru for her when no one else will, but if I say no, which I did, then she freaks out on me. I am apparently selfish because I admitted that I am not comfortable doing this for her. We have a well established boundary on my side that at least for a while do not bring guys to the house, especially people I've never met. Now that I have said no, she is blaming me and saying she's going no matter what, and if I don't want him over here on a first date with her, I have to watch her son for her while she goes out because that's what she wants to do. I've been very clear and up front with my thoughts and opinions to her, but I feel like I'm getting run over.

As tough as this is, she's arguably one of the only friends I have anymore. I know that I cannot make ends meet without her here unless I find another job or absolutely crush my goals at work.

50,"I'm an Asian high school student (male) who just started Sophmore year and is taking numerous AP classes and just doing so many extracurriculars that I cannot keep up. My mom keeps piling these extra workloads and classes on top of me and just expects me to ""finish them just like every other Asian who goes to Harvard"" -- despite how stereotypical that sounds, it's true and she's stubborn.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried talking to her, I've tried explaining in a calm voice and in a very loud and high pitched voice, I've tried a lot of things and she just whips out her phone and shows a random example from the Asian articles she browses -- ""See this kid? He took a dozen APs and did so and so competitions and went to Harvard. See this professor? He went to Harvard, MIT, Stanford, and won half a dozen prizes.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. How do I explain to her in a different way that my workload is too much, and I have to drop something?

52,"TL;DR at bottom!

In our family I (25 F) was always taught to be polite. Not just the simple please + thank you, but if you were inconvenienced or upset, you NEVER addressed it in public. Complaints were heard behind closed doors, and almost never shared with people or entities involved. 

Basically, I’m like John Mulaney: if you spilled soup in my lap, I’d apologize to YOU for wasting your soup. 

Today, as I was checking out in Target, a “Karen”-type was laying into this young cashier over a misplaced sign. Acting as if this cashier and the company was out to fuck her over personally. The item she wanted to buy should’ve been .99 cents, according to the sign. However, it rung up as $3. 

I’ve worked retail for 5+ years (read: tanning salon where I cleaned up bodily fluids all day every day), I’ve had to take it in the ass with a smile from women like this. They’re the worst humans alive.

The manager came over and explained that “Karen” has misread the sign; I didn’t hear all of it, but by the tone of the manager’s voice, I was confident that she had proved “Karen” wrong.

As I exited, I passed “Karen” and stated in the sickly-sweet bitchy voice, “I’m sure she appreciated your polite input, ma’am.” She either didn’t hear me, or pretended she didn’t.

Lo and behold, guess who parked 4 cars down from me! As “Karen” pulled out and started to drive passed me in her Benz, I waved really excitedly with a big smile on my face. She was confused and smiled back, at which point I gave her the finger. Her jaw dropped and she pulled up next to me. 

“Can I help you?!?!” she screamed, incredulous at the disrespect from a young person. 

“Why are you bitching at someone for something that’s out of their control, just because you’re a dumb cunt who can’t pay attention to detail?”

Her jaw hit her floorboard.

“Just a heads up, you actually get more stuff when you’re nice. Bye.”

I turned on my heel and climbed into my truck, I think I heard her say, lacking sincerity, “God bless you.”

So, why the hell do I feel guilty? I know I was standing up for someone and would’ve wanted someone to do the same when I was getting verbally abused at the salon. I feel like I did something wrong (aside from the bad language), but rationally I didn’t!...right?


TL;DR: told a woman to stop being a bitch in public, I feel super guilty now.",29Aug2019,1
53,"Hi all, I have recently noticed that a glaring flaw of mine ever since I was little is that whenever I meet someone of the opposite sex that is new, my mind immediately jumps to, “ok is a healthy and fulfilling romantic relationship with this person possible” ... it’s literally everyone. It might only be for one second if I am not attracted to them physically or on a personality level, but it feels like every stranger I meet I think, “this could be the person that is going to be my best friend and my love for the rest of my life” ... this is damaging for a few reasons ...

1. I feel that it stops me from focusing on maintaining healthy FRIENDSHIPS. I am a chronically lonely person, and am generally very picky with who I hangout with. However, because I feel like I am always looking for my “one” I feel I never spend time on making genuine friendships (mostly same sex friendships where I know for me there is no romantic possibility or possibility of potentially being in contact for life)

2. I feel that it puts me in a “lacking” mindset, especially when I am not with someone romantically. It makes me feel like I need x person to complete my life. I struggle a lot with mental health issues, specifically dysthymia, and with that comes a lot of loneliness. I would like to reach a place where I feel ok on my own without even the prospect of a romantic partner, while at the same time not becoming arrogant and “fuck everyone else I’m just about me” ... a lady once told me that there are 3 kinds of people:

1. “I’m ok, you’re not ok” - this is your standard “I know the answers and you don’t” condescending I am better than you, you don’t know what you are talking about
2. “I’m not ok, you’re ok” - this is those who doubt themselves constantly and take other’s words as more valuable than their own
3. “We’re both ok” - this is those who respect both themselves and others

I think I alternate a lot between 1&amp;2 and would like to be 3, but I always feel heavily 2 about not being in a relationship. I really want to share my life with someone and have them share their life with me as well as build a life together, so it is hard when I have no outlet for that energy.

Can someone offer some advice on these topics? How do I care more about myself than about my romantic potential? How do I stop evaluating everyone of the opposite sex through my own personal “mate searching” algorithm?",29Aug2019,1

55,"My wedding is in 45 days, on Oct. 12, 2019 and I just found out today one of my three bridesmaids pulled out. To clarify more, I have mild high functioning Aspergers, so I am extremely socially shy and don’t talk to a lot of people. I don’t have any female friends and I needed three bridesmaids because my fiancé had three groomsmen, so I choose my two sisters and one of their friends I knew a little bit and was comfortable around.  My only other option would be my mother, who is set on being the mother of the bride. The friend was telling my sister she would be excited to be my bridesmaid, so I asked her and she said yes. Everything was going good, I bought my wedding dress and they ordered their dresses and we were happy and excited. Then today my sister randomly says that her friend said she did not want to be friends anymore and did not want to be part of my wedding anymore. She’s done this like three times in the past, randomly ditching my sister. She used to have a girl crush on my sister and sometimes she can be a little needy. She has other friends telling her my sister is using her because my sister works night shift and sleeps during the day and her friend is offended that my sister never wants to do what she wants to do or hang out. She even mentioned being mad she had to pay for the bridesmaids dress, when her and my sisters had complete control over the dress price and style they chose as long as it was purple. Now this means there is a groomsmen that won’t have a bridesmaid and our ceremony was planned around three bridesmaids. My only option left is my mother, and my fiancé and mom hate that idea. My fiancé is saying he wants to call up the girl and cuss her out and tell her she just ruined our wedding. He says he doesn’t know what we are gonna do if she doesn’t change her mind, which does not look like she will. The bridesmaids dress were custom ordered for the color/style so she already paid for half her dress, and it’s too late to order a new one for my mom, it won’t be ready in time. We would have to ask her for the dress and hope it fits, which my sisters friend is a lot bigger then my mother. My fiancé is so mad at her he’s thinks he is gonna have to postpone the wedding. I have so much other stress going on, I’m in the middle of moving in with my fiancé, trying to find a new job where we can carpool because I don’t drive. My mom who was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s is moving to my dads home country Brazil with my dad so they can live cheaper and rent out the house because she was forced to retire and might lose the house. My fiancés roommate stopped paying rent so I had to make up the 2000$ he owed over the months so my fiancé wouldn’t get evicted, using all my savings for a bedbugs, rat, an roaches infested apartment in the ghetto, when we could have used it to move to a better place, but they would have taken my fiancé’s paychecks in back payment if we tried. To make matters worse the roommate stole 60$ out of my purse so the locks are getting changed in 4 days and he is kicking the roommate out. He’s had a month’s notice. We are under so much stress already, I don’t really know what to do. The idea of not marrying my fiancé is unfathomable but I’m worried we will have to postpone.",29Aug2019,1

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ttthe company name I said then  ‘ohhhh/mmmm...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk.

Anyway I’m not a very confrontational person and me and my roommate aren’t very close. Also we live in a small dorm and there’s not really space for two 5 gallons tanks with filters.

62,"I’m 15 and I’m in my sophomore year of high school. Its my second year at this school and last year was fine. I’m really under the average height for my age (about 5 foot male) and I’m really under weight (high metabolism rate is all). School just started last Monday and all my classes are great but in my first period there is this kid. Lets call this kid Dick, now Dick is a slacker and likes to smoke weed. I knew him last year and had no complications with him. But one the first day of school for no reason he started mocking me. I didn’t think much of it but the second day he did the same thing. He didn’t do anything else that week but this week we we’re standing in line to get tablets and he decided it would be funny to palm my head as if it we’re a basketball. The next day we did the same thing and Dick did the same thing. I’ve said nothing about it to him I just shook my head and glared at him then looked away. It hasn’t effected me at all because Dick is just a Dick. I haven’t told anyone and I’m not sure what I should do. Should I wait and see if this escalates? Confront him the next time he does something? Tell my parents, or a teacher? Please help",29Aug2019,2

My roommate has been teaching me how to window clean, and has taken me with him to do jobs every so often, for the past few months. In the past I’ve helped him with general cleaning jobs (i.e vaccuming, mopping). Would those be worth putting on to a resume? I’m studying a bachelor’s degree; would it be worthwhile to include that?

64,"I recently took a new job at a relatively new startup. When I started the job, it was me and someone else (person A) in HR. About two months into the job, person A quit abruptly. As a result, I sort of became head of HR even as an unpaid intern going to class full time.

As I began to get more duties, my boss and the head of the company slowly began to act stranger towards me. She kind of speaks in circles. She will say do task A, then a minute later say nevermind do task B, and then at the end of the day ask why task A was not done. Then, she would get mad at me for not making strategic decisions even and then a day later get mad at me for (retroactively) making these decisions.

A week ago, I got invited to a meeting about my performance. She just ripped me to threads, saying I'm destroying her company from within. I asked for clarification, but she refused.

I want to quit, this isn't worth it anymore for me. She is in Cancun for the week, so I didn't want to quit while she is gone (there are literally only 5 employees, 4 of which are unpaid interns). However, she just keeps emailing me passive agressive crap and I can't take it anymore.

But now it’s been several months since the Nexplanon has been removed and still no sex drive. My boyfriend of 2 years has been extremely understanding and knows this is a hormonal thing not a “him” thing.   I finally went to my Gyno today and she gave me Taytulla to take for 3 months to get my estrogen back up. She also is having me get blood work done. I’m a little confused because I thought birth control is what caused my sex drive to disappear and that maybe my testosterone levels are low??   Does anyone have any idea on if I should do this 3 months of Taytulla to get my sex drive back?? I know she’s a doctor and has a lot more knowledge than me. I just want it to come back.

80,"So hiii! I’m 16 year old girl and I have a crush on a literal gay goddess in my math class. But the thing is no one knows I’m bi. I’ve identified myself as bisexual since I was 12, I told my sister and a close friend (a guy whose gay) but that’s basically it. I’m super girly, and my identity has always confused me, I’ve done things with boys before (making out, oral) but never with a girl. Doing things with boys made me uncomfortable and I honestly don’t get turned on when kissing boys. I might even get a little turned off. So I always jump back and forth questioning if I’m gay or not. I wish I could be with a girl and see how I like it because I don’t really even like being with boys. I just feel like I’m a stuck “straight girl” because all my friends are straight, have had sex, sometimes they tell me that I need to lose my virginity, but I honestly don’t want to because the only time (when I have given someone head lol) I really didn’t like it. So yes I feel stuck, some guys see me as attractive but what I really want is a girl. This girl in my math is so fucking beautiful like whenever I’m in class all I focus on is her, we aren’t even friends and we never talk, I don’t want to live in that fantasy where I dream of having a secret relationship, being able to kiss her and just be with her, because I’m old enough to know that me and her is basically impossible, but it’s hard living this lie, like my friends thinking I think all these guys are so hot.

86,"I came home last night around 9 pm and as I was pulling into my driveway I saw a man standing outside of my house, looking in through the windows.  My headlights were shining on him but he didn’t move or even acknowledge me for at least 2 minutes. 

He finally started walking down towards the road on the other side of my house (we live on the corner of 2 streets) and when I drove onto that street he was still just standing there in my lawn. After another few minutes, he finally walked down towards the street, waived at me, then walked off and out of sight. 

I called the police just to inform them of the suspicious activity and they came by just to check things out. They said to call back if he comes back around. Later on, around 2 am, my dog started barking so I looked around outside with a flashlight and found a man sleeping on my lawn. I’m assuming it was the same man but it was hard to tell as he had a hoodie on and it was dark outside. I called the cops again and they made him leave. 

I no longer feel comfortable in my own home. My boyfriend is a nurse and works nights so there are several nights a week where I am home alone. Any advice on how to feel safe again? Unfortunately we are moving in 2 months so setting up an expensive security system would not be a good option for us.

88,"To start off I'm 16M starting school this week if that has anything to do with this. 

My Dad has anger issues, not to the point where he is abusive but little things can set him off. I am getting to be more and more like this recently. I have a bit of an Irish temper as well but in the past I've been good about controlling it. Lately though I have been getting so pissed off at everything. Any small inconvenience sets me off. I got mad at my mother (whom I never get mad at) for asking me to help her sign up on a website, I ghosted my friend for a couple days for telling me I was bad at GTA, every single time I die in Rainbow Six Siege I get mad. I punched my wall and I can't even remember why (I left a deep dent in the wall, there'd probably be a hole if I threw a good punch). After I get mad at who/whatever is around me I get mad at myself for getting so upset. 

&amp;#x200B;

Idk if this is related but my sister and a few acquaintances/friends really like telling me how bad I am at everything. My sister and a family friend always told me my music sucked, my sister just generally calls me an idiot and tells me how stupid I am all the time, and my Friend I like to play games with (the one I ghosted) is the reason I stopped playing Minecraft. I was afraid that he would laugh at whatever I did and tell me its bad. Come to think of it that's probably why I've been so upset by dying in r6, I want to prove that I'm good enough. I don't play music around other people because I don't want them to think it's bad. Fuck I just realized this from typing it... I've been pretty good about taking these jokes since I was very little, I guess its just all boiling over now with the help of starting school.

89,"Ok, here's the scenario:

My aunt has lived with my grandma for many years (decades), and she used to come around to family events and things until about 15 years ago when she essentially became a shut-in. We assume agoraphobia, but its undiagnosed. For many years, grandma wouldn't even admit there was a problem. My father (aunt's brother) started to get involved, but he was diagnosed with cancer and passed away not long after. We tried to encourage grandma to get help for our aunt, but there were other issues and there was a falling out between grandma and me/my siblings not long after dad passed. We've had very little contact with her since 2013.

This week we were notified grandma has passed. Evidently when the police went to talk to my aunt, she fled to her room and wouldn't talk to them. My sister has gone by the past 2 days, trying to get her to answer the door. She left a letter in the mail slot. We've been calling, but it rings and rings and then theres a recording that says ""memory full"".

So our concerns are a) we have no idea how much food is in the house or what she'll do when it runs out, b) we know she potentially has financial resources (she inherited a portion of my dad's estate, but at the time she refused to sign anything so as far as we know it's just sitting in a trust for her), but we have no idea if she even knows how to go about accessing it. But obviously, house and utilities payments will need to be made before long.

We're considering contacting the police to go out and do a welfare check. What we don't know is, if they do manage to talk to her, are the police just going to say 'she's alive' and leave it at that, or will the fact that shes unable to care for herself be taken into account?

I don't know if this needs to be said, but my siblings and I are not looking to get the house or anything monetary, we truly are just trying to avoid our aunt starving to death alone, and possibly get her the help she's needed for years.",29Aug2019,6

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ttthe company name I said then  ‘ohhhh/mmmm...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk.

97,"So I’m in high school as a senior and last year around halfway through the year my friend suggested we make a club with the three of us as leadership positions for it. I was personally interested in the topic and issues of the club and wanted it to succeed. For the sake of anonymity I’ll call the one who suggested it Caesar and the other friend who agreed along side me Cassius. So Caesar got the papers for the club and wanted us to fill out the paperwork together, lest he be stuck with all the work which we all found reasonable. After some debate it was decided I would be vice-president and my friend secretary. Caesar wanted to make sure everything was right with the paperwork so we often filled everything outside of school together. However, I noticed progress was going extremely slowly because Caesar wanted to use the progress we made as a draft which I was hesitant about as most of the club paperwork personally felt like busy work like making a structure for how the club is gonna run. Caesar and admittedly both me and Cassius took a long amount of time for our vision of the club and every specific detail. Despite this, I knew it was more important that we had a club in the first place to run rather then a well made club but never said anything about it in the first place. We got a teacher to moderate the club as our advisor as we hurriedly turned in the paperwork before the term ended as you couldn’t make a club during the next term. Some issues occurred regarding turning in our paperwork (most blame falls on the school personally) and we were left with no real confirmation regarding the state of our club. I repeatedly suggested to Caesar that he as president should personally ask what occurred and follow-up as we had a lead with the person in charge of making the clubs. He ignored my advice yet never even scheduled a first meeting which is what Cassius suggested, to just start meetings. Eventually the end of the year came and nothing happened. I personally realized near the end that nothing would happen and accepted it. Over the summer we only met once and briefly suggested trying again to my hesitation as Caesar never went all the way last year. I improved myself in many fields over the summer(especially the area regarding the club by taking classes at colleges) for nothing but self improvement. The new year starts and Caesar suggests we wait a week then try to make the club, I say yes but privately talk to Cassius and said if they were truly committed this time then I would go all the way but if not I don’t care because my time matters to me. The year starts and after a week Caesar starts doubting(on his own) that he may not want to start again. I told Cassius to go contact the new person in charge of clubs to see if we have turn in a new application as we unsure to the state of the club. The person comes back and says even if we did our club would have to restart paperwork again. I print out the paperwork and hand the paperwork back to Caesar to see if he’s truly committed and somewhat dodges this advance. I realize I’m so damn tired at this point that I’m just gonna fill out all the paperwork with some slight assistance from Cassius as he’s helping promote the club and get the advisor to agree to advise the club again. Now I’m sitting here filling out the paperwork somewhat angrily and think to myself whether or not I should turn in all the form with me as president and Cassius as vice as this year Caesar has done nothing for contributing to the club and wasn’t willing to go all the way. All in all I want to know whether I should as morally i feel I’m betraying a friend but I also feel is doing the work and him receiving the benefits is unjust.

98,"So I am taking Engineering Mathematics at uni this semester to get into a degree that requires a certain level of maths. This course assumes knowledge of a level of math in high school (Maths Methods) which I did not take. This uni courses covers a handful of topics from Calc 1 to 3 and I had never even touched calculus before now...

I attended the first lecture and, naturally, I had no clue what was happening. I asked my mate (who took a high level of math in high school) for some advice and he said: “Maths is hard bro, if you didn’t do Maths Methods in high school, you’re gonna fail that course. 100% you’re gonna fail. You should drop the course. I got 26/50 grade on my high school maths and the course you’re taking is even more in depth.”

That day, I started considering dropping out of the course as I can’t afford to have any fail marks on my transcript. I just won’t let that happen. It was a shit night, I really didn’t know what to do - I thought about it a lot and I didn’t know if I should stay in the course or drop it.

I slept on it, and the next day I was able to think more clearly. I started studying differentiation and picked it up quickly. I was enjoying the fact that I was understanding it and able to follow the classes - something that seemed impossible to me on the first day started to make sense!

I’m in week 6 now, and we have an assessment every Friday which goes to our final grade. I am maintaining a ~91% grade currently and not only do I think I can pass the course, I might even be able to get a decent final grade!

I look back on what my mate said to me and I feel a bit of anger that I almost dropped the course because of that advice. But maybe he was looking out for me and my best interest. I’m not sure, but I do feel like I want to prove him wrong by passing. “100% going to fail” are the exacts words of his that I keep thinking about, and it motivates me to prove him wrong.

I just wanted to share this and ask you what you think of advice like this? I considered may e I shouldn’t hang out with people that have such little faith in me - but maybe he was giving his honest opinion and didn’t want me to struggle. What do you guys think?",29Aug2019,4
99,"I'm 17, if that's relevant at all, and have no friends, which may factor in the hating silence part (loneliness and whatnot). 

I can't seem to bring myself to turn audio off and read in silence, and I don't want to read with audio playing because I've heard and read that you don't learn properly if you have sound distracting you. No matter what I'm doing I always have some form of audio playing bar when I'm doing some sort of physical task (like cleaning, getting food, going to the bathroom) or when I'm sleeping.

101,"I have had chronic insomnia for a year now. It has been so bad at points that I literally have been one bad thought away from swallowing a bottle of benzos. I've tried various prescription pills and marijuana for it and while the marijuana has somewhat worked, the pills were awful and made everything worse. 

Anyways, 2 months ago, I took LSD and it made a MAJOR difference in my mood and with my insomnia. The following week, I slept amazingly and even felt great even on days where my sleep was a little bit iffy. My suicidal thoughts went away and I was in a state that I hadn't been in since before I developed my chronic insomnia. I decided to tell my parents since I felt it was a good idea to let them know rather than to have them find out later on and since they didn't mind my marijuana use.

So I told them and my mom freaked out and threatened to kick me out on the street. I pointed her to studies that talk about how it works and how safe it is, and she claims to have read them, but obviously hasn't. She won't let go of this idea that LSD and Shrooms turns people into murderers and that they are deadly. Whenever I bring it up, she says she's having ""chest pains"" from ""stress"" and then begins to lash out on me and say it is ""her house"" and that if I want to continue living here I need to respect that any time I so much as make a peep about it.

Frankly, while I get that logic, I am not in a position to move out and will never be in that position if I don't cure my insomnia. I finally found a cure that doesn't warp my mind or lead to worse issues like Adderall and restoril and she refuses to allow me to have it.

I'm desperate. I'm beginning to regress and NEED to have this. I'm so desperate that I've considered telling my mom that I'm going to take it anyways and that if she tries to kick me out, I will kill myself. I obviously don't want to go to this extreme, but if I'm desperate enough I WILL do it and I am depressed enough that I wont be kidding. I know it's awful to hear from your kid that they want to kill themselves, but it's awful also to feel like you want to kill yourself and have a parent who cares more about being right rather than your health and well-being

I need a solution. They told me they are okay with me going to a hotel, but I want to trip in a safe setting that I recognize. I also want people to be there for my first few times in case I have an emergency.

PS: I don't need advice telling me that ""LSD is bad."" or that ""I am wrong and shouldn't be taking it."" I have done my research, made my decision on it, and If I get such advice, I will ignore it and downvote you. I'm not hearing it.",29Aug2019,1

104,"TLDR-ish at bottom.

Hi.

So, I'm going to try and keep this as short as possible:

My parents never really loved each other. My mother never wanted to get married but she did it anyway because that's normal, I guess. They both settled. 

I have an older sibling who is in their mid 30s. They are a half sibling-- different father. I also have another (full) sibling who is only a few years older than me. I am in my lower 20s. 

My older sibling was already born when my parents got married, so they were legally a step kid. They do not remember any involvement of my father in their life other than him being abusive. They say my father has been abusive since before I was born, and I don't doubt it. 

My first memories of my father being abusive were when I was around the tween age. (By this time my oldest sister was out of the house.) I don't remember exactly when it happened... I just remember getting used to the sounds of arguing, except this one time it happened, it got worse and I needed to contact the police. This happened a few times. I was always on the edge of trying to figure out when I needed to call the police and when I didn't. Sometimes when situations would get rough my mother would take my other sibling and I and we'd sleep over a local cousin's house for a few days or weeks. We even stayed in a shelter for a month, and transitional housing for several months (before we ran out of time).

Memories in general of my father have never been good. Important context to add to this story is that I was born with a genetic disease that is degenerative/progressive. It is very, very similar to the condition from the Ice Bucket Challenge-- just a different gene defect. Throughout my childhood I was in and out of hospitals (inpatient and outpatient) dealing with my health. He was never there. He didn't like that I was crippled, or probably ""defective"" in his mind, so he never made an effort to... be a father. That said, my eldest sibling has said even before when it was found out I had genetic health problems he denied me as my skin color was ""too light."" (Thankfully I look like my mother but it was never any question that I was his.)  

I cannot stress that there is not a positive memory I have of this man. (You can skip this area in parenthesis but if you are curious, continue: I have this one memory that's so creepy and predatory I actually don't want to type it out, but aside from that I have other memories of friends being creeped out from him. Before I was a preteen I would want to go places when he would bring my other (full) sibling somewhere but he would always say ""next time"" because it took a few minutes to put my wheelchair together and apart to get in/out of the car. He would purposely annoy me when I was in the ICU. Once, instead of helping to afford a wheelchair accessible vehicle (once my condition progressed to the point where I needed a power chair, which can't fit in regular vehicles) he bought himself a motorcycle and new car instead. Once, he showed me a new phone ""he was going to give to me"" and when I, out of excitement, tried to input my mother's phone number I saw it was already saved under ""Devil."" I used to have nurses over the home and he would torment my mom in front of them. He would bring me aside and say ""I could always defend him"" when he was abusing my mother. After my mother having tried to leave several times some things fell into place to where she could finally leave for good. Unfortunately this meant leaving the adapted house and moving to an inaccessible apartment. My father dragged out the divorce for many years to drain my mother poor and has moved to a new state (great) and the house is empty. No one lives there. There are honestly so many things that were done that if I were to continue this list I would look like Bitter Betty.) Quite honestly, I have made peace with the situation... If you were to ask me how I felt when I was 14 it would've been a completely different response, but I am only listing a fraction of these things he has done / not done so the gravity of why I don't talk to him can be understood. 

Now, back to the present. 

My physical health is a lot worse than it used to be because duh. My mental health, about two years ago (in the middle of the divorce) was the worse it ever was. And the MH thing isn't completely due to the divorce but to be transparent my mother, in dealing with her abuse, has abused (neglected) me as well. (And that's no excuse for her. I'm currently dealing with that situation and getting help.) 

Though the divorce is over my parents have continued to go to courts due to him not doing what he was ordered by the judge to do. I am legally an adult and have a job and all of these things but as I can't be expected to work full time and am not able to pay for my own attendant care, health insurances, ventilator, etc, on my own, and because of a loophole from my state, he has to help pay for medical things and lodging until/unless I can do so myself. 

In other words, I'm tied to this person I don't want to be tied to. The odds are against me. But I haven't given up. 

&amp;#x200B;

The main problem disrupting my peace right now is that my family on both sides urges me to talk to him. The odd part is most of the members doing this are on my mother's side. Since over a year my father has contacted one of my cousins and my cousin tries to get me to talk to him. When I ignored him, he got his mother (my cousin's mother) to try to do the same thing. They say ""He's still your father. Even though he tries to make your life worse he still cares about you. Don't be like that. Don't be mean."" I've told them to stop and lately they haven't talked to me back about it. But my mother? She does the same thing even though she says she doesn't. She never knew her father until she was 12 (and he also was not a great father figure) so she has a distorted idea of things. She says I should write him a letter and honestly I started to (to please her) but I never did anything with it because it was useless. It was just a long list of reasons why I didn't like him as a person. (One of the things on the list being one of the few birthdays of mine that we ""celebrated"" together when I opened up a card that said ""I loved you"" in front of the family, and my tween self teared up and immediately stopped because I almost believed him.) While I wasn't angry or anything when I wrote that letter I knew if I sent it I'd be made a villain and who knows, he probably would've killed himself... 

And now he keeps texting me and calling me. These random texts like ""It's your long lost dad lol 😎"" and ""just checking to c if this is the right number,"" (knowing dang well I've had the same phone number since I was a kid).  Something else he did a few months ago was contact his sister and she texted me asking for my email, then she forwarded an email from him to me about a special needs trust. I think the trust fund pamphlet was supposed to make me think of when he'd die and how I'd get money from him. But the truth is I don't want any of his money. Anything that comes from him feels dirty. 

&amp;#x200B;

From ages 0 to the end of 15 I lived in that house with him and everything was ordered by him. I could never be myself. If I wasn't handling my health I was figuring out how to stay out of his way. When I was a tween I figured out I was lucky to not get the attention I so wanted from him when I was younger, and nothing has changed. I want out. I know I can't get completely out. Unfortunately I have to suffer as a result of these two people deciding to hook up... Both physical health wise because of my genetic condition and mental health wise because of the effects of his abuse and moreso lately, my mother's abuse to me.

I haven't given up on my life... Despite this rant I have a lot of good in my life and I'm grateful to be alive. But I'm done with putting others first. While it was a survival tactic when I was younger I've learnt it has done me no good and I'm starting to live for myself and make goals towards my independence.

I just need to know, though... **Until I reach that level of independence that I will be able to get, how can I block out this bad energy from my family? I'm sick of people asking me to contact an abuser literally just because he had sex that resulted in me, a human. Is there any way to do this without people thinking that I'm ""crazy?"" They know he's abusive... Everyone knows. But they say I'm supposed to treat him kind and care about/for him when he's old. (The irony, as most people with my conditions die before their parents and I myself need near around the clock care. Me.)** I feel like they're trying to make me feel like his mental anguish right now is my fault, and that if he does something it'll be my fault because I didn't try to see him.  

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR: My father has been abusive to people since before I was born. My mother has dated abusive people since before I was born. Out of no goodness was I created, and I have a progressive genetic illness (similar to the one from the Ice Bucket Challenge) thanks to that. My whole childhood sucked due to living with him. Years past and my mother got out, and the divorce was drawn out for years because my father wanted to empty my mom's pocket. Despite all this my father has gotten through to several family members both on his side and my mom's side so they can egg me on to talk to him. They've guilt tripped me to talk to him. Even my mother turned around and does the same thing too... (Stockholm syndrome if you will.) No one knows a few years ago I had suicidal ideation due to dealing with this mess. Now I'm a lot better but these people won't stop nagging me about contacting him. Even he has begun to pop up with weird texts, calls, etc. I'm being guilt into talking to him... I haven't budged. I won't budge. But dang, dealing with a terminal illness is hard enough... How can I get my family to essentially buzz off? (Important context: I am still legally partially financially dependent on my father for health bills. And unfortunately legally physically dependent on my mother for care as where I live disabled people don't get enough care hours from the state to live independently. I'm working on trying to change my situation.)**",29Aug2019,1
105,"Hey guys,im sorry about sharing my problem here but i really have nowhere else to go and posting here relieving myself calms me in a way.

So let's start,i am a guy currently in senior high school,and i have never ever had a girlfriend or a first kiss.Im still fairly young but all my friend have like a ton of ex girlfriends and some of them even lost their virginity.To be very fair i was really obese most of my life,therefore i have never ever had confidence to talk to girls and i always have be anxious about everything.

About a year ago i started going to the gym and got insanely shredded and now i have a very decent physique.I get called handsome by some friends and all od my famoly and relatives.But thing is i never belive that.Yeah i have a good body,blue eyes and brown hair with a good jawline.But i never ever have any confidence ever to go with that.Whenever i look in the mirror i just get really sad since im finding all my flaws like dark under eye bags and the slightest of acne really fucks me up.

I've tried talking to multiple girls and i feel them actually being attracted to my looks but my thinking and wording is so bad i get rejected or ignored by every single one of them.Im ultra mega shy to talk to girls in real life so i just messege girls on instagram.I get shy even talking to girls that are just my friends.Please help guys you don't know how much of a pleague this is to live with,im personally a big muscular guy but i have 0 balls and guts to talk to girls and im just very afraid that if i screw up they will tell all their friends and since our city is small everybody will know thus ruining the chance of ever me getting a future girlfriend.Im not outgoing im just training and staying home,im way too shy to go to a disco or a bar.",29Aug2019,0

Today has been an intense day and if I’m being completely honest it feels like I’m dreaming. After a deep conversation with a family member, it’s been brought to my attention just how abusive one of my parents was and still is (now less subtle). I know you’re probably thinking, how did you not know, you lived it? But I can’t even answer that looking back. I don’t know how I didn’t know. But I know now and I’m not going to let my siblings go through it for any longer and become products of their upbringing as I see starting to happen.   I don’t know how much information to give and I’m sorry if this is all over the place but I feel completely dazed and frustrated. The abuse included emotional and physical including but not limited to: locking a kid out in freezing temperatures, stepping on the gas while one was exiting the car, attempting suicide in front of us, hitting, etc. 

The issue: I have little proof. Other than police reports from years ago which could be helpful, I have recent text messages and maybe some emails I can dig up- she deleted everything. My family member said we had videos but the person deleted them. Cps was called multiple times and she put on a facade good enough for each of them, as she had warning they were coming. We were told what to say and also we were kids and only knew the “truth” as what we were told, in addition to being scared of being taken away.

so i’m a very nosy person. this has always ended up getting me in trouble, but never something like this. one day, i decided to be nosy and look through who my uncle was following on instagram just to get a laugh out of who he was following, if they were stupid pages etc. then i came across an eleven year old girls profile in his following list. i thought it was odd, so i decided to look further into it. 

i looked at some of the girls pictures and saw that he had commented. things saying she was “sexy” and she “looks good in that bathing suit” and, i kid you not, “many guys would love to have you as their gf, me included”. on an eleven year old girls instagram. many creepy older guys around his age commented on the girls pictures. i felt sick to my stomach. i honestly didn’t know what to do. i just remember laying in bed crying. i haven’t told anyone what i found yet. a few years ago his account was hacked, but, i honestly think he was faking it. who would hack a 52 year old mans instagram? and all that happened was “lude” pictures were put on his page but then got taken down. you could chalk it all up to be he really did get hacked, but there’s more.

 he follows other girls around this age as well, but i can’t see them as they have private accounts. and i looked up the signs of a pedophile. he showed many of them. he still live with his mom, my grandma, he’s not married, nor has he ever had a girlfriend, he’s interested in things that kids would normally be interested in, like the muppets, he’s always been very quiet but normally open up around girls my age (15). he also is super protective over his room, like he doesn’t want someone to find something. when we go to the pool, he always has his sunglasses on so you can’t see his eyes, but i always have gotten the eerie feeling his eyes are on me. if my mom points out a young girl in public with a cute outfit on, he whips his head around to look at her. 


i don’t feel safe around him anymore, and lately it’s really been getting to me. i’ve been having nightmares about it for weeks now. i should’ve told when i was able to. i’d mustered up the courage to tell my mom about it tonight and when i went to check the profile to show her, it had been deleted. i’m absolutely crushed. i don’t have any evidence now. i’m scared as well. i don’t want to tear apart my family, but then i imagine all the poor girls he’s more than likely perved on. i don’t even know how to go about telling my mom, and if whether or not she would bring attention to it. that’s her brother. they have an amazing bond and i would hate to tear it apart. i’m stuck at this point.

How do I politely tell them to stop? I was thinking of writing a note and taping it to their door. What should I do. Any suggestion is helpful!,29Aug2019,1
119,"I'll keep it short, my parents were obsessed with me getting good grades, I remember bringing home a B in 6th grade and proudly presenting it to my dad as it was a hard test that most students failed. He responded with a disappointed ""We'll do better next time"". My sister and a friend of ours always told me how bad my music taste is, to this day my sister tells me about my garbage taste in music every time she hears it. My friends I play video games with have started telling me how bad I am when I play with them to. I stopped playing Minecraft because whenever I got on it was just a chance for them to bring up how bad I was at the game, I played GTA for the first time in 2 years and was immediately shot down for not being good at driving within the first 10 seconds I got into a car. When I play Siege I get mad whenever I die because I am afraid my team will think less of me, I punched my wall hard enough to dent it and leave a mark on my hand (there would probably be a hole if I punched properly). I don't even remember what angered me so much as to do it.

Everything I love has turned into me trying to prove myself because anything less than perfect means I'm a failure to everyone, I'm holding them back so why would they want me around. How do I stop caring what others think? There is no logical reason for these fears but they are present in whatever I do.

120,"Im not sure what to say
In the past few months my relationship with my parents has turned to one sided arguments and punishments given with poor judgement. 

Im 16 years old soon to be junior in highschool, and im not sure what to do. My dad calls me selfish, curses at me, and insults me almost all the time when he is angered at me. I am an introverted person and I spend most of my time isolated. I have friends irl but I mainly speak with online friends. I play videogames with them alot and enjoy their company more than alot of people i know personally. Whenever I forget to do something or do something late, he will lecture/ yell at me for being selfish and having a poor attitude towards people. He expects me to be outside with people everyday instead of being inside. I would also like this but many of my irl friends are busy as well as the constant interrogation of where I am going, who I am with, exactly what I am doing, and the time I will return by. I know it may seem he is just a dad but he does it in such an unnecessary and pessimistic way that it doesnt even seem worth it to make plans if I have to basically file paperwork to do so. He will take away my computer for forgetting to do certain tasks and when i ask for them back he will mock me. I have two brothers one older and another one younger than me that do not receive receive the same treatment. They will be on their computers until 11 at night and wont get yelled at or even noticed while I am forced to get off mine at 8pm or I am berated. I feel that I am being treated unfairly as well as feeling lost on what I should do. It seems that he hates me because I have more fun online than in the real world. I just need advice.",29Aug2019,1

126,"Hi!
Ok so I am a substitute teacher for my local school district. Just some background as I understand that it might be different in other districts or states - subs here get paid by day and are not salary. We get paid a daily rate for full days and half of that for working half days. Because I have a BA, I receive the highest pay grade a substitute can have. I originally applied for an interpreter intern position, but was denied due to me needing to pass a test, however, while I wait to take the test, the district would hire me as a sub so that I could work in a similar environment in the meantime. Great, perfect, glad I chose to go through with it because I found the school that I wanted to work at long term as an intern. 5 months pass, I take and pass the test with ease, schedule a formal interview for the job that I was initially, but not formally, guaranteed and got the job. I was told to expect to be contacted by HR for paperwork. However, as the first day of school approached, I got more and more nervous and tried to make contact. I was then contacted by my sub coordinator, explaining that my HR packet was taking awhile because they were busy, so would I be willing to do what I did months ago and be a substitute while I waited for my paperwork, that way I could at least work and earn some money. I agreed, but then found out a few things - I would be subbing for my own future position AND at a lower rate than I had previously been subbing for. The intern position is salary, and much more money than I was making as a sub, but this position would be a little over $20 less than my previous subbing experiences, and the work would be harder, AND there is the sting of doing a salary job but not getting the appropriate pay. I decided to go along with it because a) I need money and b) I didn't want to cause a ruckus and mess up my future employment. Now school has started and people who recognize me are asking if am full time, and I give them the ""yes, but actually no"" explanation, minus detailing my salary, and they seem very suprised that this is even happening.

I have received word that my packet will be done soon, but I definitely feel like I'm being used and I am curious if it goes longer than this first week I stand up and say I'll continue to work once my pay gets worked out, or if I should continue like this for the sake of money and a good name?
Not looking to get on my coordinator about giving me the short end of the stick, because I honestly feel blessed to have this position coming soon, it'll be great for me and I need it, but I DO want to stand up for myself because I know what I'm worth and so do they, so I'd like to get paid for it if this keeps up.",29Aug2019,1
127,"I graduated college almost two years ago and I've been chasing stability since then. My family has spread rumors about me ever since undergrad saying I would never make it. But I did. Right after college, I spent a year applying to grad school and I got in. I was also applying to jobs and I found a job that I'm still currently going through the process. I am having a vision problem and it is setting me back now, but I believe it can be corrected.

128,"  For the past two or so weeks, the two irl friends that I have, ( let’s call them John and Mark) haven’t been talking to me, or each other. Nobody is mad at each other or anything, just haven’t been talking. Other than them and my family. I have no one to talk to.  We played video games almost all the time, and would occasionally hang out and get food together. 

  John has another group of friends, and they are his main friend group. So when his friends were all busy and he wasn’t he would talk to Mark and I. At first and for a while I didn’t really think anything of it, because it was about half and half. I’ve always wanted to be included in that group, because I’m there friend but not someone who they would want to hang out with.   After a while he started hanging out more and more with them, to where it got to the point where he was talking to us like once or  twice a week, for about 3-4 months

  Mark, he just all of a sudden stopped talking to me, I’m not sure why. When Mark got quiet, no one talked to each other. 

  The first week, I didn’t give it not a lot of thought, because there had been times when it was mute from us for like 2 maybe 3 days. It has been 16 days. 

  Today was the first day the we’ve said anything to each other. I wasn’t happy at all. The entire time I felt like they didn’t want to be friends anymore.  Im not sure if I should ask them what’s up, or just say nothing and see what happens.",29Aug2019,1
129,"My bestfriend of 13 years is a really pretty woman.But that's not what made me fall in love with her.We share the same story,even though we don't have a lot in common.What i lack,is what she has,and what she lacks,is what i have.She is calm peaceful,collected and loves to study.While me,im a frenzy guy that loves adrenaline and new things.She admitted she wants adrenaline and i admit i want to read a book once in a while.

I always fancied her,and i always was in the friendzone,but got over with it when she got a boyfriend.Over the past years i did misrable attempts to make us a couple but she always rejected me.About three months ago she broke up with her boyfriend.Me being the friend,i was always here to calm her even more and to be her shoulder to cry on,all these 13 years i was here,even when nobody was.She admits that too,that nobody was there for her like i was,even tho she doesen't act like it.

Example:I arranged a meeting with her a week prior to the meeting day,she agreed.Two days before the meeting day i asked her what time we should go.She told me she forgot and had a girls night out.Times and times like this i have been screwed over,ive given her too much and recieved nothing,not even a plain meeting,for the last couple of months we only chatted via instagram,i always replied on time even when i was busy,she never replied on time and if i didn't write constantly she would never have opened the messeges.

She was not like this the past 13 years,this started about 2 years ago when she got new friends that were not even compareably close as me.After she broke up with her boyfriend,she got really flirty with me,i was fed up with her lame and shitty ""friendship"",so i decided to do the same.She kept telling me how she wanted to kiss guys after she broke up with her boyfriend but she didn't know who,indirectly giving me the hint.I got it,we went out.It ended terribly.At the end she was really weireded out and later she admitted that she was awkward around me and she didn't like my new flirty style.

I took the advice and stopped being flirty with her and started to be a friend again.But then SHE started being flirty AGAIN with me.I got really fed up because she was even worse of a friend now not even listening to what i was saying.I went really deep into it,falled madly inlove,i flirted,she flirted back.

4 days  ago i told her i loved her.Not because of her looks.But because of her beautiful soul.And that i had many more pretty girls (which is true) to choose from,but she was my soulmate,and that i always chose her.And i asked her on a date.Told her i was not the same person as before when she rejected me,which is also true i was very fat and in terrible shape,and now im super shredded and lean with good aesthethics.And that i would treat her like a goddes.My goddes....

She rejected me,told me we don't go well toghether,while previously flirting with me and giving me all sorts of hints.

I told her if we weren't gonna be a couple,i would stop being her friend because she treated me like a sack of shit while i would cancel on people and skip trainings just to be there to support her.

She got furious,telling me all sorts of thing i never expected to be in her head about me.How she never wanted to go alone with me because i fancied her.Started telling me all about my flaws that i never knew existed.But that hurt me the most,she told me she never wanted to go on meetings with me,just because i liked her.Guys,im not sick,i don't have any condition,mental or not.Im perfectly fine,i wpuld never do something to hurt her,especially her,i would always protect her and walk her to her home to make sure nobody does something to her.

And yet,she'a making me a pshyco for just LIKING her when she started flirting first.

I told her just a simple goodbye,she questined why i didn't wanna talk and be friends,i told her straight up she was a shitty friend,and if we were not a couple i wouldn't like to be her friend.

She told me that we both knew this was not the end.Especially because i did this on several occasions,telling her i won't be her friend anymore and communicate with her and leaving for a week then coming back and i would start talking again.But this time.

Im not coming back.

Im just ao emotionally fucked up and wrecked,losing a person i knew and loved for 13 years.I now have new insecurites and my anxiety is going throu the roof.I just cant forget her and still have that love for her.But on the other hand what she told me and how she reacted really fucked me up on stages i didn't knew were possible.She may messege me again,or she may not.I just don't know what to do....",29Aug2019,3

I saw a man walking an old dog (golden) that looked badly starved. I thought maybe it could be a medical problem but he was pulling on this dog that could barely walk so I do think he is negligent. I was almost late to work because I tried to follow him, thought if I got his address I could report, but he had to walk slow due to this old dog stopping a lot and walking slowly, and I became scared of him as well as needing to go to work. I want to try to find this guy and nail him somehow.

If I see them walking again do you think I could call and tell someone where he was seen, maybe flag down a cop car?  Is it too crazy dangerous to try to follow him again or confront him? Ive never seen them before.

Im also afraid that my actions may have already caused harm by making the man limit the dog’s walks out of fear of being caught. I also still think there is a small chance it could be a dying dog with a medical problem and not abuse- but most people would put down a dog so miserable and he didnt seem like a caring owner.

141,"I(20 M) am a sophomore in college. I made a mistake in choosing a school because my cousin(also 20 M) wanted to go there. It was my dream to go to this school, but I couldnt get into main campus, neither could my cousin, so we went to a satellite, I wish I went to a different college, or the campus closer to home, but I thought ""who cares, once I get good grades I can transfer to main campus and be at my dream school."" Big mistake. My cousin and I mutually decided not to room together, as we wanted to continue being ""best friends"" (I genuinely considered him my best friend, and I thought he did too, but it was all fake), but wanted to branch out as well. We ended up getting the same suite, right across the hall, literally 5 feet apart from each other at the front doors. I got a really bad roommate, and his dropped out, so about a month or 2 into the semester I asked him if I could switch to his room and we could room together, he told me he would rather pay for a single. 3 days later, he convinced his best friend from his highschool(we went to different highschools) to move from an entirely different school and room with him. I felt betrayal by this. I hid it because I know my cousin would be a dick about it, either getting extremely agitated, or avoiding confrontation the second I show my true opinions on the matter, but I felt awful. 

In my first semester, besides my awful roommate, I met some really fun people, I loved hanging out with them and it seemed like they liked me too. Turns out I was wrong again. They were just as fake. As soon as the new roommate moved in, they gravitated toward him, they started hanging out with my roommate(who they *really* *really* shit talked in the first semester), and they for some reason started avoiding me. A lot. My roommate moved out at some point because he is rich so he could afford to pay for 2 rooms, and he wanted a single, and I basically became a recluse because I was part of a tight knit friend group and it was too late in the year to join clubs and sports, and my cousin never knocked for me. 5 feet away and every time they went out he didn't knock once. I got into a deep depression, and even began crying every night for a while, which until that point I hadn't done since I was 6 or 7. I felt so alone and depressed, I started seeing the school therapist, and though I'm not honest to my family about this because I don't want to alarm them, I even considered suicide because I lost contact with all of my friends from high school and back home, and not only did I not have friends at school, but I was being actively ostracized. Even by my own blood and the guy who, for the last 17 years I considered my best friend. I liked his roommate, you can tell he didn't do anything, he was nice enough(he was a dick a lot but not in the excluding way). Come summer time and I thought that time away might rekindle my cousin and my relationship, and my friends from school. Nope. My cousin ignored every. Single. Text I sent him for 3 months. He barely talked to me at family parties, and now is barely talking to me back at school. To make things worse I got screwed over by the room assignments so I'm in a building with nobody from last year. Most people are in the same building, but I got switched, as well as my cousin and his roommate, but they still have each other and I have no one that is familiar. I get extremely paranoid now because they ignore me still but when they see me in person pretend to be best buds. They do everything without me, and while I sit in my room depressed and bored, they go out and do everything and wont even consider inviting me, and have all these crazy stories that, before he convinced his friend to transfer in, I was always a part of. Today hurt really bad, because we all went out to dinner, and I was almost not even invited, and there was a quizzo game show thing tonight with the school where you can win prizes. When I asked who was going, everyone said no they were not. I just opened snapchat and one of them posted a video of all of them at the game show quizzo thing and they were all dancing around. Every single one of them. I fucking hate people like that. 
Why can't anyone be truthful, why not just tell me outright ""fuck you I don't like you anymore!"". People are such cowards now that they think ghosting someone or ignoring them is nice ""because they dont find out"", but at least if you're brutally honest I leave with my dignity, no paranoia, anticipation, or depression. I just don't get it. I also don't understand how someone can hold such little value in a 17 year long friendship and be literally in love with a person they've been friends with for 4 years (who, might I also add, actively makes fun of their love life, brutally). I just dont get it. I want to tell off my cousin, tell him how awful he made me feel. I want to tell them all, but I'm afraid because it would be about 7 against 1, they like to spread rumours and talk shit, and I'm bad at debating under pressure. Even if I were to have more evidence against them being good people, I would still become too intimidated to make a good argument, and i would sound like I'm making things up. The worst part is, I know what people will say, ""just find other friends and move on, screw them, they aren't good people"". I've heard it a thousand times, but it isnt that simple. Even when I'm hanging out with the people I've met this year and trying to enjoy myself, it still hurts when I see their status updates and stories and they're doing stuff without having even considered inviting me. It hurts. So. Bad. Even when I'm out, I still get paranoid and I'm left to question why I got outcasted and why I get ignored. I'm left completely without closure, and a part of me, and I'm very upset by this, but a part of me deeply wants them to be hurt, bad, part of me wants karma to hit them hard, put all of them into a deeper, more sad, more painful depression then they put me. And I hate that side of me. 
I just want to know how to get rid of the pain when I can't find closure. When my cousin deflects and ignores every attempt of mine to talk about it, or ask for the truth, when they give me shit for bringing anything up, or my own head getting in the way, worrying about sounding nuts. How do I get over this? How do I get the truth or get them to communicate, or get them to apologize or to understand how much pain they put me through? What do I do? I'm so hurt. How can someone be so selfish that they can be friends with you for 17 years and know you since you were 3 months old, tell you you are their best friend, then literally 2 months later, convince their real best friend to move in with them and ostracize you and completely ignore you. If he were a real friend he would honestly Express his gripes with me, or tell me off, or honestly tell me the problem, but instead he ignores me, even still, but him and his roommate are practically in love. I just dont get how someone can even comprehend being that selfish. If you are best friends with someone, truly, then you don't want them to be hurt constantly, even if you dont like them anymore, even if you hate them, you wouldnt want them to be paranoid and severely depressed for 3-6 months constantly straight. You would still remember the good times, and you would treat them with respect and end it on good terms, or at least be honest to them and vocal, but my cousin was cowardly and is still so. I'm so tired of life. They make me feel so much pain. Idk what to do.

147,"About two years back I met a girl who I’d have an extremely close bond with, both of us were 14 at the time. We’d take time to every single day to talk about how we’re feeling and stuff that’s been going on &amp; on our minds for a few hours. I looked forward to it everyday and it brought a smile to my face, she had a personality that I thought was special.

We got extremely close in the span of 6-7. We held hands, she flirted, i really liked her and thought she didn’t have a crush on me, me oblivious most of the time since I was younger and dumb, but we never acted far on romantic intentions, and she opened up about her own struggles at home with family &amp; her mental health.

Everything was fine until the next school year rolled around. I wasn’t as immature anymore, and I was not a great person compared to the year before because I started experiencing serious family issues which wrecked me mentally. We were fine for those few months, but we slowly drifted apart, we never had time for each other anymore, and we both changed, but we were still on extremely friendly terms.

As the year progressed, I changed into more of an unfriendly person, and I’m guessing I scared her away. It wasn’t until the end of the year where she went “I think you hate me” and I didn’t, so I said that I didn’t but I guess she doesn’t believe me.

The new school year started. We have a class together, and we now are desk partners. We glance at each other but otherwise we act like we are complete strangers and we exchange  the minimal amount of words we need to every day. I felt like she still thinks I don’t like her, so I thought about it for like four hours, and finally sent it, explaining what happened to me, and asking what she thinks of me now. I thought could happen would be that she’d say she hated me or something, and atleast I’d get closure.

I sent the message, and waited. She never replied because I was on delivered for TWELVE hours. I felt rejected so I deleted it. She never opened it, she never replied. 

The next day at school, she kept staring at me, it gave me mixed feelings, because it made me think that she was thinking that I was some weirdo. I feel like she somehow read it, and just never replied.

It really hurts seeing how we are around each other so much. I want to mend it, but I’m sure she doesn’t. I feel like an idiot that I already attempted to fix it and I still want to try again. I took what we had for granted before. Should I just stop and act like we’re strangers again?",29Aug2019,1

153,"Lived with two people the last year and a half. One guy is fine we get along well, the other is kind of annoying. Wakes us up every morning. Plays loud music in the shower at 7am. Will talk as loud as he can on the phone while we’re asleep. Has a work uniform he wears five days a week, but then somehow washes an abundance of clothes every two days. Puts the house-heater on when it’s not cold then goes to his room (I even said he could take my portable heater for his room so he doesn’t get cold. He never took it), he does no chores then gets mad at us when we don’t do ours (like, what?), invites randoms over and doesn’t ever give a heads up. Each of us have spoken to him about it at some point and nothing changes. 

He was primed to move out a few weeks ago because this one guy he absolutely worships like Jesus said he was going to move out. So he told the First Housemate his intention to move (another thing is that he purposefully keeps me out of the loop about everything). Then, a few weeks later the guy he worships said he wasn’t moving, so now he’s saying things like “hey guys why are we doing this? Lol let’s forget it XD”. 

The First Housemate and I decided we’d like to live closer to the city, and we decided it would be so much easier just not having him around and moving in with others. Luckily I have another person I know from uni who’s looking to move out of his place, so the three of us are looking for new places. 

I want to know how to tell the other housemate. The only thing I have in mind is texting “hey man, First Housemate and I are moving out in November, just a heads up so you’re in the loop”, but I know that sounds bad. I just have no idea how to word it properly.

158,"For some context, we used to be best friends for years before we started dating. We connected on levels unknown to us before we dated. Everything was amazing for the first few months. I had already known her family (and they swore up and down we'd date while we were just friends), they adored me. We enjoyed doing the same things, and, being at a similar point in our lives, we did/tried everything together. It was truly my first experience with love. Anyways, to make a long story short, she did some things that made me step back, not realizing she was capable of doing such things. Eventually she became very aloof when we hung out and it felt like the whole thing was forced. I had to end it, and, after being in the friend zone for years, it was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. As of now, we're barely friends and I feel like the only reason we atleast have that is because of our friendship in the past. I.E. there are certain things I would not go to anyone else to share, and vice versa.

&amp;#x200B;

The gist of my problem is the fact that I'm self aware enough to know what I'm doing in thinking about her is a bad idea and I should just move on, hell I'm only 17. But I'm also stupid enough to want to plan to meet her at the nearest starbucks and confess how I feel. I truly believe if I let myself get back into this relationship I'll end up getting hurt again, but I honestly would forfeit my own peace of mind to be with her. Ugh.

Ive always loved pets and thought I could maybe remedy my isolation with an affectionate companion, however my Mom is very against having pets because she thinks they're too messy, expensive, and troublesome (probably due to our previous pair of dogs, which my sisters were responsible for, but ditched most of their duties).

My mom doesn't understand what depression is (which was evident when I had to explain it in its most basic form after I was diagnosed with chronic depression at 18) so I dont think she could see reason.

168,"I will (try) keep this short and digestible: I have a friend who values no longer align with mine, but I don't know how to end the friendship. 

**TL;DR:** I don't know how to end a friendship who I personally deem toxic despite multiple attempts.   
**FULL Context:**  
For the past year, I've hung out with a ""friend"" who can be described as [r/redpill](https://www.reddit.com/r/redpill), and [r/ihavesex](https://www.reddit.com/r/ihavesex) rolled into one. We use to have discussions about sex, girls, social situations, etc. however, I've grown to realize that a lot of his values and traits are either super immature, outright toxic, or creepy/suspicious. Here's my list of problems w/ my friend named ""Bob"":   
a) **Talks about sex in EVERY social situation.** ex. a conversation about a movie turns into Bob banged Dolph Lundgren's daughter.  
b) **Make FREQUENT contradictions/lies**. ex. Bob lied about where he's born, how many siblings he has, his life experiences, how old he is, etc. It changes from day to day.   
c) **Gives TERRIBLE life advice.** ex. Bob told my depressed friend to ""man up"" to his mom, who ends up punching his mom in the face because of said advice.  
d) **BELITTLES everyone to seem better**. ex. Bob will say you don't have this attractive feature like him, so you are deemed ""unattractive""   
e) **NOT ACCEPTING no for an answer.** ex. I told Bob I'm leaving the gym with my friend and I didn't want him to come with us. Ignores what I said, and weasels his way in despite multiples times of me saying NO. 

I have a list of other annoyance such as **spam calls, talking shit behind my back, passive-aggressive jabs, and flat out racist remarks (no satire, no jokes).** 

I don't know what to say to this guy. 

I'm honestly fed up with his bullshit. He acts nice and humble, but he's just obsessed with looks, sex, other people, and trying to better than his own friends. I don't even know if what is a lie and truth at this point... I just see Bob as a person hiding behind a mask. 

I'm secure enough with myself to not let his comments go to head or corrupt my thoughts, but it's pissing me off that he's given terrible advice to people (that has consequences) and lures in my naive friends with the promise of sex and women (which is a whole other can of worms).

174,"So I'm a fresh graduate (May 2019) with a bachelor's degree in computer science. I applied to a whole bunch of places and finally one of them agreed to hire me. The company wants to send me to 10 week of training, after which I will have to work for them for 2 years. They're a contracting company so the whole premise is that they train me up and then rent me out to one of their clients for 2 years. 

The issues I have with this is that 

1) I wont be able to choose where I go. I basically only get one week to move back home, pack all my stuff, and then head out to where ever the client is. I will also need to find an apartment pretty quick as hotel and Airbnb prices can stack up. I can also be relocated multiple times within these 2 years. I don't know how high the chance of that happening is, but it's still a possibility.

2) They pay for the first year is 45k, it's nothing to write home about but it's pretty good for a first job out of college. My problem is that this is a 2 year contract and on the second year they bump you up to 60k which isn't that great for someone in my field. I feel as if I could easily get offered more if I had another job with some experience under my belt.

I've been thinking about this a lot, the due date for signing the contract is on the 4th of September after which training starts. 

My options are to stay with this company, get the training, and go work for them for 2 years. Or I could go back home and work on getting my masters while going back to job hunting. If I can find a job then I can use that as my starting experience instead of using this company. I'll also be able to leave whenever I want and  have a say in where I work.

My family doesn't really get healthy food from the store bc they they wanna save money on cheaper things (though they waste a lot of money on random junk food) and I usually get yelled at if I suggest healthier food. They get fast food every day pretty much and a lot of the time we end up eating fast food every meal. Everyone in my family is fat, even out dogs. Again, my parents don't care and I get yelled at or accused of ""acting up"" for wanting us to be healthier. When I express wanting to lose weight because i am overweight they get an attitude and say something like ""well whose fault is that?"" 

I don't have much time to exercise because my free time mostly goes into school or times like right now lying in bed before sleeping. I've been lowering portion size, I only drink water, and I take yoga at school (i would've taken PE or some other class but my parents made me take yoga bc they claimed they knew I'd get bullied for my body). They're not very encouraging when it comes to my attempts at weight loss yet they've called me fat and told me to go on a diet, etc (which honestly i would if i had any control over the food i could eat). 

My self esteem is destroying me.

I analyze every aspect of their body and what i hate about mine and think like ""if i could switch my body out for any body I'd pick that"" or even not— I've come to constantly focus on other people's looks and I can't even focus in school because I'm always fidgeting and feeling uncomfortable in my fat flesh.

178,"So, I got my first job back in March. I'm 17 years old and at the time was only going to school twice a week for an hour. My work permit states that I may only work 20 hours a week, and Monday-Friday I can only work 4 hours. Due to having 8 hours of homework A DAY due to only going to school 2 hours a week, that means I'm pretty busy. So, up until May when school ended, I only had like 15 hours a week. That was okay with me. It was also okay with me when my hours got bumped up to 25 during my one month of summer in June. 

 However, when school started back up in July I was still working 30 hours a week and being called in on every day off I had. I can barely finish homework, and I'm usually only sleeping 4 hours a night. I've expressed this and my boss didn't really care and continued doing so. I have no idea how he's not getting in trouble with corporate. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, as of last week I handed him my new school schedule that was beginning this week, so I handed him my schedule. I go to school from 10-4 now, and guess what. My hours got lowered to 22. I was okay with it, despite being held back 30 minutes - 1 hour every shift due to the team leader wanting to give someone a lunch break right before I clock out every fucking day. Except for today, I walked into him asking me if I saw the new schedule. I looked, and he added another day and changed my hours for Sunday by moving it up three hours (went from 6 AM to 9 AM). He didn't even bother to ask me, and just casually mentioned he changed the schedule. I'm so fucking stressed out. I can't work this many hours, especially since my classes got bumped up to 6 classes, on top of that 8 hours of homework a day. He schedules me right when I get off school so I'm always late. And he tries to call me in early, which would require me to leave school early.

I explained to her that I don't allow anyone on my PC unsupervised. I've had someone break something in the past without them being able to pay for the item they broke. Everyone knows that my PC is my prized possession. She again questions our trust and claims I have no ""faith"" in her. I recently just moved into my own apartment as well.

She ended up sleeping on it that night. I also noticed that when I came out of the bathroom she was looking through my drawers. She quickly closed it once I saw her. I had work the next morning so I let her sleep in. I texted her and asked her to deflate the mattress before she left. She complained and said, ""B\*\*\*\* you got it out"". I also figured out she used some of my makeup and she used my Airpods while I was at work. I acknowledge that I need to set boundaries and confront her on how I feel. I just don't know how to. I'm too kind and I struggle with standing up for myself. Any advice or opinions would be very appreciated. Thanks!",29Aug2019,1

Where do you all find interesting, educational material to read? I loved learning about anthropology, psychology, cultural studies, learning styles, etc in college, and now that I've graduated, and a few years have passed, I miss it all. I miss the setting. I miss the discussions. I miss being around motivated people. Also, I feel like I'm losing my ability to articulate, and overall communicate like I used to. I miss the feeling of growth that came with studying and learning about different topics. I've heard that MIT allows access to all of their course material but I don't even know where to begin with it. Can any of you relate?

182,"Hi everybody,

A couple of weeks ago, I got blackout drunk and ended up signing up for a bunch of dating sites/premium snapchats with my debit card. Now, I am getting billed a huge amount of money ($35-45) because of the ""subscriptions"". I keep on going onto their websites and terminating the subscriptions, but it seems like once I cancel one, two more pop up. Another huge problem is that I don't remember which sites I signed up for, so I have to wait for my account to get billed in order to try to stop the subscriptions.

188,"Earlier today my girlfriend had told me that she was meeting with a 'nutritionist'. This surprised me because she hadn't mentioned anything about it prior to their meeting and I was a little worried as to why. I asked her if she was okay and why she had met with this person to which she responded that she was starting her ""weight loss journey"". This phrase in particular worried me because I had seen it before. A little before this had happened I had seen a post she had made on facebook about how her friend was looking for people to do work ""from their phone"". I looked into the friends account and found another account that she was friends with that was trying to sign people up to do this work with up to $10,000 bonuses. I quickly assumed it as a pyramid scheme and messaged her about it. I asked if her weight loss journey had anything to do with that. It didn't go too well. She was very defensive at first, we went back and forth for a while. Come to find out that her 'nutritionist', as mentioned before, was with Herbalife and had interested my her in their meal replacement shakes. I told her that it was a scam and that they could be potentially harmful. We have been arguing about it and she has come to the conclusion that I'm not being supportive. I told her from the start that I 100% support her losing weight if she chooses to, but I don't support her doing it through that pyramid scheme. I've been doing my research on what ingredients go into the shakes and I've found mostly negative results, but everytime I try to tell her that they can harmful she says things like ""anyone can write anything on the internet"" and ""you're gonna find stuff if you look for bad stuff"". I can't even say anything about the topic without her getting upset. I don't know what to do.

195,"At a summer workshop, I met someone who is essentially, the male version of me. We have the same exact obscure interests, political opinions, weird mannerisms, and general approach to life. The pull between us is almost magnetic, and we both have discussed that we feel like we have met each other before. I'm not sure what it is I feel towards this person, and neither of us can really figure out what we're supposed to do in this situation. If any of you know what a twin flame is, I'd almost define this relationship under that notion, although we both deny having any romantic feelings for each other. However, on the last night of our workshop, we both escaped and lay on the cold grass under the stars in a distant but nearby field, Neither of us really took in at the time that this is absolutely fucking weird to do with someone you just met. We've discussed a lot of this, and we both acknowledge that we feel this urge that we can't ignore -- that we have to do something about this, and subsequently tried to come up with solutions to this weird feeling we are both experiencing towards one another. To top it all off, there were tons of things in my personal life leading up to this workshop that could have prevented me from meeting this person altogether. There were at least 5 instances where I thought I wouldn't be able to attend the workshop. Meeting this person has honestly made me question everything I believe about destiny, supernatural forces, and the universe itself. What do we do? What is this feeling? Where do we go from here?

197,"I just quit my job working as a one on one aide with a special needs kid. It was $18 an hour which is alright for me. I liked that the jobs was less than 40 hrs a week, and the schedule was nice and I liked having breaks even though they were unpaid. 

But the kid was super out of control, never sat still for a minute, the entire school basically felt sorry for me, and it was a very risky job for me.

It was just really stressful so I felt it was better to quit. But being me, I never searched for a new job because of procrastination, fear, and lack of faith. Now I ran out of all my money, and even though I still live with my family I'm starting to stress out and over eat and I realized the stress at the moment feels worse in a way than working with the kid.

It's weird because living in America I feel safe and blessed, and I think of all the people who make less than $2 and how some of them are happy, but at the same time I'm freaking out. Plus I'm starting to not feel like a human anymore and scared I will lose my friends and opportunities to hang out. (But in reality I've been broke and jobless many times and I've sometimes noticed I get used to it and feel fine and develop better habits in some areas). 

But I do want a job, I enjoyed working, I just dread the job hunting process. Part of me wishes to never have a job and just sacrifice having a house and wife and live easy but I don't want to shut down because maybe I can have a richer life.

I can pursue being a teacher, always liked chemistry and maybe I can get away with teacher basic chemistry but I'm not confident in myself, lack leadership, and afraid brighter kids will eat me alive. But that's the only career I can think of but then again I hear how awful teaching can be, but man getting paid anything above $18 an hour would be amazing to me.

211,"*throwaway for identity/personal reasons 🙃*

If you were in my situation and have multiple job offers, how do you choose which one? Based on pay, benefits and other perks, schedule, prestige/job title? 

I've been working since I was 14 and always just took the first one who offered because I had bills to pay (long story but my foster parents charged me for everything including rides to school, using their laundry machines and showers. Social worker thought it wasn't a big deal since we were  being fed and not beaten lmfao). No matter the pay or how hard the job seemed I just took what I could get.

When I aged out of foster care at 18, I was given a check of a few hundred dollars and sent on my way. My job was a hostess at a chain restaurant , no one would hire me to serve without experience. I was homeless for a bit, sleeping on the all nighter bus and trying to save my money from my job instead of paying a motel. Eventually I got into a shelter. shelters are rough! Especially as an 18 year old female. I don't want to go into details but I ended up having to leave in the middle of the night for my safety. When I came back in the morning all my possessions were gone and the police weren't much help at all. I started couch surfing for a bit until I moved in with a guy I met, who was sweet and generous. Turned out he was a drug dealer and went to prison after only a few months, which left me homeless again since I couldn't afford our apartment by myself. I went back to couch surfing.

That spring, I enrolled in a CSU and majored in business with an accounting option and moved into the dorms (I had okay grades, a C average, plus I was in AVID and being a foster kids helps with the admissions process). I worked as a waitress during school and eventually got an internship with the county. I was placed in the office of agriculture/weights and measures doing admin work. After that internship ended, I wasn't offered a job because they didn't have a permanent opening. I started working at the library during the week after class and waited tables on the weekends. After graduation, I continued those jobs until I kinda got pushed out of the SF Bay Area due to the cost of living. The room I was renting was $1200 with no kitchen access, no guests allowed, and just was super uncomfortable.

So I relocated out of state by accepting a job on coolworks.com as a server/bartender. I was promised a room to rent for $125/week, free food at work and $5/hr plus tips. Well guess what? Every paycheck was wrong and they would pay me only a penny per hour and it would take weeks to get it corrected. And they would give me the difference in cash instead of a check with a stub. And the owners would come in every night 20 mins before closing to eat and get drunk. When it came time to pay they would never tip. The housing had a roach and beetle infestation and our windows were busted so we had to use blankets to keep the cold air from coming in. one of my coworkers/roommates was an alcoholic cook who showed up to work so drunk that he fell asleep on the line and burned his hand. Instead of getting help for his burnt ass hand, he went to the bar and grabbed a bottle of wine. He drank the whole thing and fell asleep! We were looking for him for almost an hour until we found him 🤦‍♂️ Then my other coworker/roommate got drunk and verbally attacked our other roommate and called her racial slurs and threatened to rape her. He was arrested but at that point I was ready to get far away from there.

I left there and settled in Las Vegas. I've been here 2 weeks and found my own studio and have been going on interviews. I applied to 68 jobs and so far had 8 interviews and 5 job offers. More places contact me everyday which makes it even harder to make a decision. I have a few months of living expenses saved up plus a credit card for emergencies so I could technically hold out for a little bit but I also generally enjoy working and am ready to get back to it.

Right Now I have like 5 different companies who have sent me solid job offers via mail/email and need me to complete background checks and drug screening. I don't want to make the wrong decision. Seems like such a basic question but I never had anyone really teach me this and I don't have any older, more experienced people to ask or any type of guidance. I just feel like my decision making skills aren't the best and I don't have anyone to turn to for this type of advice so I that brings me here :)

1. Executive assistant $18/hr at Gentleman's club. crazy hours, some days graveyard, some 7am-2pm. The job includes not only admin work but also basic accounting work and doing stuff the managers can't get to including auditions, ordering furniture that break like broken lockers and poles, chairs and glasses for the bar as well as ushering ""entertainers"" out of the building when they get terminated. It's a 30 min bus ride from my house and I get to wear what I want. It's considered one of the higher end clubs in the city if that means anything

2. Call center agent $9/hr , 9-5pm, full time with benefits. Taking inbound calls from ppl who need assistance with the federal student loan forgiveness programs. 1 hr bus ride from my house. Business casual dress and the quota is 2 sales a day. After 5 a week, I get a commission off each ""sale"" that I make. If I don't make quota I could lose my job? The management does seem like it would be typical call center shenanigans though. For instance, during the second interview I overheard someone cursing someone else out because they ate their lunch.

3. Bartender at a resort $12/hr plus tips, no benefits but comes with dorm-style housing at $70 biweekly. I obviously have no choice on who I get to share a room with but my current rent is $600 a month so I would be saving money. I am afraid though because living in the dorms was hard and crazy so I am hesitant to live with strangers again.

4. Financial Operations Clerk $16/hr at a local credit union. Full time with benefits. Behind the scenes finance stuff like processing overnight mail transactions, ensuring transactions are posted correctly, remote deposit capture review (reviewing mobile deposits). This one was appealing to me because I think it would be nice to have a non-customer facing job even though I don't mind it. let's be real, after a certain amount of time you need a break from customers. The only issue would be they are asking for a credit check. Mine is terrible :(

5. Teller at check cashing store $14/hr and is right across the street from my apartment, so no having to take the bus or take uber/lyft. Full time with benefits. No set schedule. Does have sales quotas for payday loans though and I am assuming there could be some safety issues because there's bullet proof windows and a man-trap to get in.

Any advice, tips would be appreciated. I want a job where I can stay for a while, get on my feet financially and will look good on a resume. I want some type of stability for once on my life. I'm sick of moving around and job hopping.",29Aug2019,1

I figured she was cute and by the end of the shift I worked up the courage to ask for her number. My friends had separated themselves from me and her friends left a bit early and I saw her come down the hallway a bit later. The conversation went a little something like this:

My parents relationship: Ever since my step dad had entered my life at the age of 4 I have witnessed many, many arguments between my parents. All ranging from different things. It seems like they have fights every other week.

Their fights can be really ugly. A lot of things are said (yelled or screamed) about each other, insults are thrown and accusations are made.  My father bottles up his anger until he blows, and my mom yells and is angry most days.

PJ and AJ and I know very well that their relationship is VERY toxic, and we have all agreed that we'd very much like them to have a divorce rather than stay and torture us and this dysfunctional family.

KAY NOW WE MAY BEGIN.

Between 14 and 15 I had found texts between my mother and unknown guys who aren't her husband. I remember that I found this one guy and went as far as deleting their messages and blocking his number. I didn't confront my mother and thought nothing of it. Forward to where I was 16 and I find that she is talking to ANOTHER MAN in a different country and my sister PJ also found out about this. 

It was an emotional affair nothing more than I know of, but  I DID confront her about it, and she continued to call, face time, and text even after my sister and I talked to her about it. But it stopped for reasons unknown to me.

I have allowed this to happen because my mom deserves better. What I am telling on Reddit isn't the full story or the full extent to what I've seen and been in, or what my step father does and acts.

For the past few months my mother has lost a significant amount of weight, and has started working again because of financial issues with my step father and his ex-wife.

I thought this was great! My mom is finding new confidence she's happier than she is angry lately, everything is going great.

My sister PJ and I were confronted from our littler sister AJ that she had  found texts messages between her friend, where she then finds that our mother has had a physical affair with multiple men and will be doing it again.

Now my sister PJ and I really don't care what our mother does, and we both don't care for our step-father in a father-daughter way anymore. We have both seen that our mom deserves to be treated better, treated with respect and fairness and to be loved and not be put through my step father past drama and issues.

But AJ is disappointed and mad at our mother, and I am devastated that she had even found out. AJ is definitely a daddy's girl, and the relationship between our mom and her isn't the greatest.

I had never thought my mom would have an affair, I didn't think that she would lie about her job and go to meet these men to have sex.

As sisters we have decided that I will confront our mother sometime next week when everyone is at school and my step dad is at school.

So what I am asking is advice on how to approach my mom.

She can get angry, she will accuse and hate AJ for snooping through her phone and personal life, and she might lie about this, but if she doesn't lie she will definitely play this as a one time thing.

TDLR; My mom is cheating, my younger sister has found out, don't know how to approach my mom and not sure how this will end between my step dad and her.",29Aug2019,1

216,I currently am 18f and weigh 210 pounds. I have never hated myself more. I can see my dad becoming angrier with me that I'm not losing weight.

217,"Ever since I graduated I am not the same person who I used to be. I graduated 4.0 had a job and was overall successful in that department. I had an awakening that I really was miserable and don't amount to anything. 

I don't have a job anymore I had to move in back to my dad house. I stopped taking care of myself and scraping by in college. Since I have no job it seems everything is my fault. I dont have a drivers  license or good credit because my dad says im too immature to have either. He tells me regularly or explodes on me because I have no job. 

Now that I have college classes I can't get a full time job like I want too because i wanted to expand my resume and move up. There is nothing like that where  I live. There is fast food and factory jobs and im limited because I have no car no buses in my area or friends that can take me. 

Im deadset on getting some type of part time job while Im competing my degree. I just don't want to live with my dad anymore. Im constantly being reminded im worthless in some type of way. Sometimes I being woken up to him yelling on the top of his lungs because something pissed him off. 
He wants me to open up but I am not comfortable when 90% hes tired and is easily set off by anything.

We talked today about how I don't want to live here anymore. He says he understand how I feel but he keeps saying "" I was depressed too but I got over it, I was jobless too"" Within the same conversation he tells me its my fault I don't want a fast food job that im a princess with insignificant problems. I can't handle living in the real world. When I had lived by myself just fine for a little bit. 

I would rather be homeless and depend on myself just so I can prove him wrong, but more so its annoying to hear I can't deal with being an adult. He says he knows I am constantly told off but I need to grow up. 

Is it wrong to say I don't want to live in a toxic environment. I know my dad means well and I haven't been the best because I am a shut in who has 0 drive in life. But I know im shit. I just don't to be yelled at  anymore. My brother is a shut in too. He does a lot of mistakes too. but he has a job. He never gets yelled at. Sometimes he makes mistakes and I get yelled at for it. I get yelled at for being a shut in. but He literally in the same fucking position as me. 


The only reason I havent been homeless or found myself a place to live is because I have a dog. She is my reposonibltiy and I don't want to risk her well being, but because of that I am not able to live in low income housing because they dont allow pets. I have a boyfriend but I don't want to be a bother to him and his family as well as my friends.

220,"Today I had a very complicated and severe case of fraud in my checking account - let’s call this account A. The amount of stolen information was so in depth that the best course of action was to open a new checking account (account B)  and close account A. My banker originally tried transferring my balance from A to B, but because we locked A from having withdrawals, the only option would be to transfer the money with “tickets” - whatever that means - and it will be available in B tomorrow morning. However, when I arrived home and looked at my account online, account A shows the expected balance that will be transferred tonight, but account B shows a cash deposit at the bank equal to the amount being transferred from A. Essentially, the bank (mistakenly) did a cash deposit into account A but didn’t take it out of account B. When the transfer posts tonight, in the morning account A will be empty and account B will have double the amount of money as it theoretically should. What should I do about this, considering it’s “supposedly” a cash deposit from one of my accounts to the other. It’s not like it’s someone else’s check that was accidentally put into my account.

227,"\**throwaway account because I know lots of ppl don't like sob stories and I don't want this traced back to my normal account. The main reason for all the text is to give some background so you understand why I am so anxious and kind of scared about this decision*\*

\&amp;nbsp;

**If you were in my situation and have multiple job offers, how do you choose which one? Based on pay, benefits and other perks, schedule, prestige/job title?** 

\&amp;nbsp;

I've been working since I was 14 and always just took the first one who offered because I had bills to pay (long story but my foster parents charged me for everything including rides to school, using their laundry machines and showers. Social worker thought it wasn't a big deal since we were  being fed and not beaten lmfao). No matter the pay or how hard the job seemed I just took what I could get.

\&amp;nbsp;

When I aged out of foster care at 18, I was given a check of a few hundred dollars and sent on my way. My job was a hostess at a chain restaurant , no one would hire me to serve without experience. I was homeless for a bit, sleeping on the all nighter bus and trying to save my money from my job instead of paying a motel. Eventually I got into a shelter. shelters are rough! Especially as an 18 year old female. I don't want to go into details but I ended up having to leave in the middle of the night for my safety. When I came back in the morning all my possessions were gone and the police weren't much help at all. I started couch surfing for a bit until I moved in with a guy I met, who was sweet and generous. Turned out to be a drug dealer and went to prison after only a few months, which left me homeless again since I couldn't afford the apartment by myself. I went back to couch surfing.

\&amp;nbsp;

That spring, I enrolled in a CSU (California state university) and majored in business with an accounting option and moved into the dorms (I had okay grades, a C average, plus I was in AVID and being a foster kid helps with the admissions process and financial aid). I worked as a waitress during school and eventually got an internship with the county. I was placed in the office of agriculture/weights and measures doing admin work. After that internship ended, I wasn't offered a job because they didn't have a permanent opening. I started working at the library during the week after class and waited tables on the weekends instead. After graduation, I continued those jobs until I kinda got pushed out of the SF Bay Area due to the cost of living. The room I was renting was $1200 with no kitchen access, no guests allowed, only one 20 mins shower allowed a day and just was super uncomfortable.

\&amp;nbsp;

So I relocated out of state by accepting a job on [coolworks.com](http://coolworks.com/) as a server/bartender. I was promised a room to rent for $125/week, free food at work and $5/hr plus tips. Well guess what? Every paycheck was wrong and they would pay me only a penny per hour and it would take weeks to get it corrected. And they would give me the difference in cash instead of a check with a stub. And the owners would come in every night 20 mins before closing to eat and get drunk. When it came time to pay they would never tip. The housing had a roach and beetle infestation and our windows were busted so we had to use blankets to keep the cold air from coming in. one of my coworkers/roommates was an alcoholic cook who showed up to work so drunk that he fell asleep on the line and burned his hand. Instead of getting help for his burnt ass hand, he went to the bar and grabbed a bottle of wine. He drank the whole thing and fell asleep again! We were looking for him for almost an hour until we found him knocked out in the storage room🤦‍♂️Then my other coworker/roommate got drunk and verbally attacked our other roommate and called her racial slurs and threatened to rape her. He was arrested but at that point I was ready to get far away from there.

\&amp;nbsp;

I left there and settled in Las Vegas. I've been here 2 weeks. At first I was sleeping on the couch of a girl I know from college but now I am renting a room. I applied to 68 jobs and so far had 8 interviews and 5 job offers. More places contact me everyday which makes it even harder to make a decision.

\&amp;nbsp;

Right Now I have like 5 different companies who have sent me solid job offers via mail/email and need me to complete background checks and drug screening. I don't want to make the wrong decision. Seems like such a basic question but I never had anyone really teach me what to look for and I don't have any older, more experienced people to ask or any type of guidance. I just feel like my decision making skills aren't the best and I don't have anyone to turn to for this type of advice so I that brings me here :)

\&amp;nbsp;

1. **Executive assistant $18/hr at Gentleman's club**. crazy hours, some days graveyard, some 7am-2pm. The job includes not only admin work but also basic accounting work and doing stuff the managers can't get to including auditions, ordering furniture that break like broken lockers and poles, chairs and glasses for the bar as well as ushering ""entertainers"" out of the building when they get terminated. It's a 30 min bus ride from my house and I get to wear what I want. It's considered one of the higher end clubs in the city if that means anything
2. **Call center agent $9/hr plus commission**, 9-5pm, full time with benefits. Taking inbound calls from ppl who need assistance with the federal student loan forgiveness programs. 1 hr bus ride from my house. Business casual dress and the quota is 2 sales a day. After 5 a week, I get a commission off each ""sale"" that I make. If I don't make quota I could lose my job? The management does seem like it would be typical call center shenanigans though. For instance, during the second interview I overheard someone cursing someone else out because they ate their lunch.
3. **Bartender at a resort (back in CA) $12/hr plus tips**, no benefits but comes with dorm-style housing at $70 biweekly. I obviously have no choice on who I get to share a room with but my current rent is $600 a month so I would be saving money. I am afraid though because living in the dorms was hard and crazy so I am hesitant to live with strangers again.
4. **Financial Operations Clerk $16/hr at a local credit union**. Full time with benefits. Behind the scenes finance stuff like processing overnight mail transactions, ensuring transactions are posted correctly, remote deposit capture review (reviewing mobile deposits). This one was appealing to me because I think it would be nice to have a non-customer facing job even though I don't mind it. let's be real, after a certain amount of time you need a break from customers. The only issue would be they are asking for a credit check. Mine is terrible :(
5. **Teller at check cashing store $14/hr** and is right across the street from my apartment, so no having to take the bus or take uber/lyft. Full time with benefits. No set schedule. Does have sales quotas for payday loans though and I am assuming there could be some safety issues because there's bullet proof windows and a man-trap to get in.

234,"TL:DR at the end.

So okay. I have this friend, I’ll call her Rose. Rose and I have known each other and been best friends since kindergarten. Nothing has ever come between us, I think previously we had like one disagreement and it was literally like the smallest thing ever and we were upset for like ten minutes. We’re in senior year now. And holy hell I was hoping my last year would be somewhat easy. Nope. Over the summer, things went to shit. So she was dating this guy, who I’ll call August, for two years. Previously to like about two months before the year ended, I never really met him or anything like that. But she introduced me to him because she thought we would make good friends, and I’m glad we did because he’s like the only good thing that’s happened to me now in the past several months.

So pretty much now here’s the issue. As I started to hangout with them both together, I saw their relationship. It wasn’t good. Picking fights with him over everything, constantly accusing him of wanting other girls, expecting him to buy her everything no matter what never asking just expecting, never doing anything he ever wanted, only what she ever wanted. The list goes on. Naturally, he wasn’t happy. He had actually broken up with her previously to this and got back with her because she convinced him it would be different. He opened up to me about everything and how he felt and just literally everything. I saw a man in need and I wanted to help him. It got to a point in which it was decently clear that the relationship wasn’t getting any better ever, obviously leaving only one option. But he wasn’t sure what he yet wanted to do, so for the next few weeks him and I continue talking and I listen to him and say what I think about things and all that. It got to a point in which he realized he had to break up with her. And so he did.

She gets very upset with me. Upset because I helped him, upset because she said I betrayed her, upset at everything. As I see it, I helped someone who needed help and provided my friendship to someone who needed a friend. I don’t feel like I did anything wrong. Did I? He wasn’t happy and he was lost and I helped him. Rose was my best friend for my whole life essentially but I saw part of her I never saw before and it was destroying someone and nobody deserves that. I had tried to talk to her about the things I noticed several times but she never changed anything about it. I was not the cause of their relationship falling apart, she was. And I picked someone back up that she pushed down. 

She kept talking about how we were best friends for so long and I was a brother to her and then went and picked August over her. And you know what at this point I certainly have because I was pushed away by everything she was saying and doing and what saw her doing with him. But it certainly wasn’t that way at first. I helped someone who needed help. And then she kept saying things like why didn’t I stand up for her when he was “talking shit” about her, said “shit” being all true things like the fact he said she was manipulative and she sure as hell is. But she’ll never admit that. Everything she keeps saying makes me feel like an awful fucking person when all I was doing originally was trying to help someone that was in need of help and someone to listen to him. But am I a bad person? Am I really? I didn’t feel like I was but I keep being made to feel like am a horrible person for “taking his side”. For befriending someone who was “awful to her”. Which by the way he was great. Not to say anyone is perfect, but he tried so hard to work through shit for two years and he loved her so much and at some point planned on one day marrying her because he saw the person she could be if she tried but she never would. 

Also another fun detail is that now she is dating who was his best friend for six years. And not a single thing was said to August about it until yesterday because I found out and told him. Needless to say he isn’t very happy about that. And less even the fact that he’s dating her, just that who he thought was his best friend didn’t tell him he was dating his ex. Then because I told August about this, Rose gets mad because I had no right to tell him that and he doesn’t need to know everything she is doing. Though I told him not because of her, but because of who it was.

And this all comes down to another shit issue. Like I said, we were best friends since kindergarten and nothing ever got between us. Who could have seen this happening. At the end of the year last year, when we were picking classes for our senior year, we picked all the same classes, not only because we were best friends, but just in general we like the same things. So we are in all of each other’s classes and alphabetically we are near each other in them all too. And I don’t fucking know what to do. I was hoping for a decent last year of high school. Wish I knew what was going to happen beforehand.

The only good thing that came out of this is August. We’ve only known each other for a few months, but we have become very close really quick and he is like seriously a brother to me. And just in general I’m so happy to have him in my life.

237,"So I've recently made a promise to stay off drugs, with the exception of weed and alcohol. Over the past few weeks I've noticed that alot of what me and my friends would do together (consciously or not) would revolve around drugs. I've known them all for years now and it's just strange to have a new outsider's perspective on what the group is like. I get a weird mix of feelings about this, part of me feels sorry for them, but drugs are so heavily rooted in everybody's connection it'd be laughed at to suggest sobriety( That's the other thing, I don't want to come off as if I'm condemning them for their own choices, I don't have an issue with drugs, I'm just not taking part anymore). A small part of me wants to run away from all that, but maybe I'm just being dramatic, after all, they're all I've really had and got for a stable group of friends. I do really like them all too, so I don't want to abandon them. I've spent alot of the time at recent parties sleeping because I can't pull off 3-day benders without some sort of stimulant. All in all I'm just confused as to what the best outcome would be as I don't want to effect my relationship with everyone. Any advice appreciated, Thanks!",29Aug2019,1
240,"I (20m) started seeing someone this summer (20nb). Everything was great and on like the third date they told me they still see their ex. I didn’t mind at the time bc we weren’t anything serious. As the summer progressed we got closer and I fell for them but I didn’t realize when they meant see their ex they meant date. We went to an amusement park and their ex was there with friends and we stopped and talked to them and my heart dropped. That was like a bone crushing feeling and idk why. I didn’t tell the though and continued seeing them and a few weeks ago we decided to be in a polyamorous relationship. They told me they want to continue seeing their ex(which I guess makes them not their ex) and someone else I know. They then asked if I wanted to know about their other partners and if they see people and I said yeah. Idk I just want to know like if they are not the details. Their response was something along the lines of I’ll see p1,p2 a lot so I don’t think you want to hear about every time I’m with them but I’ll inform you of new people. I agreed, I felt better about that. I’ve been doing a lot of reading about polyamory and self analysis and I think I would enjoy poly. The only thing is one day everything makes sense I understand the need for multiple partners, I understand they make them happy, I understand that I can’t be their everything and I don’t want to be but I get this like sinking all consuming feeling sometimes when I think about them being with the other people they see. We’re about two months almost three into all this now It was kind of jarring but I agreed. I don’t think it’s jealousy, I think I just get really anxious and I don’t know how to stop it. I want them to be happy and I’m so happy with them I just wish I could stop feeling so anxious. I had a nightmare that I saw them and one of their partners hanging out and they saw me and I ran. I don’t know what this means. I really want to maintain the understanding I have sometimes and not the dreadful anxious feeling I get. I care about them a lot but I don’t think I’m in love with them. I like taking care of people and being there for people and in return I don’t really know what I want or need. I think it’s bc there was so little to do thi summer I spent so much time with that I have this idea that I want them to be mine. I think I’m also scared they’ll leave me but that’s inevitable so I don’t know why I’m so anxious. I have no one to talk to about this and I don’t think I’m ready to tell them all of this yet. We talked about it a little but I didn’t address all my concerns bc were on opposite sides of the country rn and I think a text about it would be a little jarring. I’m really happy with them, and I want them to be happy to so I want them to continue relationships with other people that make them happy but I don’t want to feel miserable and anxious when I think about it. I just want to fix whatever it is in me that gets really sad about hearing them talk about their other partners and them being with other people. I definitely think I’ll explore dating other people too but for some reason they’re different and with them I have this like anxiety surrounding how they feel about me. It’s going to be a very short lived relationship regardless bc in January they are leaving the country and we’ve already agreed that we don’t want to do long distance but for now I want to be comfortable and happy for them and with them. They are one of the most amazing people I have met, I’ve never meet anyone like them before. I think I just get really attached to people when they express interest on me and I do everything I can to ensure they won’t leave but that’s not how I really feel about this I don’t think. There’s something different about to bc I know they’re going to leave and it’s going to be short lived but I just get a sinking feeling knowing they love other people. I’ve read the articles about how loving more than one person doesn’t mean they don’t love you and sometimes I feel great and enlightened and happy (yesterday) and today I had that nightmare and now I feel afraid and sad. I don’t think to highly of myself but I’m not comparing myself to their other partners so idk what’s happening. I’m not sure if I’m jealous maybe a little but I just want to stop being anxious about it. I just want to spend the little time I have left with them happily and worry free. I haven’t explored dates yet really, I’ve hung out with people but I don’t think they were dates (I’m a little oblivious to things and I never make assumptions about stuff I literally have to be told directly) . It was nice and I was happy and I really like making people feel happy and comfortable. I just want to learn how to manage this drop in feeling and how to not be constantly in contact with them and be ok. I think about them a lot and idk I feel like it’s too much. Were college students and when the semester starts well both be really busy so I’m hoping having something else to focus on will help alleviate the downward spiral that comes with overthinking about them. I’m sorry this is so long but I just need help and understanding and tips bc I want this to work. I’ve been in a monogamous relationship and it wasn’t horrible but I like being with other people romantically and they weren’t ok with that. I’ve always had this image of being someone’s main partner but us both seeing other people and at the end of the day and half of the time it being us so I don’t understand why when I get the chance my brain freaks out. My ideal relationship is probably a closed triad but if I can’t even handle seeing my partner with their other partners or talking about them idk wtf I’m gonna do. I need to work on something but I don’t know what exactly or how. Like all the pieces are there but I can’t see what it is. I struggle with depression and anxiety and I’m currently not on meds so maybe getting back on some will help. Please give me your best advice.

Tl;dr I fell for someone who’s polyamorous and I’ve been wanting to try being poly bc monogamy doesn’t really work for me. Now that I have the opportunity to with this amazing person my brain goes from complete understanding to anxious mess who overthinks everything. I need help on how to stop the anxiety or what I need to work on.",29Aug2019,1
241,"Hey guys. 
In my state (Massachusetts) child support no longer has to he paid after the age of 18, but my biological father owes so much ($60k) that he'll likely be paying forever, despite me currently being 19.
The issue here being my mother, and possibly my understanding of how child support works. My mother keeps the money in a separate bank account, and moves certain amounts of it into my account if she approves of the purchase. 
I thought that this money was mine, and she wouldnt have the right to tell me what I can or cant buy. For example, when I tried to buy my new glasses, it came from my pocket. 
Is it my money, or hers to choose what i do with?
And if its rightfully mine, what's the best way of broaching this with her?

As the last woman was getting in, the driver started driving and the woman fell pretty hard on the street. I was behind them on a narrow residential street. I got out of my car, helped the woman and her friends and yelled at the driver. I thought the rule of thumb was to wait until your passengers are in the car, seatbelts fastened and all doors closed before moving. This guy had the audacity to say he couldn’t hear anything because the ladies were all talking. The women were then taking care of their friend. When they asked if she was ok she just kept saying “I don’t really know.” Seemed confused, but got in the car with her friends. I had to get back in my car but I took a photo of the plates.

In the past year what I thought my “friends” and I started experimenting with weed. It went good for about 6 months until my friends started dealing. Another close friend of mine got caught  by his parents and I realized being associated with drugs was not my path and I wanted out. 

My friends who have always pushed me around and picked on me then threatened me. They started shipping drug paraphernalia to my address. At first I went along with it. I was not only angered that I was not being compensated for this but blackmailed as well. My @sshole friends had plenty of videos of me doing weed and threatened to expose them to my parents and the whole school along with the principal (keep in mind I am a straight A student trying to realign myself on the right path). They started putting MY NAME on packages to be shipped to my address. I had had enough and confronted them. My “friends”, who have dark web dealings, threatened to ship illegal firearms to my house under my name. I blocked them on all social media and haven’t been in contact since. It’s been 12 hours and I’m scared for my life. 

I have no clue what to do at this point. Should I just move on? These illegal packages are on their way to my address at this very moment. Just I keep them and hide them? Is there any way I can plead them to stop?

The surgeon has an opening 8 days before classes start. If I don't do it then, I would have to wait until winter break. The surgery has a recovery time of 1-5 weeks. Mostly no lifting, twisting, aerobic exercise or staying in one position (sitting or standing) for more than 30 mins. So I would have to stand up during class to stretch and getting from class to class on time might be difficult.  

I am hesitant, however, to put it off because I am dealing with chronic pain. Although I have dealt with pain for many years, the idea of putting up with it even for four months now that I have an end in sight is daunting.

She feels like no one would ever ask her to homecoming, so I want to make it special, not just some poster board asking her to homecoming, but I don’t know to much about her. My knowledge stops at her appearance, general personality, and that I know she bakes. I just need ideas to make her feel special when I know only general stuff about her. This is a private school, so everyone knows each other, so I know as much about her as everyone else does, so that I know she bakes isn’t so special.

253,"Forgive the provocative title, but it's an accurate summary of my dilemma. I'm typing this under the influence of post-nut shame so keep that in mind if I sound dramatic or extreme.

I guess really what I'm wondering is if it's healthy to be a cuck. Normally, I'm of opinion that a person should not be ashamed of their fetishes but in this case I feel like the cuckoldry may actually be eroding my dignity and making me undesirable.

I get off on the fact that another man of superior quality is taking what I cannot, and I believe this is a reflection of my insecurities. My theory on cuckholding (at least in my case) is that I deep down believe myself to be unworthy of the women in my life, so I find it more gratifying for them to be pleased by a better man, all the while demeaning me. I would think that feeding this mindset in any shape or way is not healthy because it only reinforces my inferiority complex. On the other hand, is it possible that cuckholding is a healthy outlet to this complex, allowing it to be released in a relatively harmless way?

Even if that were the case, I find it hard to believe that being a cuck could in any context be better than not being a cuck. Would it not be better to try to overcome my insecurities in a different way, and rise up to become the imaginary buff alpha bull that's fucking my gf right now?? 

I suppose when it comes down to it, I'm just confused. I want the perspective of both ducks and non-cucks.",29Aug2019,1

255,"I grew up celebrating halloween every year. I used to have actual friends and would throw good parties for halloween and was known for them. I always looked forward to it. For me it was one of the best days in the year. And in my country november 1st is a holiday so i wouldnt have school the next day. Perfect. But...that all got ruined...last year i stopped going to religion class after my teacher publicly shamed me for celebrating it and forced the other kids to do the same. (Not kidding she tols them to write whats wrong with me). So after my parents freaked and complained to the principal he allowed me to drop the class. But...my class never forgot...everyone kept messaging me rude things and general cyberbullying. This was my 2nd school and i switched from my last one cause of bullying and i couldnt handle it. When halloween came i had 0 friends so i didnt invite anyone. One guy posted a story where he said “*my name* kill yourself by jumping of a building singing *random dumb song we learned*”. The video was taken AT A HALLOWEEN PARTY with a few kids who bullied me and wrote that im cursed, retarded and demonic because i celebrate halloween. 
I should note that my country is 95% catholic but. My mum is an ex religion teacher and a person who regularly goes to church and raised me and my sister to be catholic, shes the whole reason we celebrate halloween because she likes it and says its fine.

256,"TL;DR: I went out on a few dates with a girl I really like and we had fun. Recently she has been using every excuse in the book to stop going out on dates, and I'm not sure if she's just really busy or maybe she just doesn't want to see me anymore.

I've thought about this a lot recently and it's really been eating at me. To set the stage a bit, I'm a guy in high school with a relatively small group of friends. I'm a pretty normal guy, a slight touch of emo maybe. I've never had a girlfriend before. I'm pretty much average all around. I've had a few crushes in my lifetime, but it's just the usual suspects (blondes, hourglass body, you get it). 

I met this girl about 10 months ago in wrestling. Yeah, she wrestles. That's so badass right? Oh, and she's a technician at Valvoline, a varsity swimmer (with school records), and a guitarist. In other words, this is someone I would never think I'd have a chance with. Anyways, we had gotten to know each other after a while, discovering we have a lot of the same interests, the same taste in music, and I just really love her personality. She hangs around a good crowd, and her friends and family are all awesome. I've met her parents, and they know and accept that I like their daughter. I've never kissed her or anything. Hell, I've never even held her hand. 

The first time we even hung out together was when she wanted to see a movie with me. I wasn't really ""into her"" at the time, so I agreed to see a movie with her and didn't think much of it. Soon after, we started talking more. Like, a lot more. It wasn't long before I started to really like her. We've known each other for about 7 months at this point. It was one night when we were texting on snapchat that I decided to just ask her out on a date. I called her and just let her know that I liked her, and that I thought we should go out on a date together some time. She agreed. Things were going perfect.

Every week or so for the next month or two, we had gone out on a date. My cash flow was running dry, but I didn't really care. I just wanted to have a really good time with this girl. I can honestly say that some of my best memories have been with her. We did the most random shit, and I still think about it all. Trying on stupid outfits at the mall, going to guitar center to scout out my first guitar, staying up late and debating which 80's rock bands were better.

At some point after a while, we had a conversation in which I asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend. I told her exactly how I felt about her. I poured my heart out to her. She is the perfect girl, and I told her that. She told me that she wants to go out on more dates before that happens, there's a lot she still wants to know. I respected that and understood. We had known each other for 9 months.

We went out on even more dates after that, and always had a really good time. However, some time after the last one is when I suspect her feelings could have changed. I don't know what could have set it off, what I could have done wrong. She just stopped wanting to hang out. everything just stopped. I haven't been out on a date with her in a month. I've tried to set things up a week in advance, but it's always ""we'll see what happens."" And then it never happens. she always says she's working, and when she's not working, she's doing something with her family. We said we were going to go to guitar center so she could help me pick out a guitar. I've always wanted to learn. I have the money for it and she knows I want her to do that with me, but she's never available. I asked her earlier in the week if she wanted to hang out on Thursday, and she said she's free. Now she apparently has to work.

I don't want to believe that she doesn't want to see me anymore, I just wish she knew how I felt. We both know hearts can change. I just want to know why, or what I did to make her stop talking to me. I just want honest opinions.",29Aug2019,1
257,"Here's the background story:

My family and I are Arizona natives. Born and Raised in Hell (well, it feels like it anyway). We recently moved back to this hot hole 4 months ago after living in gorgeous green Virginia for the last 5 years. I (F31) worked as a server and my fiance (M34) was a shift manager for pizza hut. 

We missed our family. My fiance hadn't been out to visit in 5 years and I got to visit once in that timeframe to attend my grandpa's funeral.

So we came back! 

Here's the thing:

We hate it. It's miserably hot. My two kids (F7, M5) hate it and beg to go back to our old house in VA) 

We thought moving out here would help us financially. We moved in with my fiance's grandma and helped her clear out her house (borderline call the hoarder show). We only have one car, so part of our plan here was to get another and save for a down payment on a house. We were planning to live with grandma for a year at least and go from there. Longer if necessary. 

The shittiest kicker was that I found out the very same day i arrived back home in AZ that my dad wasn't doing so well. He had gotten a diagnosis for a rare cancer and they were in the hospital the 4 days we were traveling so they didnt tell us while we were driving so we didnt get stressed. So there's that. It will be an important piece of information in a few minutes. 

So far, nothing has gone to plan here, but when does it ever? I transferred my serving position and started right away, within the first 3 weeks of being back in AZ. We kept trying to get caught up on our car payments (currently 3 behind) and things just kept racking up since I was the only one working. My fiance recently found a job and so we just got his 2nd paycheck to hopefully start moving things along and in that time frame my lame job really cut back my hours, and i hadn't worked in a week and a half. 

I moved back home to make and save money not lose out and stress! 

So, I'm the type where I just cant sit on my thumbs and not work so I called up my old boss and got a job back with her. It's another serving position but they are offering me more hours so, hello! I'm there. (Finished training early and first shift is tomorrow)

Things are looking up now, I got 2 jobs (technically 1 and an eighth of a job LOL) and my fiance has income coming in as well so in a few weeks we should be caught up on our bills and actually start the saving process. 

The catch: 

The last couple weeks my fiance's old boss and district manager kept contacting and mentioning that he could have been running his own store as a general manager if he had just held on a little more in VA. That he should come back and work that position. 

Some time has passed between mentionings and today they were saying they needed to fill some big district manager shoes and the current district manager wants HIM to take the position, but he has to be a general store manager for at least 2 years. They are offering him a 50K salary job plus if he takes it, they'll give him 1200 to put towards a house/place to live for moving. 

The problem here is this:

I wanna go back because I love Virginia and didnt wanna leave, except for my family in AZ. I found out my dad has cancer. I feel like I lost so much time already with everyone I loved, including my grandpa who passed suddenly during the time I was gone. All of that feels stolen from me And I really regret it. 

But the timing isnt right for me to just go back right away. And...We have kids. Since the fiance worked night shift, I was the primary parent. I made all the doc appts, took them to the appts, the school meetings, I did the homework and projects and dinner and showers ect...while he was working.  Naturally they want to spend more time with dad because they didnt see him as much. 

So...IF he were to take this position back in Virginia, we were thinking that he would take the kids with him. While I stayed in Arizona and just worked/saved money and stayed close to my dad, who I hope recovers and gets better...(PS...he does have my mom...but I wanted to clarify. I wouldnt be a caregiver....I just want to stay close)

There would be some kinks we would have to iron out like the store location, hours ect. (Theres some of his family closer to one location vs nobody in the other location). Who would pick them up from school ect...

And this isnt a hop on a plane tomorrow thing either. They want him to take the position even if it's another year before he can. We want to try and get another car at least or the money to get one while he is out there first...

Maybe I could go back to college while i have more time so I could get a different type of job? 

Theres pros and cons to this situation.

recently i got my first part time job, well the training part of it. The manager was extremely nice and worked around my schedule for me, changed the schedule twice just for me. I had my training two days ago, i liked the work, but not the hygiene. During my training my coworker had me wipe down tables, trash cans, counters, and the inside of a blender. Nothing wrong with that, except it was all with the same rag. We took out the trash, came back in, they didn’t wash their hands and went on to make smoothies. After work we out watery rug on eating tables. I know i shouldn’t be complaining since it’s my first job, But i really don’t wanna work at a place that treats their customers like this, I felt really disgusted and guilty. I know a lot of fast food restaurants are unclean, but after asking my other friends who also work at fast food, they advices me to quit. If i want to quit i have 2 days to quit before my first official day begins. My biggest fear is that if i quit i won’t be able to find another job.

The only thing, I can't help but to think that deep down this would bother my brother, even though he is now married with kids.

Is it wrong to be with her or considered disrespectful towards him? Or am I just overthinking this? I did talk to him about it and he seems okay. He actually gave me his blessing, but I still can't shake it for some reason.",29Aug2019,1
263,"I'm starting college next week. And I want to wear a school uniform while I'm at school, I'm going to a local community college while living at home. The outfit I plan on wearing will consist of a black blazer, white blouse, black sweater when it gets cold and a tartan pleated skirt with matching tie, and I'm also wearing tights and while inside of the school I'm wearing Japanese indoor school shoes. I'm doing this because I like the look of fancy school uniforms and uwabaki are very comfortable. Plus I never got to wear this kind of outfit in high school.

264,"Throw away account as my friends know my main one.

My ex and I broke up over 2 years ago now and I still can’t move on. Iv tried everything, meeting other people, keeping my self distracted, hanging with mates as much as possible. I even picked up a new hobby, but I still can’t get over her. I was seeing a girl at the beginning of the year for around 6 months but i couldn’t get feelings for her, every time we were in bed I had to think of my ex to finish. I find it so draining and kind of pathetic that I’m still attached to her. I get massive anxiety when I think about her and it just ruins my day. We didn’t have a messy break up it was a mutual decision as the relation ship got to toxic and we lost trust in each other. I know it’s only a young relation ship and there not meant to last but for some reason I’m still stuck on her. And I’m unsure on what else I could to do move on. Iv slept with multiple people after her and nothing compares. It’s so draining. I haven’t been able to stay involved with another because I never end up getting emotionally invested.

265,"So the last time I went to Venice Beach was about a couple months ago, I’ve just gone back today and been noticing a lot more homeless people trying to come up with random stuff to make money. A dude approached a random couple with a snake on his back and offered for them to take pictures. He then offered my girlfriend and the other guy’s girlfriend to put the snake on them. My girlfriend ended up taking the offer and he was telling me to take as many the pictures that I want. He also kept telling me to take pictures at different angle, he then proceeded to do the same thing for the other couple.

Next thing you know he goes “It’ll be $10” and i’m like ??? “$10 for what?!” and he replied saying for taking pictures. we both then proceeded to walk away and he ended up grabbing my arm and turned me around and demanded that I gave him his money for taking pictures. I told him he never told us anything whatsoever and he was the one who offered for us to take pictures...

Long story short, are people able to do that? Charge you just to take pictures ? Even if you’re out in public area?",29Aug2019,1
266,"I'm looking for advice on the ethics of throwing someone out of my apartment (not the legalities, as I've got those working in my favor.)

My roommate is a generally decent guy, but he does not have good sense much of the time. This is a case in point. A friend of his, let's call him Reginald, was ""going through some tough times"" and apparently needed a place to stay. Consequently, my roommate, we'll call him McLovin, told Reginald that he could stay ""for a few days."" This irritated me, but I didn't mind Reginald staying for a few days - at first.

It's not been long since he arrived here; he showed up only this past weekend, but he's become a problem, and he appears as if he intends on staying for a while. The ""trouble"" that he was going through seems to be more stupidity: the guy had a sublease, and it ended, and he didn't line anything else up. For what it's worth, my city is relatively inexpensive and there are numerous roommate situations advertised on our local Craig's List. However, it also seems that this guy doesn't have any money, or, at least, very little money. Apparently, none of this was ever discussed.

Reginald is also not a very conscientious or self-aware person, it seems. He's not even bothered to give me a simple ""thank you for letting me stay in your home"", for example. The other day, whilst cooking, he set off the fire alarm. When I came out to see what the noise was, he was still just cooking away, not seeming to bother about the fire alarm at all. Yesterday, he **invited his own guest to spend the night**. I heard a couple of people from my room, and came to find that Reginald had invited a second person (without checking with either me or McLovin) to stay the night, and the proceeded to talk well into the night, loud enough that it was audible through my walls.

This guy is even now wandering around out in the other room, making noise, running water, and so on. He's made himself quite at home, and has even moved in most of his stuff (boxes of books, bags, etc., all in the living room). He appears to be doing nothing to find an apartment: he sleeps much of the day, then goes off to social events, and stays up at night.

I've told my roommate to tell him to find a place, and to be out by the first, as that is certainly doable, but McLovin seems unable to do this, saying, ""We have to help him.""

To me, this is ridiculous. Why am I helping someone who seems not to help themselves? He's a nice enough guy, but it's very odd that he just forgot he had to move from his old apartment, and even more odd that my roommate seems not even to know what Reginald's situation is, in terms of finances, plans for a new place, why he had to move, or anything.

What are the ethics here? I  don't like the idea of throwing someone out into the street, but, at the same time, this seems unfair to me. While paying rent, I've had to deal with a guest who invites his own guests, who sets off fire alarms and leaves them going, and who doesn't even show the most basic of courtesy. Further, it doesn't appear he is trying to fix his situation, and there hasn't been presented any reason he should be homeless in the first place. I despise that there's some person I don't know floating around my apartment, without any consent on my part. Can I just throw him out? Is that unethical? Immoral?

**tl; dr**: Roommate allowed friend to stay in our apartment, and this friend is rude, doesn't understand boundaries, and seems to be settling in. What ethical/moral questions are there in throwing him out? Is it wrong to do so?",29Aug2019,2
267,"I originally wrote this for WIBTA but wasn't allowed to post due to the nature of my uncle's crimes. 

In 2007 my great-uncle (Grandma's brother) was convicted of some kind of involvement in child pornography and sent to prison. I was 15 at the time, so my mom didn't give me many details about why he disappeared suddenly, but over the years things slowly came out, though I'm not even sure she knows the true extent of his involvement. I dug around and found his sentencing online today. I don't understand them completely/don't feel compelled to type inquiries about child abuse into my browser, but it said he was serving five different sentences: three for ""MULT ENCOURAGING CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE 1"" and two for ""MULT SEX ABUSE 1""

Needless to say, everyone in my family has completely disowned him and the idea of him ever returning, except for his sister, my grandma. It's important to note that my immediate family on my mom's side is extremely close. Most of us live in the same city and we all see each other very often even between holidays.

My great-uncle was released this month, 12 years later, on good behavior. My great-grandmother (Grandma and great-uncle's mom) passed two years ago, and since then my grandmother has become more comfortable casually dropping her brother into conversation. Just little things, e.g. she'd been visiting him recently, or Great-Grandma (his mom) had wanted to see him before she died, or things she needed to prepare for his release. It feels like she's trying to toe the water and see how we react, but it always just quiets the room while she pretends we all aren't uncomfortable. My mom tells me she's been very vocal and direct with grandma about the fact that we are all completely done with him, but I've never wanted to bring it up personally as her granddaughter, especially considering the nature of the charges. Also important to point out that my grandma is in her late 70's, but absolutely has all of her faculties. She's a very able and intelligent woman.  
My best guess about why she isn't considering our feelings by bringing this up all the time is because she likely feels lonely in the situation. He's her only sibling, and they recently lost their mother. Though, I'm still not entirely sure why she decided to help/visit/stand by him in this before that.

Anyway, she's been managing his finances and driving back and forth between our town and his to help with housing the past two weeks he's been out, so he's been mentioned more often. WIBTA if I asked my grandma to stop bringing it up? I love her so much, and I don't want her to feel alone in this or to compromise our relationship because I imagine it must be so challenging for her as well, whatever her reasoning may be. But damn, I don't ever want to hear his name contaminate the air again, and I know I speak for the rest of the family (including her husband) too. I just don't ever want to make her sad

TLDR; Uncle goes to prison for involvement in child pornography, family disowns, 12 years later is released and grandma wants to reintroduce him to the family",29Aug2019,1
268,"Hello r/Advice. I am 27 and at a point in my life where I want more fulfillment and meaning out of life but am rather stuck. I'm having trouble moving forward with my life. I have vague ideas of things I enjoy but can't seem to find the will power to do much of anything. 

For some brief context, I was raised homeschooled with very few friends in a very religious household. My mother had all sorts of issues and would have weekly/daily melt downs. She was also arbitrarily strict with things like music and video games. I grew up not having a whole lot in common with my peers due to my mother restricting what I could take part in eg. Pokemon as it was, according to her, \*satanic\*. 

So from the time I was about 17 and had more freedom in my life, I spent all of my drive and energy finding ways to basically get as fucked up as possible. Alcohol, cannabis, opioids, cocaine, psychedelics, and all sorts of drugs. Mostly booze. I've spent the last 10 years figuring out how to escape reality as much as possible through drugs and alcohol and it led me down some terrible paths. 

Well now I'm 27, single, have very few friends, and am trying to put my life together. Financially I'm doing pretty good. Socially and emotionally? Far from it. 

I like photography so I tried going to photo meetups and for a while and it worked. Unfortunately, I live in a very poor area hours away from the city so most of the people in the photo clubs are too far away. I tried to make it work but ended up feeling burnt out and feeling like an outcast in that circle.

I like music and playing the guitar, but I have a terrible fear of playing with other people even though I have many times before and even have a degree in music. I know its silly, but it keeps me from it. 

Basically, I need friends. I need a SO. I need a life but I'm too afraid and too apathetic to seem to be able to push myself out of this. I don't know what I want from life.

What I do know and something I would like to do is some kind of camping/photography trip. I've saved tons of locations on google maps but I have no one to go to these places with and I don't want to do these things alone. Even if I did have a friend or SO to do these adventures with, I feel way to scared to try. Like totally gripped with fear giving me anxiety biting my nails. What the hell is wrong with me?

I'm a mess, this post is a mess and I'm sorry. What the hell do I do?",29Aug2019,1

Basically, I've joined the gym since November last year (2018). My weight has been fluctuating, 57-62 kgs.

HOWEVER. I had a comment from a trainer, that my physique wasn't improving.  
well that hurt A LOT &amp; the fact that that comment was still on my mind made me so ashamed of going to the gym.  
Look, I've improved in my sprints. I used to do 16 sprints, now I do 24 sprints.   


Buy because of her comments, I haven't been to the gym for 2 days now.  


What if every trainer in the gym says the same thing ? About me working hard but still haven't changed a damn thing on my physique?

Please help a girl out here, I've watched so many self help videos on this but still cannot get myself to the gym due to embarrassment.

276,"Basically as the title says. 

My dog Gucci is a 6 year old male Maltese. He has always been food aggressive since he was a puppy, despite hand-feeding him and other attempts to fix it. Even though he is aggressive, he will only growl and never actually attack whoever is near him. I’m the only person he let’s take food from him, this has never been an issue since he won’t attack people and especially not family. 

However, in the past two weeks or so, he has started to charge at my youngest brother, who is 8. They’ve grown up together and Gucci has never attacked him like this before. This has happened maybe 6 times already. Most of the times it’s happened because someone was eating (either me or our other 12 year old brother) and my 8 year old brother comes near us while we have food. Gucci will charge at him and has even bitten his clothes. This has also caused Gucci to charge at my brother a couple of times when no food is involved. 

My mom is understandably upset and is saying if Gucci continues to act this way I will have to re-home him. I honestly don’t know what to do because he’s never been this way before or ever just randomly attacked my brother. Re-homing him or putting him down are definitely not options I want to pursue. I want to correct his behavior, and need to know how to go about it.

283,"I work at a utility company making over $16/hr with over 18PTO days a year. We can purchase additional PTO days if needed. The benefits aren’t godly but are okay. I’m not super worried about benefits because I’m on my parents till I’m 26. 

I have yet to start college and really really want to. I feel like I can handle college + a moderate work load, but not with this job. 

It is an inbound call center, so I only get called, I don’t call out. I assist customers with their power bills, specifically when they cannot pay them.

Not many people enjoy the work they do, especially at my age. That’s fine. I just really can’t stand it. I worked as a contractor for the company for well over 9 months before being hired in as an employee with the previously mentioned benefits. 

This company is HUGE and offers all these different jobs- but here’s the catch: you gotta wait a year to bid out to these jobs. Which would be fine, but the jobs I want require college, and i don’t want to get stuck somewhere in the company. The drive is over 30 minutes a day and I live in an area that is pretty hellish during the winter. I really just don’t like this job. I’ve taken many days off just because I can’t stand going there, and many more due to my significant others health issues. 

I don’t know how long it’ll be till I just am over it.

Questions for anyone who’d be nice enough to answer:

- Would it be an okay idea to get a job making much less money, (minimum wage) but work for the college I am wanting to go to? I’d get no particular benefits other than being able to work a relatively easy tech support job that isn’t a call center and have more time for college, and much less stress from my current job. The grass is always greener, but a close friend of my friend works there and the job does seem really nice. 

- Is it okay to quit even though this could lead to a career if I stick it out? I have pressure from everyone here and I’m scared I’ll be given crap for not making the “right” choice. 

- Do you need any more information? I’m glad to give as much relevant info as needed. I’m trying to stay a little incognito here.

hi there, i am a 17 year old female and live in the netherlands. my mom and i fight a lot, 99.9% of the time it gets physical. yesterday 28th of august we had another fight. why? because i forgot to do a chore. she snapped and as soon as she could she started to get aggressive and physical, what bothered me the most was that is was in front of my little sister. she threatened to kill me (with a knife) in front of everybody, and to send me away to a foreign country.

lately she has threatened a lot to send me out of her house. and yesterday it was official. i had a choice to stay or to leave. if i were to stay she would give me a 30 day trial to see if i am allowed to stay with her. i have to make a decision by september 1st. if i leave, i leave. and have to pay for everything myself. but you see, i want to leave, i wanted it since i was 15. i do have a very supportive boyfriend and he’s gonna ask his parents if i could stay with him. i am still scared though.

i work at a mcdonalds but i don’t think i earn enough money to pay rent for a room, since i also go to school. i earn around a 3,90€/h. i had saved roughly 400€ but my mom asked me to pay for my books myself, and she told me she would pay it back. which she didn’t and doesn’t want to now.

i also mailed my “therapist”, she’s qualified but i don’t know how it’s called in english. in dutch its called a ‘POH’. i told her most of it and how i’m basically being “kicked out”, even if it’s my choice. i asked her if i could do something called ‘kamertraining’, it’s living alone with help. or if i am able to go to my boyfriends house.

i really don’t want anything with police or the law, i just want to appear like a normal 17 year old student that moves away because of college.

what more can i do? i have really little time to figure everything out and i am stressed beyond existence. i’m not sure if i’m able to stay with my boyfriend since he lives with his parents. i don’t know if i’m financially gonna make it.

I was excited to start taking computer science, but turns out I'm too stupid for it and I'm getting placed in a lower level class. I used to think I was good at computer science because I'm an arrogant brat, but I'm terrible at it. I don't have any classes with my only friend, and all my classmates see me as the weird girl who never talks and cries all the time. I'm lazy and over sensitive and attention-seeking and narcissistic, and I'm so tired of sitting alone and watching everyone else talking to their friends and setting up plans while also balancing sports and AP classes and extracurriculars. All I ever do is play video games and sleep. I don't deserve my family or all the stuff I have, I don't deserve anything. I spend years studying a subject and barely understand it, I can't handle school, I can't talk to people, I look disgusting. Why should I even stay alive if I'm this pathetic? My parents tell me to just deal with school and wait until college, but I'm probably not even going to pass junior year. I'm a failure and I just want to be normal. I want to have hobbies and friends and I want to be worth something, but I'll never be and i can't take another year of this",29Aug2019,1
295,"Obviously this post is about about a girl I have feelings for 
But like THE girl 
I don’t think I’ve ever been more sure of anything ever
She’s a better human than anyone I’ve ever met

We’ve worked together for three years at a facility for medically fragile children and I’ve known her since third grade. 

Took me the past three years to build up the courage to tell her how I feel about her, not wanting to complicate things because neither of us plan on leaving our jobs 

Well I did it a few weeks ago and we’ve been talking a lot more until recently she told me some really intense stuff which she doesn’t know I already know about 

She was assured her freshman year of college and has never been ok with herself since. Mind you she’s one of the most beautiful people I’ve met but she feels the opposite way

Last night she told me I wouldn’t want to be with her because she’s not sure she can ever have sex. 

And I’ve thought a lot about it and I know I probably sound like a crazy person but I really think I’m ok with that. Really seems insignificant when compared to a life with her. 

I told her today exactly that and she’s really confused as to my reasoning and when I tried to explain how much more important she is than that she persisted to rant about how much she hates herself and then say she’s done taking and just went to bed. 

Soo now I feel like I really did something wrong and I can’t ask any of my real life friends about the situation out of respect for the things she told me in confidence so that’s kinda why I need this because I am lost on what I should even do

It feels almost selfish to persist if she’s really that uncomfortable with the idea of the whole thing, on the other hand I don’t want to let her slip away

Putting more thought into it as much as is seems possible I am not sure how a relationship without intimacy would even work or if she’d feel guilty about it  

Anyways thanks reddit",29Aug2019,1

297,"Hello people of r/Advice, I think I might need your assistance with this one.

So recently I was hired as an RA as a Senior at a university (this account is a throwaway to prevent this from being traced back to me) and while going through training realized that I am attracted to one of the other RAs that works in a nearby location. On top of that she is majoring in field adjacent to my own (which is fairly niche), funny and sweet, and is what I'd consider 'my type'. Great right? Well, yeah, but there are some roadblocks that I'm struggling to deal with with what I should do next. Some of these are internal and some of these are external, but I am going to lay them out on the table:

1. I have absolutely 0 relationship experience. This moreso impacts my confidence in terms of what action to take going forward (its a bit awkward as I am involved in Greek Life and kind of defy expectations there). I haven't really found someone I liked both physically and personality-wise in a long while and this in itself is kind of an unfamiliar experience. I don't know how to address this and could use some help figuring this out (especially since I'm not really expressive less casual settings).
2. She has had a negative experience with someone in my organization that she was in a relationship with before I joined (which in itself is not through the traditional means of recruitment and I kind of dramatically am not the type of person). I won't go to into details but it included physical altercation and severe penalties given out. I could use some advice with overcoming this (or even knowing if this is still a factor- more on that later). I would get it if she didn't like this, but I'm really just looking for a chance to address this and maybe find a way to work past it.
3. I feel like there is a distance between us. While there has been nothing overtly any direction between us, I can't get a reading on how she sees me. There have been events that imply one way, but others that the opposite, a lot of ones with a grey area. That said, she is close with some other people from years prior and not so much me or the new people- but whether thats because she is used to them or not is another question. I guess what I'm asking is if there is any sort of way to test waters or find people with better info or if itd be best to just ask her directly (which ive been avoiding for the other reasons).

I am definitely interested in her, but man I feel like if what happens negatively impacts her or makes it permanently weird then it will affect future interactions with her (which are somewhat required as she is another RA and I need to coordinate). My ideal end would be to try out a relationship if possible, but I don't want to do anything that would make her want to avoid me. I've considered waiting to see more info, but I wouldnt know where to get that info and I recognize that other life events could happen.

302,"I’ve been pretty conflicted over this and I’m not very good at conversations or being assertive. So I’m just asking for some advice on how to do it in a way that shows them that I’m not happy about what they did to me and I don’t want them in my life.

Here’s some backstory and there’s a TL;DR at the bottom:

So I moved around 3 or so years ago to another state and I made a really good friend here. Or at least I thought. I was really lonely and basically didn’t know how to have friends since my previous experiences were mainly abusive and bullying. I ended up basically being a caretaker for this person for around 2 years. They were very poor and dehydrated almost 90% of the time. I would take the time out of my mornings to pack extra water and sometimes make lunches for him. I also paid for his lunch quite often or gave him part of mine. I really did my best to look after this boy for around 2 years, helping him build confidence, getting him to finish assignments, making him keep his cool (he had bad temper issues) etc.

I had gotten a boyfriend at some point during the 2nd year or so of our friendship and the other guy really wasn’t a good guy. I was desperate and lonely so I stupidly said ok to dating him. This made my friend really upset because he didn’t like him and he apparently had a crush on me.

Keep in mind that a lot of people had told me that he did before, but I was worried that it might be true. I did ask him straight out and did everything I could to ensure that I wasn’t friendzoning him. He always said no he didn’t think of me that way and he saw me more as a little sister. Okay, I thought, because I wanted to trust his words.

As soon as we graduated, he acted so harsh and coldly towards me. It was awful what he did. He called me unnecessary to his “plan of happiness”. He told me my depression and anxiety were contagious and told me to not expect any sympathy from him. There were a lot of things he said, and I cried for a long time.

He then removed me on pretty much everything and refused to answer any attempt at contacting him. I really didn’t understand what had happened and I beat myself up because I thought I must’ve been the worst person in the world to have someone who I so deeply cared about just slap me in the face like that.

A year later he has the audacity to text me.

At first I answered coldly and made sure to point out that he had hurt me. After some back and forth and his “explanation” he told me that he had a massive crush on me still and he wanted closure.

Are. You. Kidding. Me.

He demanded closure and I had already told him I’m not looking for a relationship right now and I haven’t seen him in literally over a year and asking me to dinner won’t repair that.

Frankly, I learned that he left me because I had some issues with my boyfriend at that time and he got tired of all my drama. For a short period I had broken up with my boyfriend because he was a total douchebag but I got basically threatened back into it. It might be better to show an image so I’ll post a picture right after this one.

How do I communicate the pure rage and display what stupidity he’s spouting before I go and slap him myself?

303,"Over the past year or so I’ve grown to have anxiety in social situations while alone. Lately you hear all these stories of women being taken, stalked, or worse, and I guess over a period of time of constantly hearing these events, it’s unsettled me. My anxiety isn’t to the point where it stops me from going out alone, but I am I’m constantly looking over my shoulder to make sure I’m good, and hyper aware of my surroundings (it gets exhausting to say the least).

I miss myself. I was/am, free-spirited — I enjoy going out alone, chatting up and meeting new people (with reasonable caution), and was just more trusting of the world. I met some of my best friends due to me just putting myself out there and doing things not typically in comfort zone. Now I look back and think wow any number of things could gone in an opposite direction. But my best memories and friendships have come from taking risk, &amp; I don’t want to lose that adventurous part of me.

305,"So sorry this is all over the place, I'm terrible with staying on track, but I really need to know how to feel about this whole situation.  
So my wife's mother had her fresh out of high school, I think she was a prom night baby. Her mother and father got married because she got pregnant and they got divorced about a year later, her father winning guardianship and the mother moving to another state.   
She grew up with her dad who a few years later married her stepmother, who absolutely hated her. Treated her like garbage. Threw away birthday cards that had been sent to her just to make her unhappy, made her do a ridiculous amount of chores like cleaning her personal bathroom and things a child should not have to do. Years later people from the neighborhood got worried and called CPS. She didn't know anything bad had been done to her so the stepmother just got a warning. Leaving a lot of things out about her because that's not what I need advice about. She would try to spend every weekend she could with her grandmother, calling her mother once in a while. Her grandmother was the closest to a mother she had, sadly she passed suddenly from lung cancer a year ago.  
My wife tells me she went to visit her mother for a few weeks every year. Growing up with a single mother myself, that seemed just unbelievable, but she didn't seem to mind it. Her mother had two more kids with different men, eventually getting her tubes tied to avoid it. She is dating a new man every time my wife contacts her, has been married and divorced dozens of times, and seems altogether very unstable... She posts on Facebook constantly about her two other kids, never contacting my wife at all. We recently got married, moved from FL to OR in her little car and there have been so many changes going on. She knew that we were planning to move and 2 months later, about a week ago, my wife finally messages her asking to FaceTime, the mother saying she's too tired to. Unbelievable. How as a mother, do you not message your child for two months, not caring at all about how she is doing? We moved here over 2 months ago and she had no idea we had ever left Florida. And gotten married. And that she had totaled her car when a deer had jumped in front of it. She answered her with maybe 3 responses in total when they were messaging on Facebook. Whenever they do Skype she doesn't ask how she is doing. It is my wife who asks her things, and her responding with ''yeeah...'', ''nope, divorced again''. How as a mother can you not wonder what is going on in your child's life? Her other daughter who finished high school recently is like her buddy. The mother didn't even know when her final exams were, my wife, while  freaking out asked her sister personally, she said she didn't want to do them. She now works at McDonalds. My wife is soon finishing college (first person in the family to go to university) with a teaching degree.  
Her mother just doesn't seem to care about anything. She lives off of social security and I know she has a lot of physical illnesses that prevent her from being able to work. She's on facebook all day doing those quizes like 'what butterfly would you be?', 'your sexiness based on your profile picture!' as her youngest son has been taken from her as well. How do you not think of your first born baby girl when all you do all day is stay at home doing Facebook quizes?  
I have met her through Skype and feel like I should be grateful to her as we are a lesbian couple, and she has agreed to keep it from the father's side of her family, who has raised her. They are in Florida, so as you can guess, are homophobic.  
I just don't know how to feel about her at all.   
Sometimes my wife gets sad and wonders why nobody loves her. When her grandmother was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, everybody expected her to care for her. With a full time job and university on top of the closest person to a mother she ever had was fading away, all her farther family members like aunts and uncles turned on her and started despising her. She was crying every night because of the guilt she felt for not being able to watch her get weaker and weaker and for not quitting her job and college to care for her. (Her family strongly suggested she drop out.) Her grandmother's own children came from IL to care for her, sending my wife horrible messages about how disgusting she was for not having ruined her future to care for her grandmother who would pass away one month after finding out about her illness. She had been somewhat close to her aunt and great aunt who just abandoned her for not being able to take care of her all on her own as her father was watching and doing nothing.   
Her whole family seems to not care about her at all. Both her parents had children after her and seem to love them more than her. I just do not understand how you can not feel love for your child and family member. I talk to my mother on the phone for hours each and every day and she just can not believe her own mother would not fight to keep her. At the end it turns out it was a better idea for her to be near her grandmother as she encouraged her to go to college and have dreams while everybody else around her treated her terribly.   
I myself had no living grandparents, grew up without a father and any relatives at all. All I have and have ever had is my mother and so I don't have any perspective on how any other family member really behaves. I have always felt that maternal love my wife has never been able to get from hers and I feel so sad for her. I try to tell her I'm her family now, but sometimes she still thinks about how easily her whole family turned on her and feels down.   
I want to know what to say to her. I also want to know how to feel about this mother of hers who doesn't seem to care much either. (I'd like to note she does sound a little like she doesn't have a whole lot going on up there and also acts like it, which my wife agrees with. I have always blamed it on that, her just being a bit... different, but I also think maternal love is something every mother feels for her baby).   


This story was terribly long, but I felt like without adding in most of what's been going on in her life, you wouldn't have the perspective.",29Aug2019,1
307,"I’ll try to keep this as simple as possible. I (24F) grew up as a kid attending a Presbyterian Church most Sundays. In my opinion, my family had a relatively healthy view on religion - it was introduced and was a part of our family, but nothing was forced on anyone and being a good person was always emphasized over everything else (my parents expressed irritation towards a side of the family that was more preachy and used religion to shame others). Due to complex circumstances including the death of my grandpa and the preacher moving to a different state, we quit going to church when I was about 8 and my parents divorced when I was a teenager.

Now, I am married. My husband (25M) and I have very similar and nearly identical religious beliefs, but differ in one key area - going to church makes him feel very uncomfortable. He grew up not regularly attending church, and whenever he did, he feels he was “preached at” and judged so intensely that he really dislikes the idea of churches, and he thinks that most churches are just businesses that don’t have to pay taxes and that they don’t really care about the people that attend. Fair enough.

Since we started dating we (more so I) always talked about finding a church to go to together once we were married. Well we have been married about a year and as he kept putting off going to church he finally revealed that he doesn’t plan on ever going (see above). He is a very supportive person to me in every other way, and the idea of church much *really* make him uncomfortable for him to refuse to go with me, so I respect his decision. I have encountered plenty of very mean preachers, so I understand where he is coming from. 

About a month ago I tried going to a local Catholic Church alone and I was just really uncomfortable. I tried a Catholic Church because I heard the people were more reserved, and they were, but I really just felt like a weirdo and a loner. None of my friends are very religious and I wouldn’t really feel comfortable asking my mom or dad to go due to past circumstances. I think if I went back I would go to my own denomination, a Presbyterian one. How should I go about trying to go to a church, and would a be considered weird if I went alone? 

Tl;dr : I have no one to go to church with, but I would really like to see if it’s something I would enjoy again. But I also have a lot of anxiety about going alone. What should I do about this, and is it weird to go to church alone?",29Aug2019,2

311,"I’m almost finishing high school and I don’t feel prepared for the future. To be honest I struggle at school with my grades since I came to an English country. My first language is not English.  I would like to know, how can I break my negative thoughts from making me cry and thinking I’m a failure. I believe there are possibilities for me to improve in all of my subjects before the final exam. I see various successful people failing high school not going to college. Well, I don’t have chances to compete with the rest of the kids of my age because I am late- I didn’t do any extra- curricular activities because of the excuse of always failing in my grades. I didn’t win any awards after 8th grade. I’m not sure what happened to me through highschool years but now I can’t talk effectively even in my own language, is it because of my grades in English and grammar classes? Each time I try to talk with someone they are always quite type, I like those people don’t get me wrong, but I wish I could also have extrovert friends. Prom is coming and I’m not going because I don’t have any friends that are going or friends that are going but they will only hang out with close friends. I never thought seriously about my grades until now. I’ve been too busy with my work ( that in reality is procrastinating on investigating to build a business and become successful) but in reality I want to be sociable and have a group of friends that will last. I’m not sure how to get close to someone. I tried many times to socialise with them by being myself but it takes time, and I’m always moving somewhere else because dad works overseas. I am in the age in which I discover what I want to be, however, how do I even am I going to get to an specific uni or how to manage to get the subjects that I want if my grades are so low. It hurts me. I wish I could talk to my family about my problems and struggles but I now the answer, they have told me my errors and mistakes, the hard part is that I’m trying to succeed but is supposedly too late because 50% of my final mark is gone and I’m trying to make a plan and organise myself, but I achieve unsuccessful results. ( I’m not whinning I’m confused and hopeless at the same time) for those people that have been in my shoes, how did you managed to come out from this mess and at the same time achieve a successful life? 

And yeah, for some reason I flirt without wanting to. I don’t like this quality of mine because some of my classmates get angry and causes trouble for me, I sometimes want to just hide my expressions but they come out or slide down. I don’t want to create drama it cause problems in friendships. 

If you have further questions ask please, I’m kind of helpless and I still have I little hope for change in my life.

However as I get old and he gets older (mid 70s) I begin to question where he's actually going when he comes back at 5am. Perhaps he just falls asleep on people's couches or maybe he is out gambling or hanging out with friends but recently I discovered that he has a lot of trust issues with my mum and always questions if she's out with a man when she's literally just nipping to the shops.

I need a little advice. So the last few weeks I have grew closer to a male colleague. It started off friendly and became a little to friendly.

We work in different offices but are on the same team. We have only kissed once but we would text and sext a lot outside of work.

He's married. Last week while on holiday he began sexting me I responded a few texts then I started work. I may have sent a few texts while at work. But use of phones while working is allowed. His wife saw the texts and sent a photo of my vagina to our work group chat so my boss, my colleagues and a member from another team saw.

HR got involved and told me that as it was on personal devices and not during company time I won't lose my job.

But when he is back on Monday his wife is making him show evidence that I did in fact text him after 9.

A co-worker in another department (we work in a hospital) has been extremely overbearing. He’s (21m) asked me on dates multiple times (I’ve politely declined every time), always comments on my selfies telling me I’m beautiful, and lingers by my desk staring at me without saying anything. I’m hesitant to go to HR because I don’t want to get him in trouble, but I can’t stand him breathing down my neck anymore. How do you handle a situation like this without causing a scene at work?

I should note he’s extremely fragile because he just got out of a relationship with a woman that may or may not be pregnant with his (or his cousins) baby. Once, after I declined a date, he went on a rant on Facebook about how everyone is fake and we are all going to die alone. The other night I smiled when he said hello because I was too busy to chat and he confronted me about it not being a good enough response. Other staff members have commented on it without me saying anything about it, one nurse even asking if I needed a safe word for when he won’t leave me alone. 

I don’t know what to do. I leave work wanting to scream and cry. I get sick to my stomach with anxiety when I know we will be working a shift together.

Also this is definitely going to be too much detail, so my main point is that I’m looking for advice on how to get help. 

Over the past month I’ve developed an extreme fear of bugs (roaches especially). They were living in my old apartment and are also in my new one. I am extremely paranoid as soon as the sun goes down, and once I try to go to sleep and turn the lights off I am extremely uneasy. 

I have heard noises in the dark and turned on my flashlight to see a  giant roach crawling on my walls/floor/furniture on more than one occasion and am now petrified of the dark and also sleep. 

This week I saw one on my wall and was unable to sleep until 8am when the sun was up and spent the entire night in the verge of a break down. I am in the same situation right now except I haven’t seen any pests in my room, I’m just terrified that there will be one. 

I consistently spray my room (weekly), have had professional exterminators come in to spray, and i keep my apartment very clean. 

Tonight has proven to me that even if they are completely gone, I will still be petrified in my home. I have tried many coping exercises and changing my routine to be more tired at night, yet nothing helps. 

I have finally scheduled an appointment with a doctor, as this is not normal or healthy. However I’m extremely nervous that I won’t be taken seriously because this is such an irrational fear. 

Has anyone else had a similar experience/situation? Any advice on how to make sure my doctor understand how much this is effecting my life?",29Aug2019,1
323,"My girlfriend and I recently had sex and it was both of our first times. I have no idea what the chances are of her getting pregnant but here are some things to take note of: we’ve had sex twice, both with a condom on and with me finishing inside, but neither time did the condom break. It was 2 weeks since her period and according to an app she uses, she wasn’t ovulating. Do I have anything to worry about? Should I have her take plan B because it’s still within 24 hours of the last time we had sex?

327,"1st of all my ex and I have been talking recently and as much as we both want to get back together our friends are so different and everyone thinks we hate each other that it would throw three separate friend groups out of balance and start avoidable conflict

2nd is the fact that school's back in and I  have a class with the person that sexually assaulted my best friend. The school refuses to transfer me out of the class or even to a separate teacher because ""that's not true we would have it on record and we know you just want to be with your friends."" What's making it an issue is he's trying to befriend me and I'm too scared to say no because he's also one of my Ex's friends and it's a whole web of social ties that make it very hard for me, social recluse that doesn't like starting anything, to say no to this guy, highly social, lots of friends, still a registered sex offender. 



3rd and most personally stressful
I have ""friend"", he'll be K for simplicity. 
K is not a good  person in any capacity. He is manipulative to everyone he meets, He's the kind of person that think every single person on earth wants to have sex with him, he's not trustworthy, he flirts with girl that like him just to play with their feelings, hes a pervert and a stalker, he refuses to take obvious clues and leave me alone when I ask for it, and hes more arrogant than an anime villain could even dream of being(God complex doesn't scratch the surface) Now I fully understand he's a horrible person, unfortunately we were close for around 10 years but went to different schools so I never got to see how he interacts with others and I thought the things he did were normal and just what happened. He ridiculed me and refused to accept me when I came out as bi. The issue is our families are now intertwined and it's not an option to just end the friendship as blunt as possible, but it's not an option to keep lying to him and myself about this ""friendship"".  I'm currently working on getting a group of as many people as I can to call this guy out but I'm scared and just don't know where to go once I do it. What will happen. Yes it's true everyone that knows me will understand but to the other 1900 people that dont know much about us they'll just see a 10 year friendship ended for seemingly no reason and I'm scared it'll put a major block in my social life. Ive done the crying but the stress of being the only person who could get the point me and about 30 other people have across is slowly wearing me down. I'm sleeping less, eating more, drinking nearly 10 monsters a week and living in constant fear that ill let the whole thing slip out early which will only make it harder

330,"Hi, I'm a 28 year old male and I don't really know how to proceed anymore with my girlfirend.

So we've been together for a little over a year now, and I absolutely love her. We've decided to buy a house together a few weeks ago and we're moving there in about a month and a half. The thing is I'm having a lot of doubts because of the following:

We don't fight a lot because I have a lot of patience with her, she's easily angered and in a bad mood, but mostly because of her work or things that happen to her on her commute, and I can calm her down most of the time pretty fast. But since we decided to buy a house and cancel my lease for my appartment, she asked me to arrange all of it because she's just not as organised and doesn't know a lot on how this works. So I arranged most of the things required for the house and the cancellation of the appartment. 2 days ago when I got home from work I asked her when she was available this week so the landlord could come over to take pictures of the appartment to post online, she told me she was available today in the afternoon and 2 days next week, so I asked her if it was okay if I send her a mail saying that she could come by today in the afternoon or next week, she replied today in the afternoon is okay, and so I forwarded her this mail yesterday.

She didn't reply to me all day yesterday and when I got home from work she just exploded and told me I'm an asshole for making an appointment for the pictures while she wanted to spend her afternoon doing something else. We had a pretty big argument and it seems she was having quite a few issues with me that came up. 

She told me she felt as if we are just roommates with benefits, and that I don't show her that I love her enough. I tell her several times a day that I love her and when she wants to do something I'm usually up for it. Now I don't often have ideas to go do something because on my end money is tight, I'm working a full time job and I'm combining this with a study which requires me being in classes 3 nights/week, and studying at home. I usually end up paying extra on our monthly bills even though she makes about 1000€ a month more than me, because she wants to save 1250€ every month and so I can't really save as much.  
Because of this, my life is pretty stressfull and I relax by playing guitar and video games (and it's not as if I play every day for hours on end). She feels as if I don't pay enough attention to her, which I disagree with, but if that's how she feels she has every right to it. 

Every 4 weeks or so I meet up with my friends to go get a drink and every time she is mad at me for doing so, because then she feels like I don't want to spend my time with her.

I feel as if she's just bored because she has absolutely no hobbies, she goes to work, comes home and watches tv. That's pretty much all she does. I on the other hand have a pretty busy schedule, and I do have my hobbies to keep me occupied while I'm at home not working for school or work. 

I'm getting pretty fed up with her behaviour towards me, because I do spend time with her and crawl on the sofa next to her to watch some tv together, but when I ask her if she wants to do something her answer is most of the time ""no"", but when she wants to do something and if it isn't too expensive we'll go out.   
But now, after she told me she felt as if we're just roommates with benefits, I'm very hurt because of that. I feel like I try my best to balance my free time between her and my hobbies, but she seems to strongly disagree.

I have no clue about what to do anymore and it's only adding to my already pretty stressfull life.

333,"It’s like 2 am and I have school at 7 am, so I’ll keep things short and clarify in the morning.  Thank you in advance for anyone willing to help me out! 

I’m currently a senior in high school (17 F) and over the summer, I went on a few dates with a guy who used to go to my school (17 M). 

We texted a lot, so one day we hung out. at the park together and I told him I liked him. We kissed, he said I love you which I freaked out about, and I told him I wanna take things super slow. 

Since then, we’ve hung out twice and texted/called a lot, but I made it really clear that I wanted to take things really slow after he said I love you. I have a feeling he doesn’t really know how relationships work or how to pace it, plus he goes to a charter school where he doesn’t really talk to anyone. Besides me, I’m not really sure if he talks to anyone in our age range, so he might be a little socially unaware. 

Lately, I haven’t texted or called him at all. I started to notice we didn’t have a lot in common and it felt wrong to drag him along. I’ve also had family issues, meaning I’ve been busy from like 7 am-9 pm, so I’ve had no free time.

Recently, he texted me calling him my boyfriend when we’ve never had a conversation about that and we’ve been on two/three dates (which we’ve never even called a date). I texted him telling him I’m not ready for anything serious, maybe he misunderstood what was going on, but I’m starting to feel like a complete asshole for it. 

Am I in the wrong? I’d post this to r/AmITheAsshole but this is more of a relationship/advice thing. How should we move forward? Am I being unfair? 

TLDR; I, (17F) told a (17m) friend that I liked him. He said I love you back, I told him I wanted to take it super slow. We’ve been on two dates irl, texted/called a lot. He called himself my boyfriend when we’ve never had a conversation about that. Am I being unfair? How do we move forward from this?",29Aug2019,2

337,"This is a long read, so please bear with me. Be aware of the trigger warning explicit on the title please.

We’re both young (F,16), she briefly told me about this a few months ago, but did not elaborate, just hinted at it until i got it, never explicitly said or described anything. I obviously wanted to do something about it, sexual abuse is a serious line and i can hold back when she begs me to stay put about the physical and verbal abuse, but sexual abuse is just a whole other level (i am not invalidating or undermining other forms of abuse, please don’t think that, i understand the seriousness of any type). She begs me not to do anything or to say something to anyone because it’s her choice, her life, and i have broken her trust before on that department in a really drastic way before (she is suicidal and was planning to kill herself, i contacted the cops, they talked to her parents, a lot of people ended up knowing of it and overall it was just a huge violation of her trust. i did not know much about the abuse back then, much less the sexual type). 
She claims, and with rightfulness, that she needs someone she can trust and just be there for her, and me doing something would hurt her more than anything else. Once I hinted that i might do something and she placed herself on the balcony of her little cousin’s place threatening to jump because it’s not worth it if she can’t trust the person she loves and i hurt her as badly or worse as everyone else. 
But this time, I didn’t stay put again. The first time she said something about the sexual abuse, I decided that was a line that could not be crossed and contacted Minor Protection Services. I told them about all types of abuse she suffered and they told me not to worry about it. That was two months ago. They doubted her story (I understand why, but either way, where there’s smoke, there’s fire). They did basically nothing, they called her parents in, talked to them and that was about it. She’s still living with them and severely suffered the consequences of them being called in. 

[Her parents are both successful, upper middle class, extremely manipulative individuals that care more about their image than anything else. They can easily fool anyone and they constantly shift the blame on her even when they’re clearly the one in the wrong. I have met them both and they are nice, they seem good even though there was an extreme underlining passive aggressiveness, specially towards their daughter.]

She doesn’t know it was me and believes me when I say I didn’t do anything, I feel awful about it but I can’t let her know it was me or else it would just be worse for everyone. She understandably is incapable of speaking about it, it’s too hard and takes too much of a toll on her, if someone were to ask her directly about it she would deny it. She doesn’t want to ruin their life and their image, because “they’re good to everyone else even if they’re awful to me”, “they’re good people”, “it’s my fault for being a terrible daughter” “i’m a slut” that’s what she says. They have conditioned her into their full control in so many ways. It’s absolutely terrible. They are terrible parents, awful human beings in every way possible. She is the purest, kindest human being I met, she’s sincerely good even though she wholeheartedly believes she’s bad, and i’m not saying that just because of my connection to her. 
Now, she has been diagnosed with anxiety, depression and bulimia. And lately she has been listening to voices screaming for her to kill herself, that she’s awful, that they know her secrets, all the works, and after I did some research, along with other symptoms, this could very possibly be the first signs of schizophrenia manifesting (I am not licensed whatsoever of course and i am not diagnosing her, just stating her current state). She is very unstable and suicide is a recurring thought.
Yesterday night she got drunk and slipped a few things (she didn’t slip yesterday because her parents take her phone away at 21.30, but this morning she was still a bit tipsy), she very briefly explicitly told me some things about the abuse. They even have a small taser to shock her. It’s inhumane. No one deserves that, much less my little girl. She didn’t do anything wrong.

I don’t know what to do, even though they neglect her mental state and invalidate it ,she has been picked up by the public sector (they tried to keep her in the private bc poor them, that have a “damaged” daughter and no one can know) because of the bulimia, and maybe if she talked there they would do something but i have no idea how to persuade her to that, she doesn’t care about herself, and deep down she loves them, she doesn’t want to hurt them. She can’t handle two more years of living with them. She will not survive and even if she does, is it worth it with all that pain? She can’t go live with anyone else. She’s exhausted. She hasn’t slept for days and they don’t care. It’s not fair. I can’t stay quiet, I can’t let her go through that. Please, does someone have any idea of what I could do? How I can convince her to talk? I have used logic and every technique I could think and know of, which are a lot. But she’s high functional and extremely smart too and doesn’t fall for it. I am out of ideas. 

Please keep in mind we don’t live in america or even an english speaking country, so the system works a little differently, its much less rigorous or knowingly, idk how to explain.",29Aug2019,2

342,"When around a group of people, i normally aimed to be funny or entertaining in some way. If someone said something, i usually come up with a good pun or innuendo to dirty it up. Usually i would get a laugh, sometimes i am unsure if it was funny and say it again because i don't think people heard me. Then i find out they did, but it wasn't funny. Because of this, i am never taken seriously when a serious matter arises. This means, i have no say in anything. I am the comedic relief in the group. I have said some serious things and then because it seemed to confuse people i didn't say a joke or was it a joke? frowning happens, I immediately tell an actual joke as if i meant to build up to it all along.

The group i am in does need some ideas, most of which i have thought up. My only way of making them happen is to whisper to someone else that idea and they say it to the group, which they take that person seriously = Getting all the credit for that good idea they thought up with no help at all.

This example being- my friend of 9 years and I live on opposite sides of the state (rhode island, so it’s pretty small). We both go through a lot of the same mental difficulties. She doesn’t have a car but is rarely allowed to use her mom’s to meet up with me, although sometimes i break out of my comfort zone and go pick her up myself. All of my friends can be spontaneous sometimes, a trait i never see myself having. She asked if i wanted to go get dinner today-which i had a genuine excuse not to. But in hopes of making her feel a bit better, since we havent seen each other in close to a month, i asked if she wanted to go eat tomorrow night instead.

347,"So I have my driving test next week

I drove a car with my instructor 15 times yet I still dont understand manual transmission. 

I stalled my car 10 times max because of either releasing the clutch too quickly, releasing the clutch before going into neutral, fucked up something and the car stalle.

I cant rely on luck so I need to understand a few more things about manual transmission 

Question 1
When the fuck do I release the clutch? At what point exactly can I tell to myself that ok let's go I can release the clutch 

Question 2
If I'm on 1st gear, can I drive using clutch (by having it slightly raised to me) forever without pressing gas? Or will the car stall?

Question 3
When I want to move my car fully, can I just press clutch and release it quickly while pressing the gas pedal or do I have to hold the clutch in the middle a little bit while simultaneously pressing gas and after a few seconds release the clutch?

Question 4
What do I do if I'm in full stop on a slope and want to move without hitting the car behind me? I cant hold the brake pedal because I obviously need to press the gas pedal and the clutch. What do I do? Do I press the clutch and slowly release it while pressing on the gas pedal with all of my power? Won't that cause me to move backwards since it takes time for the car to move?

Question 5
If I accidentally stall my car what do I do? How do I quickly start moving again?

Question 6
If I want to go full stop on a red light, do i press clutch and go into neutral and then when i need to stop i press brake pedal? Or do i press clutch and then fully stop and then i can go into neutral?

Question 7
When I'm approaching a red light at 3rd gear and then going to a slow speed like (7mph) and suddenly there is a green light. Do I need to press clutch and fully stop, go into first gear and then move? Or do do I just press clutch and move into an appropriate gear without fully stopping?

348,"I'm in highschool and finding it hard to talk to this girl that I find really interesting and fun to have a conversation with. I have had a few decent chats with her at parties before when we were alone together. She has very similar hobbies to me and as well as interests that I find quiet intriguing.

However, I constantly struggle to talk to her around school even though I really want to. There's been numerous occasions where we've literally walked side-by-side when moving between our classes and all ever say to her during that minute is ""Hey, how's it going?"". She usually responds with ""Good, yourself?"". I casually tell her that I'm good and that's the end of it.

I want to say more definitely, but all I can think of is really boring things like how she's going on her assignments, or I end up asking her questions to the point where it ends up being an interview rather than an organic conversation. I've tried on multiple occasions to think of something that we're both interested in, like The Office for example, but I just can't do it without it seeming completely random and having absolutely no context. I'm fine with holding a conversation with her, once we get the ball rolling we can talk for hours on end. The main issue is actually starting the conversation.

I'm worried about health implications later and seeing as how my dad had cancer, my grand dad's siblings died from cancer, and my older sister had cancer, I'm worried if I don't stop I will get it too. I've tried by myself unsuccessfully. Any advice so I can get my pink lung back?",29Aug2019,1

351,"I'm currently about to enter my sophomore year at UCLA as a Neuroscience Major heading towards a medical career. I'm not failing or anything but I have definitely felt my laziness get the better of me. My work piles up, I get stressed, and I cant even go to the gym anymore. I dont know why I'm like this but I keep convincing myself I'll get past it and I'll make it through. My family and friends have all taken notice of my rising behavior and it honestly feels like shit when nobody believes in you. I just need to overcome my laziness, develop a hard working mentality, and essentially become motivated. I've been getting lazier and lazier over the years and I cant take it anymore. If anybody could please give me some advice on how to get back on track and get motivated to work hard I would really appreciate it. Really, anything helps. Thank you so much",29Aug2019,0
353,"So as an adult (24f) I’m good at making acquaintances but I’m never able to cross that bridge over to friendship (unless that person is an extrovert and essentially adopts me). I’m a lot better at making friends with guys than girls - I think that’s because I’ve been hurt by girls in the past, but I’m desperate to have some girlfriends. 

I’m about to start an MSc at a new University (I’ll be commuting) and really could do with some tips as this seems like a great opportunity to put myself out there.

357,"My aunt would constantly be talking to him through FB. They've been talking for the past 2 years but these past days have been awful to my cousin. My aunt would travel back home to Japan where she would meet up with her friends along with the guy. While in Japan she would spend tons of money and ask for more to the husband. For i'm well aware that he knows she is cheating but wouldn't confront her because he's thinking about their kids and their future. My aunt would call her kids ugly even their birthday and only cares about her and the attention she gets. 

Then my mom (my aunts sister) recently found out that she's doing this unacceptable behavior. So my mom contacted other relatives such as their her brother and eldest sister letting them know the situation. Furious as they were they made an arrangement to confront my cousin and my aunt about the situation. Which imo is not a good idea, but i could be wrong. 

Now my cousin has been stress these past couple of days due to the situation. Her studies are in affect of the situation and failed a mandatory class. Her parents are strict af and always bringing her down when she fails or even not being able to accomplish something because they'll say she cant handle it. But she's always determined to prove them wrong and still try. Then she's thinking about enlisting to the NAVY so in case they do split up she's thinking about her little sister and dad with their financial needs. (we want her to pursue her dream and she's only doing NAVY to help with money) She's tried blocking him on FB so they wouldn't be able to talk but that didnt stop them. She has a big heart and constantly think about her little sister as she's in high school and would be hard for her to encounter this.

Now I'm here thinkin the best way to approach this situation. Is it right that my mom (including my relatives) to intervene in this situation? Should they only talk to my cousin? or/and my aunt? For my cousin has been depressed and crying the past days as it keeps getting worse. I dont know how manage this and approach it the best way.",29Aug2019,1
358,"So, obligatory First Post Here, I'm trying to follow the rules but please don't stone me if I missed out on something or this isn't the right place to post.

Context: I'm a 17 year old male and I'm just gonna start 11th grade. I am VERY introverted and I have social anxiety and I feel like having Borderline-PTSD when I see a classmate in public, it just freaks me out. I was attending a different highschool for almost 2 years, where I had good friends and everyone was welcoming and accepting, but I've got dragged into stuff what I wasn't part of and they were threathening expelling so I had to change schools. I went to the local high school 2 months before finishing 9th grade(I had a ""Pre-9"" class, I don't know how to word it, it was basically a preparing class which we referred to as ""Class 0"") because of this and the new class wasn't really welcoming and I was stressed out for the 2 months. Fast forward to last September. My parents started to see that I don't feel that good and my grades are getting worse and I told them that I don't like being in this school(or in any other community that is new to me), but there is no decent nearby school that I could go into. So we talked to the Principal and we came to the conclusion that I'm gonna be a Private Student who has to take an exam in January and June. I was doing fine, when the government cancelled the whole Private Studying thingy by the 1st of September and now I have to go to school into the same class. How could I overcome my anxiety or try to enjoy/bear being in school? I was told that I looked like a damn Tractor hit me every day when I went home, and I totally felt like that.

PS: I was bullied for the first 5 years of school that probably made me introverted/socially anxious even more. Maybe that's a reason why this is happening.",29Aug2019,1
359,"So I have to contact some people I haven't talked to in a while. Some are my family members, others are family friends. I live in a different country to them, which is why we haven't spoken in a while, but also because I never really made an effort to contact them.

Well now in a few months, I am moving back to the country they live in, (which is the country I was born in) and I need a place to stay for a week or two while I search for someplace to rent. 

I'm worried about contacting them again, I feel like it comes off as I want to use them. But I also genuinely want to see them again. I just don't know if they will believe me since I have made no effort whatsoever in the past...

361,"So to start off I’m 19 living with my parents. I’ve been researching ball pythons for a couple of weeks and I’m very interested in getting one. It’s all I’ve been thinking about and researching, I’ve gone to different stores and talked to snake handlers. I have enough money to get the one I really want. 

so I asked my parents about it, because I still live under there roof. They instantly said no. I started to cry a little bit because I’m so invested in this. I kindly asked why they didn’t want me to get one and there answer was “they are hard to take care of, the require a lot of care, they get sick easily, they need to be fed often and it cost a lot of money to feed them” which from my research is all incorrect. Every point they made was very incorrect, and not in an opinion way, in a factual way. I would reply with what I’ve learned and kindly tell them that they are incorrect, and they just told me to drop it. It really devastated me, and felt like they wouldn’t even let me talk. And i know I’m young, I know I still have so much to learn, but I just don’t understand. 

So now I’m at the point where I want to bring it up again, and try my best to clearly tell them why I want one, how it’s an easier pet to take care of, how much research I’ve done, that I know it’s a responsibility. But I’m afraid  that they won’t listen. Any advise on how I could approach this? Should I just move on and not bring it up again? 

TL;DR I really want a ball python, but parent last won’t let me for reasons that are incorrect.",29Aug2019,1

I then told her that i don't think i could just on the fact that i don't think i could handle it if she ever found someone herself. When i told her that i don't think i could stay friends she began cry, like really cry. I told her that i just need some time and distance, it has been a week since i have talked to her.

374,"In 3rd grade, me name was Jack and there was another Jack in my class, and so everyone agreed to call me Jacky. I realized that it was feminine in 5th grade and then that dude tried to have sex with me. Were both guys and I pushed him off of me. In Highschool I had hooked up with one girl and one fling with a girl but she ended up being a total scandalous person and used me for weed and money. I was a pushover. I got bullied a lot for being a white nerd with glasses and pushed around. I broke my spine in football freshman year and was hazed by the team and stopped playing. My closest friend used to say I was a faggot just like my Dad who was an idiot who fried his brains from drugs and Its sad how I am gonna end up just like him some day. I got a girlfriend in college. She was nerdy and was attracted to me being a nerd. I overcame being a nerd and was cooler. It felt like she was trying to keep me a loser to have a stable husband. She wanted to be the dominant one in the relationship. My other best friend who is a guy said she seemed like a Hoe and I should not trust her, started flirting with her and making her laugh a ton when we hung out, would flex on me to make me look inferior around my girlfriend. She liked him I kinda could tell but she was dating me so she hated him and we both blocked him. I was at a party and he was there, and tried to fight me and grab my balls and say these are mine. He used to be my best friend. My girlfriend noticed I got insecure after that and after a year of dating I had a panic attack and woke up in the hospital right when she walked in the room. I thought we were soul mates after that. A week later she blocked me and left me for someone else who was nerdy. I was devastated. First relationship. 19. My last friend left, who was hispanic, helped me through it. He had a drinking problem and wore all black and said he loved embracing the dark and loved his 'dark skin' i thought it was weird. He also said stuff like I bet you think Im a dirty beaner and he assumed everyone was racist. I was like dude wtf that didnt matter when we were all little kids why cant we just keep things like it was then? When we would drink, he would sleep in my closet. I thought that was super weird. When politics got weird, for some reason my parents decided to be trump supporters. I dont keep up with that. My friend was an illegal. His brothers were all in gangs. He would sleep in my closet right under my Moms bed and tell me he had dreams of him getting a warm bath and shit, i thought it was super weird. He was like fuck trump. He was teaching me spanish and so my Mom liked him and I thought it felt super weird. It felt like his 'dark energy' was like sexually taking advantage of my mom or of her emotions because he was always like fuck trump and my mom was always saying she wants america to be safe. I felt like this whole thing was super symbolic on a micro chasm of whats happening in the macro of the world and it got way to real and freaked me out... then I ran into cuck porn online of these submissive white men letting a black guy with a huge dick fuck their wife in front of them and they like being humiliated and everyone was saying black people are the superior race and whites are submissive cucks... i was at a party with him in a weird neighborhood telling his friend about how I used to take shrooms but dont anymore because it fucked me in the head and I pointed my middle finger to my head I guess that was the wrong move.. and he dropped his beer got up and went to the fridge and it looked like he was like fucking the fridge and demonically everyone turned and started nodding at me mouthing with their lips ""hes fucking your mom"". Then I just sat there and felt like I was dying and I heard my friend say I was a cuck and i just lost the will to live... and then it felt like i was literally fading out of existence because it felt like i just cursed out my Mom or something... everyone was really high and drunk so idk what was real and what wasnt... and then it felt like I was being nailed into a cross... and then my friend said ...i didnt mean it like that...! they all went from making fun of me to giving me food and water and trying to help cheer and sober me up... then later a few weeks that friend broke into my house and robbed me with a blood and his gangster brothers... i blocked everyone out of my life... then I met this black guy randomly who said the holy spirit connected us and he started showing me how that was Jesus who saved me at the party... my life has been on a crazy trip and it feels like ive been so manipulated and hurt by everyone im losing sanity.

376,"(Sorry if this is gross.) I’m a middle-aged man who has always had food &amp; body issues. I am very careful about what I eat most of the time. Every once in a while I go crazy and eat a ton of sugar and bad for you items — usually this is ok, I give myself “cheat days” and it’s fine. Sometimes I binge when I hadn’t intended to. I have had pretty bad GERD for a long time, it causes me to regurgitate food, mainly when I eat the wrong things (fried food, chocolate, and when I overeat). I don’t do anything to make myself regurgitate, it just happens, though if I concentrate I can kind of control it a little. I’m on medication and see a gastroenterologist — I have it as under control as it’s going to be. (As far as I know no one but my therapist knows about the regurgitation thing because obviously it’s disgusting.)

Last night I was on one of my eat lean days and I started getting sugar cravings so I went a little nuts on my candy stash. Nothing major just a few peanut butter cups and a kit kat. And then I started regurgitating, triggered by the chocolate, but rather than “force it back down” I kind of encouraged it (I didn’t gag myself or anything, like I said I can control it) and essentially made myself vomit a bunch of times and spit it out into the toilet. This is not the first time I’ve done it, but it isn’t that frequent. (Maybe every couple months or so?)

So is this a problem? Am I bulimic? I’d be regurgitating anyway — the chocolate makes it happen (and I’m not going to cut out chocolate, just ain’t gonna happen), it’s just how I deal with it. 

tl;dr — sometimes I binge a bit and use my naturally occurring GERD to vomit it out, and I’m not sure if this is unhealthy.",29Aug2019,1

382,"Hey all! This is a throwaway account

&amp;#x200B;

I really have a lot in my mind, a lot that I don't even know where to start, I guess I should start by telling you about my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I was born to a quite privileged family, both of my parents are doing business which led to them spending not so much time with me when I was a kid. I had a pretty good childhood until the first grade of elementary school. I had some bad childhood memories in the past, it was an abuse, my parent used to beat me up whenever I can't do simple math problems (yeah, my parent is that strict, but not my mom), sometimes there's this flashback thing about when when my parent threw a book from the second floor of my house to me (yes i was downstairs) but it wasn't just a regular book...... it was a 1000+ page encyclopedia with a hard cover, my parent did it because I keep not knowing how to do this specific math problem and his emotions blew up, there was also that time where he kicked me in my room and had my computer CPU thrown at me just because my room was a bit messy. From that moment, I keep thinking that my parent hates me for existing or something. I also have another siblings but my parent doesn't treat them like the way he treated me. Although, he's super generous to me and my siblings, but I feel like I'm his least favorite child.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I'm also gay and I'm not planning on coming out anytime soon, my family is known as that homophobic family who clearly won't support me. My parent also told me that they wIlL nOt bE aBlE tO pAy fOr mY cOlLeGe tUiTiOn and his reason was that he cOuLd nOt bE aBlE tO aFfOrD iT when my siblings are still going to a f\*\*\*\*\*g private high school for $60k/year (someone please make it make sense) and he also basically lied to me about not being able to afford my school when I literally saw that he makes grossly millions per year.........so basically like he doesn't want to pay my tuition???????? I don't know but I'm pretty sure that without him paying my tuition, there would be no way that I can pay my own tuition when my tuition is around $70k/year. I was planning to leave them all because I have a trust fund from my grandfather but they keep holding onto it, not releasing it to me, even tho it says that the fund should be released when I'm 18.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I feel like I'm just not wanted in this world (or probably the condom broke when they were having sex, so thats why they treat me like shit) and there are also a lot of problems going on with my life. I have talked to some of my friends about this but they didn't seem to care about it that much and just brushed it away. Every friends I talk to think that I don't have any issues going on with my life, and also - I don't have that many friends so its getting lonely at some point. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm tired of keeping the burden that eats me slowly, I always try to make jokes out of my problems, it seems to hold me pretty well sometimes but idk its just running out i guess. Part of me also don't trust my parent(s) because of something they did in the past",29Aug2019,1

385,"Hello Reddit.

Last night, as my fiancé was walking me to my car I noticed that his aunt (who happens to live with him) parked behind my car but rammed into my bumper slightly. Her car was still physically on mine. I am immediately upset, and I pull my car forward to see if there was any damage. There were three small marks that were made, each 1 cm or less. 
I was upset, and went back inside to let her know that she had damaged my car a bit. She took a look at the scratches and said- “what now? Do you want me to pay for this?”, And I said that I’d need to see how much it would be. She then walks back into the house and I drove off after talking with my fiancé after.

I feel like I really shouldn’t have gone back inside to make her look at the damage. I should have let it go after seeing the tiny scratches, but I didn’t.

Should I apologize for overreacting?",29Aug2019,1
386,"My gf is going through a very  difficult time (She has a drepression). She has been feeling down and bad for 2 weeks (for her that is a long time, normally it's a couple of days). Some days ago she went to the  psychiatrist and she got mad because she is dating someone. She is putting me before her self and that is preventing her from helping and healing her self. And now i'm stuck not knowing what to do. I love her and don't want to lose her she is the best person i have ever met. But i don't want to be a reason for her to not help her self.",29Aug2019,1
387,"I have a crush on a coworker ever since I caught her looking at me and I thought she looked really pretty. I am currently in a relationship and don't get me wrong, I really love my girlfriend and would do anything for her. But the thing is everytime I see this crush of mine in the office I always check her out and sometimes look at her everytime she stands up and walked in front of my workstation. I caught her looking at me again when I walk passed by her while she is sitting in front of the computer and she looked down on the floor immediately when I noticed her. Me, being kind of a snobbish guy looked away like its nothing but deep down inside, my heart beated so fast I feel like I just ran a marathon lol. I do not know if this is normal or not. I am just really attracted to her everytime I see her but kind of forget her when I see my girlfriend. I currently resigned at this job due to not being happy working there anymore and wanting to follow my passion and I have been planning to admit to her that I have a crush on her before I leave the company lol. Just so I can  release some feelings and then forget her totally. What should I do? Should it be just a well kept secret that I myself only know or should I tell her?  Its been nearly 8 months since I had a crush on her!",29Aug2019,0
388,"I’m almost always being rude to my mom. I know that it’s not a good thing to do, but I find it impossible to have a conversation with her, so I end up avoiding her, giving her short replies, telling her I don’t want to talk to her… Of course, it ends up in arguments more often than not. 

Now, the reason why I act like this is that she’s been shaming me since forever for what I like and what I do. Like a high school bully, except she is my mom. The overall feeling I get is that she’s disappointed in me for not being the perfect daughter she expected to have.

&amp;#x200B;

Back when I was a teen she shamed me for liking games and anime (because apparently that’s only acceptable for kids and boys), told me it was my fault that I had no friends (I was bullied), and always told me that no one would ever want me around because I’m awful (she meant I wasn’t “normal” because I liked “kids” stuff, because I’m kinda tomboyish...).

Now I’m in my 20s. Whatever I do is never good enough for her. And all criticism is always destructive. 

A while ago we got into an argument for something silly and she told me to go get fucked. I responded with “same to you”, to which she replied “at least I enjoy it, apparently you don’t. That’s why I’m telling you to get fucked”. I’ve never told her, but I guess she figured out I’m asexual and she just shamed me for it and basically told me to get raped. Fine, I guess.

 

Anyway, it has become impossible for us to have a conversation that doesn’t end up in an argument, partly because it has come to the point that I overreact to everything she says. I cannot help it. 

I would like to talk it out, but talking to her is impossible because she never listens to anyone, thinks her opinions are the only valid ones… Sigh, let’s say she’s difficult to deal with.

If she were a friend or something, I would have already cut all ties with her, but she’s my mom. I’m looking forward to moving out, just so I don’t have to deal with her on a daily basis. I feel like distancing myself is the best solution there is.

&amp;#x200B;

Any ideas on what I should do? Do you think that when I move out our relationship will get better (since we won’t have to deal with each other daily)? Any tips on how to control my rudeness to her?",29Aug2019,2
389,"I came to a stop after driving through a row of parked cars and went to make a right turn in a parking lot on the main road. After seeing a clear path I let go of the brake and started to roll. I stopped, not suddenly because I was crawling and it wasn't needed, because I saw a woman walking between 2 cars and came out into the road in my path. She didnt stop or look both ways before crossing, or at least I didnt see that part at all. So as I'm sitting there stopped for her she turns to my car, jumps and screams along with calling me an asshole and continued looking back at me. My window was already rolled down slightly and I said calmly Oh I'm sorry, are you alright, because I understand she was scared but it's not like I was doing anything reckless. Only 1 or 2 other people were in the parking lot at that time, it was very early in the morning. 

I know I didn't do anything wrong, but I was more embarrassed to go into the same building as her because of how dramatic her reaction was. Also I go to this place the same time every day so I will most likely be seeing this woman. I figured I'd let her cool off for a day, before I enter my normal routine.

My question is when I see her again do I approach her? Do I just ignore her and go on as if it's a normal day?",29Aug2019,1
390,"So I want to start out by saying it’s not that I dislike my roommates at all, it’s just become very apparent that their lifestyle doesn’t really match with mine. I’m not on the lease yet, but if I moved the share of everyone’s rent would increase and I would feel like a total dick. I just want to know if these problems seem move worthy or if I should attempt to stick it out. 

1) there are no locks on the doors. The house is always unlocked, and nobody seems bothered by it. I’ve brought it up to ask when we are getting locks and it doesn’t look like it’s happening. 

2) there is a one lane driveway with 5 cars. This is a major hassle when it comes to trying to leave my house. We keep keys in a common space so we can move cars but it’s becoming more frequent that people don’t leave their keys, and one of the cars I can’t even drive because it’s a stick shift and a finicky one at that. I’ve been stuck at the house because of the car, and I’m technically not allowed to Uber to work or be dropped off by someone else do to confidentiality reasons, so I’d have to walk. I work at 10pm in not the safest area so it scares me to have to do that. 

3) I don’t trust them with my cat. They’re very nice people, but the cats that have previously lived there with the same people got out a lot. They leave doors and windows open often. They’re also very social, bring people around I don’t know, and get very not sober. I just don’t feel comfortable with my cat around that. If I lost him I would be devastated. 

4) finally, I work night shifts meaning I NEED to sleep during the day. This just doesn’t happen. There is always yelling and slamming doors, and they know my work/sleep schedule so I’m not sure if this is something that would change if I talked to them. I also feel it’s a little unfair of me to like, force quiet hours when a majority of the house is up and active during that time. 

The more I think about it, the more I just wanna live alone. I’ve found a studio that’s a lot more expensive than my current situation but still doable. But I don’t know if these are legit reasons to move or something I need to force myself to get over. I’ve talked to them about my concerns but they just brush it off, I haven’t told them I’m considering moving. I just don’t know what to do.",29Aug2019,1

I've slowly started to be ignored in conversations, having eyes rolled at me, not being told about upcoming plans, etc.

I didn't realize how bad things had gotten until just now.

I work in software development in the United States, and we contracted a guy from Egypt for the past year or so. He was recently let go. However, about a month ago I had learned that he was planning on moving to Turkey to give his kids and wife a better life in terms of schooling and health. He is a 33 years old. 

I have been setting aside some money over the last few years with the strict intent that it would be money I either donated to a worthy cause, or it was used to help someone in need.

I have about 5k saved up for this purpose.

I really want to help this guy to either have some money while he looks for another job, or to help him use it for the move to Turkey.

My original intent was to give him half of the 5k.

After talking with a friend, they asked some though questions. Which got me thinking. 

What are the implications of sending a large sum of money to him? Is he going to ask for money in the future? Then will I have to say no, or actually give it to him since I do have more saved up. 2.5k is almost a month's worth of salary for him.

Could the money be better utilized by someone in greater need? How the heck do you even quantify that, and how can I be the determiner of such a thing? My go to charity is Doctors Without Borders who I know are helping super critical areas and those in extreme need.

LONG POST AHEAD ABOUT INFIDELITY

\*I will be using they/their/etc/SO instead of he/she in order to preserve some anonymity in case the wrong person stumbles across this. \*

I just graduated university, and decided to do a little soul searching in Asia. I planned to leave for roughly 3.5 weeks, and am currently writing this from abroad, while in the midst of my trip. 

While abroad, my significant other decided to cheat. And by cheat, I mean the full nine yards. Sex, included, emotional attachment, everything.

\*Backstory\*

Now before I left the country, my significant other had begun texting a person I was not familiar with (was a friend of a friend, i have now come to learn) pretty frequently. I thought nothing of it, as i had no reason to be insecure in our relationship.

Within my first two days in Asia, she messaged me when I was out partying with some of my friends, and my SO informed me that they had cheated. They told me that someone had begun flirting with them and they entertained it, allowing for it to happen and going as far as to hang out with them one on one. (I will refer to this someone as X from this point forward.) One thing led to another and X ended up kissing my SO. This is all they told me at the time. I did not take this well as I’m the type of person who still thinks emotional cheating is a type of cheating, but was willing to look past it as they were honest with me and seemed to be truly sorry. They told me nothing else had occurred and they had to tell me as the guilt was eating away at them.

This is not what truly happened, or what they had told their friends.

\*Fast forward two days\*

My significant other has been dealing with some significant mental health issues, including severe depression and anxiety disorders. They had an episode last week regarding her friends and attempted to take their own life. Obviously being overseas, I did what I could and called my SO’s friends asking them to contact the local police department. They did so, and after my SO was hospitalized, I got to wondering; was what happened with my SO and X all that really happened? So asked their friend, what really happened. At first they hesitated and the finally told me the full story - my SO had not only kissed him, they had hung out numerous times and SO had gone over to X’s house 3 or 4 times and had sex. Myself being very impulsive, immediately asked my SO. In hindsight, I should have waited until they were released from the hospital and under better care, but I am very impulsive and do not often make rational decisions especially when it comes to my emotions. I confronted her and they repeatedly began to deny it asking why I would even consider saying such a thing. Something in my gut told me they were lying and I kept pressing the issue forward, unrelenting. 

At first they denied the whole story. They first flipped the question to me, asking why I didn’t trust them. Saying why would I ever say such a thing, and asking what was wrong with me and if I wanted for them to kill themselves. My stupid ass kept pushing at the question for over 6 hours, my SO began to slip up on their story. At first they admitted they hung out more than a couple times, then they admitted that they had gone over to X’s place. At first my SO said they were never alone together, then I got frustrated. I told her I knew the whole story and just wanted for her to confess, and hung up on my SO. They called back immediately. I ended up punching a wall and fracturing 2 of my knuckle. My SO kept calling me back over the next 30 minutes repeatedly, and when I finally picked up, they admitted to it. They said they had slept together once. I knew this wasn’t the case but decided to not press the issue and simply hung up the phone. My SO then called back threatening to kill themselves while in the hospital, and I hung up every time suicide was mentioned as that shouldn’t be something someone takes lightly, especially in this type of situation. They agreed not to mention suicide anymore, and we began to talk a little bit. 

Their friend had told me that they met at the club within the second night of my departure and that my SO had informed X that I was gone for 3 weeks, and that our relationship was coming to an end because of our differences. On the second night, they went home together. My SO snapped me pictures of their bruises saying ""where did this come from?"" cause i am aware they bruise very easily, and my SO's friend informed me that my SO had told them that they were the result of having sex with X.

My SO lied to all of his/her/their friends in order to cover this affair up, and to my direct face over the span of a week even though I asked point blank if anything else had occurred. After this issue had blown up in my SO’s face, all of his/her/their friends messaged me saying he/she/they were absolutely crazy and that they would be cutting them off, as he/she/they had absolutely drained them over the past month by creating different problems such as this.

He/she/they keep messaging me asking for forgiveness, and although the apology does seem sincere, I am not sure I can take back someone who would blatantly lie to my face about something so severe. To further complicate things, my SO’s mother is constantly texting me asking for their child’s forgiveness.

Reddit, what do I do? I do love my SO very much, and I am so deeply conflicted. I do want to be with them, but I am aware of the fact that things may never be the same. My SO has suggested that I cheat on them back, so I can inflict the same pain, however I feel like that is so toxic there is no point of being in a relationship at that point. My SO begins treatment with different therapists and psychiatrists regarding their mental health issues, which I feel further complicates the issue.

c) im a girl.

ok now -- for many years i have watched porn (since about 12, im 18 now), it didn't affect my life at all and ive never seen or had a problem with it. then a couple years ago i discovered bestiality porn. dog and girl, man and dog. it got me off faster than any other porn, i can't explain it.  but typical story, the moment im finished, i feel disgusted with myself. i immediately close the tabs and swear i'll never look at it again. sometimes it lasts, and i dont watch it for months. and feel much better for it. but mostly, every time i want to get off fast, ill watch beastiality. it always does the job and usually within minutes. which is why stopping watching it is hard. i know it works. and if i want to just cum quick, thats what ill search for.

im ashamed of myself. i hate it. i dont want to be watching this shit. other porn works, but it never gets me off as quick or as easily at beastiality porn. 

ive seen people say that it shouldn't matter as long as its just watching it, that its ""just a kink"", that as long as im not actually hurting animals its not a problem; whatever. this is not acceptable to me. hurting animals is and should **not** be considered a kink, certainly not to me. i dont care if its ""technically ok"" or its legal to watch it: i dont want to be watching it, full stop.

so please help me. what can i do to stop myself from watching this shit? please.

420,"I am 21 and I've lived on my own in a council flat near enough since I was 17. I've never had any major problems until now and I don't really know what to do about this. There's a lot of information behind this however I am going to shorten it. But I would really appreciate some sort of help cause it's really taking a toll on my mental health.

My neighbour who is probably late 50s, lives directly across from me is quite a violent and crazy man, apparently has PTSD, but it was caused from being violent and ending up getting stabbed due to being so aggressive. To put it straight the guy scares me a and my upstairs neighbour, he's very intimidating and very aggressive. 

A couple of weeks back we got into a small dispute because he was being incredibly noisy with DIY in the shared close we have at antisocial hours. I politely asked him to keep it down but instead lashed out calling me a bitch. The following day he lashed out again when I was leaving my flat as I ignored his apology but this time he also came right up to me and threatened to attack me. That day I complained to the council antisocial team as well as called 101 and told them about the incident. This took a toll on me a lot as I became scared to go home and leave my flat incase something happened. I stayed at my partners that night and when I went home the following day, my partner accompanied me to make sure I was okay. Unfortunately as I was unlocking the door to my apartment my neighbour attempted to speak to us again and then threatened to kill us when we ignored him. When we got into our flat and locked the door he banged on my front door for like two minutes until he gave up and went home. We called 999 however no officers came out that night and they didn't show up till the following night. During those two days he was forcing passive aggressive notes through my door basically saying I need to accept his apology or else. 

Anyway once the police finally arrived they warned him to have no contact with me or my partner whatsoever and that was it. Since then nothing has happened but the man spends all his time pretty much acting like he owns the place, setting up chairs in the close and will sit there loudly chatting and shouting to his friends. I'm scared to leave because the guy isn't right at all in the head. My mental health has taken a huge toll because of this and I don't feel I can leave my flat because he is always there. I've kept the antisocial team up to date with everything and apparently the guy has had loads of complaints against him already since he's moved here. I've put in another application to the housing department but I likely will be waiting another 2 years for a flat, and I don't earn enough right now to move out and live in private accommodation, as well since I have a pet a lot of private landlords I looked at won't accept pets.",29Aug2019,1

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ttthe company name I said then  ‘ohhhh/mmmm...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

424,"I am a 12 year old girl in year 7 and I enjoy cutting myself. It’s not because I have depression or anything but I gain pleasure form hurting myself. Every time I get injured or hurt it brings me a weird sensation in while I feel a burst of adrenaline and it makes me feel very good.

I don’t enjoy looking at people get hurt I usually gag at the sight of blood and have a phobia of it. However, I enjoy hurting myself with scissors. I just want to know what’s wrong with me.

I know some people would recommend me telling my parents or some psychologist at school but I sadly can’t because my parents wouldn’t be understanding and would just call me crazy and it would make my perfectly normal life go down hill.

429,"Right now I’m 17 in my senior year of high school. Last year when I was a junior there was a girl in one of my classes. I’m really shy and quiet, so I don’t talk to others much. I just really liked her, she’s done things that make me think maybe she liked me? I don’t know why she would. I don’t really have friends at school. I’ll say what she’s done that makes me think maybe. 

Her friend just randomly said ‘hi (her name)’ and they started talking while I was the only other person at the table. She said her sister was sick and said her sisters full name, then repeated it. Maybe she wanted my to then know her own last name? 

In the class we had to try looking each other in the eyes and talk to each other. I just explained that I was shy, but I didn’t feel quite as uncomfortable looking her in the eyes as anyone else, but she just said ‘shys okay’ a few times and seemed glad when I said we were in the same grade. 

The class did some presentations, and when she did hers she kinda walked around the room in circles, everytime she passed me, she slowly brushed past against my back.

After that class, my teacher stopped me and asked if I wanted to present to just the teacher in a while, instead of the class, but the girl stopped packing up, and watched me. We were the only students in the class still. She was still in the class when I left.

I’ve never really felt like this about anyone before. For a while almost every time I saw her in the halls, she was holding one guy’s hand, but then suddenly I never saw that guy again, and she was always by herself in the halls. I wanted to let her know, my mom just isn’t the most mentally stable person, and can take little things and reach and try to say I’m doing something bad or something. 

Summers over, and now she isn’t in any of my classes, and I haven’t seen her in the halls, and I’m worried I blew my chance. I’m thinking about looking her up, but I don’t want to be a creep or invade her privacy, or anything. Maybe just see if she has social media, make an account for that (I literally have 0 social media aside from this and YouTube if you count them), and ask if she’s dating anyone. I’m also thinking about telling my dad about it.",29Aug2019,1

We only chatted. You know that feel when you chat with friend and you disagree about some minor thing? yeah, Mary needed to win every little argument about stupid things. She is a PRO at arguing because of her past(frequent disagreement with parents). Mary won all of those arguments. Even the bigger ones. I still considered Mary to be my friend but the fact she wanted to destroy me with words pissed me off. I tried message her less often but i found myself often thinking about those arguments and  trying to win them at least in my head. i felt moredestroyed the more i thought about it.

I mentioned how i feel to my other friend. lets call him Simon. he knows us both. he sayed that Mary seems to be ok to him and that she is a good friend. few days later i was in a bad mood, i was stressed about school and i slept only 3 hours before i went to work that day(poor sleep management). out of anger i quickly texted Simon this ""If i ever committed suicide i would kill Mary first and then myself""(not exactly this, i translated it). Simon told Mary and Mary texted me. She was wondering why do i hate her so much. And that i need to stop acting like a child. Mary challenged me to solve this in a discussion like an adult.

I did not responded (i was at work and i didnt wanted to send her something spontaneous). then her boyfriend send me an chat request. he is a good person but i didn't responded either. 

Yes i am childish sometimes and im not a perfect but i want at least some respect. My communication skills are poor so i thought best thing i can do i ask reddit. Should i even message her? What about Simon is he really my friend?

438," Title says it all really - She was saving us doing it for a little while because she didn't want to be too easy so when we actually were going to do it, I asked her and made sure she really wanted to.

The conversation was a bit long and kinda stalled the fore play and got me a little anxious but I was still able to get her off - the issue is that

1.) The condom was pretty uncomfortable, for me  
2.) I was overly worried about cumming too soon at first, and   
3.) after a couple minutes, she finished, and asked me if I had yet which automatically kicks my mind into thinking she's just waiting for me to finish (even more pressure)...

So I was getting a little worn out and really like to be on bottom so I had her climb up - but by the time we got situated, I'm too worked up about her just waiting for me to finish that I actually went soft... obviously this lead to a great post-sex conversation to have your first time with someone.  She just seemed really upset at first and insecure which made me feel so mean.

I don’t know why this happens. I hate this person. When we dated, I always felt bad. I’m not jealous about anything that happened after, I’m actually glad it’s over lol. But how do I stop thinking about her, or how do I get rid of this feeling when I do?",29Aug2019,1

446," Hey guys. I'm going to preface this with a bit of background so I apologize for the long post. I'll put a tl;dr at the end.  


I'm going to hit 28yo in about 2 months. I only finished High School. For about 7 years I worked in a cellphone kiosk, until I got fed up of working in public. Now my uncle, he owns a company here in Canada. The company manufactures industrial racking, the stuff you put pallets on (like in Costco, warehouses, etc). I went to him to get a job, being a salesman for the bigger part of my life. He opened the door for me, and I still am extremely grateful.   


I've been working there for three years now. The first years was ok, as I wasn't straight up on my own. Being a relatively small company, we lack structure. There's no HR, no departments, no air filters, it's all extremely ''Babyboomer'', if you will.  The two years that follow have me selling across the country, and even in the states. I've been doing extremely well, which is good since I work on commission. The problem is that I still make a lot of mistakes, because in this company, it's every man for himself. The salesmen are entirely responsible for what they sell, up to the installation of the material and the payment. Some customers can straight up not pay to get their way and we have no leverage. The first few times, the company absorbed the few mistakes I made, but now they're starting to dock it on my commission. I work with only Generation Y and Baby boomer people, who do not value good work conditions. The company is, honestly, imploding on itself, growing too fast, and the higher ups will not spend on adding structure.   


In July, I rented a condo with my girlfriend that costs us a reasonable amount. I feel like I'm too old to go to school. I can't go back to working minimum wage either, and in Canada, to get unemployment payment until you get back on your feet, you need to get fired. To be honest, my personal life is the only thing that's keeping me composed. I have great friends.I have a great girlfriend and a cute little dog, I love them both with all my heart. I just had a two-weeks vacation and I thought that it would allow me to get better, but it didn't.  


Fast forward to the past few months. Every morning, I wake up feeling nothing but dread and emptiness. I get to work and I cannot stay there for more than a few hours until I need to head home under the pretext that I'm meeting customers. People rub me the wrong way and I feel cold, unaffected by what people think. But people don't give a shit, because I'm still selling, so technically I'm doing my job. All the pressure from customers calling and the immediate emergencies that need to be fixed ''right fucking now'' is making me feel physically sick.  


But it's a family business. My uncle is the CEO, my aunt leader of production, my dad is the sales director, etc. I can't leave, both because I can't pick my balls up from the floor and because I'd be deep in debts if I did. I can't go back to school, because I can't afford it and because I'm too old.  
Then, yesterday, I tried getting fired. My uncle stepped in my office to scream at me for an installation that went wrong (entirely the customer's fault, as always) and telling me that I would be the one paying for the extra time it took. I told him not to scream at me and to fire me if I wasn't doing my job well, not to hold back because I'm his nephew. He back-pedaled and started being calm and complimenting me on my sales skills.  


So I went all the way back to the start. I'm still here, sitting in my office, writing a post for Reddit users to help me, and wondering if I can get away with leaving at noon again for the 4th day in a row to go take a warm bath and stare at the ceiling. I don't even know what to do with my life. And I can't take time-off or call it a burnout, because I'm working with Baby boomers who think burnouts are an excuse to have time off. See the difference between us and them is the following:  
To baby boomers, work is life and personal life is a side-chapter.  
To us, personal life comes first and work is a thing we have to get rid of every day.   
They live to work, we work to live.  


tl;dr : I work for my family and I can't get out of there because I would honestly be fucked in any way imaginable.

S is in her late 50s, and is having a rough time in life; she is leaving her husband and moving to another state, the details of which I'm sure are overwhelming. Even though I don't believe it's work appropriate, I do my best to listen when she complains about her home situation and offer support when I can. 

Problem: The issue is that S's bad attitude is completely overwhelming. She complains about everything. Not in a whiny way, but in a spiteful, bitter, vitriolic way. She is not very good with technology, and every time something doesn't work, I hear ""THIS IS SO FUCKING STUPID"" over the divider. She has a very easy job overall, and yet finds ways to constantly complain about the bare minimum work she is asked to do. Example: Someone asked her for a form the other day and ended up needing a different form instead. She went off about ""people are so fucking stupid, what a fucking waste of my time, why can't anyone ask for what they want or do their job right?"" 

I have some anxiety issues and I tend to feed off of other people's energy. I was asked to go to an update meeting with our supervisor earlier this week, and S said to me ""prepare to get written up, I'm sure they'll make up lies about you"". S got written up for having a consistent poor attitude a week ago, a write up she insists is ""made up of lies"" because they're ""targeting and harassing her"". I knew I had done nothing wrong, but her saying 'prepare to get written up' to me almost sent me into a panic attack. It was very unnecessary, and really negatively impacted my productivity that day. 

It's simply an incredibly toxic environment to be a part of, especially because of my mental health. While I don't expect everyone to be sunshine and rainbows, the constant litany of ""fuck this, fuck that, everyone here is bitches"" that comes from her really weighs on me. Also, because I am sometimes seen listening to her, I worry that people assume I am commiserating or in agreement with her complaints, and I don't want her reputation to rub off on me. 

Our summer hours (during which we were working from home two days per week) are ending. So while I only had to see her one or two days per week for the last several months, I will now be back in the office with her five days a week. 

Question: What do I do? I'm worried about directly confronting her, because she will most assuredly become angry at me, which will further degrade my work environment. I'm not much of a tattle tale and am worried that if I say anything to my supervisor it will be obvious that I was the one who complained. I also try not to complain unless I have a solution to the problem, and the only solution I see is requesting to move offices, which will make it obvious that I'm trying to get away from her. S is leaving in about a month (allegedly), so I could just sit back and put up with it. But it's becoming more difficult to tolerate her on a daily basis, and I think eventually I will snap. 

This isn't just a job for me, it's a career, and I don't want this situation to negatively impact my future. I am worried that it could do so no matter what course of action I decide upon. So I'd really appreciate any advice from anyone, but particularly from any young professionals out there who are trying to build a career and a good reputation for themselves and have dealt with difficult co-workers.

457,"Sorry this is actually the first time I’m writing a notice. I really want to leave this company on a good note, I’ve really enjoyed working with them but ultimately something better has come along. So I’m not sure what to write on the notice so it doesn’t come across too harsh or mean in any way. I’m the person who does all of the admin work atm so I’m kind of leaving them in a tough spot for a while, but my notice is two weeks. 

Also I’m a pretty emotional person and I don’t wanna cry lol but I have a feeling I will. My boss is a lovely old man and I feel like I’m gonna shed a tear or 100 tears. Is that bad?

Thanks in advance",29Aug2019,6
459,"My mom had anger issues all her life and whenever I try to discuss it with her, she gets angry at me and denies it and tries to insult me back. I remember when I was six years old, I was studying shortly in a foreign country and I was absolutely terrible at English(English is not my first language). I wasn't able to memorize the alphabets and I was just very slow when it came to learning the language. For this reason, my mom threatened to send me to an orphanage and she actually threw me out of the house, not once but twice. I had to beg her to take me back. I also remember that whenever I would wake up late, she would literally start beating the shit out of me and cursing at me. I remember one time, she thought we were late and started beating me to wake me up and then when we out to wait for the bus, she realized we were an hour early. She never apologized. In fact, she never apologizes for anything. Once, in middle school, my mom and I were talking and it came to the conversation of when I was younger. I tried to tell her that I thought it was wrong how she treated me just because I was bad at English, and she got mad at me and told me that any parent would do that if their child was me.

My father and mother also treated my older brother terribly. He was not good at studying and he got low grades on his tests. My parents would beat the shit out of him. I remember I was playing games with my brother on his computer, when he should have been studying, and my parents found out when they came home. They literally grabbed a golf stick and hit him with it. I vividly remember my mother grabbing my brother by his face while he cried and telling my father to beat him while she held him. That made me cry when I witnessed what happened and thinking about it still makes me cry. I'm crying as I write this. My parents kicked him out of the house because he wasn't studying. My parents told me to lie that my brother was in the army if people ever asked me because it was ""embarrassing"" that he didn't go to university and also because she didn't want to look bad.

Now, it's happening to me. I'm not going to lie and say that I grew up to be a good kid because honestly, I am a terrible kid. So it just makes it so confusing because I don't know if my parents are in the wrong or if I deserve it. When I was in middle school, my parents were incredibly strict on studying. My mom wanted me to be some sort of child prodigy, but I wasn't. She wanted me to complete high school math(Geometry to Calculus) and middle school math in a spam of 2 years(in my middle school years). I'm definitely not some fucking genius, ESPECIALLY in math because I suck at math so bad, so how the hell was I supposed to do that? When I didn't understand a question and tried to ask her, she would get mad at me and yell at me to find it on my own to ""train"" me to learn on my own. I don't know if it was because of this, but in 8th grade, when puberty hit hard, I started acting rebellious and stopped studying. Surprisingly, I still passed the classes while getting As and Bs. That's when my best friend(Maddy) and I decided to try drinking alcohol. I was at a sleepover with her and we snuck out at midnight to drink alcohol at this bar. Then, after that, I got used to drinking. I found this app on my phone where I can talk to strangers and I decided to meet up with this guy to drink together(I was a huge fucking dumbass). We were supposed to meet at a subway station and I spotted him. He was not what I imagined looking like at all because he looked really creepy. I got scared and ditched him and decided to drink on my own. I went to my best friend's house completely drunk and her parents had to take care of me. They didn't tell my parents yet. Maddy and I were fighting a lot and honestly, I was being a really toxic friend, and the school principal had to step in. The principal had a meeting with her father and my parents, and her father told my parents that I had alcohol. My parents were really mad and shocked, but they didn't hit me or yell at me as I expected. They were just calm and told me to never do it again.

At the end of my freshman year, I started becoming really depressed for no reason. I didn't understand why but I felt so fucking empty and hopeless. I started cutting myself. My parents found out and became very angry. They threatened to send me to a mental hospital. They asked me why I was cutting myself and to answer honestly, and I told them it was because I was depressed, and they laughed at me. They told me that if I was really depressed, I would just kill myself. They also brought up my ex best friend, Maddy, and said that she stopped being friends with me because I was acting like this. I thought my brother would understand, but he said I was self-harming because it's ""trending"" these days and that it's social media's fault. He said straight up to my face to go kill myself if I'm actually depressed. So I decided to kill myself on before the last day of school. I wrote my farewell notes for my parents and close friends, and prepared myself to die by jumping off a nearby bridge, which was infamous for suicides. Knowing that I was going to kill myself was mental torture. I would just go home and cry and then ready myself to die. Before the last day of school, my school has something that's similar to prom where the whole school body dresses fancy and eat at this expensive buffet. I was going to the bridge after that and going to jump off. I told one of my close friends that and they stopped me. They told the school principal what I was planning to do and my father came to pick me up(I don't think the principal told my father). My friends really helped me through that and I'm still alive because of them.

Summer kicked in, and the relationship between my parents and I were really toxic. Whenever I would talk to my mom, we would end up arguing, so I stopped talking to her altogether. My brother came back home because he decided to go and finish university. I was glad to have him back, but I never expressed it because it was just really awkward and I didn't know how to. I barely spoke to him when he came back, but I cried happily by myself. Then, after a month or two, my brother and I were alone at home. He told me to do the dishes after he was done eating and I said to hold on because I was watching something on my phone. I was taking a while, so he just walked over to me and punched me. I was shocked and muttered ""what the fuck"" to him. He got more mad that I had said that to him, and he literally just threw me to the ground and started punching and kicking me. He cut off the wi-fi and told me to do the dishes. I had really bad bruises for 2 weeks because of that. After that, it became even more awkward between my brother and I, but he acts like nothing happened. After that, I don't remember anything noteworthy happening.

Until my sophomore year, I used to be really socially awkward and quite unattractive, but I had a ""glow up."" People started talking to me first and I became REALLY social. I literally had a 180 degree change. I was naturally confident and social and a huge extrovert. I made friends with a lot of the popular kids and got myself into dumb shit. I started drinking alcohol, going to clubs or bars, and vaping. Honestly, I don't think drinking alcohol underage is bad as long as you are surrounded with friends who can take care of you and are not drinking past the point where you can't control yourself. I first got caught vaping by my parents because I used their credit card to buy juul pods online. I lied to them that it was my friend's. After a month or so, I got caught again when my mother found a pregnancy test in the trash can. I wasn't pregnant, thank God, but my parents were pissed. My father was so angry(he was angrier than me vaping or drinking alcohol). My parents are not religious at all, so I never expected them to be so angry about sex. He literally flipped out, but he didn't hit me but my mom sure did. He then checked my bag to see if I had anything else and that's when he found my juul. My mother told me that if people ever find out that I had sex, everyone would make fun of me and that I would be expelled from school. I later explained to them that I used protection, but I lied to them that it was my first time so I was scared and that he was a boyfriend I had dated for a long time(it wasn't my first time and it were all just hook ups with my friends). Then my mom brought up how it was because I stopped going to church and she said that it was probably because all the kids were making fun of me there(she's not even Christian, so I don't understand why she said that). I explained to her that I stopped going to church because this teacher there asked me to hook up with him and I declined and I've felt uncomfortable since. She just said that I was lying and she told my dad not to believe me. Then, skipping to almost right before summer, I hung out with my friends and we drank together socially. I drank too much that day and I got really drunk. My friend ended up having to call his parents to drive me home. That's the second time I got caught drinking alcohol ever since the first time in middle school. My parents were very angry and they started hitting me, and I promised them I would never do it again.

Summer started and that's when my grades roll in. I got a F on my math, while getting As and Bs for other subjects. My parents were, of course, incredibly pissed but they didn't lecture me much about it. I really slacked off that year and seeing how I was caught vaping and drinking alcohol did not make me look any better. I wanted to really try hard for the next year, so I decided to spend my summer partying and wearing myself out, which worked. For the first week, straight, I was out all day with my friends, just drinking and crashing at motels or their houses. My parents told me that I can't have a sleepover, but I ignored them and slept over at my friend's house anyway. I drunk called my parents once and that's when they found out. I went home, my parents were very angry, they yelled at me, and then they started beating me up to the point I had bruises. Honestly, thinking about it now, I think I deserved it because I was really being a bad kid. I promised them that it wouldn't happen again. For about a month, I stopped hanging out with my current friends and stayed home because I didn't want to anger my parents more, and moved on to better friends because my current friends were being a really bad influence on my life. I reconnected with some old friends and we decided to catch a drink together. Everything was fine. I drank moderately, just drove around in my friend's car(of course, my friend who was driving didn't drink at all), and then we all went to his house to just talk there. I called my mom and asked her if I could sleep over at my friend's house(I always lie and tell her that it's at one of my girl friend's house because she freaks if I'm with a guy) and she said no. I got angry and explained to her that we weren't doing anything bad and that I'm fine. She still said no. Instead of obeying her, I ended the call and slept over at his house anyway. We really didn't do anything bad(we did drink but we drank maturely and to the point where we were all under control, as we had a lot of experiences drinking before and we just drank for the sake of drinking socially) and I was just angry that she didn't trust me this once. Of course, she has every right not to trust me because I broke her trust multiple times but the fact that the time when I was finally becoming ""good"", she didn't trust me, just made me really angry and want to break her trust more. I got home the next day, my parents are mad, they yell at me, and my mom hits me. After that, for the other month, I just stayed home because I felt like if I went out, my parents would get angry and I felt like I would do something dumb. That's when my mother found my vape a second time. I fell asleep with the vape in my hand and she saw it because she regularly just barges into my room. I used to be really addicted to nicotine and I just started going crazy when it was gone. I went into my parent's bedroom, looking for my vape everywhere, and demanded to know where it was. My parents woke up and got mad, of course, and the usual things happened- my parents screaming at me, me screaming back, then beating me, then leaving me alone. I found where my mom had hidden my vape and got it back. When my parents found out and demanded to know where it was, I lied to them and told them that I sold it to a friend.

After summer, when school started, I really decided to get my life back together. I dropped all the friends that were a bad influence on my life and tried to strengthen the friendships that were healthy to me. One of my good, older friends decided to go to the military instead of university right away. It was his last day and I decided to grab dinner with him. I asked my mom if I could sleep over at his house and she said no. I told her that I'm done with all the bad things now and that it's been a month since anything bad happened and begged her to let me because I wouldn't be able to see my friend again for a while. She still said no. This just made me spiral back down again. I got angry because she still hadn't trusted me and ignored her. My friend and I drove around in the night, just having some deep conversations, and I went home at midnight. My parents didn't say anything the next day and were just glad that I was home before morning. I really think she should have trusted me that day because my friend and I did nothing but drive around, and the fact that she didn't trust me made me want to rebel again.

After a week from that, I decided to quit vaping. I threw away my vape device and juice. When I got home, my dad suddenly called me angrily. I asked what was going on and he said that he was contacted by the police because I was being charged for shoplifting. Around 2 months ago, my friend and I had shoplifted at this store. I only stole one item, which was 15 dollars. My parents got home, yelled at me that I was going to get deported or thrown to jail for a year, and they beat me again. My mom said that I was acting this way because I was dressing like a slut and this is why Maddy stopped being friends with me. I got angry because it was summer time and I all wore were shorts and tank tops or short-sleeved shirts, and my mom constantly brought up Maddy whenever I did something bad. Maddy and I stopped being friends THREE years ago because we were fighting constantly and we were both going through middle school puberty and we needed to mature up. I just hated how she brought up Maddy whenever I did something bad and would say that's why she stopped being friends with me. I also just find it so funny how the day I decide to quit vaping and really move on with my life, this shit catches up with me. And want to know something funnier? My friend got away with it and I'm the only one paying the consequence. My brother came home and beat me up too. We begged the store to drop the charges and they said they would try, but it's up to the prosecutor. Everything was okay for about a week, until my brother caught me staying up all night. I have a huge fucking problem sleeping. I have this insane fear of falling asleep and I try my hardest not to sleep. Also, I procrastinate on my homework and I keep telling myself that I'll do it later. I've recently been taking sleeping pills to solve this problem. My brother told me to go to sleep and I said that I had homework to finish. He asked what I was doing the whole day and I told him I had fallen asleep. He said to go to sleep, but I said no. He then got angry and started punching me really hard. I couldn't deal with it anymore. I kicked him back. My parents and brother are always hitting me, and I had to just crawl up into a ball and defend myself from their punches and kicks, and I was so fucking done. He was shocked that I had hit him back and it just made him angrier. We started fighting and we eventually stopped. He then spit on my face and I spit back at him. He punched me again. I told him to stop. He said that if he hits me once, then I can hit him once back. I didn't know what to even do at this point, so I said okay. He's a big guy and I'm a thin girl, so of course, his punches hit a LOT stronger. He punched me in the arm once and I punched him back, and it kept going until my mom stopped us. What she said just blew my mind. She told me to stop hitting me because I had to go to the police station because of my shoplifting and she said that the police could be able to see my bruises. My brother yelled at my mom saying that she treats me better and that it's unfair for him. I felt bad for him because he was just taking out his anger on me and he probably still hasn't recovered from his family issues. My mom assured him that she would kick me out of the house once I was an adult and then she went back into my room to yell at me. I still have bruises from my brother and my mom. After that, it's all been calm. I think my mom felt bad because she would make me really good food, but I didn't eat and just got angry at her because I'm still holding a grudge for what happened.

It's not only my parents that I have relationship problems with. Every single one of my close friends ended up leaving me. Whenever I get close to someone, we end up fighting and then drifting apart. Same thing happens to my exes. I just have really bad relationship problems. It's gotten a little better, but not much because I've been kind of distancing myself from the fear that I'll lose them.

All this shit is mentally deteriorating me. Honestly, I've thought about suicide a LOT of times. I thought of taking all of my sleeping pills and ending it all, but I'm fucking scared of death. Honestly, I feel like I sometimes unconsciously get myself into trouble because whenever something bad happens to me, I stop fearing death because I want to escape the problem. I fear death constantly, that's why I hate sleeping because it's like death.

I know that I'm a bad and troublesome kid. I don't know what the fuck my problem is. I really want to better myself, but whenever I actually try to, something bad I did in the past reveals itself and I get in trouble with my parents again, which makes me do the bad things again to cope with the stress. It's like God actually fucking hates me. I have no passions or goals or motivation in life. I just want to get into good university to make my parents proud, then cut off contact with them, get a high-paying job, and then repay my parents the money they used to financially support me but not talk to them.

I just hate how I turned out. I never expected to be such a bad kid and I feel bad for my parents. I wish I was a child prodigy like they wanted or at least a good kid, you know? I also feel like I'm becoming dumber and losing focus. I used to able to read all day, but these days, I can't focus while reading and I can't understand a lot of simple things. My memory has also turned to shit and I forget things all the time. I don't know if people can be dumber, but I sure feel like I am. I just want to be a kid again, playing with my toys. This is embarrassing to admit, but that's kind of why I started playing Roblox again. It was a childhood game of mine I used to play all the time, and I got back on to feel like a child again.

I'm sorry for this incredibly long post. I just had to get this off my chest and I'm not quite sure what I'm asking for advice. I guess my question is, what do I do with my family? Are they right or wrong? And what should I do with myself because I want to improve my life.",29Aug2019,1
460,"Also, I believe I’m at risk for Hantavirus, which can be transmitted through rodent droppings, urine, and saliva. I won’t ask about that portion here though. This is a brief summary of my situation:

•I accidentally caught a mouse in my studio apartment (it somehow fell into my empty trash can) and then soon after, another fell in as well. I noticed one was bigger than the other but didn’t think much of it. Neither can get out of the trash can, so they’re trapped.

•I didn’t have the heart or means to kill them both immediately. I work nightshift and by the time I’m awake, most stores and my apartment’s office are closed.

•I came back from work about two days ago and I saw that the bigger mouse had given birth to about 6 babies.

•In the trash can are crumbs of cereal from previous trash, which they’ve eaten, and they’ve accumulated some droppings now. 

•I’d check on them a few times a night to make sure they didn’t get out (they haven’t) and I noticed the trash can  started to smell.

•I think they’re white-footed deer mice, which can carry Hantavirus. I’m concerned I’m at risk to contract this because it’s considered life threatening.

Yes, I know it was stupid of me to “keep” them this long and I’m waking up early this evening to get poison. I’m also contacting the office to inspect my unit to find out how they got inside. I didn’t want to just throw them outside because I at least know if they got inside once they can get inside again. I guess I thought in the trash can they were at least contained in one place until I could get rid of/kill them. For clarification they are pests and not pets to me. Is my hesitation to kill them contradictory to this?

I need to go to bed now for work, this is considered staying up late for me. I have a picture of the first mouse if anyone wants to take a crack at confirming if they are white-footed deer mice. I’m going to do more research, and this is definitely a new learning experience for me. Has anyone dealt with this before? Is this a good plan? Should I do something else?

462,"Throwaway. How can I escape a manipulative parent and bad home environment? 

I live in a small town, parents are separted and they both live in the same town. One of my parents offer a somewhat healthy, somewhat normal family life. I enjoy spending time there.

However my other parent is everything but that. Toxic environment, manipulation, unkempt household that is probably slowly killing us through mold, cat piss and poop, pests, etc. I am at my breaking point. I love both of my parents equally. However, I want to escape my toxic half.

I am heading off to University on the other side of the province and I have a promising academic future if I work hard as fuck for it. Currently I have my tuition paid through both academic and needs scholarships, but I still need a student loan for my dorm and bills if I want to focus on school. My student loan is registered through this parent though because they have a lower income. I'm living in a dorm so I have to be out and back home and the end of my 1st year.

465,"I‘m in North America for vacation. The first nights, I (f, 23) stayed with friend1, everything was good, then I traveled a bit, did some hiking, then I came back to the city. Friend2 offered me to stay at his place which I did but the first night was horrible. 

1) The apartment is small, we‘re sleeping in the same room and he sleeps with his fan on which caused me to sleep extremely bad. I slept like an hour? I feel like I have a cold as I’m from Europe. I asked him if it‘s possible to turn it off but he said this way, he can’t sleep. 

2) I offered him prior to give him money for the air mattress but he declined. The air mattress he bought is okay for a weekend but for another week, I‘d be getting major back pain. 

3) The major reason why I don’t feel good: I feel like he has a crush on me. I can‘t say why, it‘s just in my guts. I have a bf he knows of, still I feel like he offered me to sleep at his place having second thoughts. I initially didn‘t think of it, I actually thought at first it would be nice to spend time together but now I always feel like I can‘t do nice things (like cooking) because he might thing I also have a crush on him?

I told Friend1 about it and she offered me to come back to her place. I‘d love to accept but I don‘t want to hurt Friend2. It was planned that I stay for a week and I feel like it would be rude to just leave after 1-2 nights.  Friend2 is super nice and warm to me, gave me his keys, bought me breakfast etc. Friend2 and me have common friends so I can‘t really say that I decided to travel again because I will meet my other friends. Plus, we have some activities planned with our friend group where we‘d be seeing each other.

What should I do? Honestly, I was thinking of saying something like Friend1 has to work extra hours and asked me if I can feed her cat in the evening and because it‘s far away I might just stay at her place lol.",29Aug2019,1

467,"My heart hurts writing this. I've had my dog for almost 9 years, and I'm absolutely in love with her. She's the best dog I've ever had, and I love her with my whole heart. But, last night she had a really bad incident of aggression, and she hurt me again. :(   


She's getting older, and it seems that her aggression over food has only gotten worse. Somehow, she got into the garbage while we were away last night, and she found some food that she hid in her blankets. She's always struggled with food aggression - hoarding it, and growling if anyone is near. But last night she got really aggressive and she attacked me. This has happened twice before, but it has never been as bad as it was last night.  


I'm really worried about this getting even worse than it already is. I calmed her down last night and cried for hours. I honestly have no idea what to do. Outside of food aggression, she's the sweetest dog around - always cuddling and loving on everyone she can. It's only when she has food, and becomes protective.

i’m constantly in fear of others views of me. i’m constantly in fear of what could happen if i’m seen by people who know me, or of mutual relation to someone who knows me, if that makes sense. i’m constantly in fear of confrontation. i would do anything to spend my time at home, if it means i don’t get put on the spot in anyway possible.

i have never lost a family member or a friend. my ex-friend was on the verge of suicide. we were on a call and i could not contain myself. i had never met him, yet i was so emotionally distraught by the fact at any moment he could’ve taken his life. to my knowledge, he’s fine. i’ve always been a softie, and to see someone i know fall will devastate me. i’m constantly in fear of grief.

being a teenager, i’m always going to be moody and pissed at my first family for any reason, but they’re amazing. despite occasional belittling and mocking, if i ever look sad or upset when we’re in public, i still love them. they give me the best, but i’m so ungrateful .

i hate the self-diagnosing type, but being in literally any social area, i always get butterflies in my stomach and racing thoughts about what could happen while i’m there, to which i believe is anxiety. this makes it difficult for me to communicate to anybody who i have no familiarity to. this hurts. to feel so uninteresting, misunderstood and more when i’m actually trying to make constructive conversation rather than stupid and edgy jokes.

i’m in constant fear of being alone, being isolated and alienated from my groups. from being apathetically isolated in my future. i rely too much on talking to others to escape my head, even though i hardly have anybody to talk to. i have people i game with, and we share laughs. but it’s not the same. i want someone to share like-minded thoughts with, where we can both contribute our values and opinions. somewhere along the line, i want to meet somebody, and maybe even start a family. come the divorce rate, and the fear of losing your partner or your children. i certainly would not wish that upon anyone, and would certainty not want it myself.

i’ve never been able to stand up for myself. even if it’s a slightly offensive joke which turns into mockery of how ugly i look, i can’t say anything back. it’s like from the very start, i’ve been told to avoid everyone because i’m inferior. seeing all these people being themselves and being ridiculed from more extroverted people, solely because they don’t understand them, hurts me. but i can’t do anything. i care, but i’m just another nobody without values of importance. 

the state of the world bothers me. things i can work towards fixing, and things i can’t. so much seemingly unnecessary conflict. everyone seems turned on each other. everyone hates each other, but for what reason? a lot of issues seem untouched and ignored. 

i don’t know what to think anymore. although i’ve been present a short time on this earth, i’m lost. i’m not suicidal, but there’s just no point to me. i’m constantly stressed from the increase in schoolwork, and pressure to do well, to become only a worker, so i can barely sustain my life.

I doubt i’ve explained it well, but how does anybody cope with these issues? they cannot leave my head, and i’m so tired",29Aug2019,1

474,"I'm a middle child, and there's a 3-year difference between me and my older sister, and a 4.5-year difference between my and my younger sister.

I have always hung out with my older sister--my entire life. She can be frustrating sometimes, but she is still one of my best friends. But my younger sister is kind of out of the loop. My older sister treats her like crap (in which case I'll usually call her out and defend my younger sister), and I just realized that I don't really spend a lot of time with my younger sister. My dad is usually the one who interacts with her the most, but he's on a business trip right now and is not really available. Because of that, I found that I have to start picking up a little bit of the weight.

Anyway, recently my younger sister started riding the same bus as me, and now we'll do homework together and hang out a lot more. My mom told me that it's possible that I could help my younger sister come out of her shell if I continue to grow this relationship with her. I just don't even know where to start. I don't know how to grow our relationship, and I don't even know if I should. I want to, but I feel really sad when I realize that our relationship isn't all that strong. I start feeling like a pretty bad big sister.

475,"Hello friends,

I'd like some advice: 

When I turned 18, I changed my legal name. I struggled with identity and other mental health issue as a young black man and was never comfortable being in my own skin. This lead to a reactive decision to change my legal name to outcast myself from the family. That confused and hurt my family and we never really talked about it. 

Some years later--and now aware of the importance of communication (I chased/chasing a degree in it) and responsive decision-making--my lack of communication and longing for acceptance in my youth lead me to making an emotional decision that I'm trying to rectify in my late 20s. I know who I am now, but what I don't know is why I made such a silly decision. 

How do I go about discussing this with family and friends? Many thanks. Have a good day!

477,"I’m gonna give a little background but I’ll leave a straight forward question for advice at the bottom. (Mobile, apologies for the formatting.)

I see so many redditors that discuss their salaries and jobs on various economic threads. I had to take a very unorthodox method of establishing myself as an adult and it resulted me being saddled with some debt since it was me, myself, and I from the start. I’m floored by how people say 60k usd is a low salary because that’s life changing to me unfortunately.

I’ve always wanted to go to school or get a trade but I don’t have the time because I’m working, or if I do have the time, I don’t have the money. It’s a vicious cycle. I currently work in a factory that pays just below the cost of living so I usually end the month with my bills paid and food money but nothing more to actually lift myself up and get an education with proof on paper not a self taught education. 

I’m sure people will mention student loan debt, is that truly my only option?

How do I get into a career that actually pays well when I don’t have the money, time (currently because of employment), or resources to educate for it without more debt?",29Aug2019,2

484,"Sooo, welcome to my first ever reddit post looking for advice/opinions.  (throw away if you cant tell by the name)

Im 28 male, back about 3 years ago i ended up meeting someone while out at a social event with a group of friends, this girl in question at the time was only 18 (me being 25 at the time) bear in mind in my country of residence legal age to be in Pubs/Clubs is 18. At first i didnt know her age or think to ask her as she looked older &amp; acted older, anyway cut a long story short we kept in contact and met up a few times, nothing serious. It got to a point where the age gap became an issue for me and i felt the best thing to do was to go seperate ways because it was constantly on my mind which i felt isn't fair to waste her time nor mine. 

About 2 weeks ago, she sent me a message to see how i was keeping. We chatted for a while and ended up meeting up yesterday for some food, everything went smoothly and i thoroughly enjoyed her company and conversation, she looks really well. She's more mature than most 21 year olds i know, shes a stable job, good mindset and is an indpendant woman.  What im trying to say is that, everything other than my consiousness of the age gap ticks all the boxes, i feel now more than before the age gap should be less of a concern as im now 28 and shes 21 but it still crosses my mind, am i being too apprehensive?",29Aug2019,1

Im dating an introvert who has trouble connecting to people and emotions  
We are moving in soon(3ish months time)  
She is mother henning her little brother(now 18) parents are bad parents but good to him  
Bad at getting what she needs to say across without being extreme about it( instead of saying if this keeps happening this will happen- just jumps to this will happen if you dont stop; said as example of how she speaks but not how she feels)  
is a homebody   
has to spend TONS of time with her animals or she feels that they get sad/depressed if she doesnt.  
having a scheduled routine stresses her out and causes a form of anxiety   


Typically we see eachother about 4 times a week: Tuesday,Thursday, Saturday, and the 4th day is a rotation day of either friday night or sunday morning to early evening.  


Now randomly wants to change when we see eachother( after months of this) to Tuesday, Saturday while keeping either or rotation day as mentioned. Reason being to spend more time with brother and also feeling stressed from schedule, brother is not very emotion based either and typically doesnt really care on the spending time or not he will do it if he wants to. She had a problem with being overly attached to him and we spoke about letting him come to her if he wants time, but now I feel like she is taking a step backwards towards progression simply either out of panic of moving soon or either becoming possessive again.  


Am I making the right choices to be completely fine and understanding of what she is wanting?  
and is it in MY head that she is becoming re-possessive back to her brother or does it make sense to want more time when we are moving soon?

492,"
No one talks about ""not"" creating new habits. We waste so much mental energy and self-worth over failing on new habits that don't make us happy.


I've been a victim of this.
 
Once I attempted to practice badminton every day to stay fit. I had a racket at home and court was close by, so it [seemed] like a good idea. However, the visit was on and off and I never succeeded in sustaining it. Most importantly, I wasn't really happy with it nor did I find the visit meaningful.


About 2 weeks ago, I tried again. But this time, it'd be 30 min of basketball, 3 times a week with my wife. Basketball is my favourite sport and I wanted to spend quality time with my wife. Surprise, surprise… I haven't missed a single day.
 

Spending quality time with her is the most important thing to me. Because unfortunately, we, as in people don't have plenty of time with our loved ones.


I've been ""using"" my wife to create new habits for two weeks now.
•	Learn to code while she learns English (quality time together in the same room)
•	Cook once a week for her (learn to cook and spend quality time)

 You get the point.

The key to sustaining a habit: Do things that make you truly happy. Not what others think it'll make you happy.


So stop and think for a moment. Do you care about this new habit you're trying? If you do, what kind of life long meaning is there? If you want to clean your room, invite your friends or family over the next weekend.
 
I think discovering small habits that make you feel wholesome is the key to cultivating a new you. I'm involved in a neuroscience project and community in progress to develop a more detailed approach. Check out [here](reddit.com/r/newbrain).

499,"So this week I started studying in a unversity, and I´ve only had this much anxiety once before in my life and that was when I realised that the first university/program I studied in was shit and I had to quit. And this time my anxiety is because of university but for a different one. Its not because the school is shit (I´m pretty sure its not), or that I dont have any good classmates because most of them are nice.

When I was sitting in class today I just got hit by some insane anxiety. I´ve had a little bit of anxiety for a few weeks before starting university now but that just felt natural since everything is new. But this felt excatly like the same anxiety I had last year when I tried another university, I just want to lay down, do nothing, and stop studying(the minimal studies I have to do, its literally like 1 hour of studying, still feels massive). 

My homework has barely started since this is just an introduction week but I just doesn´t feel like I can do it. I dislike how I need to follow everything so I don´t fall behind, I dislike the new pacing the lectures have in university compared to high school(Or what americans would call highschool I dont live in America), I don´t want to be in school but at the same time I dont want to slave away at another shit job, it feels completly unnecessary to stay in school since a lot of what I learn is what I learn myself through books, online and googling. I don´t want to do anything. I´m studying something that is a branch of Computer Science(kinda) so a lot of things I can find online.

When writing this my mom called, during it I started crying, and afterwards I starting crying real fucking hard for about 5 minutes. Seriously never had this amount of anxiety before is it normal?

All the while she is home from work since 3, and is “too tired” to go get it herself. I get there at 6 with food, she stuffs herself and starts saying I came too late with food, I should’ve taken off early to get it.. yes really..)..

Starts saying she wants a divorce and what not, and in the moment after my wife hitting me, I say sure.. FINE.. either way, all that is not bothering me as much as the next part, because I know it’s an episode she’s having.

At the last question I kept pausing to think of an answer (and I was the only person that did it btw) and during the end of the interview, I sounded like I was about to cry and told the interviewers that if I did a bad job it was because I felt uncomfortable being interviewed in a room full of other interviewees. I felt like a loser and so humiliated. It didn’t help that I didn’t bring my resume (although the receptionist said it was okay) and they only asked 2 questions.

507,I broke my hand a couple days ago and I can't shower with my broken hand so my mom decided to shower with me to help me. She take all her clothes off and take my clothes off and went to the shower. My mom was washing me and i was trying to not have a boner but I can't help it and I got an erection right in her face and I said I'm so so sorry she said “That’s okay it just means you’re in good health!” so then she was washing my penis and balls she wash it just like she was trying to make have an orgasm then I can't help it and let it all out right in front my mom! She was a little shocked but then she just smiled and said “I’m glad you’re enjoying this” then she cleaned the mess and washed my penis and then we finished the shower. Since then I haven’t talked to her and I don't think I can get myself to talk to her ever again. What do I do now?,29Aug2019,0
508,"In the past month my dog and I have encountered at least 6 off-leash dogs. They’re anything from big dogs to tiny yorkies. I’ve seen a chihuahua down the street run after bikes and people walking with the owner yelling at it, but never putting it on a lead. I’ve heard of other dog owners carry pepper spray to protect themselves and their dogs from off-leash dogs. My dad has suggested I do this as well. 

My dog and I have not been attacked by these dogs, just approached. If we had been attacked I most certainly would have called the police.

My father it’s a citizen here but I had lots of year without seen him..  he let met stay in his house while I make enough money to start a life here (buy a car and rent a apartment) well.. the problem is that i think his family don’t like me that much especially my step mother. She isn’t mean with me but she does stuff like making too much noise and turning off the fan In the living room(where I sleep) early in morning when my sisters and her mother (which live here too) wake up whenever they want and it’s worse because i generally work till 12:30 in the midnight. Making comments about how bad it is that I have a free day in my work when she knows that I’m tired and can’t Stand my legs because I have to walk to work and come back walking too and I work in a fast food place so I have to stand for 8 hours or more.

 I barely see my father because he works in the day and I usually work in the night and I can’t tell him anything because he will say that it’s just me thinking bad things but it’s not the first time she has been like this with me. 

I think my only solution it’s to move out as fast as possible but I just came here. I work full time in the only job I can (almost 2 miles) because I don’t have a car and have to move walking everywhere and for better or worst I’m trying to take my  girlfriend out of Venezuela and I have to maintain her there while she is doing the paperwork (Which cost money too) so 70% of my money it’s going to her..

511,"Hey, I'm having a problem with one of the managers at my job. 

I work in retail, and there are multiple managers (shift leads) and then one main manager. We are always working with different managers just because everyone's schedule is different. The manager I'm talking about seems to have something against me. She always nitpicks and singles me out when doing certain jobs, even after doing it perfectly without any issues, but if another employee flat out doesn't even do that job, she doesn't even mention it to them. Yesterday we had a shipment of merchandise come in, and I asked her if I could help with it (because I hate being at the register, and that's the only thing I EVER do when working with her) and she opted to say ""We will see, we just need to get it done fast."" and proceeded to choose another coworker (a slightly overweight female who just got out of a leg cast) to do the heavy lifting and moving instead. I don't know if that was a cop out, or she was calling me slow. Pisses me off either way. Finally, she breaks the rules and seems to be the only one allowed to. She had either one, or both airpods in while working, even when talking with and assisting customers. I've been told off for having headphones in while working in the storage room of the store. 

I really hate this job, but I haven't found another job yet, I really hate this manager, and it really feels like she's single-ing me out. This job makes me want to quit on a regular basis, and having to deal with her makes it worse. How do I go about this? I was considering going to my head manager in private and talking with her about not being put on the same shift with this manager ever again and tell her the reasons why (especially the rule breaking one).

519,"I feel really really stupid about this.

I am in Canada and in the process of getting my driver's license. For that I have to pass an exam (the road test) where they test you on your driving skills. To get your road test you first have to book it with the government.

Unfortunately that day I was in a rush, so I clicked on the first link I got to book my road test, which took me to a very official looking website. On the website they asked for driver's license number, credit card info, name, etc. which I found normal because I thought they do need that information for me to be able to pay and for them to know that I do have a driver's license. 

So I put in my information and had to pay a fee, which again I found normal because nothing is free in this world. 

Now when I go back I realize that the website wasn't actually affiliated with the government and that a lot of newspapers and people on social media are warning that this website is a scam and just takes your money without booking a road test for you. 

I am not really concerned about the money I spent (I was stupid, I got scammed, I kind of deserve it to be honest), but I am really concerned about the fact that they now have my information. I am also kind of scared of what my parent's reaction would be if I told them, since I had to use their credit information. 

Is it possible for the scammers to steal my or my parents' identity even if I put THEIR credit card info and MY driver's license? 

if so, which steps should I take to protect my identity?

Ill start this off by saving I've constantly had severe anxiety, and depression these past few years, however as soon as it was beginning to get better my parents decided to force me out of my junior year of high school into testing out and heading to college. This just increased the amount of stress and anxiety I had as well as the depression I was feeling since I hardly get to see anyone I care about anymore. It would be fine if it was just this one thing but its always constant sh*t like this, I can hardly go out because of their strict rules, being that I'm growing up in their household and being in this family. Im unable to go enjoy my life at all, im just getting loaded with all this stress and my depression is terrible now since I have nobody to talk  to.

I usually try not to show any of this in public but recently it's getting so much worse and im always so sad and angry that I'd like to just pay for sessions in therapy to figure out some kind of coping mechanism but money's a bit short for me and my parents would say its a waste if I tried to ask

522,"One of my best friends has a tendency to ""disappear"" inside of his girlfriends. He's only ever had a couple of girlfriends before, but whenever he does have a gf, he allows them to dominate his life. The gf is not controlling or manipulative from what I can see, but he just has a tendency to almost completely ignore the rest of his friends. In the period between his gf's, we are extremely close and talk/hang out a lot, but as soon as he gets a gf, he practically disappears. I've mentioned it to him before and he acknowledges it and apologizes, but then proceeds to do it again. I have a girlfriend now, but I always make time for the rest of my friends and don't revolve my life around my gf, which seems like an absurd thing to do IMO.

I asked her who it was and she wouldn't tell me... very mature. I eventually found out and said why not! I don't really know her and how bad can a coffee and a chat be.

So we ended up going for a beer.

Mid conversation she confessed she's been facebook stalking me for a month prier and knows a lot about me, I was kind weirded out by this, but I played it cool and just laughed it off. When I finished my beer and said I wanna go home and cook, she then said ""no! I'll buy you dinner, I can get cheap pizza"", being the poor man I am, I agreed and said why not!

We went for pizza and beer.

When we left I insisted I pay her half as I felt bad, she refused it and said take me out some other time, I said sure!...

Fast forward over just a month of not communicating with her, I see her on my way out today. I couldn't avoid her. I told her some information about me potentially not leaving my job (I was going to quit) and she got excited. She then text me, ""I can't get over my crush on you"", followed by a Japanese sweating girl gif.

535,"Hello all! I wanna preface that I honestly dont give a shit about what my friend looks like. To me she will always be hella cute and the kindest person I know. We used to hang out alot in high school, but last year I moved out for college and she stayed at home to go to a local college. When I came back home for summer break, due to a new medication, she had gained something like 50ish pounds in the span of a few months. She has always been on the heavier side, but also pretty healthy as we used to go on long walks in town and stuff. But now I noticed that her pace is noticeably slower and her breathing more pronounced. This might be because she had a pretty bad flu at the time, but still. Theres also the fact that whenever we go out to eat, she usually gets sugary drinks like large cokes despite the fact that she mentioned she was pre-diabetic once. What scares me most was when I slept over. She usually snores, its no biggie, but this time it sounded like she was slowly choking. Like, the breathes werent regular and there were moments of silence where I could just hear her struggling to breathe a lil. Again, this might be due to her cold as i also end up snoring when my sinuses are congested, but not this extreme. Her mom also took me aside to ask me to tell her to loose some weight in private.


I mean, its clear that she knows. She gave me a few necklaces that no longer fit her neck, and she has been on a few fad diets like keto. And she is going to the gym. But nothing seems to work. Im hoping that omce she switches meds shell be back to normal, but im not sure. Should I lightly approach about the sodas and candy at least? Or should I just trust that shes got this and to just support her along the way? I rarely see her too due to physical distance, but I call sometimes, which makes the situation a bit trickier. I just dont wanna see her go through this, or get worse. I really care about her. Her weight has never bothered me until now, when it seems to be hurting her quality of life.

536,"I’m 24, healthy and active female. About 8 months ago I started throwing up bile 6-8 hours after drinking alcohol. It’s very inconsistent. Sometimes I will actually get very drunk, wake up perfectly fine. Sometimes I will have literally 1 glass of wine with dinner and I’m throwing up hours into the next day, like 6+ times, all bile. 

I used to never have issues with drinking alcohol. I used to drink way cheaper alcohol in college, and was fine. I’m not an alcoholic. Just a girl in my twenties who enjoys a drink after work here and there and going to pubs with my friends.

It has happened with all types of alcohol - beer, liquor, wine. Sometimes it doesn’t happen. I went 3 months without this happening and then it started again. I used to think it was anxiety, so I stopped drinking entirely for a while. I tried eating a lot before drinking. I’ve tried eating a lot after. Tried switching my birth control (only medication I’m on). Different levels of hydration, etc. Tried Zantac and pepto and Tums.

Does anyone have experience with this? I don’t have insurance, and I can’t afford to go to a GI. I know the obvious answer is to stop drinking, but it’s so inconsistent that I don’t even know what causes it. For example I drank last night (wine and beer) and I was fine. The last time I had alcohol before then was 1 month ago, and I had 2 glasses of wine with my parents during dinner. Went to bed and I wasn’t even tipsy! Didn’t even get a buzz.

My ex broke up with me 1 week ago. Within 2 days she was talking to a new guy. This made me feel devastated, unable to trust, sick. I gave this girl everything.

She had depression for years and I feel like some of it may have rubbed off on me. Basically, it's probably a good idea we split, but I'm still so hurt by how she ended it. Moving on so quick, not supporting me through it, only caring for herself. I supported her through so much and she couldn't be there for me when I was genuinely so close to suicide I had to call Samaritans to help me, because she wouldn't.

I've been trying to resolve my hurt, by moving on just like she did. I've been on tinder and it's been doing super well (130 matches in 4 days). However, I'm realising how hard it is to find girls who interest me. So many girls on there are just plain boring or basic. Theres likes 5% goths, 2% goths who are attractive.

I feel lonely and like I'm going to struggle to find another girl. I don't enjoy fucking about with girls, I just want a serious relationship, as the rest of my life is stable. I want someone I can just walk around aimlessly with, yet still enjoy it because I'm with them. I had this with my ex, which is why I thought we loved eachother.

Looked online to see my final grade and it's still sitting at STC (still to complete), which gives me some kind of relief as I've finally decided to finish it all, as I had been chipping away at the final assessment in very tiny tidbits which were not enough for the past 2 years.

Only thing is I will eventually have to say something when it comes to letting them know I've finished it all and handed it in. Especially after all the allowances and help the university and lecturer have given me. I'm a bit stuck and very nervous about this part as I have no idea where to begin, and need some advice on this.",29Aug2019,1

Recently A got married, had a kid and moved overseas and I find that we are not talking as much anymore. This is likely coz of my work and her busy with a new life settling in a new place. But I found out that A and B have been texting/calling every other day.. I do feel left out. I didn’t push the issue because they have always been closer even from the beginning. 

B and I made plans a month ago to visit A and I’ve taken time off work in preparation for this trip, only for A to tell the B that she might be busy. It’s now 2 days from the supposed trip and she is still unable to confirmed anything. 

I’m pissed off and feel like I don’t want to visit anymore however B really wants to see her and had promised her that we will wait to hear from her. I feel like A doesn’t really have time for us or me rather, and I don’t want to impose myself on her.

so my current situation is kinda unusual, i stay at my grandma's house during the weekdays because it's closer to my school and all that but my mum and my sister used to stay here as well and we'd often share the same room but i'd sleep on a different bed from them but it was okay since they were there in the room with me. 

but now, a lot of things have changed, my sister started high school and stays in an apartment closer to her school and my mum stays with her and im here at my grandma's sleeping in a big room by myself. it's also my final year of high school so the whole stress thing has really taken its toll on me and i'm feeling more alone than ever and sleeping in a room by myself isn't helping. 

now, i don't know if this makes sense because i haven't seen any professionals about what i'm going through or anything (mostly because my dad will disregard it and my mum will be all nosey and try to get me to talk to her before i see a professional) but i can't sleep properly for several reasons, one is that of course i'm stressed about school and what my life will become after high school. but also, i'm scared of literally falling asleep.

i've probably cried myself to sleep more times than there are fingers on my hands in the past few months because i'm scared if i fall asleep, i won't wake up the next morning but at the same time, i'm scared of waking up the next morning. i don't really like talking about this to people in real life so i don't know if it's normal or not. or if i should see someone for this. it's obviously not good for me because i genuinely need my sleep like this entire year, i've attempted to fix it and i've somewhat gotten that down by going to sleep earlier when i stay at my house or my apartment, just somewhere where the room i sleep in isnt so big.

apologies if this isn't as serious as other posts but i need real advice to know whether or not i should see help or just wait it for the rest of the year. i hope its the former because i don't think i can take anymore of this sleep problem i have. if this belongs in another subreddit lemme know as well because i have read the rules but i don't know if its serious enough for anything else.",29Aug2019,1
566,"I work at a utility company making over $16/hr with over 18PTO days a year. We can purchase additional PTO days if needed. The benefits aren’t godly but are okay. I’m not super worried about benefits because I’m on my parents till I’m 26. 

I have yet to start college and really really want to. I feel like I can handle college + a moderate work load, but not with this job. 

It is an inbound call center, so I only get called, I don’t call out. I assist customers with their power bills, specifically when they cannot pay them.

Not many people enjoy the work they do, especially at my age. That’s fine. I just really can’t stand it. I worked as a contractor for the company for well over 9 months before being hired in as an employee with the previously mentioned benefits. 

This company is HUGE and offers all these different jobs- but here’s the catch: you gotta wait a year to bid out to these jobs. Which would be fine, but the jobs I want require college, and i don’t want to get stuck somewhere in the company. The drive is over 30 minutes a day and I live in an area that is pretty hellish during the winter. I really just don’t like this job. I’ve taken many days off just because I can’t stand going there, and many more due to my significant others health issues. 

I don’t know how long it’ll be till I just am over it.

Questions for anyone who’d be nice enough to answer:

- Would it be an okay idea to get a job making much less money, (minimum wage) but work for the college I am wanting to go to? I’d get no particular benefits other than being able to work a relatively easy tech support job that isn’t a call center and have more time for college, and much less stress from my current job. The grass is always greener, but a close friend of my friend works there and the job does seem really nice. 

- Is it okay to quit even though this could lead to a career if I stick it out? I have pressure from everyone here and I’m scared I’ll be given crap for not making the “right” choice. 

- Do you need any more information? I’m glad to give as much relevant info as needed. I’m trying to stay a little incognito here.

582," 

The club in question is about helping out the students in any matter in the best way possible. The reason the club started is that a lot of students find it hard to go to a teacher or representative of the college, so this club serves as a go-between. It also resolves any issues that the students may have regarding Academics or CCA's. It also takes requests for the students, i.e to help them improve in a sport, or help them apply/run for a certain post in the student council.

The basic idea was proposed by a few students, who took this idea from, out of all things, a manga. Surprisingly the administration approved it. Their basic name was the Volunteer Service Club, but the administration wanted something else.

Some other proposals were the Soliciting Club, Noblesse Oblige, and the Consoling Club.

584,"Hello, I need some advice how to handle this situation.

I've been with my girlfriend for over 4,5 years now. She made a couple of friends 3 years ago when she went to uni. One of them is a guy with which she hung out pretty often. I knew the guy and I truly believed he was just a friend and I could trust him. 

Today they planned to lunch together after not seeing each other for a while. She thought they'd visit a lunchroom or something but he said he planned something at his place. She'd never been at his place alone and even though they're just friends she felt a little uncomfortable. However, she went with him and they had lunch together. After the lunch they were talking a bit and he wanted to hug her. They normally hug when they meet each other and when they leave so she didn't expect it. But anyway, she accepted the hug because he is a friend and they knew that they wouldn't see each other in a while so she thought he just needed a hug. But after the hug he suddenly tried to kiss her! She avoided him and was freaked out obviously. Then he said he wanted to do that for a while now and felt that she might want it too. Even though she has always been really clear that he is just a friend. I think he just forgot she's with me for over 4,5 years now! Such a dick move! 

I'm obviously very relieved she could avoid him but I am also so angry at him now. I have his number and I want to confront him. Should I? And what should I say to him in that case?

Tldr: a friend of my girlfriend tried to kiss her, she avoided but I'm pissed off. Should I confront him?",29Aug2019,43
585,"My mother is convinced that I'm smoking and that I smoke in whatever room I'm in when the door is closed.

 That's not the case. This has been going on for nearly a year. 

She is convinced that she smells the smoke, and through my efforts I really haven't been able to get rid of the smell (that I can't smell, but she can). At this point,I'm ready to move out. Between her harassment, full time school, full time work, and a S.O. who is currently living out of state, it's too much stress. 

On top of all that, I have no driver's license. My parents never had the time to teach me, and an incredibly generous coworker decided to help me, and the test for that is next week.

590,I self harmed In middle school and high school. I don’t have many scars but they’re there and visible. I don’t know if people judge them or not. I’ve considered getting tattoos to cover them up but I’m iffy about covering them up at all. I brought it up with my parent once and I was told that I decided to harm myself so I should live with the scars. I kind of like them because they remind me of hard times I got through but I also wouldn’t mind tattooing over them. I know they’ll still be there just a little less noticeable.

The biggest thing is he doesn't know how to be real anymore, he will just make constant jokes and my expenses or be sarcastic. When I try to have a heart to heart he shuts down from the conversation.

In a month we will be getting our own home with our friends (another couple). Even they have noticed a change in him.

593,"Honestly its more than that I just don't want to be with my GF anymore. We only talk about sex and stuff, but we are never interested in each others topics. I think i just wanna be friends, but the thought of leaving someone and being alone scares me so i try to get into a relationship fast, so i don't feel alone and hollow. I know i sound shitty, but idk how i can be ok with me i need someone saying they love me so i can know its ok to love me. I actually almost killed myself because I felt awful being alone and no matter what anyone said I didn't listen. Can anyone give me advice to how i can love myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also don't want therapy because money i tight on my family and i actually stopped going because my dad does not understand why I have to go and why i wasn't talking the first couple of times. Mainly it was because it was a week after i came out of the hospital and I wasn't comfortable with talking about how I was touched by another kid when i was in middle school. Just someone tell me how i can love myself or how i can get close to it",29Aug2019,1
594,"So, I'm starting to wonder about what to do here. I've seen therapists here and there (once younger as a teenager, once a year ago, and started to see one now) for some subjects that I guess are both different each time yet I think linked to the same core kind of problems maybe?  But that's not exactly the topic here. If it's something that you all really think is important to mention I don't mind talking about it privately but would rather not go into all the details (honestly that'd be another post in itself I think, but to grossly summarize I guess one big thing would be my difficulty acting to make changes in my life...).

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the problem though, I'm wondering if I'm either unlucky with therapists or if I'm going at it wrong. For both of the first and second therapists, while I came with different objective, I don't really feel like it helped me much. So yes, talking about some of these things can be nice and all, but idk, for the first one I feel like it mostly was nice to have someone to talk to because I migh have been a bit lonely, and for the second one, while again it was nice to talk a bit, I felt like in the end it didn't lead to much. And now, I'm feeling like with the third, I'm mainly just repeating stuff I already talk about on some other subreddits linked to my problem, all while not really getting much out of talking about it to them.

&amp;#x200B;

So here's the part where I'm wondering about what my problems might be with therapy. First of all, I've really gotten used to using english when writing notes about myself, and in general, I'd say feel more confident using english rather than my native tongue when speaking about such topics. 

Secondly, I feel like I'm much better at explaining my situation and feelings through text. In comparison, I either had a hard time really explaining myself with the second therapist, and feel like talking with the third one isn't really leading anywhere. 

Lastly, I'm wondering if maybe the problem is that I don't really know what I want out of it? Like, most of the subjects I came with I feel like are mostly stuff I'd have to do or figure out more or less myself, and thus it makes it a bit weird to figure out what I'm trying to do with the therapist. Like, the second therapist told me from time to time, if I want stuff to change, it has to come from me.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm wondering, is there stuff I could do to improve this? Maybe come to one with the explicit question of ""how can I make myself act on things I say I should/would do?"" (basing that on that core problem thing, basically come at them from the idea of trying to fix the core things I feel are the sources of the problems I come to them with instead of coming to them with these problems I'd link to these core issues ). Any idea on how to get better at talking about how I feel to a therapist? Maybe if there's a way I can do that through text, I'd like to but I can see why that'd be a bit too oddly specific. And finally, to those who'd like to share, what do you usually do with a therapist that you like? Because at this point, while I'm thinking I'm partially responsible for how it goes, I'm also wondering if maybe I'm missing out on methods and ways to be with a therapist that I just haven't experienced with those I've seen.

597,"So I’ve been with my boyfriend for nearly 11 months (baring in mind this is my first relationship - I’m a teen) and I’ve been having feelings of confusion about wanting to carry on or break up. It feels empty, uninteresting and forced mainly on my part for staying with him. 

He has given me reason to become insecure from things he has done such as having multiple girls nudes on his phone on an app that specifically has to be downloaded that requires a password to get in and searched porn on every app possible. I know this is natural for every guy but I feel like he has a problem since I see him quite often and have sex with him.  This has also made me not trust him at all which I have told him and now I am conscious when he is on his phone (which is most of the time). A couple months ago I saw on his iPhone notes “girls I’ve fucked” listed all his ex’s and me right at the bottom. I feel belittled from what I think is his porn addiction and feeling objectionable from his list. 

We’ve spoke about these things and during a break down I told him everything I felt and wanted to break up but didn’t happen because I think he gaslighted me?  This has happened more than once and each time it had the same outcome like “we can work on it” but it never happens. I also got drunk at a party and had said a bunch of shit to him about breaking up and even loving my friend more than him. 
I have to beg for attention, I don’t enjoy getting physical with him anymore, whenever we are together we do not talk at all and at some of my lowest points I wish I just never met him and stayed single. 

I don’t know what to do or how to break up since I’ve tried before.",29Aug2019,2
598,"I realise that I cannot force a neighbour to get rid of their pet, however...


Since approximately three months ago, my cat has been getting infections around once every two weeks. This is bad enough in itself, as he can no longer have the injection antibiotic as he has had it so many times, and also, because he has a medical condition that requires him to have regular blood tests, which he can't have within two weeks of taking antibiotics. 

The cause of the infections is a stray cat that recently appeared in our neighbourhood. It keeps cornering our (elderly) cat and seeking him out to attack him. Our two door down neighbor has five cats already, and started feeding the stray. She told us that it had fleas, but it wasn't underweight and had a healthy looking coat. 

After the first few instances, my partner went to speak to the neighbour, to ask her to stop feeding the stray. The response was that it is her 'duty to feed all the animals'. 

She then approached me two days later to tell me that the cat was actually living with another neighbour, but would be moving in with her if it didn't settle with the neighbour. She also told me that all of her cats are scared of it. At the time I told her that it was her prerogative to keep it, but we would be actively chasing it out of our garden with noise and water pistols. 

The cat is now living with our neighbor. And her five cats that are scared of it. And terrorising my cat regularly. We have just paid another £75 for antibiotics and an eye wash. 

If we could keep our cat inside, we would, but he's utterly miserable being kept inside.

We are at a loss. My cat has no quality of life and we are developing incredibly bad feelings towards the neighbors. What can we do?",29Aug2019,1
599,"So some relevant backstory:
I played ice hockey for approximately 10 years up until I went to college. My goal was to focus on my education and prepare for a career, plus I’ve always been on the smaller side when compared with the people I played against, so I wanted to play it safe. Well, my first year of college went nowhere near according to plan (as most don’t). I finished my freshman year with a 2.7 GPA, was part-time my spring semester because I withdrew from so many classes, and had a short spell of mental health issues. I came back my sophomore year and really put in work. I did everything I could to get where I wanted to be in the future and coming into my junior year, I have solidified my place in my major, brought my GPA up to a 3.5, and got a job with my university as a Teaching Assistant. I’m finally happy with where things are headed. All this time I have been an intern with my university’s ice hockey team to stay close to the sport and make some new friends. I had a lot of fun doing it, but the program director asked me the other day if I would consider playing for their second team. They need the players and assured me that my skill level would not be an issue, despite not having played competitively in close to 3 years, and that I would dress and play the whole season. 

My concerns are that I’d be risking everything I worked for to play hockey again. Part of me thinks it could be a fun opportunity and enjoy it while I can, while another part of me thinks that because the skill level on the team is so low, we’d be getting destroyed the whole season and I wouldn’t enjoy the stress and frustration of playing. I am in pretty good shape as I took up lifting and casual rock-wall climbing as hobbies, but I really don’t know what to do. 

Any insight would be greatly appreciated, even if it’s just a neutral source helping me divide the pros and cons. Thank you in advance.",29Aug2019,2
600,"I've heard once or twice that if a friendship lasts over 7 years, it'll last forever. But I don't really want it to.

It's hard to concisely explain the whole situation but in very short summary:

\- I spent 12 years in the same class as the friend in question.

\- For most of those years she didn't like me being around her because I was quiet (I have social anxiety and have a hard time talking in situations where I don't feel fully welcome).

\- She flat out told me several times I wasn't welcome with her and her friends (one of which used to be my best friend, which was why I wanted to be close to them).

\- I ended up in a very bad mental state because of the situation she created for me in school for about 4 years during middle school and high school.

\- Then in my junior year I started to become more confident thanks to a few people that were kind enough to be good friends to me.

\- Me being comfortable made me a better prospective friend i suppose and she and I became amicable around age 16.

\- During senior year and after (I'm 20 now, starting my third year at university) we stayed in touch and because we grew up together we ended up being relatively close.

\- She however never really changed and now I have really good and amazing people in my life that put into perspective how bad of a person she is to be friends with.

It's also just a bad friendship, if you forget the backstory, she sporadically says things that make me feel so incredibly hurt and I just feel like I'm not getting anything positive out of staying close to her. We don't have the same interests, she constantly makes me worry because she gets in actual dangerous situations when she goes out to parties (I don't in any way judge partying but when there's actual injuries coming out of it I don't think it's exactly healthy) and I feel like her babysitter more often than not, she's just plain insensitive to the fact that I have actual feelings and sometimes do need some time when I'm having mental health problems and mostly I feel like I'm just here to make her feel better about herself.

So yeah... I don't really want that in my life anymore but it feels harsh to just say ""goodbye, see you never"" or some shit like that. In a way I feel like it's sad to let go of the last childhood friend I have, but I don't know what the point is aside from holding onto that...

So I'm asking: should I just let it end and in what way?

tl;dr: friendship that stems from childhood is not a healthy one and I'm wondering what the point is in keeping it alive.",29Aug2019,1
601,"This might take long cus i havent collected myself but i’ll try and give a tldr at bottom if i can. Here goes


So im 19 and studying in college. Its not expected for college students to start work and get shit done in my country (this doesnt justify anything but its just a thing) but ever since i was 15-16 i have been feeling like an economical burden on my father as he’s (rightfully)  stingy about the money he provides for the family. 


Problem emerges around here, i used to go to work with my dad cus i wanted to get to know his business as its profitable and stable (hopefully for many more years) and if anything happens to my dad it would be nice to not get all panicked and fall down. It also helped me cope with feeling like a burden and made me feel like i was accomplishing something.

 Now, last year he rented the shop and upgraded to a situation where he is constantly watching movies and doing the work with like 5-10 phone calls. I went with him to the new place but all i did was doing school work and watching movies with him and i felt like it was a waste of time (i can do those at home too right?). A couple months ago he even said “id like you to come with me if you are going to waste your time at home, but theres nothing to do there too”. 


So since i didnt feel like i was learning there, i started practicing my instrument and improving culturally (thats what i like calling “watching movies and reading books”). This process resulted in me getting signed with a music label which is something im really proud because i feel satisfied for having something in return for my efforts. Before you say anything, i know this is not a viable source of income or a source of income at all. 


Up to this point i kept telling my father that i didnt think i was wasting my time by *doing this and that*, and i still dont think im wasting my time. Although i still feel (even more) like a burden on my father as time is passing and im not making any money or learning the business. 


In the end, just an hour or two ago, he told me “why are you wasting your time, you need to learn the job. You are going to have a hard time if something happens to me”. I know all of this, im aware (in theory) that i will likely fail in life if something happens to my father, but his words are so hurting that i never answer back. I mean, “you are wasting your time” is really heavy when i put all my effort to practicing and spend the remaining time on personal improvement. Its not like i dont feel guilty for not having any prospects, i think of it every minute but when he says it like that he takes all my passion and comfort out of my life and i get sad/angry because the things that i “waste my time” on are the only things that i do, and if im wasting my time why do i even exist at all? 


I dont know if i left any holes in the story but i need advice on if i should be as worried as i am about this topic or is it “dont mind, things comr around eventually” kinda deal?

We assumed maybe it's a recruiter. They accepted him immediately and took his phone number, email and address.
They told him he will receive a check for office supplies since it'll be a remote position and that he'll get a call from his supervisor.
Two days later a check shows up for 6.5k and no call from the supervisor.

607,"i have read everything, i have listened to friends advice, i have tried everything everyone has told me, but i can't stop her from swimming laps in my head.  i've known her for 4 years, we instantly clicked and became best friends, and i fell head over heels for after about 6 months.  apparently she felt the same way before i even did, we went out a couple of times but it didn't really go anywhere - she never really communicated why, eventually i got sort of upset at her ignoring/deflecting every time i asked her when she was free for another date, and called the whole thing off since i didn't wanna let it get me upset enough that i didn't want to be friends anymore.

fast forward a couple of months and i realize the feelings are still there - but she got over it and just wants to be friends.  i initially felt okay with this - i've never, ever had a problem moving past someone who didn't share the same feelings i did, but with her... just can't do it.  i distanced myself from her for a few months to try and work through it, but i just find that i can't.  it's fucking weird... i try my best not to think about her at all when we aren't talking, but there's times where it just becomes so overwhelmingly difficult to keep her out of my head, and THOSE are the days where she texts the hey-how-are-ya's after MONTHS of not talking and we start it all back up again.  i am in constant denial that i'm over it, but when we start talking it only just starts this countdown to when i know i'm going to have to keep telling her that i need space because i can't get over her.

i think one problem here is that she has displayed so MANY mixed messages.  without getting too into the specifics (too many, would make the post even longer than it's already going to be) i just feel like we are leaving something on the table that i'm going to regret is never going to be fully explored and that somewhere not even that deep down she's got feelings that she isn't wanting to reconcile - she's got a lot of baggage when it comes to dating and is incredibly timid/shy about it, in the 4 years i've known her (keep in mind this is an incredibly attractive, smart, educated, and successful girl) she's never gone out with a guy more than a month... always finds tenuous, dumb reasons to break it off.  i know that this is probably 50% projection and 50% wishful thinking though, so i'm not gonna get too deep in the weeds there.

we haven't been talking a lot in the last month or two (we were getting very very close again at the beginning of the year but the cycle began anew a couple months back), but yesterday she reached out to me again and i just straight up told her 'i have discovered that unrequited love eventually turns a corner from feeling sad to feeling pathetic.  i can contend with sad, but i can't deal with pathetic, and i cant knock you off the pedestal no matter how hard i try' and just told her that i'm going to miss her but i need to just finally get her the fuck out of my life once and for all.  we'll see if that sticks - to date, it has not.  but for now.. i just really need to know how the FUCK to stop thinking about her.  because she always asks to hang out, and the last couple of times i've managed to say no, but if she does it again i don't know if i can tbh.

everyone just says 'hurr durr you just gotta DO IT' and boy does that not work.  dating other people hasn't worked.  blocking her number hasn't worked.  nothing works.  i am terrified of the idea that i'm just going to be in love with her for the rest of my life even when she isn't even in my life anymore.",29Aug2019,1

610,"My 13 year old brother has been acting in a very bad way on social media and has been drinking and smoking under our noses. It started a year or so ago when I noticed he spent a lot of time on social media and often took the tablet into his bedroom. I discovered through his chat that he had been sharing topless pictures of himself to get other girls to like him through chat (some he didn't even know/could have been strangers posing as girls). When I told my mom and he got told off for acting this way, he lashed out by creating different accounts so we couldn't follow what he was doing/could get away with whatever he wanted. He got in trouble at his prep school for commenting a rude word on a boy's dance photo from school and seems to be now smoking and drinking (both of which he does away from the family when he's with friends etc to look cool). He posted a photo of himself today on a social media site holding a cigarette, after blocking me and my family first so we couldn't see it. He said he did it to get more followers as anyone with less than 1k followers is a loser at school. It's been seen by friends, school members etc and I am fuming about it. He listens to rap with some aggressive lyrics, got his head shaved at the hair salon a month or so ago (much to my mum's surprise) and is just being a very terrible human being online. As an older sister, what can I do? Are all teenagers like this now after social media/should I simply do nothing like my parents? 

Context: my parents got divorced in 2005 when he was 4 and so he spends a few nights at my dad's alone with him and at my mom's each week where the rest of the family live. My mom was an alcoholic when he was 8/9 and was hospitalized, with frequent episodes happening in front of him. She also smokes everyday, despite calls from us to quit, and that's where he steals the cigarettes from. He is the youngest of 7 siblings and gets spoiled by my parents. My dad is also too old now to know about the goings on online/the ways of a teen these days and my mum is sadly quite self-focused, spends a lot of time on social media/her phone herself and doesn't really discipline him/guide him at all. He is off to boarding school next week where he will be an hour away from home, being able to do who knows what. As an older sister in her thirties, living away from home, what can I do to stop this?

I have used my woodworking skills to make decorative urns in the past, and I have found it to be a rewarding experience. Given the ridiculous high cost of funerals, I thought there are many people who would benefit from something like a nice coffin for their loved one being provided when they otherwise couldn't afford one. A coffin typically costs thousands, and an urn could cost hundreds. The urns could be provided for people who lose a pet also.

616,"So I’ve been looking for a new job, and have been very fortunate to have gotten a few offers. I have narrowed it down to two job and it essentially comes down to passion vs comfort/stability. Since its relevant, I do have some debt that I have budgeted and planned out to be paid off within a year at my current wage. I also love to travel and want to start putting away savings for a home and retirement once I get this debt paid off. 

Job #1: This is the passion job. I’ve been in the book industry for 6 years now and I absolutely love it. This position would put me back into the center of the industry in a great place with a great community. I would be apart of the opening and foundation of this business, although the owners have a lot of experience and I trust them to do this right. The thought of leaving this industry is crushing, this is essentially my dream job because I know that working here will open a TON of doors within the book industry. However, I know that its risky. This job offers benefits, and after healthcare costs are factored in, I will not be going down in wage at all. I actually spoke to the owners and they were willing to raise my wage because of my debt situation and inability to take a pay cut. 

Job #2: Completely out of the book industry, this is an administrative assistant role. From what I can tell, it will be stimulating enough and keep my busy, which I need. There is also a lot of growth potential and room for me to move around if I want to eventually explore other departments. My good friend works there and speaks highly of it. They offer good benefits, and after taking into account the healthcare I’ll be taking about $2/hr home more than Job #1. I think I can be happy here, just not as happy as Job #1. 

Can I get some feedback and advice on what I need to consider? Or even advice that stems from personal experiences of when you may have had to choose between passion and stability, and how it played out in the following years?",29Aug2019,1

620,"TL;DR : I want to take art and drama this year but I can’t take both because they are in the same time slot in my schedule so I can only take one and I don’t know which one to take

This is my last year of high school and I really want to make it memorable.
Last week I got my schedule for the year and I have art, but not drama. I really want to take both, but they both happen in the same time slot, meaning they’re mutually exclusive. I can only choose one or the other.
Last year I took Drama for the first time and I really enjoyed it. I made some really great friends and it really helped me with my confidence and social skills.
I’ve taken art ever since Grade 7 and it always felt like it would be the one thing I’ll ever be good at. But I’ve taken up music over the last year and suddenly my passion for art has dwindled. Even last year I fell behind in art.
Now I’m really torn between the two. I want to take art because I’ve always taken it and it might be the only class I have with this girl I like.
But I had so much fun in drama last year and I don’t want to just leave behind all the great people I met. 
One of my best friends from Drama that I met last year might not even be in drama this year which is a big bummer for me.

622,"Okay, I hope this topic is not against the rules and I hope it does not trigger any bad feelings in people, especially those who are able to relate. I will gladly delete it if it really upsets people. This is complex, so I'll try to explain.

As children, my sister and I were both regularly sexually abused. This went on for years before we were able to escape it. As you can expect, this broke both of our views on sexuality for a long time growing up. And as the topic states, it caused issues between her and I. Anyway, the issue is that at some point in our youth, due to being forcibly sexualized by someone else, it made us have a really warped view as to what sex is and what is normal. What this caused was a few situations where we did sexual things together. It varies from touching to sex. We were both young then (8 and 11, me being the older one) and so quite clueless ourselves, but it happened over the course of nearly two years. Despite this happening while we were both children and both victims of abuse, I still feel like a monster for doing this. I can't really offer a rational reason as to why I did this with her, apart from having a broken concept of sex, or like it relates to the way in which sometimes children explore each other sexually.

Thankfully, this never really went on to become a major issue in our relationship growing up. It was never discussed again. We are now two of the closest siblings you could ever find, best of friends, emotionally and intellectually understanding of each other, able to laugh and get along. But I don't know how much these events have gone on to stick with her. No doubt she remembers, but I don't know if she resents me for it. It doesn't feel like it because as I said, our relationship is really great. I am hoping she can view it the way I do, that it was a result of us being abused and not some sick perversion or desire for control I was trying to express. It doesn't excuse what I did nor would I ever want it to be excused. Even though I was young, it should not have happened.

Sometimes these memories come up, and with it, feelings of guilt. It makes me want to apologize to her about what happened. But, I don't know if it's needed anymore? How can I know? We get along now. We're well adjusted and have dealt with the abuse. We get along together just fine. Does it make sense to bring this up to her and apologize after so many years? It's probably obvious to her that I am apologetic and I don't seek forgiveness or anything of the sort. I've just always had a desire to say sorry, it should not have happened. But I don't want to dig up old memories or anything that she has put past her. I don't know what to do.",29Aug2019,1

624,"I’ve been best friends with this person (let’s call her A)  ever since we were 10. We’ve been to the same school (and class) in our primary, secondary and tertiary education. 

We’ve been almost inseparable until recently when we graduated from our tertiary education. We have another Friend (let’s call her B)  in our group and we would constantly ask to meet up but she (A) would always turn down saying she’s ‘busy’. Now, the thing is, B and I was working at that time, yet we could always find the time to meet up. A, unemployed &amp; single, was constantly ‘busy’ without telling us the reason. 

We would text here and there with her asking me about driving lessons and sending me an old pic of us. Totally normal. 

Until the day came when I invited her to my dog’s birthday party (more than 2 months notice). She said she would make it but had the audacity to cancel on me less than a week before the party because of her niece’s baby shower. Okay I kinda get it. But what I don’t get was her apology. 
Her exact words ‘jahaha sorry babe’  
I called her out asking what’s so funny about cancelling on me and telling her that her share of food was already catered for, she had the AUdAcItY to GHOST me!!! 
The location of the party was only a 7 minutes drive from her place! So I don’t get why she can’t even find the time to be there, even for a few minutes! Especially since we have been friends for so Long and I don’t usually hold parties like this! The party was also at night and her niece’s baby shower was probably in the morning/afternoon. 

2 months passed and no news/texts from her. 

One day I coincidentally saw her at the bus stop (she didn’t see me as I was on the bus) so I immediately texted her saying I saw her! She didn’t reply until 5 hours later saying she saw me at a cafe nearby with a Friend (which happened like 3 hours ago). What puzzled me was she didn’t bother texting me when she saw me? Like wouldn’t normal GOOD FRIENDS at least text like ‘hey turn behind! I’m here!’ Or ‘I see you!!’ Idk maybe it’s just me. 

Our convo ended there. 

A month later.. my beloved dog passed away very suddenly. 
I didn’t inform her about his passing because why would she care lol. But I did post it on Instagram and B did so as well. She asked B what happened but B wasn’t too sure about the details. However A did not text me or ask how I was until 2 days later. She texts me asking the most generic ‘hey girl heard abt [dog’s name] how are you doing?’ I just asked how she knew about it (cuz she’s not active on Instagram and I didn’t know she asked my Friend) and she answered that. I didn’t reply her anymore after her reply. B, however, showed up at my place with lotsa goodies to cheer me up and was really sweet. Called to check on me and told me she’s there if I needed her. (We’re friends for only 3 years+) 

The weird thing is, A would ask our mutual Friend (let’s call her C) about me, how upset I was and all but she didn’t bother texting me?! C advised her to reach out to me as I was very upset about my dog’s passing and A’s behaviour towards me. Guess what? Nth new but A ghosted on C too hahahahaha. And up till today I have not received any texts from her. 

Now you may think it’s Super petty and all, but we’ve been BEST friends for TEN YEARS. Surely a Best Friend wouldn’t treat anyone like this?

What would you do if you were in my situation? Should I drop or nah? And how do I confront her if I were to do so?

626," 

So I’m heading into university this fall and I am in a bit of a conundrum. The truth is, everyone is leaving for university, going off into the world, and I’m stuck at my home city. I was born here, been here all my life, and I want to go out and see the world.

Now here’s the problem, in my home city I have countless connections. I know various professors so it would be easy to get more opportunities (and it has been easy getting opportunities), the program here (for what I’m studying at least) is quite good. All the students in my program (honours neuroscience) are effectively guaranteed research positions, funding, and stuff like that (this is perfect for what I want to do: which is to go into some professional career, probably medicine or dentistry). Furthermore, I am working a part time piano teaching position in my area which pays pretty well considering that I’ve just graduated from high school ($34/hour) and I just have a lot of other stuff going for me here. By the way, the city I live in is Calgary and I’m going to the University of Calgary.

So, I have a lot of things going for me over here in Calgary (even more than I mentioned actually). But I want to explore the world. I wanna live somewhere else for a while. There are a few options I had considered but all of them would seriously put me behind on everything that I’ve built up so far. The options I took into consideration are as follows:

Option 1: Go to a different city for university. 

Truth is, I applied to a whole bunch of universities not knowing what I should do. I got into the University of Toronto for Chemical Engineering, and Life Sciences (Yes, I applied twice). I got into the University of British Columbia for their engineering program, and I got into the University of Alberta for engineering as well. I also applied to a bunch of Ivy leagues in the states but I got rejected. Anyways, I was seriously considering going to the University of Toronto when I realized that their program is not as good as the University of Calgary’s neuroscience program and, with a heavy heart, I decided not to let my ambitions to see the world interfere with what would be best for me. Also, I would lose everything I had built up (jobs connections) if I went away, so that was another reason I decided to stay in Calgary.

Option 2: Transfer to a different city for university.

So I’m seriously considering doing this, that is doing uni for one year in Calgary and then transferring to a different university. However, that would mean that I would need to find a program that is just as good, if not better than Calgary’s honours neuroscience program. Even if I did that, I would still be losing all of the extracurricular activities and jobs I am pursuing in Calgary right now. In the end, I could transfer but it would be a shit ton of work to get back on track.

Option 3: Study abroad

So this option doesn’t sound bad at all. However, doing this study abroad thing would also mean that I would have to suspend, and possibly cancel some of the things I am doing in Calgary right now. A lot of the activities which I am pursuing require a consistent commitment, so if I were to go away for a while, I would arrive back in Calgary and a lot of the things I was doing would no longer be available to me. I would have to work my ass off again.

The feeling of being stuck in one place is kinda bad. It feels like everyone is growing, maturing, and moving along with life while you are just stuck in the same place. It not only makes you feel like an overgrown baby, but also like you are missing out on so much.

People of reddit, I kindly would like to ask for any advice you can give. A solution to my situation would be awesome, but I value advice providing a different perspective on how to view my situation just as much, if not, more.

Long story short-a tenant of mine is moving out in a few days and her mother has been harassing me, left right and centre about all sorts of things out of nowhere. Our last call over the phone-she screamed at me, and we were able to resolve the situation somewhat by having me send over the invoices by email to her for leftover internet and hydro charges and agreeing to meet on the move out day so I could grab the key and return damages. After that, I decided while going through the invoices it might be easier to just print out the hard copies of everything for her convenience and put the damage deposit, key deposit together to leave in the unit one day before for pick up and for her to just leave the key there so we don't have to meet (avoid more conflict). She's also extremely angry that rather than doing monthly hydro/internet billing, I've done a lump sum at the end (my fault-I forgot about it). However, I was just shocked because if she was really that insistent, why didn't she contact me way earlier?

633,"I took a year off from college under a hardship hiatus, in which I can take up to a year off away from school due to intense medical or personal issues. To return back to school, I needed to have filled out a few documents &amp; have a written statement about what I spent my time doing during my time away. 

The assistant dean handling my case rejected my request to go back to school, stating that I didn’t email him before the July 1 deadline to let him know that I was going to come back in the fall. This was after I sent him all of my other documents before August 1 (the deadline to send them in). He said that he could process my request for the spring instead, which is NOT what I want.

The thing is, I did email him several times back in January. He wasn’t in his office during the time I emailed him then, and I was sent an automated email stating that. He apparently replied back to one of them, but I never got or saw it. The email he’s saying he never got was the one in which I stated my intent to return back to school for the fall. He asked me to send that email as an attachment, but A) I don’t know how to do that and B) I don’t even think I have those emails anymore, as they were sent back in January of 2019. I was able to send screenshots of both emails I sent to him, but he’s saying that that isn’t enough. I’ve had so many issues with this email service in the past (Outlook), and I don’t think it’s fair that I’m being denied my education because of that. 

In addition to this, I also sent proof that I had contacted housing to secure a room back in June, purchased a plane ticket to get school, and even contacted the school about putting a forbearance on my account until I came back in September. Shouldn’t this be proof enough that I was preparing to go back to school in the fall? Why would I do that if I hadn’t sent him that email to begin with? 

What exactly can I do in this situation? I’ve tried to contact other people but they are all telling me that they can listen, but can’t directly help me.

644," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ttthe company name I said then  ‘ohhhh/mmmm...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

647,"Hey everyone, 

I've been going through a lot of stress lately, and it's because I'm unsure of what to do with myself and where to go. I moved recently to a beautiful place and got a really awesome job (that I'm pretty good at and can move forward with as a career) from the heavy persuasion of my current bf. There's issues with him being my shitty supervisor (comes in super late then makes speeches about being professional in the work place and taking it seriously (Ironic, right?), ignores messages about questions I have regarding work). We've also been having relationship issues with communication, him being secretive, and not putting in effort into our relationship, and fighting lately. There's this trip he's going on that he had told me about on our first date (about 7-8 months ago) and i thought nothing of it since it was a first date. This trip he's taking, he'll gone for 3 months, he planned on ""Taking a break"" with me but still calling, texting sending postcards to me. And when he got back, we'd go on first dates again, like nothing had happened. Which is most upsetting, because that's just wrong to do to someone if it wasn't brought up sooner/agreed upon. I did some researching and found out that, a break was his intension in the beginning, and never said anything to me.  Work has been tense and I can't stand him being my lazy boss, nor our sexist and rude boss. But I like the type of work that I do. 

I was also heavily persuaded by this bf of mine to move somewhere where the snow in winter gets ridiculous, so I could be closer to him and work. I only have a 2 wheel drive vehicle, and I can't afford to get another one currently. The current living situation is basically a glorified shed (I've got plenty of room) that has little to no insulation, and if lines go down (Which can be weeks at a time), I have absolutely no heat sources since the shed is run by electricity only. So I feel as if I'm not really going to be making it out here in winter. 

I've been thinking about moving back to the Bay Area, but I'm unsure since my friends are leaving (they're a main driving factor of me moving there) and I also would like to go back to school (another 2-3 years) for perhaps a Major in Biology and a Minor in Art. I'm not sure what schools to look at, or areas that are no snow but still affordable. I feel as if I can no longer grow in this area or with this job, and I've been thinking lately that I focus too much on relationships, and looking up to men that come off mature, and are actually a lot more childish and less mature than myself (Yes, I'm going to toot my own horn, beep, beep.)

650,"I’m a new mom to a happy &amp; healthy 3 month old, our first child. My husband and I had to move for work last year and are about 5 hours away from our family &amp; friends.

We have a wedding to go to in a few weeks and will be seeing a ton of people who haven’t met our baby yet, and much to my own chagrin I find I’m pretty anxious about the sheer amount of people there who will probably want to hold our son.

Just want to mention that I’m not overly concerned about this kind of stuff normally- when we have visitors, family or friends, I love letting them spend time with our baby and think it’s really great for him to get to know new people! I don’t make anyone use hand sanitizer before holding him (no judgements if you do- it just doesn’t even cross my mind!) though most instinctively wash their hands before picking him up for the first time.

What I *am* concerned about is that having 50+ new people have contact with him in the span of a day. What if someone had been sick recently or was &amp; didn’t know it and passed it on to him? I know he will eventually get sick in his lifetime lol but I guess I’d rather avoid it when he’s this young!

Another concern is there are a few couples coming who have made it known they’re anti-vaxxers. I don’t want to start a debate here but my personal view is I would rather he not be held by people who are unvaccinated. Maybe that’s over the top, but it’s how I feel. Also, these people are coming from a city where there are multiple Measles outbreaks. They’re not immediate family, though, but have expressed that they can’t wait to “squeeze him”! lol sigh

My son has only had his first round of shots and my doctor said it’s okay for him to be there but she recommended limit his exposure to being held by a bunch of new people. It made me feel better to know my concerns were at least valid.

But I still don’t know how I’ll politely tell people what I want to say which is “It’s not you personally, but if you hold him then everyone will want to, so no”.  There are 5 immediate relatives that I want him to spend time with, but other than that, I just don’t feel comfortable passing him around like a hot potato. 

I’m in the wedding party and my husband will be wearing him in a chest-facing carrier for a lot of the time.

He’s the first baby in our family and will be the only one at the wedding, and I do love that everyone is excited to see him, I’m just stressed and would appreciate any advice!

TL;DR: How can I avoid offending people  when I tell them I don’t want them to hold my 3 month old son? Or should I even be this concerned in the first place?",29Aug2019,1

I had an MRI on Monday to determine if I have pituitary gland tumors or cysts. The MRI place told me my endocrinologist would get results Wednesday. Obviously, I had it in my head I would get the news that same day. I called Tuesday to let my doctor know they should be expecting results and if I needed to schedule a follow up. The receptionist said they'd call if I need a follow up. It's now Thursday, and I've heard nothing. In my experience, MRI results take a lot longer than 2 days and even if everything comes back normal, I've gotten a phone call saying that. I do have questions for my doctor such as what to do next. So I'm not sure if I should call today, tomorrow or just keep waiting. But these results impact my masters program so? All help appreciated. And if this is the wrong place to post, let me know!

Since 1 year or less, I noticed that I often want to cry for no reason. I don't know why, it's often over little things. I don't think I am depressed though. It stopped for about 3 or 4 months, and now it's happening again.

Since one year, I try to be nicer and nicer, because I want people to feel happy around me. 
I had an habit of insulting people as a joke, and realized I needed to stop. When I look back at it, I wish I realized it earlier. And so, I want my friends to be happy, but they told me I was annoying, because sometimes I joke around like a kid, and they told me I was rude/mean, but I never insulted them or talked about them badly. I always compliment people and try to make them feel good. 
Whenever I go on a call with my friends, they tell me to go away (since about a week). My ""best friend"" seems to not care about me anymore.
I don't have any game to play with them, and whenever I play something, they tell me to stop because it's a bad game to them, but I enjoy playing it.

658,"First off, dont upvote this as i am afraid my sister or someone i know will see this. 

There's a lot to unwrap, but for now I would like some advice regarding my sister. She was daddy's little girl and she has been affected the most out of all of this. The day I was told the news by my mother, I was leaving the state to start work in another state. About 1000 miles away. I am currently still working here with my girlfriend who moved down here with me. The reason i moved was mainly because of work and to be closer to my dad's side of the family. Money was tight and i was left with one of my dad's debts. The job is well paying and its helping to get out of my debts. I feel guilty because I left my mother with my three little brothers (4m), (6m), and (10m). Plus my sister (17f). I want to be with them, but my mother barely makes enough and I took the job to help them out with Bills and hopefully help her get out of debt as well in the near future.

So my sister texted me today after about a month or two since we last saw each other. She tells me she needs a therapist and that my mother isn't taking her requests seriously. She's texting in search for help and I want to help. She wants to plan a trip out of the country as well and wants my help with that too. She needs my help getting her passport as my mother will not help her.

Any advice would be helpful, and I know I'm lacking a lot of information and I will try and update this when I am available some more! If you have questions I will try and answer them.",29Aug2019,0

My story- I see a nurse practitioner. I don’t particularly like her but I haven’t found a female doctor that is taking new patients in my top tier network.   I saw her a while ago for a few issues and asked her about an issue I have where when I lay down I have a large hard mass on my abdomen. As I lay there for a while it sometimes goes away, but not always. Of course she couldn’t feel it when I went to see her but I asked what this could be. I’m just worried as a hard bulging area of my abdomen cannot be normal, but it goes away sometimes which is bizarre. I really just feel I need to be checked out by somebody to know whether this is something I need to be concerned about. I’m not sure who I should see or what to ask for.

663,"I'm currently stuck in a situation where I have to live with my severely alcoholic abusive father because I have nowhere else to go.

I'm 25 years old and I don't have a car or license because I've never had anyone to help me get those things. I can't get a job because I have no way to get to work. I would walk to find work but it's been constantly over 100°F here in California where I live and I do not want to die. 

My two little sisters live here with him and are subjected to verbal and physical abuse daily. As well as neglect as there is always alcohol in the house but no food. 

One of them is still in high school. The other just turned 18. 

Every day he gets drunk even though we have no food in the house. We don't even have a working car or transportation so he walks to the store.

He gets drunk and becomes physically and verbally violent towards everyone in the house. He frequently threatens to beat or kill us if we do something he does not like. He threatens to kick us out on the street. 

I fear for the safety of my little sisters and I don't want them to have to go through this but we have  nowhere else to go.

This man does not pay his own rent. He sponges off of some friends he has staying with him because they lost their house in the fire in Paradise California. They pay his rent in exchange for somewhere to stay.

They are quite tired of his self destructive tendencies as well and also fear for their safety and the safety of their son who is 17 and still in school.

They don't have a working car because my father broke something in the engine when he heard about the possibility of them finding a place in Chico CA. It was a threat to him because if they moved he would not be able to pay his own rent. So he sabotaged their car.

666,"TL;DR
She lied a lot in the beginning of the relationship, I sensed it and she blamed my mistrust on me, saying I was paranoid. Finally comes clean, says she didn't realize what she was doing, wants to be a better person.

Full version:
We met on Meetme. Chatted briefly. She messaged me from across the country and said she was moving to my city. Fast forward, I see her on my Meetme locals on the 4th of July. She's online, I'm not doing anything so I see if she wants to meet up, watch some fireworks.

We meet up, talk and relate about a lot of things. She tells me about her situation eventually. She moved out here to get away from a toxic situation at home. She moved across the country to live with an ex boyfriend who was very toxic, an abusive alcoholic. She wasn't planning on dating him again, but they shared a bed, had sex, smoked together, took trips. She left out some details at the time, but these are things I learned. She had just been kicked out after a fight between her ex and her. I guess she made it clear she didn't want a relationship, so he started being abusive and they both agreed she should leave.

During this time, she's meeting other guys.

About the ex:  They dated for 3 years, but she says he was physically and emotionally abusive.
they sold her nudes together. They did shows on camming sites together. She says it was all what he wanted. She says he would spend all her money on alcohol.

So she's couch surfing a few days and she meets me. One guy she met on Meetme, who at the time I thought was a family friend, had paid for hotels and airbnbs for the next couple weeks. She took me to her hotels and airbnbs (because of the season my house had lots of flying insects, also she didn't want her boy toy to see she didn't need a place). So I'm taking her to work everyday. We're having cute dates, sex. When her airbnbs are all out, I let her stay with me in my tiny studio apartment.

About the guy who bought her rooms: Never met in person. She chatted and flirted with him a lot and gave him, lots of attention. She got a lot of sympathy from him. When she got kicked out, I guess he offered to get her hotels but maybe she asked. He found out about me after I'd slept with her every night he had paid for. When I found out about him and confronted her, she thought she wasn't doing anything wrong because she'd told him she didn't like him like that (which was true).

Fastforward, I'm working in a coffee shop one morning. The feelings of mistrust have been pushed down, I've been thinking my self protective mechanisms are just overactive and the conflict is just overwhelming me. So I call a helpline and schedule a counselling session. Later I tell her what's going on, she's supportive of me going to counselling. She says she didn't realize how bad her problem was. She says she didn't realize it was her fault I was questioning my sanity.

This basically went on for a while. I saw a counsellor once. The counsellor projected onto me and apologized after the session, realizing I should not have ever been her patient. Every other time I felt mistrust, I went to this girl. I asked her what was going on and she lied to my face on a daily basis. Sometimes with tears.

Last week, I reached a point where I knew I couldn't deal with feeling like this anymore. I sat down and told her she's going to lose me because I don't trust her. The next two hours she sat there and listed off things she's lied about. It was awful. Bigger things, small things. Pointless things. I was really hurt.

She tells me I put a mirror in front of her. She tells me she didn't realize what she was doing and I showed her. She doesn't want to be this person. She wants to deserve a healthy happy relationship. She wants to be good to me. She wants another chance.

Who she was: She loved sending out nudes. Nudes all over her phone. Any guy she was friends with could get a nude. Shallow. Lies to literally everyone. Insecure. Needs attention and affirmation. No real friends.

She's had it rough, so I can understand having issues and not knowing how to have a healthy relationship. But she told me she loved me while lying to me about something every single day.

She says she loves me. She wants another chance. She wants me in her life in some way.

The kind of lies that she told:

At one point, we thought she brought scabies or fleas into my house. Scabies is commonly transmitted during sex. For the record, she did NOT give me scabies. She told me before she slept on another guys couch before she met me, but they never had sex. I asked her several times, and she always said no. I asked where she got a shirt she loved to wear and she said her best friend gave it to her. She would wear it when I took her anywhere, wear it in my bed. She got the shirt from the guy who's couch she slept on and they did have sex.

She decided to tell me she's slept with 12 people when it's obviously more than that, probably around 25.

She lied about the living situation with her ex. Said they had seperate bedrooms, but they slept in the same bed. Initially said they had sex once, once turned to twice, twice turned to maybe during the first two weeks.

One night we were talking about circumcision and she was very defensive of uncircumcised penises. Quite odd because I wasn't saying anything bad and I am circumcised. Weeks later I asked why, if someone she had a relationship with was self conscious of their uncircumcised penis. She said no, didn't get why she'd be so defensive. Turns out she did have a boyfriend with one.

Am I overreacting? Am I right to feel so wronged?

667,"Years ago, I was friends with a girl in college, call her Katie, and it was purely that. She was dating a guy and I a girl who I am now married to. Anyway, this girl and I were very close and I considered her to be one of, if not, my best friend. 

We would hang out quite often and there was never anything more than being friends. I even helped her boyfriend surprise her from time to time by picking him up from the airport and she would give me advice on what to get for my girlfriends birthday or whatever. 

At a point, she had become friends with a lot of mine and my girlfriend's friends. One, who we will call Mildred, apparently had a crush on me before my girlfriend and I got together. Mildred and my girlfriend were friends. I chose my girlfriend instead of Mildred and I guess that made her mad. Fast forward and Mildred and Katie were friends. Mildred must have been talking to her behind my back and slandering me because I didn't pick her. My friend, call him Shane, from high school had a crush on Katie and hung out with her a lot too. Apparently to feel cool, Shane started slandering me when talking to Katie along with Mildred. I confirmed all this with a confrontation of the two because things got weird and I didn't know what was going on.

Katie would no longer speak to me and this went on for years. I attempted to text her twice with no reply. So I gave up and said I wouldn't try anymore. But recently, about 5 years later, I am reminded of her and have the urge to try contacting her on Facebook. She is married to the boyfriend now too, according to Facebook.

I have since reconciled things with Shane after these 5 years and would like to do the same with Katie because I miss my best friend. I know we won't be best friends anymore but if I could at least know what went wrong and we could reconcile, I would feel better.

So, now my asking for advice. Do I try messaging her one last time with the expectation of no reply or do I just leave it and ignore it and keep moving on like I have for 5 years?",29Aug2019,1

669,"I am a ""senior"" in college but not really. I am not graduating in the Spring, it may take me an extra semester after that to fully be done with my degree. 

My parents have paid for everything and the only thing they want from me at this point in my life is to finish school and get that piece of paper. 

I am not a school person, I never have been in the 22 years of my life. I went to a private elementary school which was pass/fail. When I went to Middle School I was constantly in the principals office, went to summer school twice, and just barely got by to High School. In High School I also was in the principals office but less than in Middle School. I got C's throughout those 4 years and did not have good enough grades to get in to any Universities. I took 1 year at a local Community College where I got B's and got in the following year to the University I am at right now. It is my 4th year here and I've only got 1 semester (freshman year) where I ever achieved over a 3.0 gpa. 2 seperate semesters I flunked and I am currently on Academic Warning. If I do not get my overall GPA over a 2.0 by the end of this semester I will be put on Academic Probation for one semester. I am currently at a 1.86 overall GPA and I am now taking 5 classes all upper level for my Major and I am struggling already and it's the second week of the semester. 

A little background about myself. I am adopted. I was adopted the day I was born and am the only child of my parents who I love dearly. They love me too but I know that they insist on me getting this degree even though they've seen me struggle in school my entire life. My struggles in school and with the principal when I was younger have put an enormous amount of stress on my parents especially my Father who had to go to a therapist when I was younger because of me. I have never gotten in trouble with the law. 

My parents are both extremely intelligent and went to an Ivy league school. They are also workaholics (now retired) and I was predominantly raised by a caretaker when I was in my Youth who is like a grandma figure to me. I am still in close touch with her, she lives in the town over. 

I am becoming a man now and it is time for me to make the biggest decision of my life. I am almost certain that this is not the right path for me. I am confident that I can find success and happiness in this world without the degree even though I am fully aware how much harder that is to do without one. I do not know where or how I will find success but I know that I will not find it here at this University. 

I go to school across the country from my hometown and family and I hate it here. I have voiced this to my parents for years now to which they respond ""You are almost done, you are so close, just stick it out.."". 

My parents would be so upset to hear my decision and try to do whatever they could to get me to stay here and get my degree no matter what it took. I don't think they understand nor care about the mental toll this place and this lifestyle has on me. I thrive in the work place, I worked 6 days a week on average this past summer at a Restaurant and was consider for a management position even though it was my first year working there. It is a big company in a small town which I love working for and it brought me more joy than I've had in years. The prospect of going home and working there and being happy even though I wouldn't be making much money is something I would much rather do than be miserable at school and wasting my time and my parents money. 

I am fully willing to pay my parents back every cent they spent on me here even if it takes a decade to do so. I do not plan on taking advantage of them like that. This decision is bigger than money. Money is not something that I value highly in my life. 

What do you think I should do?

TL;DR: My parents have paid for 4 years of college for me but I hate school and have never been good at it and feel I can be happy and successful in life without it. This is is not how my parents view life. This is the biggest decision of my life.",29Aug2019,2

I was raised by my grandparents, and they're usually the ones putting pressure on me to do well so I don't end up like the ""family."" And over time it took it's toll on me. I got to high school, started to focus more on friendships because I rarely talked to anyone and really had no friends all throughout elementary and middle school. I just didn't fit in and couldn't relate. 

I started going out more, and for one summer everything felt perfect and I was happy. But as soon as that summer ended, my life kinda went to shit. When I went back to school, I started failing all my classes. The reason is because I was 16, dating a dude in his 30's online, and somebody had reported it to the police. 

I lost my phone, my laptop, which made me lose contact with any potential friends from high school. My best friend moved away, and the police thing stressed me out beyond belief because the guy I had been ""dating,"" well I cared about him deeply and didn't want him to go to jail, he wasn't this horrible guy everyone made him out to be. 

He never got arrested, but I did end up dropping out of high school and getting my GED. I finally got a job, and my license, but don't have a car. But the past two years have just been terrible because they've been riddled with anxiety and this need to get away from my Grandparents and family because I feel like they just don't understand me as a person. 

But right now, nothing is wrong in my life. I go to work, come home, and think about what I want to do with my life. I want to go to community college, but don't know what I want to study. 

I just feel so fucking empty right now though. I'm way too passive in social situations, and sometimes get treated badly by others and don't even realize I was being treated badly until someone else points it out. It's making me nervous. 

I guess I just don't have any motivation right now. Before I was motivated by my anxiety, thinking if I failed my classes I would end up homeless, or thinking that if I did anything out of the norm, something bad would happen to me. Similar thing for rules, I'm only motivated to be good, not out of a sense of wanting to be good, but out of a sense that I won't get yelled at if I break a rule. 

But there are no rules for me right now. I'm totally free and I have no idea what to do with this freedom. I'm somewhat afraid to go out and buy a car, because currently I have the most money I've ever owned and I don't want to spend it all immediately. It's not even that much, just $1k. But I feel like a prisoner at home because I never get to go anywhere. My parents just go to work, come home, maybe ask me how my day was, and go to sleep and do the same thing over. We never go anywhere fun, not even when I was a kid. My grandpa moans and complains every time I ask him to take me somewhere, so I just stopped asking after awhile. 

But has anyone else gone through something similar? Or similar feelings at least? I'm just kinda lost.. I'm 18 btw.",29Aug2019,2

672,"I know this sounds like the most cliché question but I’m a little bit lost.

My boyfriend and I were together for 1.5 years, 9 months long distance. We had no issues apart from trying to close the distance. We genuinely never ever fought, minor arguments of course but nothing major and always resolved immediately.

The weeks before the break up he was the sweetest. Random texts telling me how much he loved and missed me, kept a photo of me by his bed saying he wanted to see me each night, all that gooey stuff. During my last visit he had surprise gifts for me, took extra time off to see me, introduced me to all of his friends, we had an amazing time. 

The week after I came back we were mid planning our next visit and got into a little argument about planning days off. He said he needed time to think and eventually he said he didn’t want to plan his life and that he didn’t think we could be together anymore?

My question is how can I trust the next relationship when things seemed so perfect in this one? It was genuinely out of the blue!",29Aug2019,1
673,"Background information:
(21f) am from Europe. Growing up I've always fantasised about moving to different countries, mostly England but for a while also Canada. However these were probably just kids and teen fantasies of how cool life would be if I did it. I am actually very happy in my country, it really is a great country and I'm close to my family. 
1.5 years ago I was backpacking around Europe and met my now boyfriend who is Australian. We have a great relationship and it was clear for both of us very early in the relationship that we want to stay together. He attempted to move to my country but it didn't work out for multiple reasons. So now the ball is in my court, I will have to move to Australia if I want to stay with him. I've spent quite a bit of time there and even though at first my boyfriend was the only reason why I even considered moving there he is no longer the only reason. I fell in love with the country and every time I'm there I am very very happy. I have some friends there that I'm close with and my boyfriend's family has welcomed me with open arms and make me feel like I'm part of the family. I'm a big thinker and blindly rushing into things is definitely not something I do. So we decided that I will do an exchange semester in Australia and stay there for 6 months to get an even better idea of what it's like. I'll do that next January. 

Now my dilemma:
I love both countries, my country and Australia. I probably love my country a tiny bit more but not enough to justify breaking up with my boyfriend over it. I feel at home in both places and I have people that I love in both places. It feels like I have 2 homes but I'm not really at home in either place. When I'm in one country there are things that I miss about the other and vice versa. I feel torn and like I stopped belonging. 
A quick example: today I arrived back in my country after visiting my boyfriend in Australia. As we were flying over the Alps I started crying but I didn't know why. Part of me cried because I was so happy to see these mountains that mean home to me again. Part of me cried because I went see my boyfriend for I while and another part of me probably cried because I'll miss how easy going everyone is in Australia. 
I'm basically lost because two worlds and I'm scared that I will never be truly happy cause I'll always miss some things from the country I'm not in.
Is anyone in a similar situation and how did you cope? Just general advice is welcome as well. 

Tldr: I love 2 countries and I'm scared that I'll never be truly happy cause I'll always miss the country that i won't be in.",29Aug2019,1
674,"Backstory: I used to be in a relationship with someone, it ended badly. We aren’t on talking terms anymore blah blah whatever. 

Now here’s where I’m paranoid: I think they might try to ruin my life. But it has been six months since we’ve broken up, and they haven’t done anything yet I am still paranoid beyond belief.

I feel like they may use texts we’ve sent to each other and take them out of context to make it look like I was being inappropriate, and the thing is I have my texts sent to an expiration date, so I no longer have texts to prove them wrong. I know this is silly because my text messages are only sexual, but they could make it seem like it was unwarranted, when it wasn’t, and I wouldn’t have any proof to back it up.

676,"Trying to summarize a sh*t-show into a shortish post. Bear with me.

I've been at this company for 2.5 years. As of today, in that time I will have had 4 bosses in potentially 4 different departments. Praise be that working as a lowly assistant means you can work in any department. 

There keep being layoffs, earlier this Spring it was so bad that employees were quitting left and right. I was looking for jobs too but I wasn't as lucky. 

I finally had the opportunity to tell my new boss about why people here are jaded. He told me the toxicity here is SO thick that he could FEEL it walking in for his interview. He assured me they knew it was bad and certain members of the executive team were working on making it better. (Took it with a grain of salt, but it was enough to make me calm down about the matter). New boss was working very hard to help make this a better place. 

Well, I get in today and learn my new boss of 4 months,  a Vice President on the executive board, got fired. Not the first time a board executive was fired in the last 6 months. Disgusted but not shocked by this news. I had stopped looking for jobs as I had told myself that every company goes through this and I really do have it cushy, even though I don't get paid enough for my position. 

Well as of right now I'm on my lunch break - they sent out an email explaining that he isn't with the company, but no one has approached me or my team member about it and right this moment, I don't know if I am getting a new supervisor/department again or if I'm getting fired too. 

I overheard a few months back a department head that recently got hired back for the 3rd time say, ""yeah, sometimes people don't know what they have until it's gone"". I had assumed at his high level that meant he keeps returning for a reason. 

My question is a request for perspective- I've convinced myself every company has it's own stuff like this. That this isn't a ""bad"" company, and it's not worth starting all over somewhere else with possibly less benefits.
But the disrespect in management (not telling me to my face my boss was let go), the shakiness of job stability (we have 50% less employees at corporate than we did a year ago), and the fact they keep firing people who are actually trying to make good change has be hesitating. 

I don't really know what I should do. Husband is saying to keep looking for jobs, and I will, but to what extent? Should I hightail it out of here, and sit back and understand that it'll be like this everywhere and I could be jumping from the frying pan and into the fire?",29Aug2019,1
677,"I just watched my neighbor's son back into my car and drive away. I inspected my car for damage and there's a dent in the fender, but it's not too bad. The fender is still intact, it's probably a cosmetic issue at most. 

The son doesn't live at my neighbor's house anymore (he's in his mid 20s), and so far we've been on great terms with our neighbor. I'm not really looking for compensation, I'm just kinda peeved that the kid didn't leave a note or walk up to my house and explain the situation. The neighbor has even complained to me a few times about how his son isn't very responsible and asks them for money frequently.

Do I call up my neighbor? What do I say? And is it even worth bringing up when, in reality, I probably will never get the fender fixed myself since I'm kind of strapped for cash? (If they offered to pay to fix it, obviously I would, but it's something I could probably live with).

680,"So, I heard a rumor about a pretty nasty supervisor at work. It’s a bad rumor. I, being a fucking dumbass, repeated it to someone I thought I was friends with. I immediately said I didn’t think it was true, however, and for them not to tell anyone (idk why I act like that makes it better, but whatever, fuck me). 

Well, it got back to said supervisor, so my boss (different person) took me in and talked to me about spreading rumors, I apologized, I feel fucking awful because I enabled the bullshit, I’m planning to apologize in person next time I see them and bring them chocolates, not sure if that’ll help at all. 

When the rumor got back to them, it was extremely hurtful, and I completely understand and feel remorseful for enabling it, even once. Well, now I’m getting texts from members of their family who are, I guess, getting blamed for starting the rumor? They didn’t. My boss told me that I’m not allowed to disclose who started it, because she doesn’t want my supervisor to try to enact “revenge.” I guess... 

I don’t know what to do. I already know I made a mistake, I think that the person who I told hates me because I won’t date them (another story, they’re married and have come on to me a few times since I opened my fat mouth about the rumor to them) so I feel like they might have blown things even more out of proportion when they told my boss, like... made it sound like I was telling a bunch of people when I just told them and immediately showed remorse for doing so by telling them it probably wasn’t true...? I dunno. 

Pretty much, I’d just like to quit and run away, but I’d have to give 2 weeks, I’ve worked there for 3 years, I have a bunch of shit I need to pay for, I feel screwed.

683,"
I know their names and their faces but I don’t recognise them. Like not in a seeing someone in the street and not realising who they are type of way but in the way that I live with my boyfriend and I don’t know who I’m speaking to I know in my head but I feel panicky, like I don’t know him below his face it’s really hard to explain. I know his face is his but I don’t know him.
I almost feel scared of him although I know he’s the most kind caring person who would never do me any harm.  

I also feel lost in myself, like I don’t know who I am anymore but I’m more sure who I am than who he is or anyone else is. I feel completely self destructive like I don’t see any joy in anything or any point in life. I can remember that I know I have felt like that but have no idea what it feels like.
I want to isolate myself and feel irritable around people, I constantly want to be alone. And 
I feel alone but in a different way, I don’t feel like I can trust anyone around me but I also don’t want to. Everything feels fake. I feel confused because I don’t really have a grip on reality and don’t know what’s going on. I’m very lost,  I just feel out of it and I don’t know what’s going on anymore. 

This seems to happen around the same time of year every year for the past couple but I’ve only noticed right now because I feel like a completely different person that I thought I was a week or two ago.
I’m scared and I’m hoping someone’s can bring me a little peace or help in any way Or give any advice, I’m sorry if this doesn’t make any sense it’s very frantic or if it’s on the wrong sub? Can you recommend another?",29Aug2019,1

686,"Hi, I could really use some life advice. This is going to be long, so sorry in advance.

I've been thinking about becoming a nurse because I really do like helping people, but I'm not sure the job is for me. I know I can get through the school if I put my mind to it. I was always good at school, and medical science really interests me.

However I'm not very good at communication, and am pretty shy. I'm thinking about applying at a nursing home to get an idea if taking care of people is for me, and hopefully give me more confidence talking to people. I'm not entirely sure I have the passion required for being an RN, and this might help me better decide.

Right now I've worked at walmart for over 3 years, and I have 2 suicide attempts under my belt. I've had low self esteem since middle school, and my arms have self harm scars. I feel unattractive, and haven't had a boyfriend yet. My hair has started falling out, which really isn't helping either of those things. It's so scary seeing your body change.

Anyway, I really want to know if life is even worth living? If I do become a nurse, that won't bring my hair back. It can't magically make me like myself or make me more attractive. And I'm not sure it's something I have a passion for. 

It seems that nothing makes me happy. There was a boy I sorta had a thing with, and I really enjoyed being around him but it didnt work out. That's the only thing in a long time I've been really passionate about. There's no career I feel extremely interested in, or like I would really excel in. I don't think I have a place here. I would like a family, but what if my daughter has the same body image issues that I have? And how can I meet a man that's okay with a balding woman?

If anyone has been through anything like this, please, I could use your help. Or if you can see a way out of this dark place I've cornered myself into, I would really appreciate it. Anything helps. Third attempt might be the charm and I'm a little scared",29Aug2019,1

690,"Hey guys. So for a while now I've been debating whether or not I can handle a long-distance relationship with this girl I'm with. 

I want to start with that I'm a very busy guy nowadays and I constantly find myself being stressed out and trying to handle situations on the move. I have 3 jobs,  2 friends, and 1 girlfriend. I work as an office assistant from 9-6 and it's usually super slow, but I still have to be there for 9 hours doing practically nothing. My next job is as a web developer/software engineer working for a company building an app (I can't mention the name). And I do freelancing on the side. All in all I have 2 hours to myself throughout the whole day.

After my first job, I go home, change, and I head straight to the gym. I come home, eat, shower, and work an hour or 2 on my other jobs. I am currently trying to balance all this while having a long-distance relationship, and needless to say I'm not very happy. We see each other every 2 weeks pretty much, and we have a great time, I genuinely like her and like spending time with her, but the in-between is so stressful. I can barely talk to her, we don't facetime, and it's always super difficult to have a conversation with her. She goes to college, but has a lot more free time than I do and never responds to my texts in a timely fashion. It's always one-word responses or meaningless texts. I'm not new to the game. I know she just wants me to chase after her (EVEN THOUGH WE ARE ALREADY IN RELATIONSHIP) so when she responds, I leave her on read or respond 4-6 hours later. This game is getting really old. Like I mentioned earlier, I don't have many friends and she's like the only other person I can talk to about my day.  Things come up and I want to share it, but what's the point when I know she's just going to respond with super generic text 5 hours later?

I feel like I don't have time to deal with this and have more important things to do and it's driving me crazy because I feel like I should be able to share things with my significant other. She says she loves me more than anything and when I confronted her about college and how things were going to workout between us she said that I shouldn't worry because Im the only one in her eyes. She wants us to move in together after this first year of college, but I don't think we are going to make it.

Sometimes I feel like I don't have a girlfriend. In fact, right before I started writing this post, I was trying to make friends with other people on Instagram just so I can have a fucking conversation with someone.

I thought about closing this situation but then one day I just went to her and said that I liked her.I wanted her to think about what I said as a complement.I thought there’s no harm in her knowing that someone likes her.I didn’t expect any response and I didn’t get any.

I felt disappointed and unlucky about the whole situation before even talking to her.

A lot of days have passed since then and I have been trying to get her out of my head but I am not able to.
I think it’s because we see each other everyday.
As I said earlier,I came to know about her relationship through some people who are common between us and I also came to know about a few other things.
Like she is good with a few skills(at work) and she is very social etc.
The part that she is good at something is bugging me.
I really don’t care about other people(except if they are my friends) and what they do usually with their life.
I don’t care if someone is good at something and I am not.There’s never a ounce of jealousy about this but with this girl I am feeling all sorts of things that I usually shouldn’t feel.

702,"This is my second marriage - my adult son lives with us, pays us $240 a month, finished college and works full time. He’s on the autism spectrum and has made amazing strides in his life. Yeah I’m proud and have always been overprotective because he’s easy going, good natured and my fear is someone taking advantage of him. 

My husband has adult kids - one of the daughters is 33 divorced with a 13 year old and lives with her Mom (husbands ex-wife). My husband still owns that house with his ex. He pays the mortgage and other necessities - the divorce did not state that he owed her alimony but he pays for practically everything. They were married a long time. Up until the beginning of the year my husband was still paying car insurance for his daughter and he still pays her cell phone bill. She doesn’t contribute any money to that household.

Back in December one of our vehicles needed $2,000 in repairs. We didn’t have the money. My husband wanted me to ask my son for the money and I wouldn’t because the vehicle is 15 years old and IMO it would be a waste of money. This caused a huge fight - we have a bunch of other problems but this fight was the catalyst to my husband saying he was done and wanted a divorce because he was tired of taking care of everyone else and he was gonna go get himself a career away from here. 

So we’ve been on the brink of divorce and I’ve been looking for jobs and having no luck. He finally got the money to fix the vehicle after 4 months of it being in the garage. Now it’s broken down again and needs $1,500 in repairs. I know he’s gonna want me to ask my son and here we go all over again.

Am I in the wrong for not wanting to take my sons money? He’s saving up because he knows our divorce is coming and he wants to be prepared. He paid off almost $20k in student loans at the beginning of the year and had to start saving all over again. 

Let me also add that my husband paid for a very costly divorce/custody battle for his daughter. She’s never attempted to pay him back.",29Aug2019,1

706,"18 F. English is not my first language so I am sorry about the grammar.

Sooo a year ago I got accepted to university (pretty good exam results). We had a meeting in the summer and there were some classmates who decided to go party at my ex's friend's apartment. There was a boy who would go all showing how he wanted me here and now (jerk) and I am not into that kind of thing so my ex asked me to date him right away (we knew each other for 3 days). He kind of tried to protect me and also expressed how he had liked me already.

So the school started. His parent rented and apartment for him and I lived in a dorm so we would always hang out at his place and basically live together (17 at the time). I'm not exactly huge school smart or good at housekeeping but he was the worst at both. We would almost cry doing our technical drawings for the first time and he would tear his out of rage (I also sometimes threw tantrums but not that often and big).

So I was basically studiyng for us both, cooking when I wasn't tired af (some problem with my brain getting oxygen) and I began to not feel satisfied with him. We would argue every single day and I could often pack my stuff and walk to the dorm. We dated for less than 3 month when he almost hit me (pretended) and I walked away one more time but came back soon (don't know why - my friends blame it on my low self asteem).

Anyway, a couple of weeks later I brought my stuff to the dorm as he was moving to his own apartment and never brought them back. At the weekend I was gone to my parents' house (doing it weekly), wished him good night and a minute later got a notification from an abandoned convo with his friends that we used to arrange his birthday. There were some pics of him and his friends drinking and smoking in the kitchen (I wasn't allowed to do it there and he smokes too). I called him and asked if he wanted to tell me something (we agreed not to drink often and apart from each other). He said he didn't know what I was talking about and was already in bed (at 10 p.m. when we usually only went at about midnight). I told him what I saw and he said that he didn't see the photos (deleted by his friend). We got into an argument and the next day I asked my friend for advice as it wasn't a regular kind of argument. She told me to dump him as I wanted to some time earlier and I agreed (thank her to that day).

That's when it all starts. He would stalk me and force me to meet him (bringing my thing to my dorm) for about a month. I got a new boyfriend when he asked someone to leave flowers (don't love them) and candies with a note to my room (nobody exept the relatives or dorm students are allowed in) and my boyfriend saw it and almost dumped me. I got all berserk on the ex and told him to stay away in a rude way. A couple of weeks later my boyfriend dumped me and I got all drunk with a friend. She was all into some boy partying with us so I went to sleep alone and got pissed about how nobody needed me and wrote a message to ex for fun asking to bring cigs (wasn't 18 at the time) and he came all happy to finally see me returning to him (no). He asked who hurt me (I rarely drink and especially that much). I was teasing him and laughing at him but agreed to go to his place and basically forced him to have sex with me and then left in the morning saying it doesn't mean or change anything.

He got all crazy from that day on going back and forth between loving and hating me. It was maybe one time in 3 weeks. I got a new new boyfriend and the ex knew it so he called me at the night and asked how it was all going at the dorm (I was at a boyfriends at the time) then would say he was high but knew something about my new boyfriend that would make me dump him (he didn't). A couple of months passed and he wrote again. He wanted me or the boyfriend (I couldn't tell as the ex is dumb af and is talking like an idiot) to come over and talk (he gave the address). We ignored but my precious loving boyfriend honestly wanted to protect me and was on the edge.

I always told him the ex was crazy and rich so it's not a good idea to mess with him as he might have by boyfriend expelled. Another couple of months passed and the ex started to text me from some fake accounts trying to pick me up as a stranger or straight up have sex but always failed to hide who he was (purpously or not). It happened again a few days ago. My boyfriend got really pissed (we've been together for more that 6 months now) and was ready to go and talk to the ex. The this is, I'm scared the ex would hit him or kill him (I'm pretty the ex is ill) but I also want he to f off already.

I'm really sorry for that long of a post, it is my first and I really need help - what should we do? Go meet with ex and talk? Should I go alone? Should my boyfriend go? Or should we ignore him? I've been with ex for 3 month but he has been bothering me for a year. I would be grateful for any kind of advice and give more details if needed. Thank you very much.",29Aug2019,1
707,"Ok. I'm in a stage of my life that **I NEED** to take some decisions. I'm asking you guys here cause I need some external help. 

I have 21 years old. When I was ten my father puts me in a music conservatory because since I was a little boy I had a lot of interests in music things (We always listened to Pink Floyd and Beatles together). He putted me in that conservatory because he always wanted a 'family band' (He plays guitar, but stopped because of his work). 

So, I entered the conservatory and that thing just blew my mind. I was there for two months and I had learned A LOT and being as more productive in studying as I could. After some years, my childhood friend and I set up a band with other 2 guys and we're playing since then. 

So here the problems begins. When I was in high school my father always told me *'oh, douglas, you need to do a Law University because you will earn money. Stop with the music'*. I was young and don't stopped to think about what my real ME really wanted, so I entered a law university then and I'm in the 4th year. 

When I was a teenager I went to concerts hidden from him, because he saw me doing the thing as a work. A few years ago, when my father took sense and saw me running by my on legs doing music, booking shows, travelling, recording and growing with this, he just asked me to stop. Simple as throwing a piece of paper in the trash. Simple as that.  

Now, I'm doing an internship in a law office writing this and I'm not happy. I could study 10 hours a day to be the best drummer I wanted to be. But, man, I don't understand how his opinion shakes me at the point I can't just say to him 'Ok dad, I don't want to be a lawyer, neither a Judge'. My father is a difficult person. He yells with me and make pression when I tell him I'm not gonna leave the music just for study law. He keeps saying things like *'Ok, you won't use the car anymore or You're disappointing me. It's not that I wanted for you. If I had the opportunities to study as you can when I was your age I was jumping of happiness. I'm SAD for you'*. I have my 2 bands. I have my own projects. I'm trying to study a lot hidden because I don't have money enough to leave my house and live alone. I know if I tell the truth for him he won't talk with me for a great period of time. It's difficult to do this because I really love being and talking with him. Well, he's my best friend and my father!

I know the life of a musician isn't easy as a lawyer is (in terms of making money easily - at least in the country I live), but, I think a lot in things like 'Man, did I need to leave this life I really want for me, for my future, for my healthcare and for my happiness because of money?'. I know if I dive in the law universe I won't be the same musician as I always wanted...

What can I do? **Can you give me some advices?**",29Aug2019,1
708,I recently got a kitten about a month ago (he's getting neutered in 2 weeks) and he has been going the bathroom nonstop all over the house. At first it was just a couple of accidents and I thought he was still getting used to the house but it's getting worse. There's a big litter box downstairs for him with a cover to give him privacy . He also has a litter box in the corner of my room since he sleeps up there during the night. I caught him purposely not using his litter box multiple times. I'll place him in the litter box and he''ll still go to the bathroom in my room. I can't even have my closet open because he peed in a shoe box in there. He peed on my fresh towels and also behind a shelf . It got even worse. He peed on a pair of slides that were $30 and I had to throw them away. He also peed on my other pair of Nike's that were $140 and I tried wiping them down but I can still smell him. It's disgusting. He peed inside a basket of all my baby sister's shoes!! Some were brand new!! He also peed all over her carriage. It's getting bad to the point where my mom wants me to get rid of him if he can't stop going everywhere.,29Aug2019,1

Check out the link for a few different photos from various angles. 

I’d wanted a snake tattoo on my shoulder for a long time to balance out the blocky black one beneath it, and I finally found an artist who does a lot of snakes, so I trusted her work. I told her what I was looking for and this is what I got. 

For the first 15 minutes I was thrilled, but then I noticed how thin the snake is... like, unnaturally thin. I know some snakes are skinny, but its head is twice the size of its body in parts, and it doesn’t get thicker in the middle at all like real snakes do. I worry it looks more like a worm or a rope, especially because of the style of the ridges on its underbelly. I don’t think it matches the quality of her other work and I’m just... disappointed. 

So here I am, asking the following: is it all in my head? And if it’s not, what are my options? I can’t imagine it really lends itself to a cover-up unless I were to get an all-black snake. And I don’t see any other way it can be altered. Thanks in advance.",29Aug2019,1
710,"So a month or so ago, I went to Amsterdam with a group of my friends, 4 of us total. It was me, a close friend, another friend, and a girl who I liked (bit more context, I had made out with her at a rave a few months prior, and lingering feelings were still there). After the 1st day of partying in the city, I noticed that my close friend and the girl started flirting heavily, with the girl even holding my friends hand and laying on him as we wee going around the city. Later on, when me and the close friend were waiting at hoofddorp station, I told him that I liked the girl and how I wouldn’t know how to feel if she slept with someone else, and his response exactly was “If she comes onto me, Im gonna do it because I have a ‘don’t-really-care attitude’ and I wanna enjoy what comes my way.” I was quite baffled by that response, but didn’t respond back or fight in any way because I knew it would be a losing battle due to his stubbornness. He continued flirting with her the entirety of the next day (my birthday) and when the girl and other friend left, he still texted with her a lot, culminating in a date they went on a few days ago. after this date, he went up to a close friend of mine at school and asked if I had mentioned the girl to him at all. Then he confessed that she had asked him to become her boyfriend, to which he rejected noting that she was moving away for university in a few weeks. The worst part is that this behavior continued when we left the netherlands and went to brussels, with him butting into a conversation between me and a spanish girl who I was interested in and im overriding anything I said. My european friends were even shocked with his behavior. 

As of this point, I am completely over the girl. Frankly, I am repulsed by the thought of her, but I am still hurt and can’t really get over the fact that he, a close friend of 5 years, would betray me, not only with my crush in amsterdam, but with a girl in brussels too. Im not too sure if I am overreacting, but the main issue I have is that he still treats me like we are best of pals and he ignores everything that happened. He had supposedly told my european friends that he was going to talk to me because he seemingly noticed my slightly somber mood, but of course, he never did. I see him everyday since we work and go to school together. 

At this point, I don’t really know what to do or how to feel",29Aug2019,2

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.",29Aug2019,0
715,"Backstory is in the couple of posts in my post history. 

It’s been a couple of months now since that night that my ex-best friend and I had drunken sex, and then after he left, his best friend raped me. All I’ve been feeling is guilt and remorse for having taken things too far with him and being selfish. I know it’s not completely my fault, but both of us threw away an amazing friendship over one night of drunk stupidity, in addition to me getting raped that night by his best friend after he left. 

Everything happened so fast after that night, there was no time to really say anything. I understand now, in a way, why he decided to cut me off even when I was hurting so badly from both incidents. It was either his girlfriend, or me. I get why he chose her over me, and I only want the best for him. 

It’s been killing me the last 2 months to have mutual friends tell me about the things they’ve been doing with him, and still seeing pictures. My ex-best friend and I did so much together and shared so much in common. Although I’m starting to move past it, it’s hard. 

Next week I have to return to university for the semester, where the rape occurred, but also where my ex-best friend and I hung out all the time. The few times I had to go to the university during the summer after all this happened, I felt like I was going insane and I would cry for a couple days after. 

My ex-best friend has me blocked on social media, but would it be right to ask to talk to him through one of our mutual friends? I feel like the closure and apology to him would really lift the weight off my shoulders. 

TL;DR: I had drunken sex with my ex-best friend, and after he left, I got raped by his best friend. Because of what happened between the two of us, he cut off all contact. Is it reasonable to want to want to get back in contact and make an apology?",29Aug2019,1

722,"I chose to board my cat recently at the vet for one week. This was the first time I've ever boarded my cat and did so because he is old and not healthy (chronic liver disease). I suspect he has just weeks to live and I didn't want to leave him alone in the event the worst case scenario happened while I was gone. Vet had a reasonable rate of $26/day. I expected a bill of $223 but it was actually $342. One, they over billed me for one day which is being reimbursed. The remaining difference is that they gave my cat medication for nausea. Not only was I charged for the pills but I was then charged $8.50 per day to administer the pills (1/2 to 1 pill a day for 6 days). They never called to get my permission or inform me of this extra cost of approx $93. My cat throws up about once a week. The same vet has already said there's nothing more conventional medicine can do so I clean it up and move on. I explained to the vet tech when I dropped the cat off that he will likely throw up, probably once, and don't worry, it's normal. I called to express my annoyance at the extra cost and was told it was done at the vet's discretion, i.e., too bad, case closed. If they had called me for my permission to administer the medicine, I would not have allowed it. But, the cat puked once and they immediately medicated him for basically the entire time he was there. Because I boarded my cat at the vet, did I give up full control over the care of my cat and subsequent cost for medicine that I believe was unnecessary? Has anyone dealt with a similar issue and was successful at being reimbursed? How did you properly argue it? This is such a terrible situation because I truly love the vet office and the entire staff is wonderful. I'm just so annoyed that I'm now considering not ever going back.

724,"So my favorite brand is Ralph Lauren. Typically, an outfit is around $90 plus tax. I try to find whatever I like online which is usually cheaper.

I always felt happy because I would pay less that the retail price even if I had to search around and wait until it came in the mail.

But today I went to the mall, and they had a bunch of Ralph Lauren items for $20.

Now I just feel upset and ripped off. I used to be happy because I felt that Ralph Lauren was good quality and looked nice, but now I’m just feeling like a chump. Even the founder of Ralph Lauren doesn’t wear Ralph Lauren, he wears target and Walmart clothes and seems to be proud of it.

This last button up I purchased on eBay for $50 when it’s listed at $90, and I just saw it at the mall for $20, which made me feel even more ripped off. I can picture the seller finding it for $20 and just making an extra $30 easy off me.

It just seems foolish. Maybe you have a lot of money and buying clothes doesn’t impact you at all, like maybe it’s the equivalent of me buying a coffee of piece of candy, but for me it’s a lot.

Am I being foolish for buying these clothes or is it worth it? They usually seem to make me fairly happy even though of course I get over it.

I love my wife. Weve been together a few years with no issues. Except one. Shes extremely codependant. I like to play video games, im a male in my early 20s and i work full time. Ive played video games my whole life and its how i wind down and relax at the end of the day. My wife on the other hand, finds her relaxation and 'wind down' by spending time with me. Which is fine, i have no trouble with spending time, going out for dinner, watching movies, or anything like that with her(although i dont find the same enjoyment from movies or tv shows that she does, i do it purely to spend time together)

The problem lies in both of us being introverts. She recharges by being near me, and i recharge by being totally and utterly alone. I love being alone. Its probably my favorite state to be in. Anyway, the only think i love more than being alone is playing games alone(or with a friend online but physically alone)

My wife fucking hates it. She wont admit it, but i see it in her eyes and hear it in her voice. I have a computer in the living room that i usually use so that she can get her wish of being in the same room as me while i can also do my own thing, but it doesnt seen like thats enough for her. She tells me that she feels like she has to ""Fight for my attention and that shes being forgotten."" When i play because sometimes i ask her to repeat something that she says.

Its hit a point where i have to basically ask permission to play on a computer i paid for myself, in a house i pay for, with internet that, again, i pay for, after working 11-12 hour days. Shes overly dependant with everything i do. I need to grab something from the store? ""Im coming with you."" I want to just chill in the bed upstairs and read alone? ""Ill sit beside you."" Whenever i bring it up she gets quite and pulls the ""its because i love spending time with you"" and tells me that when I say that i just want a little alone time she takes it as ""I want time alone from YOU."" Even tho she immediately says that she knows that isnt what i mean.

Because of all this, ive felt my desite to have sex with just... drop over these past few months. I love her dearly but when it comes to the end of the night im so burnt out spending time with her every waking second im not at work i just couldnt care less. I feel so smothered and dont know what to do. Anything, literally any advice would be helpful.

Sorry this ending up being so long. Once i started typing i just couldnt stop",29Aug2019,0
731,"We’re in a long distance relationship, before when we played other games he always made sure to include me in everything but since we started this one... I feel left out. He’s made a bunch of friends that I don’t talk to because of my anxiety so it ends up in him making all the challenges and fights with them and leaving me aside. Not to mention there’s no mic feature in this game, so we don’t even get to chat like we did before. Maybe I’m just being ridiculous, but I miss him and I’m starting to not know how to deal with this. He takes around 1 hour to answer a dm of mine but I see him talking in chat with everyone in that time. It hurts.

I have thought of just going up to her and start talking a couple of times but I end up getting cold feet. I get anxious around a girl I really really like. Im usually a quiet person and don’t really talk unless I’m spoken to or I need to.

The only times I’ve interacted with her was at orientation and when my badge clip broke and had to get a new one from her which was a couple of months ago and very brief, also some eye contact if that counts.

Everyone involved in this story is a senior in high school. So i was at a friends going away party and naturally as most of the people left, a small group of us began to drink. I had to be home by two so I did not consume any alcohol. My best friend (X) was absolutely hammered by the time I left, and I had never seen him this drunk. There were a couple girls there and we are all pretty close friends so of course I felt fine leaving the girls alone and drunk with these guys, my friends. This was two nights ago.

Come today when I hear of something ""NOT good"" being talked about in our group chats, they say it has nothing to do with me but I still freaked out. I called my best friend, lets call him X (the very drunk one at the party). When i asked him whats going on he started crying and explained to me that apparently he sexually assaulted (felt up without permission) our mutual friend (Z) and doesn't remember ANY of it. This came as a COMPLETE surprise to me because X is not that type of person, nor that type of drunk (or at least I thought). Z's boyfriend (who is also a close friend of mine and was not at the party) told X about everything that he apparently did to Z at the party. Z's boyfriend texted our group chat about meeting tomorrow to talk about everything. Z's boyfriend tells me that Z can barely sleep at night and has been crying so much. I sent Z a text letting her know that I'm sorry that it happened, that i wish I could've been there to stop it, and if she needed someone to talk to i was there. 

Now I'm sitting here typing this and i don't know what to do. I cannot tell my parents because I would be in so much trouble. How can I make sure the police don't get involved, as this would ruin everyone's lives? I want to detach myself from this situation but I cant, I think I need to be there for my friends but honestly I have no clue what the right move is.

I don’t want to be out of touch with them, but I also wonder at times if I’m considering reaching out too often or if I’d be bugging them if I did so I wind up talking myself out of texting or something.

Question:
How should I appeal to him to ascend in position? I am hoping to become the company COO, as I am someone who enjoys management and directing the company in these times of growth.

Question Part 2:
Since I am nearly done developing a model for a new fuel cell cycle that may be energy-dense enough for planes, my current plan to climb the corporate ladder is to go to him, present the concept as it applies to planes, and ask for a team and resources to develop a more advanced model and eventually a prototype. Through that, I'm hoping that I can prove myself to him. Upon completion of the plane project, I would then ask him for a position like COO in order to continue with such projects down the line. Is this a good path that I should take, or should I try something else?

744,"Throwaway, because everyone relevant to this story knows my real account.

For context, we are all in high school.

Several months ago, my friend, who will be called Aaron from here on out, was found out to be having several ""fan-fictions"" of a classmate, called Marge. These stories, which were highly, highly, sexual in nature, consisted of Aaron's fantasies of performing vile, sexual acts with Marge. These stories made their way around school like wildfire, naturally, resulting in essentially Aaron being ostracized by our grade level. 

In the passing time, these stories took a brutal emotional effect on Marge and her family, as they would. Aaron became deeply regretful and endured the punishment the school gave him and losing friends and attempting to futilely save face - he was salutatorian of our grade level as well, to make matters worse. (Not that this exonerates or forgives him in any way). 

Now here's where I need advice: in any other situation, I would immediately castigate Aaron for his actions. What he did was undeniably awful, and I made sure to tell him this. I did not condone what he did for one second and he has to face the consequences. Except he was my friend. And I know that shouldn't change anything, but it does, because I was the one he kept coming back to for advice and help and I essentially became a shoulder to cry on every night.

My attempts to cut conversations short failed, because he said he \*needed\* me. So I stuck with him, in private (so no one else knew I ""supported"" him) through everything, including nearly being sued by Marge's family.

This has continued for the past couple months. And I need to know, is what I did wrong? Should I have cut ties with him (and should I now?) I \*abhor\* men who take advantage of women and have absolutely no respect for them, or at least I thought I did until now. Because I can't seem to cut Aaron away from my life, because he is remorseful beyond doubt, and that semblance of humanity that he is showing is preventing me from doing so.",29Aug2019,1

770,"My best friend of several years recently started to care so much about what other people think of her and who she is close with, it’s becoming insufferable. 

She recently took a trip to Europe and upon coming back she’s like a different person. She started telling people she was European and dragging anything she deems “too American”. She used to be really good at giving advice and was a really great listener, but now any time one of us has a relationship problem she opens with “and *this* is the problem with American men!!” and goes on to drag them. 

She recently got into a new relationship and in less than a week cheated with an old flame. I told her she shouldn’t go out with the ex because I knew this would happen. She said if she doesn’t go it would make her “look like a pussy”. After the cheating she blamed everyone but herself, because it couldn’t be her fault “how would that make me look!”

She also made a big dramatic display when one of our friends didn’t want to talk to someone they don’t like at a party. They weren’t pouting or being rude, they simply ignored the person and carried on having a good time. She said this made them look “totally beta” and said her whole view of them is now changed.

I’ve really never liked homeschooling. I understand why my mom does it, as the public schools within my neighborhood are shitty, and online school is easy and flexible, but, homeschooling an extroverted child was one of the worst parenting decisions she’s ever made. 

Academic wise, I’m doing well, I do pretty okay on state tests, I have good grades, but it’s easy to cheat and get by when I’m depressed. I hate doing that, so I try to do honest work even when I feel like shit. I used to be very behind academically but online school and the fact that I’m now taught by actual teachers has helped me excel. I’m very thankful for that. I’m taking APs and Honors this year.

Socially, I’m doing okay, but I guess this is where the problem comes in: I just don’t feel like I’m being prepared for life. I’m very book smart, but I have little to no street smarts.

So I’ve wanted to go back to regular school, preferably a charter school in my area, to gain more street smarts, have more friends, to sharpen my life skills and social skills, to have more memories, etc. I don’t want high school to be remembered as sitting at my bedroom desk all day, on the computer, talking to my “virtual” Evangelical Christian classmates who I cannot relate to.

Literally, I can’t relate to anyone in my school. I’m queer, I’m not particularly religious, I’m a liberal, I don’t like homeschooling, I’m an extrovert, etc.

Anyway, I’ve had to fight my mom, almost literally- for her to even consider putting me into charter school or a magnet school in my city. She tells me that I won’t be able to handle getting up so early, that I’ll be clueless, that I can’t even take public transportation, that I’ll get bullied, so why even try. It really brings down my self esteem. Whenever I’ve tried to apply to schools, she’s sabotaged it someway. When I tried getting a job this summer, both my parents sabotaged that as well and ruined my self esteem. Despite having eroded self-esteem and dreading leaving the flexibility of online school behind, I still want to go back to “normal” school, just to feel normal. I’ve always felt out of place because of the fact that I’m homeschooled and I hate it.

How can I convince her to let me go to a charter school or a nicer public school? Is there any way I can enroll this year and transfer, or should I wait until next year? I honestly want to make a change as soon as possible. I want a different life. Homeschooling may be for other people, but it is not for me.",29Aug2019,1

774,"Ok, the title is a little confusing but here is the back story:

When I was 16 years old (roughly 17 years ago) my grandpa surprised me with a 1966 Ford Mustang. He let me choose the color and for months would update me with the progress of fixing it up (he’s a mechanic).  After some time passed he said it was taking longer to finish than he had expected and 2 years went by. I visited him and he told me his wife was tired of looking at the Mustang in their yard and he sold it. I was beyond devastated. But I accepted it, as I had no choice. I have pictures of it in my teenage scrapbook still. 

Flash forward to a few weeks ago. My mom dropped a bomb. My grandpa still has my car, in his yard. I want so badly to bring it up but don’t know what to say. I know he has no idea how much it hurt when he told me he got rid of it after years of waiting.

775,"I'm a high school senior from Serbia, basically 3rd world. The time of me choosing a college is coming closer.

I've always wanted to work with criminals and do detective work, specifically in a bigger country like America, I don't like my country too much... I always liked detective movies and shows and have been watching mindhunter these past few days. That's literally my dream job, interviewing criminals and trying to understand and profile them and also helping police with cases and doing that detective work. 

Now I can't go to police academy ( Criminology ) college, Law college wouldn't help much because the law is too different. And I always liked psychology. Would the degree in psychology help achieve my goals? 

My plan is to, after finishing college, either go to US for additional psychology studies, get a citizenship, work for the police force and try joining FBI or so on. Or, finish my studies here, work for police here and then transfer to America either police force or FBI.

779,"Throwaway. I need some advice on this *very* difficult situation. 

As the title says, my 24 year old brother in law (BIL) is autistic. I would describe him as high functioning but he does need significantly more help with money/time management. He’s been living with my also disabled father in law (FIL) and his girlfriend (GF) in GF’s house with a literal ton of other random kids. The situation there is repugnant and I’ve genuinely considered calling CPS on them. They tell BIL that because he’s “handicapped” he’s a stain on the family, he’s only good for getting money off the government and will never need a job, refuse to help him with any money related issues and blatantly steal his money. BIL’s only bathroom is a toilet in the middle of the laundry room, and there 10+ small children running around unsupervised at all times. FIL and GF have taken in several of her “grandkids” (who aren’t actually related to anyone, they’re just kids from the neighborhood who don’t/can’t live with their parents anymore) and they’re all watched solely by FIL. 

BIL has was being treated worse than usual lately in June so we made a plan for him to stay with us after my mother in law’s family reunion, which we would all be at. So he came home after the reunion with us (me, hubby and our baby, we live 8 hours away from BIL’s house) and stayed for about a week and we took him back to GF’s house. When we got there my FIL starts yelling about how we were supposed to help him get his driver’s license (which was never discussed by anyone) so I left and my husband finished the awful convo with FIL. I went to the bathroom and found the toilet literally filled up with shit, piss all over the floor and moldy children’s clothes all over the place. I was disgusted and told my BIL that if he ever needed to come back and work on things (getting his GED, a driver’s license ect.) that I will come get him in a heartbeat. 

Later that day BIL says he got in his room and thought about living there again for a little bit and decided he was upset with how he was being treated and wanted to come back with us.  Amazing, except we have a 2bed 1bath apartment and it’s *super* cramped with him here so we made a plan to work on things for a month and see what he wants to do instead of making it permanent. So we took him back with us, worked on the stuff he wanted to work on and made a lot of progress. I’m very proud of him honestly, he’s come a long way. 

But now he’s ready to go back “home” to GF’s house with his newfound knowledge since the month is up, which I thought was a bad idea but I supported him doing what he wants to do. GF and FIL have been calling every now and then to get BIL to send back the keys to his bedroom (he pays rent and a few other bills so for all intents and purposes, they’re his roommates). BIL refused and never sent it back, they seemed okay with it but haven’t called since BIL said no, and that was AUG 9.  

Fast forward to this week. He’s been trying to get ahold of FIL for a few days to see where/when he can meet us but has not gotten any response so he calls GF. GF says FIL has been camping for three days with no estimated return time and that she had given BIL’s room to another kid who lives in the house. They DRILLED A DAMN HOLE IN THE DOOR to get it open so they could take anything BIL had there, trash or sell it, and give the now empty room to a kid they were about to kick out. 

BIL still wants to go back because GF said she’d “figure out a place for him” and she seemed genuinely sorry. This is the woman who tells him he’s less of a person because he’s autistic so I 100% do not believe she’ll do anything for him. I’m so upset and hurt by their actions and BIL is mad but seems to be brushing it off, like stuff like this happens all the time at their house. He’s been working his ass off here to be a better person and improve his life, which is exactly what he wanted but I’m scared that if he goes back to FIL and GF it’ll all go away. 

How the heck do I handle this? It’s pretty clear (to me and my husband anyway) that FIL and GF do not want him there and don’t care where he goes, mostly because they’ve legitimately said that to him. I think BIL just doesn’t want to accept it because he loves their dad. What should I do, just let him live with these terrible people until they fully break his sprit? 

TL;DR my autistic brother in law is being boarder line abused by his dad and dad’s gf so he came to stay with us. He pays rent there (and paid for the month he was staying with us) but they gave away his room and won’t give it back when he comes home.  What do I say to him? It seems obvious to me that they do not want him in their house but he wants to go back since they might “figure something out.”",29Aug2019,3

This is crazy long, and I'm sorry for that. I ended up kinda venting my frustrations, but it also gives more of the story/background. Thanks for reading!

&amp;#x200B;

Hello! My boyfriend and I (both early 20s), live with our two roommates (another couple, also early 20s) in a nice but also fairly affordable apartment/duplex. We have all lived here together since May of 2018. 

I myself found the apartment, contacted the landlord, and set up all of the meetings between the landlord before we moved in. Since we moved in, my boyfriend and I have been the one who have contacted our landlord for repairs/issues, as well as being the ones that he has contacted regarding the apartment. My boyfriend and I have primarily furnished the house (save kitchen appliances, because those were supplied by our landlord). We went through the process of setting up utilities and internet, and have everything in our name. The only thing they have really brought to the apartment is their own bedroom, their kitchen supplies (we have our own), and a dining room table.

Recently, we discussed what we were all going to do for housing next year, as the last year has been tense because we feel that our roommates don't contribute much to the house, besides occasionally doing their own dishes and buying toilet paper. Their (usually unannounced) guests have also created some hostility, as they all smoke weed, which causes the house to smell, which gives my boyfriend a migraine because he may be allergic (?) to it; they also tend to take up the kitchen for hours at a time, every single time they have guests over. Mind you, I know my boyfriend and I are not perfect, but we pride ourselves on being respectable tenants. 

We found out that our roommates want to keep the apartment and have their brother and his girlfriend move in at the end of this lease, but we were also planning on staying in the apartment (without them). For some reason, the fact that we also want to keep the apartment sort of pissed of our roommates, which made us think they somehow felt entitled to it. That, in turn, pissed us off because I worked very hard to get this place for all of us, and my boyfriend and I both work hard at maintaining a good relationship with both our landlord and our downstairs neighbors. 

We are concerned by several things with them having the apartment to themselves. Rent is $1200, split four ways makes it $300 each. One of our roommates has complained several times about having ""stress hives"" from money problems, but still only works 4 hour shifts, three or four times a week, at a grocery store. His brother and his brother's girlfriend also had to move in with their dad recently, because they haven't been able to afford rent. This is not to say that my boyfriend and I don't have our own issues, but we are both able to pay $600 a month to live here by ourselves, while our roommates are struggling currently with the $300. Not to mention once WE stop paying utilities/internet, they then have to pick up the full bills for those as well.

This apartment is also beautiful. Not in the granite counter tops and brand new appliances sort of way, but in a welcoming, clean, good neighborhood sort of way. It sounds pretentious, but we don't want to see it ruined by our ""trashy"" roommates and their friends. We also don't want to leave our landlord (who is AMAZING), and our downstairs neighbors to have to deal with it. 

Setting aside completely all of the issues that we have with them, my boyfriend and I just simply don't think they deserve it, as we've put so much work into it. Does anyone have any advice about how to go about this? How can we talk to our roommates? What do we say to our landlord? Any advice you have would be greatly appreciated.

tl;dr Roommates want to live in our apartment with their brother and his girlfriend after this lease ends, but my boyfriend and I want them to move out. I found the apartment, and set up every meeting with the landlord before we moved in, and my boyfriend and I are still the ones to contact him for repairs. Our roommates and their brother/girlfriend have also complained about money problems, which leads us to believe they can't afford the apartment by themselves, while my boyfriend and I can. We just don't think they deserve it, and we don't want our landlord/downstairs neighbors to have to deal with the issues that will arise from them living here by themselves. We also want to live here, but if we can't, we don't think they should either. Advice?",29Aug2019,2
781,"Background:

Moved in with my best friend a few months ago, no problems so far as we've discussed everything that comes up pretty rationally. We both have mental health problems that we help each other with. We've also been out of work - her for 3 months, and me for one. 

I got offered a job today with a view to quick progression to seniority, at an interview on the spot - my first interview since being laid off. Of course she is happy about it but I haven't said much other than I got it as I don't want to rub it in.

Her LDR boyfriend visits for a few days every few weeks and stays over, no problems, they tend to hermit in her room for the weekend and we all get on fine.

Problem: I wanted to get out of my room for a bit today and was going to play on the xbox - they're playing it, no problem. I sit in the armchair and read. Went up for nap (apparently they did the same), and later came back down again to read. I wasn't even planning on socialising, just wanted out of my room. They were playing again but quietly, so while he was in the bathroom I asked what was up. She said I'm only coming downstairs when they are, and could I leave them alone?

Fine, I'm in my room again. 

I might be a little bit soft here. I get that they don't see each other much and want their space, but it's my house too - they usually stay in her room but play on my xbox now since I set it up (again, fine with me). Yet somehow, I feel like I've taken it a little personally - I feel a little bit upset but can't figure it out as I struggle with emotions.

Basically, am I right to feel a little upset?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Moved in with best friend, no problems. Her LDR boyfriend visits every few weeks and they hole up in her room. Now, after setting up my xbox, they're using it (fine) but she doesn't want me in the living room while they play, even though I'm just reading and want out of my room. Am I overreacting to be a little upset and taking it personally?",29Aug2019,1
782,"I’m going to try and keep this short. I am 23 years old and in the middle of nursing school. I’m fairly close with my parents and moved back in with them a year ago so I’d be able to cut back on work hours to go to school full time. However,  I don’t feel it’s working out. They don’t respect my privacy or space and I feel smothered. If I go anywhere I’m expected to tell them where, sometimes I will stay at a friends house and I feel I owe them an answer of where I am, if I don’t tell them ahead of time they always call. 

When I’m at home, they just walk right in my room to see what I’m doing or what my plans are for the day. I don’t know if I’m being a jerk but I feel I’m not obligated to say where I am or what I’m doing 24/7. I also found out that they’ve been asking my older sister if she knows where I am or what I’m doing instead of just coming to me which is really frustrating I don’t think it’s their business. 

Also, I’m not comfortable at their house. I stay awake late most nights studying or watching tv, they go to bed early like 8pm I feel like I have to tip toe around and can’t go in the kitchen or shower because it’s too loud. I mostly am confined to my bedroom. 

I ended up continuing work anyway because I needed an out, I actually work two jobs now so I know financially I could make it. I don’t want to be insensitive to them I really appreciate everything they have done for me but think this is the right time for me to go out on my own.

789,"I need advice on this problem, it's becoming quite serious. I don't have any speech problems, it happens more in a logical sense. When I speak English, everything seems okay, but whenever I try to convey my thought into words in my native language, people do not understand me, I almost always have to explain everything what I mean, kinda like in a way one explains a joke to somebody who did not understand it.   


I can't pinpoint the problem, for example: there's a message about A, the person inserts something out of context just for something (B), then I, still having a concept of the A thought before, add in something new to that without much hint of A but working it out out of the general context of the previous message, automatically assuming the person did not forget the concept of A and B was just a pointless insert, but people seem to forget the concept A and then go ""huh?"", ""what do you mean?"", ""please, explain"" and I feel extremely stupid and dumb at communicating.  


While writing essays at school, my native language teachers would always mark ""logic"" mistakes, meaning I jump from one concept to other, my grammar's impeccable. I know I suck at writing and I'm not the most eloquent but this has gotten onto  the level of speech.

I've taken time off work for relaxation and a little travel (nothing huge) in September. I had to fight hard to get this time off, because September is not usually allowed to take time off, but there was no other time I could. I can't move it, I can only cancel it.

My mother and my sister planned a holiday in September to Italy. Paid for and everything. As far as I knew, it was at the end of the month and they planned to leave their cat and dog with me (we didn't actually discuss this though). Today I found out that they're leaving next Friday, the exact first day I have off and staying for two weeks, so it overlaps. I repeat, they didn't discuss this with me.

If they leave the critters with me, I can't go anywhere so I'm forced into a staycation.

But there is a complication, my grandmother's brother just died and she lives alone (but very close to them). They weren't close, but still, and she is 85 and a widow - I don't like the thought of her staying alone for 2 whole weeks so soon after this. I cannot spend just a few days there, because I have no means of moving the dog.

My options are: 1. I cancel my holiday, take care of the cat and the dog, hope grandma is OK. 2. I go to my hometown for 2 weeks, have both grandma and the cat covered, but lose my vacation entirely because that town is awful/has many bad memories.

803,"They are both warmest, most caring people and are understandably very down at the moment. 

As his only immediate family that lives nearby, I want to show them how much support they have in me, while respecting their privacy so they can grieve in their own time. Has anyone been through something similar? 

The part that worries me, is that my brother has never been very open with his feelings. After our mother died when we were kids, he was very closed off about what he was going through, and it alienated him from a lot of people. His wife is a wonderful person, but I worry that if he shuts down and starts spiraling again, his relationship might suffer which will only make things even worse. As the 26 year old gay younger brother, I know this is outside my realm of expertise, and is probably inappropriate to talk about with him at this time. But I can’t help but be concerned for his well being from here on out. 

How do I show support for him, without being inappropriate or overbearing? Has anyone been through something like this before? Any advice on what I can/should say/do?",29Aug2019,7
804,"So, I (m/19) got asked out by my crush (f/18) to dance with her at our graduation ball. The week after that we had our first date, which went really well and we agreed on attending our second date. In the last two weeks however she doesn't answer to me for days and told me that it's hard for her to find a day/evening where we can meet. 

I haven't told her about my feelings for her.
On the one hand I feel like I have to whereas I am also afraid I could overwhelm her with that.

The thing I am constantly thinking about is why she would ignore me even though she did the first step at first.

In addition to that I have pure o ocd which makes this whole situation so much harder for me, because it is like always in my mind.

806,"I currently live with my dad and spend £120 on rent per month. I work part time(18.5hrs/wk) earning about £850 a month and also go to uni full time and get £500 student loan per month(both situated city centre). I have a decent amount of my student loan saved (hoping to be for a house deposit). The opportunity has came up where I could move in with a workmate that has a flat literally right next to both my work and uni but will cost me £400 a month for rent only, not including WiFi/food etc. I currently live about 40 minutes travel from both my work and uni so travel is over an hour and a half daily which would be cut down significantly if I moved. I would also have to give up my car as there is no parking space at the flat because it’s in the middle of the city centre.

816,"I work for a small cleaning company. Half the staff quit within 3 days of each other, leaving a copious amount of work for a few people. I worked 12 hour days, I worked multiple weekends in a row, I went straight from having a tooth (that was connected to my jawbone) pulled to work for the rest of the day, and then worked both days that weekend through having dry socket, I have given everything I have to my boss (who has been a great boss up until recently). 

School started for my daughter and myself (I am just now starting my first semester back in college after 6 years of working), and I told her I needed to pick my daughter up by 3:30p three days a week, and by 6:00p two days a week, so I could have time to work on school myself as well (which is completely online). 

Today I was in a house cleaning, and she was supposed to be there before I left. She wasn't able to (there was about 10 minutes of no body being in the house), and she was upset I couldn't stay. But I can't just not pickup my daughter, and sending her to after school care for 10 minutes costs the same as 3 hours. After I left, she called me and asked if I really couldn't have stayed the extra time and had my daughter go to after school care. And then she proceeded to ask if I really couldn't stay an extra half an hour or hour on a regular basis to help finish a job, and tell me about how me leaving is going to make her day even longer, just like everyday that I leave early (she was basically guilt tripping me at this point). She went on for a while, but that is the jist of it. She was also upset yesterday when we arrived to a house and I told her I had to leave in 50 minutes (and ended up leaving late), and asked why someone else can't ever pick my daughter up. 

I will also note that my SO drops my daughter off at school everyday, so my start time is completely open and I am willing to and have started as early as 5am at times. 

I've been with the company for 6 months and make 48% commission (base of $13 an hour if that isn't met, but can be as much as $18ish an hour commission if solo), since that is slightly relevant.

So am I crazy for wanting to quit right now??? I have given everything I have to her for months, and made my time constraints very clear long before school started. Is it even appropriate for her to interrogate and guilt me for making a schedule and sticking to it?  

TL;DR: I worked a ton of hours for months, and now that I have life obligations and gave proper notice of my schedule limitations, I am being guilted for sticking to my set limitations.",29Aug2019,5

818,"The entire time I worked at this new job, my department had issues processing my paperwork. While I worked 40+ hours each week, my name was never on payroll, I basically didn’t exist in the system. Two paydays have passed, now coming up on the third one and I won’t receive a check because my department was so behind. Meanwhile, my boyfriend has been kind to help me with my expenses, but is also upset that I’m not earning anything. He knows I’m a sweet person and try to be understanding, but he expects me to be assertive about it. Every day I talked with my manager and supervisor, made phone calls to payroll to figure out what’s going on and yesterday I went to HR in person to finally get things moving. My department was profusely apologetic for not paying me sooner, as the problem with paperwork was unexpected and I wasn’t the only person this was happening to. My supervisor even sprinkled in extra hours on my check to compensate me for waiting so long.

Although now I’m set to receive pay, I can’t receive a check on tomorrow’s payday because time was due last week (we’re on bi-weekly pay) but for my case HR will cut a check for me next week. My boyfriend knows my issue has been resolved but he doesn’t know I won’t get paid and I’m afraid he’ll get angry for it. Not that he needs my money, I feel like he thinks I’m weak for not being more hostile about not getting paid. My department screwing up was unintentional, so I didn’t have to call the Dept of Labor in this situation (if they did this on purpose then of course I would have). Plus my manager is lending me money to take care of my needs so I will have some money, just not my own. What do I say to my boyfriend if he asks if I got paid? Do I say anything at all to him?

821,"To start off, I am a 22 yr old female with a 3 month old daughter.

I am puzzled about what to do.. I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend for approximately 5 years. He is the father to our one and only daughter. He's been staying with my mother and I for about a month since I am back to work. We've always talked about living together but can never actually decide if I should move in with him or if he should move in with me. We live in different states (I live in NJ and he lives in NYC) Anyway, the reason I am seeking advice is because the lease at the apartment I am living in with my mother ends at the end of October and I need to make a decision soon.

To get into detail my mother is a 38 yr old woman that is extremely selfish, money hungry and extremely inconsiderate. I've been working since I was 15 because I know I can never depend on her. Truth is I feel as if she resents me a lot due to the domestic violence relationship she once had with my father. She constantly disrespects me and hurts my feelings about any decision I make, how I do things or how I choose to raise my daughter. She's messed up my once good credit by taking out a leased car under my name and claiming I would be the co signer but the car is actually under my name. She pays the car and insurance late every month and I am constantly always getting attacked by the dealer since they think it's MY car. Anyway, I also have a younger brother which might as well be my son. I'm always the one taking care of him and making sure he is good and now since my boyfriend is staying with us, he's become his responsibility also. My mom is always out at bars, smoking weed or meeting different guys since she is now single. To be completely honest, she acts my age and I act hers. It's almost like I'm her mother. Don't get me wrong she works extremely hard and has a good paying job but because of her horrible decisions on how she chooses to manage money, it's put us on eviction notices several times. I also pay rent in my apartment but according to her ""my mediocre"" money isn't enough. She acts like my daughter and I are always in the way or as if we bother her. MANY people have told me MANY times, including my own family, that I just need to let her sink the way she's let me sink several times. She claims that my problems are none of her business. 

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend's mother has taken me in at any time of the day and anytime. She has an idea of how messed up my relationship is with my mom but truth be told I don't tell her everything cause overall I don't want her to hate her. For example, when I was pregnant with my daughter, my mom and I got into an argument that resulted in her putting her hands on me. I never said anything to my boyfriend's mother but appeared at their doorstep at 2:30am saying my mom and I just argued (my bf knew the truth though) the more I type the more I realize what decision is actually the right one.

&amp;#x200B;

If I move to the bronx, I have to deal with my boyfriend's uncle and cousin which are disgusting to live with. They never clean, take out the garbage and don't contribute to buying anything for the apartment. as far as pantries and food but always use and eat everyone else's things but they do pay rent but NEVER on time, I lose my good paying job (I just got promoted) but I can also get a good paying job in the city, I have to rely on public transportation instead of driving the expensive car I pay for with my own money obviously but it will all only be temporary because we do plan on moving back to NJ and I gain my peace back and I wouldn't really have to leave my daughter at a day care. I'll also have less expenses and don't have to deal with someone constantly putting me down.

&amp;#x200B;

If I stay in NJ and live with my mother, I have to deal with always taking care of my little brother that doesn't even listen to me while my mom goes out and parties while taking care of my daughter, I have to deal with her irresponsible choices, her constantly putting me down and acting as if my daughter and I are in the way (I PAY RENT) BUT I continue to live in the environment I'm used to as far as not living in the city and can keep my job.",29Aug2019,1

However since I started year 12. With mocks and AS levels I just completely had no motivation to work. I wanted to do well but for some reason just didn’t work and I can’t explain it. I tried all the classic tips like making a schedule and breathing and taking breaks. I ended up getting UDDC. I’m hoping to go to a Russel group uni for physics which will need all A’s 

Some other info that idk If is related. I do regular fitness stuff. Work a few hours a week and am doing gold DofE. I have a lot of pressure from my parents and my sister who are all super successful. Also I had a sheltered upbringing so not that social will probs go out once every month but see friends at sport clubs. I got 128 in CATS which means I’m intelligent kinda I think 

Summary( idk the Reddit acronym thing)
17M Going into final year. Can’t find motivation and don’t know why. Really want to do well and go to uni just can’t work. Failed AS pretty much but did well in GCSE. 

I hope someone here has some shared experience and has something that helps. I’m honestly terrified of what will happen if I fail these exams. I try to hold myself to standards I can’t really meet.

836,"In April of 2019, I learned my mother was getting kicked out of our home. Since I was a senior in high school and planning on going to college, I didn't worry that much since our grandma had agreed to help us for a while. So, I apply to a college, get accepted, applied to housing and got everything I needed but then I got a bombshell, I didn't get into their housing department. So, I decided to ditch college for this year and wait until 2020 to go to college. Now, I glossed over a bit of complexity, but to make another long story short my grandma was getting frustrated that we weren't out of her house by July, since my sister was still in high school and my mom couldn't do much right now, I was targeted for ""not doing anything with my life"" and ""dropping out of college"" so I decided to move to my dads house.

Some backstory with my dad, my dad was an alcoholic and went back home, when he got an opportunity for a good job, to a small town in West Virginia. But then he got into an accident where alcohol and some medicines combined caused him to be hospitalized. Since he was drinking so much he was quite poor and could barely afford food so his sodium levels were very low. The doctors then, reasonably, pumped some sodium into his body. Once again, to make a long story short, when you pump sodium too fast into somebody they develop a syndrome called ""Osmotic Demyelination Syndrome""  (ODS). In most ODS cases the patient is put into a nursing home for the rest of their lives, my dad got very lucky and recovered from a catatonic state almost instantly. But since he was in the hospital from January (2019) to March (2019), he lost everything except for some small stuff his cousin had managed to grab before it was donated or destroyed, he even lost his home.

When he got out, he stayed with his cousin until the beginning of August (2019).

In July, when so much shit was happening to me I decided to talk to my dad and asked him about so many things from alcohol to cigarettes to gov't benefits. He told me so much and he was stable, it sounded like going into the hospital ended up working in his favor. Although, after hours of conversation it sounded like he was doing great and I would be happy up there with him until I went to college or found something. So, my stupid ass bought a plane ticket for me and my bird (I can't leave without him) and moved in with him.

I found out on day fucking 2 that he lied to me about so much. Yes, it's true he stopped drinking, he didn't stop smoking (if anything, he smokes more). He barely gets any money from the gov't. I live off of ramen noodles because its the cheapest thing we can afford, my bird is barely getting much to eat, he lives off of the cheapest birdseed and apples from local apple trees. The doctors told him he was a very healthy dude for his situation and could ""resume normal life."" if the fucking doctors would take 3 seconds to look at him, he's got bipolar disorder, hes got memory problems and he barely remembers my siblings names, he never talks about them and only talks about how ""everyone in the world won't help him because he was in the hospital."" Now, it's true that the gov't really fucking screwed him over by punishing him by getting a job (Won't give him enough food stamps, and lowered the amount of money he gets for rent, won't allow him to get disability benefits). He lied to me about so much that I barely even know him anymore, he doesn't know me anymore and he lied to me to get me up here so he can see me for the first time in a year. 

Now for a bit of good, his cousin, we'll call him Phil. Phil did so much with his life until his heart decided to stop working and is living off his savings and disability (his heart works at 15%). Phil can get me a job at any one of these places: FBI Fingerprint analysis, Corrections Officer, anything post office, 911 Operator, SCUBA Diver, Police and probably some more I forgot at the time of writing this. Fortunately, for all except the last 2 pay at LEAST $18/h (in West Virginia) and to WV standards, that's exceptionally high. 

My question is: What do I do?

If I go home, I may lose this huge opportunity, it's also possible I can still get it where I used to live

If I stay, I'm pretty much guaranteed to get the job but ill be stuck with my dickhead dad

Alternatively, I could say fuck it and get the job and just move my ass out (I have no idea how to adult, and I have to grow the fuck up fast)

One last thing, my dad treats me like I'm 14, he only barely let me get a bank account, he won't let me get a job, he won't let me get a car and he keeps holding me back.

If there is anything else you suggest please leave it here, im in dire need of some help.

It’s not anything weird like them being underage. They are 19 and I am 21. I can’t imagine my life without him but I’m terrified of what people may say or think. I know I’m not doing anything wrong, but it feels wrong? Idk how to explain it. I really want to be with him, like as in a relationship with him. I’m not sure what to do.

839,"I have three dogs. Dog 1 is oldest, about 9 years. Dog 2 is 7 years old. they’ve been together basically their whole lives. in febuary we got Dog 3, a puppy. 

Dog2 and Dog3 are best of friends now, and never have issues. 
Over the past couple weeks, Dog 
2 starts walking up to Dog1, sniffs her, growls a bit, and then starts fighting. this usually happens when they get excited like when someone comes home. 
Dog1 never fights back though, they just make loud noises and Dog 2 does put her mouth on Dog1 and leaves spit. 

we brought her to the vet, who had nothing to tell us. when we got home, Dog 2 immediately went after dog1. we separate them for a while and when we tried to let everyone mingle again, dog2 completely went after dog1 and she fought back. 

we have no idea what could be causing this or what to do. 
Dog 3 usually just watches and runs along or tries to get involved but she is always ignored by the other dogs. 

it’s just not possible to keep them constantly separated, they eat at specific times from separate bowls, and all sleep together every night. they never fight when we aren’t around. 

if she were to be jealous of anyone, i think it’d be the puppy?",29Aug2019,1

So I’ll be vague on my jobs for privacy. I got offered and accepted a full time job with benefits working with domestic animals. Exactly what I’ve been looking for! Starting it next week. Although not what I got my degree in it’s still animals. 

My problem is that I just had an amazing interview for a job that might be more in line with my degree and passions that’s also better paying (wildlife and domestic as well as working with the public). There’s a good chance I might get this job. I’m having the jitters because I don’t know if I’d like this job even though I think it sounds great. 

If they offer me the wildlife jobs I think I want to say yes. But how do I back out of the job I already accepted?

Has anyone else been in this kind of situation? Job limbo stuff? I feel out of my league and so confused. 

Should I just do the job I know is safe or go for it with the higher paying wildlife job.

I feel like if I don’t invite them to hang out we start drifting and I really don’t want that but recently I’ve come to a breaking point with it. Something happened earlier today that made me snap.

Later when we got home I sent a design to them and they said it was cool and asked if I had made a website (no I’m not doing all the work or I’d do it myself) nothing else happens until today when one of those friends was asking about manufacturers to start a clothing business. I asked if he was really into it we could go 50/50 and I’d handle our social media, advertising, and the customer side of things.

851,"When I was 17 I had the biggest crush on this guy (let's call him Drew). Drew went to a school in the next city over but we met on a school trip and we really bonded and had a lot in common and eventually, started texting every day. The thing was not many people from my school really knew him so when I asked my friends, including my best friend (this is important) if they thought he liked me just by looking at the texts they would shrug and say ""I dunno, maybe that's just how he is or maybe he's gay"". Looking back on those texts and our conversations it was VERY obvious he liked me (he called me beautiful a few times), but I didn't want to pursue him if that was just his personality. I am one of those people you need to tell straight up your feelings or I assume otherwise... One night he saw me in a show and I swear he was going to ask me out but he changed the subject to something very small. It was something like ""I was wondering...... what grade are you in?"". I tried to be as obvious as I could to him that I was interested, even agreed we would be each other's dates for prom if no one wanted us the following year, but he never made a move. I decided to let fate be the test. 

We were both auditioning for a show in between of our cities and since I would be seeing him more than once a week if we got in together, he would be worth going after. If not, a distant relationship was not worth repeating a second time (that's a long story, not important). I didn't get in so I gave up and fell in love with my best friend and now we're engaged (told you it was important).

I only saw Drew a few times after that but we still talked at least once a month (and dressed up as Gaston for my birthday because my fiancé and I were dressed as Belle and Beast), and eventually once a year. 

I invited everyone on my friends list on Facebook to my stag and doe which included him. He showed up by himself no family or friends (I no longer had any mutual friends with him or none of them showed up) and no RSVP. I was the only one who knew him there so I talked to him throughout the night and caught up with him a little bit (as much as we could with the DJ playing loud music). At one point I asked him if he was seeing anyone since he mentioned his brothers were engaged as well. He said he was not and hadn't dated anyone in a while. Then Drew told me this:

""You know, if we got into that show together, I would have asked you out"". After debating for a few minutes I decided to tell him I liked him as well at the time. We laughed a little and then he said, ""Thank God! I didn't know if you were going to be mad!"" and I wasn't... I was really happy that my feelings were returned the seventeen year old girl in me was dancing for joy... and I feel guilty for it.

All I keep thinking is ""What if?"" which I can deal with never knowing I am very much in love with my fiancé though I would be lying if I didn't admit Drew was in the back of my mind when I decided to start dating him. I know I have my reasons for not taking the first step though at the time.

But the main thing is I told him we would hang out after the wedding when I was a lot less busy. I'm going to be in his city tomorrow doing some shopping for the wedding by myself and I want to see him to talk and catch up without the DJ there, but every situation I come up with doesn't end well. I keep coming up with excuses to message him and never do. The thing is, the more I think about that night the more things come up that signify he still has feelings for me somewhere.

But now this feeling has me feeling creatively stimulated and inspired (I'm a song writer and playwright) and I can't make it go away, but I want it to keep going by seeing him and working with him since he's in the same field as me, but I don't want to sabotage our friendship and my future marriage because of it. 

It's just a meeting to catch up but I'm scared it would be more than that to him and my fiancé. I do not want to be with him over my fiancé, I know I made the right choice for my husband, but I know old feelings for people you felt deeply for never go away completely.

Should I ask if he's free to meet tomorrow or not?",29Aug2019,1

857,"Our school instituted a new process for restricting content online. I got called into the office earlier today and was told my device was flagged 14 minutes before school started. The thing is I didn’t access those sites. The Vice Principal was very cool about it, he assumed that I’d left it up by accident and my phone auto connected to the school WiFi thus leading to the two flaggings. So he’s not exactly saying I’m guilty but at the moment of stress and panic I didn’t defend myself rigorously. I know now with near certainty that his hypothesis is wrong, I haven’t even accessed either of those sites in the past 24 hours. That said I can’t come up with any other explanations and I feel very much in a “compromising position” that never even occurred. It’s been eating at me all day.

861,"There is a job opening on my team that would be a promotion for me. I've been working my ass off the past few months to prove myself and have been getting really positive feedback from my boss and senior teammates. My boss is aware that I want this position and has been providing support/encouragement(e.g. letting me know the position was posted and to apply) however, the job posting coincided with my scheduled vacation which put me in a crunch. I saved the job posting to apply to when I got back from vacation and the day before I returned, I quickly updated my resume and applied for the position.

  Fast forward to today: my boss was checking in to make sure I applied because she didn't see my name on the list of applicants. It turns out the posting I applied to was a totally different position and the actual posting for the position I want was taken down. My boss said she'd see if she could have the posting put up again briefly so that I can apply, but that her boss will see that it was posted again and that my mistake does not reflect well as it demonstrates a lack of attention to detail.

I mean, there are factors that contributed to this fuck up(being away on vacation, not being familiar with the application website and application system), but ultimately, it was my fuck up. My boss was not pleased, which I can understand. It doesn't exactly reflect well on her when her staff fucks up something simple like this and she has to go back to her boss to see if she can make an exception. At the same time, I'm a perfect candidate for this position as I've already been taking on the tasks that are required for this position and have been excelling. 

What I want an opinion on is how much of a fuck up this was.

865,So some 'travellers' have decided to set up camp about 1 minute up the road and I'm abit worried as my house is fairly set back but is one of the nicer houses in the area. I'm a bit worried as we have recently gotten two llamas and I we also have a few goats I also have my dirt bike locked up in a shed along with £1000's of pounds worth of tools. We are worried about these being stolen. But should I be worried about this? And to make matters worse my parents are out for the weekend (I'm 16) I was told by my dad that if they try anything to shoot them with his air rifle personally I find this to be a bad idea as I'd probably get my house burnt down so what should I do if they do decide to steal our live stock or personal belongings. But more importantly should I even be worried?,29Aug2019,1
866,"I apologize in advance as this is going to be a very long and all over the place kind of post but any help would very greatly be appreciated. 

So I’m a 19 year old male and I’ve been dating my girlfriend for 2 years now. It’s a very serious relationship and we love each other very very much. We live in a small town and my girlfriend has been wanting to move away to a city to go to school since before we even started dating but she has stayed in this town (that she really doesn’t like) just for me because she knows I haven’t been ready to move. And the biggest reason I haven’t been ready to move is because of my mother. 

Basically my mom divorced my dad when I was about two years old. It was a really nasty divorce that lead to an eight year battle in court for custody of my siblings and I. My mom eventually won sole custody and guardianship and since then my siblings and I haven’t seen our dad very much (and he lives in a city on the other side of the province). So naturally, my mom is very attached and protective of my siblings and I, to a point where I feel it’s not healthy (and since I’m the youngest I’ve gotten the worst of it). We were never allowed to do anything that she deemed was unsafe, which were things that, at times, were totally fine. And if we ever mentioned moving away or “leaving her” as she put it she would get super sad and mopey and try to guilt trip us into staying in our home town forever. There would also be hell to pay if I spent more than two nights at my girlfriends place without phoning every so often to tell her I’m safe or to check up, or if I house sat for some people longer than four days. As a guy entering his young adult life this is really suffocating and it has had terrible effects on my relationship as my mom has accused my gf and her parents of stealing me away and manipulating me to leave home. So naturally my gf really does not like my mom and my mom doesn’t like my gf. 

I recently got into a really bad argument with my parents about these issues which lead to me being kicked out. My gfs parents set me up with a small travel trailer to live in. I went back in the next few days to get my things and my mom was screaming at crying at me, partly asking me to not leave and partly getting angry at me for how I acted. I figured that that would be the best time to leave as I wouldn’t want to go through with this again (my brother recently moved out and the same thing happened to him). Ever since I’ve been really distant from my parents, partly because my mom called my gf a lot of bad names (fucking cunt, bitch, etc and I was called things like “pussy whipped”) and partly because I’ve been wanting to be a little independent as I’ve just been “the baby” my whole life. But my whole family and my siblings included (who have had to go through the same things as me) constantly guilt trip me for not talking to my parents very much and it makes me feel horrible. 

So to bring it full circle my dad recently came to town and my gf met him for the first time and he said he found a really good deal on a place in the city he lives in and my gf and I are gonna take it. And we’re moving in a month and a bit from now and I haven’t told my parents yet out of straight fear of what my mom will do. 

So basically I need advice on how and when I should tell my mom because she is the most destructive person when she gets angry and hurt. And moving to where my dad lives is like the worst thing I could do to her so I’m utterly terrified of what’s gonna happen. And my brothers, who know more than anyone how bad my mom can be, are showing absolutely no support for me or offer to help at all which makes me feel super alone which is why I’m coming here for help. If you read this far I really appreciate it thanks a lot and if you have any advice for me I would really really like to hear it as I have no idea whatsoever of what to do. Thanks again.",29Aug2019,1

869,"TLDR: flatmate broke his back so needs his dad to drop him off and pick him up. In between that time he sleeps in our shared flat in my mates bedroom.

This year, I've (21M) decided to take a break from doing medicine to do an intercalation. I moved in with a friend from my course who isn't doing an intercalation. We agreed to move in together if I wasn't an inconsiderate house mate who made loads of noise, plus I have loads of toxic family shit I wanted to avoid this year.

The problem started before we moved in where my flatmate broke his back in an accident abroad. Thankfully it's not too serious and the extent of it right now is having to use a back brace but he should recover perfectly.

Because of it though, he can't drive into placement so his dad drops him off every morning and then comes to apartment and later picks him up. He just sleeps in my mates room and occasionally talks to me if I'm up.

Yesterday was weird cos whilst I had 2 people round, my flatmate and his dad were meant to come around 6 but ended up coming at 8. I smoked up with one of my mates outside about an hour before they came but they could still smell it in the apartment and my flatmate said his dad mentioned it to him but said he didn't care, just that he didn't think I was the type of person.

One of my female friends decided to stay the night, (completely platonic friendship) and he saw her in the morning. When I was making a cup of tea he asked me if that was my girlfriend, which I felt super uncomfortable about.

I'm not sure what steps to take from here realistically, cos my mate needs a lift and I can't really say tell your dad not to come round as they drive like an hour and a half every morning to come here. Plus he pretty much keeps to himself.

Big thing for me though is the privacy issue and the fact that I moved out to be away from family and parents and now ones pretty much in my apartment midday every weekday. I might just talk to the dad and say that made me felt uncomfortable and try explain the situation but I'm not sure from there.",29Aug2019,1

I've done sooo many job orientation tests, went to so many university info days. And just nothing interests me enough to have the motivation to make it work. And I know if I don't care for something I won't make a lot out of it.

879,"Hi all, in need of some advice. 

I am currently attending college, just started the new semester of my 2nd year. In the middle of my first semester there, I met my current friend group through a mutually shared interest in theater. I was working backstage for a show that a lot of them acted in. Now I’m pretty close with this group of about 20 people, and I would consider them my primary friend group.

While I see them a lot because of school, there’s no one person in particular I am very close to. I get along fine with everybody, but my best friends are people who aren’t a part of this social circle. That being said, I struggle a lot with feeling like this group does not care about. 

It’s never things that are explicitly done or said to me, but little actions that add up. I wish I could think of a specific example, but it’s more that I’m often talked over or they just don’t listen when I try to talk. For example, if we’re hanging out I constantly feel like I have to explicitly interject myself into one conversation or nobody will talk to me. I guess that’s normal, but like I said: it’s less of the way they act toward me and more of the general feeling I get. 

They’re never excited to see me, like they get with other members of the group. I always feel like nothing would be different if I weren’t at whatever party or event we go to. I often times feel like I have to clarify everything I say around them, or they will misinterpret me. It’s like they don’t understand me at all, even after knowing me for a decent amount of time. 

I’ve considered bringing up my feelings to them, but I wouldn’t even know where to start. Knowing them, they would probably say I was “causing drama” if I brought up how I felt, or another negative response. We’re not really the kind of group who share deep feelings with one another particularly often, at least personal things like this (but we will talk about things like relationships or more surface problems). 

All this comes down to my major question, is this a normal feeling? My social circles have previously been small but close groups of 3/4 friends, or just individual friends who I’m very close with, none of which know each other. I’m not used to having such a large social circle of people who all know each other. Am I just being dramatic in trying to feel a high level of intimacy and care with a large group like this? Any advice is very appreciated!",29Aug2019,1
881,"Hello. So I recently moved to a new state and I know nobody except for my boyfriend. I went on the Bumble BFF app to find girls in the area to connect with. The first girl I met up with was last night. We were to dinner and had drinks. She was really awkward and quiet at first but I'm generally a pretty outgoing person so I kept the conversation going. She was nice but I felt like something was off and I couldn't figure it out. My boyfriends out of town and I don't know anyone so I figured if we had a couple drinks she would open up more! Well she did. And it wasn't good. 

A little preface is that on the bumble app it said she was only a mile away which was awesome because everyone I've talked to so far is 30+ miles away and it be quite the commitment to hang out with them. So I was excited. She told me which apartment building she lived in so feeling obligated (stupidly) I told her mine. Granted there is over 200 units at my place so there's no way she could know which ones mine. Except...I have out of state plates. So it's obvious. 

So when she stared to get a little more drunk she started telling me about her boyfriend. I guess he has terets (which is whatever) and bi polar. She told me he drove through my apartment complex. Which just adds to the weird factor. 

Next once we start drinking she told me she had to reschedule later in the day because her boyfriend had to go buy some drugs (Didn't specify...) Now I'm starting to get a little uneasy. She starts talking more about herself. She lets me know that she has multiple personality disorder and bipolar. And that she ""isn't suppose to drink on her meds but whatever"".  We are about 3 drinks deep at this point. And I can tell she is visibly intoxicated. She is getting really hyper and saying how she wants to go out and dance all night and party until the sun comes up. 

So I was feeling really uneasy. As someone who has had multiple family members suffer from extreme mental conditions I know they can be scary. I'm a little freaked out at this point. I told her that I was too drunk and didn't want to stay out any longer because I didn't want to be there. 

She's now texting me every five minutes and asking when we are gonna hang out again. Please tell me how I can politely let her know I do not wish to see her again. I hope and want the best for her but I do not want to be entangled in her mess and need to get out now. But I'm also a little scared because she knows where I live and I don't know how stable she is. 


TLDR : I met a girl and she is mentally unstable. She wants to be best friends. How do I let her down gently?",29Aug2019,1

883,"I am a 21 year old woman and the ex in question is a 24 year old man. We were together for 3 years.

My ex recently contacted me in an attempt to solicit me for sex knowing full well that I was still in a very unstable state and missing him after our quite recent break-up. He dumped me, claiming he no longer had any feelings for me, and went to pursue other people.

At the time I was in an extremely emotional mindset and I agreed to it in the hopes that seeing me in person again would somehow re-ignite his affection for me. It was stupid and naive, but the bottom line is I really didn't want sex... And I made it clear to him what my hopes really were, in spite of responding positively to his sexual advances over text chat. He did get cold feet and considered cancelling it towards the point of the meet, but ultimately decided he wanted to meet me.

When I arrived at his apartment I was told to wait on his bed for around 40 minutes since he supposedly had games to play on his computer with friends.

Once he came down he sat on the bed with me and started being flirty. I responded fairly dismissively as I was far from ready for anything like that. It's true that I by no means sternly told him off and was quite passive. ""Maybe"" and ""I don't know"" was said a few times. I told him I didn't want to do anything until after the food we ordered had arrived; that there wasn't time and I wasn't comfortable yet.

In spite of this he started kissing me, but was interrupted by the buzzer shortly after. He went to collect our delivery and I followed after him. 

I reached over to collect a box but as I was doing this he gently grabbed me by the arm and pulled me back into the bedroom.

He resumed kissing me and after a while of this I stopped him to say, ""Shouldn't you be asking me whether I'm okay with this?"" He did, and I tentatively said okay, but in truth I was already very uncomfortable about the situation and would've felt awkward saying no.

Everything kind of escalated from there and there probably isn't too much point going into detail. I think I eventually enjoyed it, but I'm not sure that matters.

After the fact it feels like he took advantage of my emotional state for some easy sex, knowing full well I still loved him and that I'd fall right in his lap, and he was then unnecessarily pushy. I feel gross and used, and deeply regret ever going there. It feels like a huge mistake.

I don't really know what to do about it all. I'm not sure if it was sexual assault because I was never particularly explicit about my feelings... I'm fully open to the idea that I may just be blowing everything out of proportion.

 Any advice would be appreciated.

**TL;DR:** Stupidly agreed to an ex's requests for sex, never explicitly gave consent in person before he made moves, came out feeling very uncomfortable and used.",29Aug2019,2

887,"Hey all, throwaway for what will be obvious reasons shortly.

So I've been at my current job since April. Our company is reliable, management is pretty nice, and I enjoy working with most of my coworkers.

However, I'm feeling pretty damn neglected as far as treatment of the employees goes.

Very early in the business's opening we were all told that we would be getting a 30 day, 60 day, and 90 day review from management, as well as one at 6 months and another at a year.

Most of the staff got their reviews relatively close to on-time, but mine waited longer than almost anyone's. For reference, I'm night shift so I honestly think they forget about me a lot of times. But that in itself should say how much they don't think about me, because I'm literally available every single day during business hours and they still didn't arrange a meeting until last week. The rest of the staff also got raises AT their reviews, and MOST of them go those raises back dated to their 30 day mark. 

Anyway, I get my 30 day review after about 140 days on the job (!!!), and they haven't discussed yet whether I'll get a raise or not. Okay, I can be patient, especially because I bugged the hell out of them until they gave me a review, so whatever. But after a week of them still not telling me whether I was getting a raise or not, I lose patience. So the other day I finally tell my manager I need an update.

He says they'll give me 50 cents and back date it to my 90 days.

I'm okay with a 50 cent raise. I'm the highest paid hourly worker there, I didn't expect a whole dollar until I hit my year mark.

But 90 days!? When I've been on their asses to do this since the 30 day mark!?!

It genuinely just makes me feel like they don't give a shit about me working there. Because it isn't about the amount at this point. They could've denied me a raise and I wouldn't have cared if they just would have TOLD me in a timely manner. In feel like I'm getting beaten and dragged around the bush and I feel completely disrespected as a team member, specifically as the team member with the most experience.

Anyway, I'm scheduled to take maternity leave in January, and so I'm wondering if I should just quit and find a new job? Or should I wait until my maternity leave and just not go back?

Or am I overreacting? Am I being dramatic because I didn't get what the others got?

TL;DR - I didn't get the raise I wanted and they're shorting my back pay two months even though I'm the most experienced team member. Should I quit or am I being silly?",29Aug2019,1

902,"Hello. There are a lot of disjointed details to this situation so forgive me if it's a little hard to follow or all over the place. I'll try to be as concise as possible. 

Basically, I graduated college in the east coast this past May. I majored in media and had a great time in school. Made lots of friends, many of which are either still in school, or living in the city for the next year(s). 

Three other friends and myself all had the idea to Los Angeles in pursuit of media jobs and generally entertainment gigs/jobs/stage time etc. Mostly in comedy. 

This has been the plan for pretty much the whole summer, as I've been working a retail job to save up. Yet, in the past two weeks or so, I've been having constant either anxiety or panic attacks (self-diagnosed, so forgive me if I'm misusing this term). 

I'm doubting why I really want to go out there to begin with. I'm not sure why I need to be there, at least right now. I don't necessarily want to be anything that is only out there, and I DEFINITELY do not want to become famous or try to pursue any type of role that could lead to fame. (I realize how pretentious this sounds, but why would anyone go to LA to do, say Stand Up, if they didn't want to become famous for it?) 

I also started a casual thing with one of my closest friends who I've had a huge crush on for years. It's still casual but has gotten ever so slightly a bit more serious in the past two months. (Emphasis on slightly). 

I'm not sure if I'll regret going out there right now, or regret staying. Or if it's smarter to wait a few months or a year in my home city and try to find a job to save up money for a move, and to take time to figure out if I really want to.

The people I was planning on moving out with are going out soon, and even though I was trying to convince myself I want to go, and if I did go I'd want to live with them, I feel this sense of dread and hopelessness.  

Is it that big of a deal to stay here one more year? Or vice versa, is it that big of a deal to try to live in LA for just one year to see if I enjoy it? 

I'm completely lost. Any direction or insight would be helpful.",29Aug2019,1
903,"Trigger warning: sexual abuse and death. I dont want to upset anyone so if you can't handle that then please turn back.

My daughter is officially two weeks old today. My grandma has been fighting off pneumonia in the hospital for a little longer than that. Earlier this morning I got the call from my uncle that she is being moved to hospice and they're not sure how much longer she has.

I feel so devastated. This woman raised me. My own birth giver was an abusive person who allowed me to be molested at a young age. My grandma fought for custody of me and won and raised me as her own. This woman IS my mother in all sense of the word. I stupidly followed my daughter's father to a different state and haven't seen my grandma since before I got pregnant. She was so excited to be a great grandma and now my daughter won't even get the chance to meet her unless it's by a miracle

My own birth giver, her daughter, won't visit her. (This is also the woman who called my daughter a ""mistake"" and an ""overdue abortion""). My uncle (her only son and I guess the only person who can make those decisions) is guilt tripping me and telling me I need to come now because my grandma is wanting me there.

I don't even have enough spare change for the bus to get to my two week post partum appointment. My daughter's father is becoming more possessive over the car and his money and his drinking has increased to the point of being almost abusive(please dont tell me I need to leave him.

911,"dis bihh gon be longggg as shit. for starters , this been my best friend for over four years. we’ve been through so many things and everytime we drifted apart, we came back. seriously love her more than anything. a couple of weeks ago(barely over a week), i transferred to my besties high school (for sports and grades and...her 😎) so the basketball coach gave me a tour and i got a girl from the teams number. i didnt text her at first, but last tuesday we started talking and hit it off and have been talking everyday since then. at the open house on thursday, she told me she was bi and dudes hadnt been working for her. i brushed it off cuz i literally just met her for the second time, but since then we’ve been talking about relationships and eachother and roadblocks in our personal life. the day before yesterday, some stancc girl calls me cute and asks for my number. she was being weird as shit so i assumed i’d just ignore the texts and whatever. nope. she comes up like”cAn i gEt a hUg” right infront of the girl i talk to(calling her bailey from now on). bailey thought it was funny and i was just like...no. anyway, bailey asked me why i didnt want her and i was like “cuz i want you dumbass” then she said “good i just wanted to hear u say it”. i thought back through everything and realized she basically pushes stuff like that outta me, but never says things like that back. ive come to the conclusion she just wants me to chase her. so on tuesday or monday, idek, we had a conversation about her family. she was like “ i cant come out they’re homophobic” like most peoples parents are homophobic. idk how serious they are about it, but i have the feeling she was over exaggerating a bit. her sisters a stud so like???? ok whatever not my family. BUT the bitch said sum like”i couldnt date a girl and make her hide like that, not fair” so i went to bed mad as shit cuz obvvvviously shes talking about me and she JUST finished talking about relationship stuff. shes just all over the place and its driving me crazy. i forgot what i was gonna say next.  OH YEA so last night or the night before i was texting my bestie about when i used to like her and when she used to like me. i dug up the screenshots and sent it saying sum like”really wanted to eat u back then, but ur always playing games” . thing is , sent it to bailey....right after she finished ranting on about getting played. i saved myself and told her my bestie was straight and it was old, but we were talking about our relationship now. anyways fast forward to today, my bestie flirts otp but when i see her she acts normal, so i assumed she was joking, but our mutual friend just told me i should get w her and i cant take her serious. i want to, but shes hard to trust. i dont wanna ruin our friendship either bc thats the most important over everything. and with bailey, i dont consider it to be “playing” her cuz shes not being honest or open with me, but it would definitely be mean to walk around dating the girl i told her not to worry about. plus i gotta play ball with her for two more years. and she loooves talking to people(she calls herself “popular”.. cringe) like everyone knows her business so i dont wanna become another story around school. im so lost. i know i probably sound like a dickhead but im not. literally two days ago i found out two people liked me and nobody’s ever liked me and im just. cringing. i got way too much on my plate. i can re explain stuff and answer questions i wrote this inna hurry and ik its ghetto but pleasssee. i just really need help. soon. so help me reddit :/",29Aug2019,1
912,"For some background, I am 21 and me and my girlfriend were going out for 7 months at the time of the break up. I really loved her with all my heart and soul and I know that she loved me back but behind all of this love we shared for each other was a lot of conflict that we dealt with. She had a ton of jealousy and insecurity issues which put a huge strain on me and my ability to enjoy the relationship. I loved her because at heart, I know she is an amazing woman and she has so much going for her and Ive never had anyone prior to her care for me as much as she did. She really truly was always thinking about me. But that was a double edged sword... she gave herself entirely to me and made me the center of her universe and she expected the same back from me, which I couldn’t do.

It got to a point where I felt so pressured and like I couldn’t live up to her expectations, that I literally had issues in bed with her. Mind you she is absolutely stunning but I was so hurt that I just didn’t have it in me to keep it up. After this I told her I needed time to myself to feel better. A week or so into this break she invited me to her place and she broke up with me stating that she needs to work on herself and that she needed to leave the relationship for her own sake.

I was devastated but part of me also understood that we both needed that.

Now I’ve been by myself, single, trying to make meaning out of my life but I feel trapped, and I slip back into moments of anxiety and depression. I feel like without a relationship I have no purpose, no reason for being happy. I try and be thankful and to give my life meaning by studying hard, working out, journaling, and speaking to some friends, but I always feel like I need a girl to feel complete. I know that this is desperation but I really want to work on it.",29Aug2019,1
913,"Tomorrow, I’m going to come in to my internship and tell my supervisor that I’m quitting. It’s a small digital agency and I’ve been interning there for about 2 weeks. I’m very anxious about it and afraid that they will be mad at me for quitting so early.

I’m leaving because I just accepted a new internship that is more hands-on. I’m basically only the “glorified janitor” in the office, and while I can watch the artists design and edit stuff, I can’t really work on anything. Aside from being able to learn more &amp; gain more experience in the other internship, I also accepted the new offer since I need to earn more money due to a recent family financial problem. The old internship is unpaid while the new one is paid.

What should I tell my supervisor about why I’m quitting so early? It’s a really small agency, with only 4 people working in it including the front desk. Everyone has been really nice to me, one of the graphic designers even spent a couple of hours to teach me how to use After Effects. I feel really bad for quitting. I’m planning to say that due to financial problems, I have to find a job/ paid internship. 

How to politely and respectfully tell the supervisor that I’m quitting? Should I tell her via email instead since this is very intimidating for me? Am I just overthinking it? I also have social anxiety so this is very overwhelming for me",29Aug2019,1
914,I got home from work today expecting a package to come in of wire organizing looms and some stickers. But I also got this mystery big 11 pound box package as well. It's in my name (first name only) and my address (perfect no errors) I opened it up curious of what it was about and it has a whole bunch of stuff in it that I have never looked up and especially never ordered. I'm not sure what do with this. Do I call Amazon to see what's up or do I ..... Keep it? There is another name and address on the back of the package but on the main shipping label it's addressed to me. How do I proceed from here?,29Aug2019,1
915,"Made a new friend online and finally met up with them. Sat down and talked. I’m 20F and he’s 24M. I noticed he kept looking at my chest every now and then but the thing is I’m pretty flat so there’s literally nothing to look at lol. So what does that mean???

I didn’t know where to ask this sorry if I’m on the wrong sub",29Aug2019,0
