0,So I recently got friendzoned and now I want to ask another girl to homecoming. I’ve never talked to her but we have marching and jazz bands together. I want to ask her to homecoming but not come off as weird as I’ve never talked to her. Sometimes I feel like I see her looking at me but I’m not hopeful. How do I approach her without being weird??,06Sep2019,1
1,"I have a really close friend (F) and i have feelings for her. we have talked about it in the past (ive even said that ive liked her before) and made jokes about it but always end up ignoring it. We cuddle alot and sometimes lie in bed cuddling all night. She does things that some people would say is a (hint,sign,etc.) but i dont know what to do about it",06Sep2019,1
2,"It's not really just the fact the I got rejected, but more so the aftermath that I'm worried about. I asked a close friend on a date, she said no, and now it's REALLY awkward and I don't know if we're even still friends. Should I ask her about it? Should I give her some time? And how do I cope with just being friends/seeing her date other people?",06Sep2019,1
3,"I'm not sure if this is the right sub, nor if reddit in general is the place I should be right now, but tbh idk what else to do atm and maybe just writing it all down is just what I need to calm me down right now.
I am currently 23 weeks pregnant. I had my second ultrasound last week and was told to go to a hospital 2 hours away to have a doctor do the ultrasound again because something seemed off. 
Yesterday I went to the hospital and had the ultrasound, afterwards we had a talk with the doctor and she gave me a shitton of information and things they worry about. 
First of all she is way too small, she should be about 700 grams right now but she only is like 400. 
It looks like her kidneys are fused together into one which also worries them. 
The umbrical cord has only 2 veins instead of 3. 
And the last one I don't quite understand is that there a high resistance from my uterus and there is some backflow of the blood that goes to the baby, which means she doesn't get enough oxygen.
They told me they advice to do a amniocentesis because they think she might have trisomy 13 or 18. 
I do understand that if this is the case the chances of survival are really not high and her quality of life would basically be non existent in the case she does survive. 
But they also advised me to at least until after the results, not to do anything. So basically if she would pass tomorrow then to just let it happen. 
If the results would come in differently and she might have a bigger chance of survival they would hospitalize me and monitor her in case she needs to be delivered fast.

Now my issue us that I feel like it's just all math. When she advised me this is the hospital I didn't quite grasp what the doctor was saying yet and I agreed. But now from what I understand is that she is not getting any healthier by waiting, we would just have more information about her chances of survival. 
Maybe I'm being selfish, or I'm just not ready to give up, or maybe I'm just terrified of having to give birth to a lifeless baby. But I don't know if I made the right choice agreeing to this. 
I'm contemplating calling the doctor in the morning and ask for hospitalization anyway to give this girl every chance of survival, but I don't  know if it's the right thing to do. 
It's the middle of the night right now and both my partner and my parents in law are asleep, and I'm  not sure they would even understand these ramblings and loose strings of thought I am managing to put out there. 

Again, I don't know if this is the place, nor the time to put this here, but typing it out made me stop crying long enough to catch my breath so there is that.",06Sep2019,872
4,"So I got called for jury duty to serve on the month of December, but i'm a full time engineering student with multiple mental health conditions (ADD, ASD, Depression, Anxiety, Personality Disorder) and I cant think of how I'm going to deal with it with the stress of final exams, projects, and everything else that comes with the end of a semester.

5,"Pretty much said in the title. Basically I his (14yrs) brother wanted to know because he just constantly eats. I ask him about it to find out why, he just says that he doesn't feel full (most of the time) and just likes how it tastes. He barely gains any weight (though he does grow at a normal rate), has a CRAZY high amount of energy, almost no fat (he says that he is cold most of the time) but isn't anorexic, and just is a normal child for his age. He does get fed well, 3 times a day + snack time, but I just feel it's weird compared to when I was 7, I would feel full after a full serving. So, what are your best guesses?

7,"I'm 25, and I have a brother who I do care for quite dearly and me and him spend an inordinate amount of time together. However, my brother's mental condition is becoming debilitating for everyone around him including everyone from his husband (He's a homosexual) to his cats who he has abused before. My brother was heavily abused as a teenager, from both love interests and his own parents (He used to get beaten every day for being gay). He got involved with criminal activity and the dark side of humanity in his late teens (Including witnessing attempted murder and stuff like that). Now he's 30 and after changing his last name, he's living a completely new life on the other side of the country (Where I live). When my brother is in a good mood (And has had his proper weed dosing for the day, he is genuinely addicted and eats 800 mg of edible every day) he's a fantastic person to hang out with and he genuinely makes me a happier person. But oh my god when his PTSD strikes it's a nightmare. He turns into a vile psychopathic bully and tries to tear everyone down for no reason. Like for example, a few years back when we went on vacation together he had an episode and started psychotically screaming at his husband about how he wants a divorce and how he wants to fuck other dudes for absolutely no reason before then screaming at me about how I'm a worthless burnout loser. No, his PTSD is not an excuse for his behavior, he genuinely has C-PTSD and he is on the severe end, it's so bad he genuinely goes numb and just wants to commit suicide from time to time. 

The worst thing he's done is once his cat (Whom he normally ADORES and treats like a goddess) jumped up on the dining table and he SMASHED his fist against her tiny torso and sent her flying against the fridge and she needed to get stitches at a vet clinic. He said he felt awful but it was a genuine split second decision he made. He regularly will just assault or insult me or his husband for no reason when everything is going good simply because he feels out of control. It's like watching someone who is normally sweet and caring shift into an entirely different being at the drop of a hair for no reason at all. I don't know how to deal with him anymore and I do want him in my life. He's tried extreme therapy but almost got arrested for nearly assaulting the therapist when she confronted him about the stuff he's most insecure about.",06Sep2019,1

12,"For starters, My girlfriend and I have been dating for around 2 years, and we're very happy together. We live far away from each other, but we try to meet at least once every two weeks.

As a side note: We play video games together about 4 - 5 days out of a week. Usually we only play with each other but occasionally we'll invite others or a friend to join us. My girlfriend occasionally streams on twitch but doesn't have a large following, (mainly as a hobby.) 

For some context we're mostly playing the game Overwatch and we meet a lot of interesting people on there. However one day we just finished a game and my girlfriend advertised her stream in chat then someone came into her chat and asked to join the group. Of course we agreed and let him join us and we had a great time that day. After a few weeks, he'd play with us more than any of our other friends, and at this point we'd become pretty good online friends. However I started to notice something. He would act differently towards my girlfriend than I. 

For example: He would compliment my girlfriend on everything, talk to her in DM's and even donated to her stream. (My girlfriend rarely gets donation.) The reason he donated to her was because my girlfriend previously mentioned that she wanted to buy a webcam for her stream.

I didn't really think much of it because my girlfriend enjoyed his company. But just soon after, he started to only want to talk to my girlfriend as if I wasn't in the conclusion. He would spam her asking if she wanted to talk privately and watch every VOD of hers on twitch if he missed one, like every post of hers on twitter. He seemed obsessed with her and I knew what was going on. 

The next day us three were in a group call and we were playing Minecraft. It started out fine until he got very stingy when I called my girlfriend ""Babe"" instead of by her name. Afterwards during the rest of the call he gave me the cold shoulder and did everything for her. (If she needed something, he would drop what he's doing to get it for her. If she wanted to go anywhere in-game he'd ask if he could join. Meanwhile I'm not speaking much and just watching this happen.

I'm in no way jealous, just more annoyed that this happens and my girlfriend let's it continue. It's very obvious to me that he doesn't want to be friends with her, but more than that, and he doesn't want me in the conclusion. 

My girlfriend is going away for a few days for work and he got upset and messaged her ""Try not to over-work yourself and make sure to drink water"" as if they're dating.

I told my girlfriend that night how I felt about this guy. We agreed that he has a crush and is obsessed with her. She decided to not tell him anything and just keep things the way they're going. Right after I asked her ""What if it was vice versa? If there was a girl attached to me the same way and I didn't want to stop it? How would that make you feel"" She replied: ""It wouldn't matter because I love you and you love me"" 

I'm just furious about this all. I know she wouldn't leave me or anything but this is just unfair. I don't want this to continue, what should I do?",06Sep2019,1

16,"So I recently moved home about a month ago after graduating from college in May. I spent my summer in my college town working a barista job and mostly having fun. Now that I have been back I have really been searching for a job (mostly ""big girl jobs"") and there aren't many in my field of interest/within my experience level in my hometown. I want to move to a bigger city in my state, but it is so expensive right now, especially considering I don't have any job prospects here or there.  This is the first time in my life I haven't returned to a new school year in the fall and it is really weighing on me. I feel lost and like I am failing myself. I am so thankful to have parents that accepted me back into their home, rent-free, which is amazing. However, they are pushing me (as they should) to find a job or something to do rather than spending my days in their basement withering away, and I agree with them but it is so HARD! 

I know a lot of job searching and opportunities happen through networking and connections, but I feel just so discouraged right now. I know I will have to work a barista or server job again for the time being, but it is so hard because I spent four years expecting to end up with a career. I guess that is my main problem, I should limit my expectations for now :/   

Most people from college either found jobs right after graduation, or are pursuing grad school. I think I might go back to school, but I don't want to put in another two years to end up again where I am now. If you've dealt with the post-grad life scaries how did you get through it?",06Sep2019,1

22,"On my phone so hopefully this still all makes sense and isn't a nightmare to read.


I'm going to use abbreviations to help with the story. 


Y = aunt in question
A = her older sister
E= youngest sister


I have an aunt (Y) who got into a lot of disagreements when her parents (my grandparents) were dying. She was actually quite shitty. Like stealing expensive jewelry and deceiving family members. I know her and my other aunt (A) got into a large argument and no longer speak to one another. I didn't know what the argument was about until recently. 


Even though she didn't get along with my parents or one other aunt I didn't hold anything against her, especially since I was only hearing one side of the story. When my other grandmother passed away she showed up to the wake which probably sucked for her and I decided to tell her I was getting married. 


It wasn't until after I sent the save the date to her that I learned more about the argument. Basically she made some very rude comments about my mom and Aunt A told my mom. Aunt Y told Aunt A if she apologized for telling she would forgive her. Well Aunt A didn't apologize. So they no longer speak to one another. 


So I start getting a little torn about sending the Save the Date.


 So Aunt Y is extremely religious. Aunt E recently announced she is getting married...to a woman. Aunt Y said she refuses to go to the wedding because she doesn't support that lifestyle. This really pisses me off. Supposedly Aunt E and Aunt Y are still on speaking terms but I still think it's super shitty.


So at this point I feel like she gets along with no one. The only times we chat are through texts to wish happy holidays. She still sends me cards on holidays and usually a gift card on Christmas. We were very close when I was growing up. All this drama started about five years ago and the only time I've seen her was at the wake. 


Part of me feels like she didn't do anything to me directly so maybe I shouldn't be mad. And I would feel like a huge asshole sending the Save the Date and then not a wedding invitation but I don't think I really even want her there anymore. But I really just don't know. 


So Reddit what do you think? Do I invite Aunt Y to my wedding? Sending invites in a day or two so I don't have much more time to think about it.",06Sep2019,1

He made all of the money while she cooked (sometimes) and cleaned (again, sometimes).

She says she can not work due to her COPD, diabetes, and the fact that she says her body simply can not handle it. I've seen people much worse off than her go to work daily though. She also says she can draw more from disability and food stamps than she can get from the majority of jobs around the area she lives (very small town). 

She is always complaining to me about money and saying shes starving and can barely afford anything to eat on. Her sister (46F) and my sister (32F) are both constantly sending her money, yet she still always complains and almost cries to me about it daily. I feel guilty because I make around $4,600 a month and my boyfriend (20M) makes around $2,000 or more. But we both have lots of student debt, medical bills from when I didnt have insurance, $450 in car insurance combined, rent, internet, groceries, gas, and on top of all of that I'm an actor constantly having to put aside money to take off work for a week at a time for an acting gig and we are saving $30k to move to LA. We do not have much money to spare even though we make a lot for our age. 

Today I tried to explain that I didn't have much to spare and she went off on me saying that she should be more important to me than anything and she's never met someone so stringy with money. They thing is, I don't have that much and I'm trying to save to make my dreams come true. I work so hard for my money that it is literally mentally exhausting. I'm under constant stress while she lays in bed all day. She hasn't worked since I was 6 years old. She even brought up how she wants to commit suicide because of her lack of money. Then she called back ""offering"" to sell her house and go into a nursing home so I can have the money from the house ""since my dream is so important."" I never asked her for money and I know shes only saying this to make me feel more guilty. She says I should at least be willing to give her $100 a month.

33,"I am a student in her last year at university, studying environment design and VFX. As such, upon graduation, I would like to work in the entertainment industry, and I have been fortunate enough to have professors at my university who are actively working in the entertainment industry.

Here is where I need some advice - I have been trying to reconnect with a professor (let’s call him Ben) I studied under back in the fall semester of 2018, and I’m just not sure how to go about it/if I’m doing something wrong. On the two occasions I’ve reached out to him, he responds initially, and then just goes silent. I think he would be a great contact to have since he’s pretty high up at his company, but I don’t know if I’m going about reconnecting with him the right way...

Some background - I earned top marks in his class, and he even took me and a few others for a private tour of the studio he works at in February of this year. To show my appreciation, I gifted him an expensive pen (he’s a script writer) and notebook. He appreciated it and told me to add him on Facebook, LinkedIn, and PSN so we could play Destiny 2 some time. At the time, all seemed well - I had networked!

Fast forward to May of this year, and I was lucky enough to work at an indie gaming studio, which just so happened to be a mile away from where Ben worked! Realizing this, I emailed him and informed him of my new job and asked if he’d like to grab a coffee. He initially responded and sounded happy to hear from me, but shortly after just stopped responding. Then a few weeks went by and he emailed me! He said he was super busy at work, had been traveling, and that once he was back in town, we could set up a time to meet. I quickly responded saying thank you for replying, and gave him my number, explaining to just let me know a good time to meet and I’d be there. I never heard back.

Now comes the second attempt at reaching out to him - the head of my department (let’s call him Barry) knows I was a top student in his class and that I spent a lot of time working on projects for his class - and requested I reach out to Ben to teach again in the spring semester of 2020 (he’s taking a semester off because he’s so busy). I emailed him about Barry’s request, and added in that the offer to meet for coffee is still there if he’s free. Aaaaaand complete silence.

I think it would be OK as long as I am clear that we are just having fun and that it doesn’t mean anything..

My mum's too busy to work cause she's taking care of me and my brothers, my dad has Hepatitis B and is to ill and old to work. My mum has never done anything wrong to my grandad and is still talking to him and keeping in touch though she's very upset we don't get any money and we can't work (we live in a council house too) so we could use some help, she's talked to him and he just refuses to give any money. From your prospective, do you think this is fair on my mother since it's his money? Or do you think, we're poor and he gives 250k ~300k a year to the rest of his children but refuses to give money to the person who needs it the most.

38,"I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‘mines 21st’ and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays eh (Sam was laughing about it a bit) then Sue said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted seriously   like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest she looks like a drug addict. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

I started uni last week and have only been there 2/8 days because of my anxeity. I wanted to ask my psychiatrist, if I could get something to help me with that. Im already on Oxazepam, but it doesn’t do much for me, I feel like. I know the pro and cons of benzodiazepines and so does my parents, but they think the cons weigh out the pros.

I am lazy, lonely, and very self concious at certain points. At other times I can be very happy and not self concious at all. I've considered that I might be depressed, but I doubt this simply because I don't feel sad all the time and every time I think of it I feel ridiculous because I feel like i'm a sad Bart Simpson posting 5th grader.

49,"Hi. 
So there's this girl in my class who I think I'm into. Considering how I feel about her and the way she makes me feel, you'd say I'm quite fond of her. She is probably one of the prettiest person I've ever seen. She's got a beautiful nose and silky skin. I didn't touch it but it looks soft. Her legs are long and skinny, as her fingers. She's also very funny and kind. Anyway, you get what I mean. However, considering that I've never fallen for someone it could just be confusion or some necessity for affection and love. 
The thing's that she makes me feel happy and I shake when we're talking, even via WhatsApp. 
Best part is that she feel the same way. She didn't say so but she flirts with me and I also do. Her friends used these websites where you calculate two people's compatibility. The test said 85%. She said some really nice things to me, like I'm cute and stuff. Today, she especially told me my hair looked cool.
So, it is mutual, there's no problem. I also see a future with her. 
There wasn't any kind of problem really until today my friend told me some things about her. Let's call this friend A so it does not get confusing. A said she is part of the Jehovah's witness community. There is nothing wrong with that itself, but they are homophobic and we are both girls. They wouldn't approve of our relationship and keeping it secret wouldn't be fun. And I know that there are some exceptions but still.
Secondly, A told me she goes to a psychologist because she talks to herself. I couldn't be more shocked when A said so since I do that to and in English, which is weirder considering it is not my first language. However, when A and I got to talk about it seriously she told me that's not the reason why she's seeing this doctor. She did not elaborate more on that since she had no clue. Before she told me that, I had spent the last 2 school hours thinking about that, how I could be dating a crazy girl. When I got home, I realised that if she had any mental condition, I really shouldn't mind because, in the end of the day, she is the same be 9autiful girl I'm into. I'd support her tremendously. 
So, what should I do? Should I really get involved in this? In a girl who's "" crazy"" and whose family is probably homophobic? When I really think 'bout it, the mental illness part is not something I should be worried that much.",06Sep2019,0

52,"I'm a young adult guy and about 2 years ago I became very close with someone from work and we quickly became best friends (my ultimate best friends live back home where I'm from but in my new city he's become my closest friend here).  We share the same interests like working on our civics, home projects, building things - etc.  I joined his friend circle and became friends with all of his friends too.   After about a year of being his best friend, I began to notice that he tells a lot of crazy stories about himself.  I always believed him because why would he lie?  When I finally looked back at some things he's told me, I began to think ""wow he has a suspiciously high amount of crazy things he's been through"" He would tell me things like how he's been in an airplane crash, how he bought a high price BMW right out of college but it's at home in Florida because his parents drive it &amp; he doesn't want to park it on the streets here, or all these skills he has yet nothing to show of them.   Or how he used to buy cars, fix them up and re-sell them when he was in high school.  (I later tried helping him fix something on his car and he had no idea what he was doing despite his stories of fixing cars back in the day)

&amp;#x200B;

I began to realize he's lying!  He always acted like he knew the answer to everything.  I even fact checked some things that came out of his mouth and he was so wrong! His stories would get crazier and crazier, especially when drinking and with friends.  He once said that he was accused of attempted murder once because he was getting robbed by 3 people who had a gun; he grabbed the gun from their hands and shot them all in the knees.  He said he was under house arrest for a month.  There is no way! You can't have a criminal record for the job we both have.   

&amp;#x200B;

So I've distanced myself from him.  We don't text very much anymore.  He will invite me to something and I'll usually decline.   It sucks because he used to show up to my house unannounced a lot because that's how close we were.  Now I feel that everything that was genuine between us has all been a lie.  Like when I helped him work on his civic I couldn't believe he talked so much about how he's done this and that to the car but when helping him try to fix his radiator it became so clear to me that there was no way any of that was true based on what I saw of his skill levels.  

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways,  any advice for this friendship?  Should I be done with it all together or try to connect with him somehow and see if I can repair the way I feel about him now?  Thanks.",06Sep2019,3
53,"I’m going to try and keep this short. My boyfriend (23m) and myself (22f), got pregnant four years ago. We were both students and struggling and never intended to get pregnant, but I did. We planned to continue the pregnancy and most likely keep the child. When I got pregnant, I had no idea for about 8 weeks. My period was somewhat  irregular still and I didn’t keep track of it. I was prescribed adderall at an early age, and when I got pregnant, I was drinking with my college friends as well as smoking. I stopped when I found out I was pregnant, but it may have been too late. I found out I miscarried, I immediately blamed all of those things that I did. I was barely eating and was living a very unhealthy lifestyle. I ended up falling into a deep depression that I have still not gotten over. We lived together when this happened, and he knew how horrible I felt. I didn’t leave our apartment except to work ( I had to take online classes) for nearly a year. I was absolutely heartbroken. Well, this spiraled and I became a horrible girlfriend/person. I was absolutely manic and depressed and unstable, it stemmed from the miscarriage but turned into much more. Boyfriend got addicted to cocaine and we struggled with that for a very long time. I ended up moving home to my moms for a year, bf went back to college hours away, and I got better. It totally changed me. A year ago I moved back in with bf so I could also finish my degree. At that point, it had been awhile since the miscarriage, and we just didn’t feel the need to talk much about it anymore. It absolutely ruined me, which in turn made him feel trapped/miserable and turn to drugs, and we both had been better/sober for well over a year.

Last night, we both went out and got very drunk and ended up having a fight. He blamed the entire miscarriage on me and screamed that it was my fault in my face. I love him, but I feel like everyone has to have that one thing that they can’t forgive. That is 100% my #1 thing. I’m not sure how i’ll ever get over it. We’ve been together for over 5 years and I love him. He says he doesn’t even remember saying this stuff, but I think I’ll think about it forever. It brought back the worst feeling in the world, and I can’t believe that he was angry/drunk enough to say that. He obviously has also thought that it was my fault.

I’m just not sure what to do. We live together across the country from our families and have built a life here. I have nowhere to go and I always wanted to be with him, but I feel absolutely nauseous over what he said...",06Sep2019,1

A bit of background before I begin

The problem for me begins when they compare all of u cousins.... as if one of my cousin got something why dont i, or if they have a gf why i dont have one. U know maybe someone can relate
Lately idk how to deal with them saying im getting fat.. ik ik , maybe im overreacting. 
But is hard sometimes, i do know i gained weight, and my aunts keep telling my nother about how my cousin are on diets and doing work outs.. to the point of my mother putting pics on her phone to show me how they are very fit and whatnot.

So i guess i ask for adcvice in how to handle this, i feel like telling her that its my life, but sadly the more ive talked with her i think it gets worst

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ttthe company name I said then  ‘ohhhh/mmmm...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look at my hair funny in a wtf face if I had it styled or just untouched is that a bad sign?

I don't know what subreddit this should be in.

I have a cousin who is around 1-2 years older than me. We are both are in our late 20s. We aren't the closest but we are definitely not strangers. We've always lived in different states but the drive distance was maybe around 4 -5 hours. So not incredibly far to the point where our parents would never visit each other. Anyways, this guy has bad anger issues he has multiple felonies which are from assult and theft. He hasn't stopped his habbits at all. He's always verbally abused me but I genuinely think he's a joke and I tell him that when ever he tries to verbally abuse me, that's the only time I talk bad about someone is when I'm defending myself.

We do play video games together with some mutual friends and chat through discord when we are all gaming. there has been multiple times where he has said some of the worst things ever to a human, even after I've told him multiple times to never talk to me like that. He doesn't seem to care to stop he just says he is ""raw"". So I go bouts of no contact with him. This last time was the last straw and I told him to fuck off and not to contact me. Most of our fights are him just comparing him self to me and him saying how he's so much better. He's always compared him self to me and has always put me down  (the typical bully psychology) I've always felt like he is sociopath or at least narcissistic.  His friends that I play games with agree to what I say. So! After some time had passed where I was not talking to him, I re joined the discord and he is enraged with one of his friends and he was threatening him that he was going come down  and beat the shit out of him. So I replied to him and he started threatening me and verbalizing his plans how he's going to send people to us to kill us. What's funny is that this is all being typed so I have screen shots of the whole conversation. It bothered me so bad that now I want to call the cops on him and have him put in prison. He already has a criminal history of violence. I'm just so tired if his behavior. This has been 2 months since this has happened and I still feel like notifying the authorities. Am I dumb to do this? I'm not willing to communicate with him any longer, that bridge is burned.

The problem is she’s becoming very negative all the time, constantly looking for pity points and being better than me. We both just had surgery, hers for her shoulder about 7 months  and me for my jaw last month. anytime my surgery would come up in convos she would bring up hers and how bad hers was. how she went through all this stuff. I literally can’t eat anything for two months and she brings up how she couldn’t lift her arm for a 3 weeks. she moved from a different state and will constantly bash mine which i love dearly, and say how much better things were there. she is always needing to be superior to me, bringing up her advanced school classes, achievements, and “better” music taste,( that one the most for some reason?) questioning most different things i’m into. if i like something that doesn’t fit her grove, shell talk about it in a way that makes me feel insecure about liking it. if we make a slightly mean joke about me, which usually i’m all for, shell keep stretching it out to where i feel she’s just trying to jab at me. the thing that i struggle with the most with wanting to talk to her about is how she is always talking about how hard her life is. Every day she brings up how tried she is from sports, sighing and saying how much it sucks until i show sympathy. she has pity-pressures me into buying many things for her, including amusement park tickets that she said was alright if i went without her, but the way she was talking you knew it wasn’t. she doesn’t have time for a job, which i completely understand not having money, but then is constantly wanting to do things that i feel obligated to pay for since she doesn’t have much. today a comment that really irked me was this, “yknow, i’m so tired from my sport, if i didn’t take you home, i would have so much more time to relax...” i’ve never forced her to take me home, and try to be very understanding of her busy schedule, what made me upset was yet again she guilts me into things to get what she wants without just telling me directly, while getting extra sympathy. i broke down crying after school because i’ve been struggling with my own things that she’s shown little sign in wanting to know and support me with.  i absolutely dread confrontation and i don’t know what to do. anytime i bring something up she gets extremely defensive. she’s a good person with minor flaws, and i was in hers shoes and i know how sucky life can get, but i also know complaining about it constantly just makes it worse. i have no idea how i should go about this, ive just left a toxic friendship before i became friends with her so im scared i’ll have to do it again.",06Sep2019,1

68,"I'll try to keep this short, any thoughts are GREATLY appreciated I feel very lost and confused on what to do.

(Our work is 7 days on shift, then 7 days off shifts are 12 hours + travel 1 hour each way for a total of 14 hours each day.)

My birthday is Aug 22, which is my work week. I'm not a big birthday guy so I would never request the day off, my friends wanted to go camping for my birthday so I decided to do it the week before, on my week off. I got called in to help out because there was nobody else to cover, so I cancelled the camping trip and delayed it to the week after my birthday (another off week). Everything went well, covered the shift went etc. The week after my work week I'm out camping on Wednesday and I get a call saying ""can you work tonight?""

Now, like I said i am NOT a birthday guy...I said yes, there was nobody else to cover and the guy on shift has been on for 14 hours straight. I had to drive north 2 hours to get back to my house but decided it was worth it to help the company. They called me about 15 minutes into the drive and said ""nvm we found someone but we might call you over the next few days"" I smiled said ok no problem and turned back around to the camp. Great so far right? 

I wake up to a text the next morning (I woke up at 11:30am mind you we're camping and hanging out late) to a TEXT MESSAGE from 10am saying ""you're working tonight at 5:30"" with NO NOTICE, no request, no phone call, nothing...just a text saying you're working (for the record it's optional for me or anyone to take shifts on our days off). Remember, I'm 2 hours away from my house and from there another hour from work...I'm minimum 3 hours away. I explained this to him and said I'd be willing to come in for the rest of the week but if theres someone who can cover tonight that would be great cause it's very hard for me to make it. 

He said ""I can't do that to anyone its too short notice"" ...........

.........ITS SHORT NOTICE FOR ME TOO! AND im out camping, and im 3 hours away with a 5 hours window to the shift (mind you this is NIGHT SHIFT, preferably I can sleep before working 12 hours..?

I bit the bullet, said fuck it and went to work. Cancelled everything, all my friends are mad who came camping etc but I'm a company guy and now I kind of regret it...I asked for a day off and got a message back within THIRTY seconds ""no one willing to cover that day""

He didn't even have enough time to check....this is a company with \~90 employees mind you it's not a crew of 5 and he knows everyone's schedules...he DID NOT EVEN CHECK.

WTF do I do? I'm being treated like absolute crap, its been eating me alive and even today I almost texted I quit and not shown up for my shift.  BTW, I'm not a bad employee and I've never quit a job in my life. I'm the guy who goes WAY above and beyond the requirements of the post. I do management's job as well when they're running low on time.

A girl called Sophie (not her actual name) made it easy for me to move because she was nice and helped me figure out the school people etc. From 7th until Freshman year we were great friends, talking daily to each other stuff like that. I was gonna ask her out but the day I was going to she told me someone asked her out the day before. I was really sad about it and shit. Then out of nowhere she just stopped talking to me. That was middle of freshman year. Now i’m a junior and i’m in her class and we sit next to each other. We are starting to talk again and I’m falling for her again but I feel like she could do the same thing again. What the hell do I do?",06Sep2019,1
70,"I’m 25 and still live at home, I have student debt out the eyeballs so I’m not paying that off anytime soon. I’ve been trying to find a better paying job in my field for the past year with no luck mostly because I live in a super rural place and I’ll have to drive at least an hour to get a decent job. And I’ve been so bored with my job and my life for a long time now, there’s just nothing to do and most of my friends have moved away. 

I found some relatively cheap studio apartments in an nyc commuter town that’s two hours away from where I live. I have about 6,000 saved up, is that enough to possible quit my job, move, without another one lined up? Or should I look for a job first? Or am I being too rash about the whole thing?",06Sep2019,1
71,"Oh boy. This happened about mid August.

So my cousin was out and he video called me and told me his female friend wanted to speak to me. The conversation was decent and seemed okay so I asked for her contact information. She gives her snapchat to my cousin and I speak to her for a few days. These conversations are completely innocuous. Nothing sexual, inappropriate or overtly political. During my conversations with my cousin, I (obviously) relay some of the info about our conversations seeing that she's his friend (nothing negative), but as time went on, I felt as though he was misconstruing my intentions and going back and forth between the both of us. I told her that we should stop relaying information to him because it might cause confusion. She told me that she feels like he is making it seems like she has a crush on me and I told her that I feel that he is doing the same and I made it VERY CLEAR that this is not a romantic relationship and even asked her if I made her uncomfortable in any way. She said no and that I ""just made her laugh"". 

Anyways... my cousin and I are on the phone and he adds her to the call and the conversation starts takes a turn for the worst. She starts hurling insults at me saying that I look like a woman, sound gay, ""your parents are ashamed to walk around in public with you"". Very abusive, vile stuff. I instantly shut it down and remove her from the app. I move on and forget about it.

Today my cousin called me and told me that she is telling people at his school (mind you, we live in two different cities, different social circles and I have no way of defending myself) that I was being a creep, I kept asking her to call me, I kept texting her and that I invited her to coffee (which is not true and certain things are being implied from the last point). I was extremely hurt and disappointed because this person is painting me in a negative light and is destroying my reputation. What do I do? I don't want to be labelled a predator. What's even more baffling is that she was the one who spewed so much hate and venom now she wants to lie about me to her friends and the people at her school? What do I do?",06Sep2019,2
72,"I performed a statistical analysis for a client a few weeks ago. It was a lot of work and we negotiated what I thought was fair compensation. He is from Saudi Arabia and he told me that he wired me the money in a few weeks when he returned to the United States.

After a few weeks he did not wire me the money, so I sent him some messages on What's App just trying to check in. He did not respond to any of them, so I looked up his university email (he is an Assistant Professor) and sent an email there. I did not say anything rude in the messages. I only said ""Hi"" and ""How are you"" hoping to start a conversation.

After the email to his university account, he finally responded to my What'sApp messages. I was happy and I told him that I was worried that something had happened to him. After he said this he told me that yes something had happened to him. Then he said that his whole family died in a car accident and he could not speak because he was at a wake. He gave me the contact information for a ""colleague"" and told me to contact the colleague. 

Eventually this colleague reached out to me and basically corroborated  the guys story. At this point I already doubted things, but I thought I would be the king of the assholes if I called someone out for something like that and found out that I was wrong. 

This ""colleague"" eventually starts making up info about the other guy. He used a different last name and said he works at a university in Oman. Then after a few minutes he writes ""[Guys name] RIP."" And tells me the guy just killed himself!

It was so ridiculous I just stopped responding. Then this second guy says he still wants me to help finish the guy's project that I had worked on early in the month. 

I don't think I need to explain to you what is almost definitely happening here. I just want to know what you think I should do. I did a lot of work for this client and I put off other jobs and it really upsets me that not only will I not get paid, but this guy thinks that I am stupid enough to fall for his B.S. I have considered talking to his university. He is an assistant professor there. I have receipts for all of this.

I’m not the best when it comes to relationships, in my eyes I’m a lot less attractive in person, and I’m very awkward.


Today I [17M] invited over a crush [16F]  just to chill in my room and watch netflix. Everything seemed to be fine, i drove her home and said goodbye. I then texted her about 20 minutes later saying that i had a great time etc. She responded with a “ :))))”. And I then asked if she ever wanted to hang out again to just text me. This is about the 2 hour mark of being ignored. I hate to seem weird but the app we’re communicating on shows that she’s active &amp; talking to other people.

I currently work as accounting manager at a company that is a thirty minute drive. The culture at my current company sucks, but I have great flexibility (with all the guilt but it’s there). I’m also worried about the longevity of the plant. It hasn’t had financial stability in its four years of operation. The current manager is also a hot head and makes rash decisions frequently. He makes the third manager since the plant opened. Pros of this job: I’m only a half hour from my daughter’s school. Flexibility. Pay is more than fair. 

I was just offered a position at an awesome company. The manager seems awesome and we really jived in the interviews. The pay is a slight bump up, the culture seems to be exactly what I want, but it’s an hour drive one way. That’s literally the only hang up. My mom guilt is playing me hard right now; I already took my current job, leaving a job that was literally two rural miles from her school. Now I’m considering this. While it won’t drastically change my time with her, it will affect it somewhat. There is a possibility we can move closer to the potential new job, but it will be at least a year out.

A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it.

The next day we were talking then she asked me “why do you sit at the back?”...I took that as a hint that she wanted me to sit closer to her which I did the following exam. Was I right to do that or did I throw myself onto her and came on a bit too strong? Anyways I sat closer to her the next time and after the exam she made a point not to leave immediately like she does every time and revised the exam with me. I just wanted to know what her question indicated that’s all. What do you guys think? I just want to know if her question indicated that she wanted me to sit closer to her. Would really appreciate some answers.


She also regularly looks at me when I’m not looking and always gives a wide smile every time I talk to her, also keeps the conversation going by asking questions etc but I don’t really believe in those ‘signs’.

Anyways, do you think she really wanted me to sit by her or just asked me that to cheat off me? I asked that somewhere and someone said that she was being nice just because she wanted me to do her a favor and copy my answers in the exam. The thing is, at the time I didn’t think of that possibility at all as she’s really, really shy and honestly when we sat closer to each other I was the one who always initiated the cheating, then she’d follow. Also, one of the things that happened that made rule out that possibility was that once before an exam started, she glanced at me a few times (my friend notified me of this) before coming over from the back to say hi with a wide smile...then left with her friend to sit at the back. This incident right there is why I didn’t think she was using me to cheat...I mean if she did then why would she leave with her friend to sit at the back (I was sat in the middle)?

99,"Hey! So I’m 23, and the youngest child of 3, I don’t have a relationship with my parents because I don’t trust them. I would like to some day have trust in them but every time I try it blows up in my face. So my lack of trust in them is due to just being emotionally neglected from them for years, feeling like they weren’t protecting me enough from my abuser(I had been abused for 6 years), and just generally them being uninterested in my life. I’ve expressed my trauma and mental health concerns with my family and they really blow it off, making it seem as though my disorders or minuscule even though I go to therapy/take meds.  Well recently I explained to my mother that I had 14 therapist/psychiatrist in a span of 3 months because I was transferred through 3 different outpatient programs and she just kind of dismissed it and said “you should learn how to control your emotions more”, and then proceeded to tell me that I don’t need medication. 

I recently got into a new relationship also and my parents have been trying to ask me more about it but I don’t feel comfortable about it because they had rejected my previous same sex relationship that o had for 4 years and just generally dismissed my bisexuality. 

Whenever I get mail at home my parents then proceed to open my mail, I had received a check of over 1k and they didn’t tell me about it until a month later and then told me that they wanted me to deposit it into their account(I did not, but they’ve been trying to make me transfer it). 

I continually get put down for my appearance even though I’ve been told I’m attractive, as in my parents calling me ugly, or them calling me fat, even though I only weigh 112lb. I had gained weight over a year of time due to my meds and work out regularly so I’m still very thin, just that I have thick thighs and a bit of a tummy, I used to be 98lbs and was underweight but they think I looked better then, even though they’d still call me ugly. 

They ignore my abuse also, I had tried speaking to my parents about how it feels dealing with ptsd from the events and they kind of just laughed it off and when I started crying they left me alone until I stopped “being dramatic”. 

And these are a lot of things to deal with, it’s annoying, it’s troublesome, I had just graduated college and I’m back home. I’ve been applying to jobs so hopefully I land one quickly so I can move out with job security, but I’d like to one day have a relationship with them, I want to talk to my parents about how dismissive and generally rude they are to me but I don’t know how to go about doing this because they’ll overlook everything I say regardless?",06Sep2019,1
100,"Okay, so here is the thing. I need your help with this moral dilemma.

You see: Ever since I was young, I have played different instruments- most of them never really clicked, except from this baritone or euph (long ago, does not really remember what it looked like). I've been wanting to buy one of those bad boys forever, but never could afford one. I have been contemplating this alot, and I really miss having one. When I played it before, it was only a borrowed one I played- so I never had the chance to own one. But seriously- just thinking about that goregous sound coming from it. I miss it so much. I have been living places with thin walls, and have not been able to play any instruments lately so it is no rush.

I might have a chance to afford one. WHen my dad died, I inherited his flugelhorn- this beautiful little fella(looks like the Danny deVito of trumpets).It kind of sounds a bit softer than a trumpet. I do play it sometimes, but it does not feel right. I am not a big fan of the soprano wind family- I have sensitive hearing, so sharp and light sounds are painful. Right now it is more or less just sitting on the shelf and collecting dust. I really do not feel any love for the instrument itself, but rather the sentimental value. Would it not be better for an instrument to end up with someone who would love it? I feel like I am a jerk for asking this. 

Music, classical especially has a big place in both me and my father's heart. He knew I loved playing music, so therefore he gave me the instrument in his will, but at the same time it is not the right instrument for me- and I'd hate to see it just wasting away not being played on as much as it deserves. And if I sold it, I'd might be able to buy that very instrument mentioned above- and instrument I'd actually play alot. Both instruments means alot to me.

She just told me that she goes through bitchy moods sometimes (and used those exact words). So long story short I’m 15 and I like this girl who seems to be interested in me but openly admits to liking another guy. What bothers me is this guy is an ass. And that’s not just me it’s been EVERYONE I’ve asked who has said that they either don’t know him or DO not like him at all. So basically we both go to different schools in the same town and she was supposed to hangout with this guy she liked, he stood her up, she was initially very frustrated about it and we spent almost all day talking about it. Next thing I know they have plans to hangout again, which isn’t bad but she seemingly forgot about what JUST happened. So I don’t think this guy is treating her right at all, and I do give her more attention than him (it’s very important to point out that’s it’s not to the extent that she’s annoyed or anything, she actually really likes talking to me).

She also really likes sewing/quilting and keeps buying tons and tons of fabrics and other resources.

I make online friends a lot, and I never have been romanitcally attracted anyone in terms of online friends. Until I talked to this one dude. We talked before in my circle of online friends. And I considered him a good friend. He wouldnt pop up in the groupchats much anymore so I just left it at that and didn't really talk to him afterwards. 2-3 months ago we started talking again. Almost everyday we would talk, even with school starting. Talking to him really brightened my day. Soon enough I started to think about him, even when we weren't talking. If I was sad, I think about a happy moment together. (Which worked, but I ended up looking stupid while smiling for no apparent reason in class) Or I might ask myself 'Will he be online today?'. And I also started to really rethink what I was texting to him, and if I felt like I sent something too simple or just weird I would just scream in my pillow and call myself stupid. 

I noticed I get many reckless crushes easily in real life. Of course none went as far as asking them out, and the feeling would disappear after a few days. I connected the 2 (Him and me getting crushes easily). I  of course really tried denying it. He's a really good person, but I just don't necessarily agree on online couple relationships. I decided to give myself another week to rethink about it, because like I said, I get a lot of reckless crushes but stop having the crush after a few days . 'There's no way I have a crush on him right?'. 

And alas, here I am. I wanted to stop this weird feeling in my heart and tried avoiding him. Of course, I failed. He's a good friend of mine and I really enjoy talking to him.

131,"Hello all,
My mom is going through filing for a divorce. She doesn’t speak good English so I am translating for her. We had a consultation with a firm that we ended up liking. Prior to the meeting, we were informed that the firm knew the lawyer representing my father (both firms are about two hours apart and in different counties, so this was surprising to us) we were concerned that our firm would relay anything mentioned in the consultation to my father’s lawyer. So I chose to record the conversation in case they relayed anything back to his lawyer without our permission. I did not make it known to the attorney that I was recording. 
After the consultation we signed the legal agreement to sign up for her services. She went into another meeting, I approached her secretary and told her that I was recording because I did not trust her. Told the secretary that I trust the attorney now and am deleting this audio. I showed her the audio, played a snippet, and hit delete. The app doesnt have a recovery mode and I told the secretary of this. She asked if I had told the attorney that I was recording, I said “yes”. I don’t know why i didn’t say “no”. 
Anyway my mother got an email from the attorney today about this situation and how she did not agree to the recording. She also mentioned a bunch of legal stuff relating to recording without the other person’s consent. She is right, I should not have lied about it. But I don’t regret it because it was a true concern: my father is not afraid of buying people and information. 
I feel ashamed for lying about her saying “yes” to the recording.

138,"I am 23 and have never dated, had sex, or been in a relationship. I read answers to my dilemma all the time on the internet and it is always the same: ""don't wait for someone to find you, go find them"", ""work on and love yourself"", ""work for the future."" All these are wonderful pieces of advice that I think anyone should live by. Yet, I don't feel that advice is what I need. I am finishing school (mechanical engineering) and excelling at it, no stress at all which is rare for the program at my school. I have worked hard for companies, networked, and have a promising lineup of offers. I have a tight group of friends and hobbies (gourmet cooking and hardcore videogaming) that I enjoy and love to share. Most of all, I love myself. Not with a huge ego, but enough that I can loudly and proudly say I am confident in my own shoes. 

Yet, no matter how hard I try. No matter what I do. Nothing I have ever done has gone anywhere relationship wise. I feel like I am out of ideas almost. And I absolutely put in the effort. I have mingled with plenty of girls. Yet, when I do work up the courage to ask out someone I like all I end up is rejection. Engineering girls at school? The small few there are either end up having a boyfriend or just aren't interested. Out at a bar and chatting up for the night? Nope, I've had people sneak off saying they just have to ""go to the bathroom."" Trying to make some moves when going to a one on one beach trip with a crush? Nah. And it is not like I rush into these things all the time either. Ranging from being two strangers who meet up at a party to being a close friend for a while, no length of ""timing"" when making a move has worked. 

And it is not like I am viewed poorly either. Plenty of people, my age and older, compliment that I am a catch. That I have qualities that will make me a great boyfriend/husband one day. Being independent, showing sympathy and thought for others, cooking, the list goes on. Ironically, it hurts to hear that more than it helps. You just don't want to believe them. Because if something like that really was true, then why wouldn't at least someone, some opportunity, come your way. Just someone to show interest even. Hearing ""You are just XX years old, you are still young"" just makes me laugh at this point. It didn't help the problem 6 years ago, and it doesn't help the problem now. I wonder how old you have to be to stop hearing it. 

I also think it is a crucial question to ask what someone wants out of a relationship, which I have both heard before and have an answer to. It probably wouldn't surprise many that sex was a driver when I was younger, but that didn't last long.  To have a close companion was my goal for much longer. Only recently, I did a lot of soul searching to see if I could boil it down even further, and I was successful. Now, all I want is affection. Something I never had growing up. But, not the affection just a friend could give. That intimate affection that comes from someone who you know is attracted to and loves you and can depend on you as you them. That affection that makes you passionate and intimate with someone. The same affection that makes you two want to bounce back and work things out when you're both at your lowest, your worst, your ugliest. Cheesy, I know. And by no means something I see or want out of someone just starting out in a relationship. But, it is something I hope to have at some point down the line.

So after all that rambling, now comes the advice I ask. Hearing all that, and assuming most or all of the things I have said are valid (and I acknowledge the chance that I don't know the whole picture with my experiences), what would you do?  I feel I have things together, and all I ever hear at this point is ""keep waiting."" But I am frustrated at this point. I am the type of person that tries to solve problems, and this just has never been a problem I could fix.  

My grammar isn't the best, I am no writing savant plus a lot of this was dumped raw straight from the brain with little editing. To any of you that actually read this all the way through, I thank you for your time and apologize for having you listen to the ramblings of a frustrated young man. XD If someone has advice to what I have to say, I would always love to hear something new. This account is a throwaway, I just had to blow off some steam after once again, getting rejected.

After we broke up, she already started talking to somebody else, but her friend says she's still kinda depressed. The guy stopped taking the bait because he was one of the guys she messed around with, and just like me he was waiting too long to know if she loved him.

144,"I moved into a townhouse about a month ago. In the last week or so, my neighbor's daughter (I assume) has started playing loud music in their basement after midnight, sometimes continuing until 3 or 4am, sometimes stoping after an hour. I assume it's when she has people over because I can also sometimes hear talking, unless that's a TV or something. Rarely plays music during the day, really just starts around midnight.

Anyway, it's bothering me, and I usually have to wake up early for work or school and it keeps me up. I have a white noise machine, a medium-ish fan on the floor, and a tabletop fan to try and block the noise, and it works for blocking talking/general noise. But the music's bass comes through and loudly, I can hear it despite my white noise and I can hear it on the second floor of the house. I know the wall between us is thin, and my bed is up against the shared wall which doesn't help much. I want to try and do something to block the noise to see if I can fix it before I go over to talk to her (If I go talk to her/her mom, I want to be able to say I have done basically everything I can to fix it because I don't know them and don't know how they'll react to me asking them to keep it down after midnight). I know I can get earplugs, and I might do that still but I want to also try physically stopping the noise as much as I can. Today, since their TV was louder than usual, I started playing music on my echo dot to drown it out (and since they can likely hear it even though it isn't super loud at all, maybe they'll realize that I'm in here and how thin the wall is haha) but once it's past acceptable time to play music, I'll turn that off and listen to my headphones like I have been since this has all started.

My house is owned by my grandfather, who I'm living with, but I don't want to do anything that is super invasive, because the noise doesn't bother him and I don't want to bother him with this. Right now the shared wall is bare except for a couple framed posters, and the wall is panel. My thoughts so far are getting some moving blankets to hang up, since I've read that can help sometimes, as well as tapestries and canvas paintings, and I'm gonna try and see if I can layer it all somehow (both to add mass to the wall and also to cover the blankets as much as possible.) When I can afford it, I will be getting a desk, desk chair, and maybe a comfortable dish chair to put in an empty corner of the shared wall and I'm hoping that might help some too.  The room is also carpeted, with a couple rugs, so that's already covered. The wall facing the backyard has doors/windows, and I have blackout curtains that claim to also reduce noise on the glass patio doors but the other window is covered with a thin cloth. I have more blackout curtains in the doorway to the basement hallway (no actual door between basement and hallway). I have also looked into getting those foam bass traps since it's the bass noise that's the most annoying, but they are a little more expensive and honestly ugly, so if I have to get those, I would do it after all this other stuff and it doesn't work.

Does covering the wall in moving blankets/tapestries/canvases and getting furniture seem like it would be at least somewhat effective? I know none of this is going to truly get rid of the noise coming in, but my goal is really just to deaden it enough that I can't hear it past the fans/white noise. There are also a lot of nail holes in the shared wall--could filling those with something help reduce noise? I've heard that holes can lead to a lot of noise leaking through, but I don't know if nail holes which obviously don't go through the wall all the way would do that. Any advice on other things I could do on my end to sound proof?

tl;dr: Neighbor playing loud music, I can hear it clearly through shared wall. Don't want to do anything invasive, so I'm thinking of covering the wall with moving blankets, tapestries, and canvases, and getting some more furniture. Would that help, and/or are there any other things I can do?

And I can’t tell if I can even have a crush on her, we don’t talk much and I barely know her. I just enjoy our few interactions and think about her romantically whenever I see her and stuff.

I quickly hurried home and told my parents that I couldn’t keep taking him on his walk until he has calmed down and that I didn’t feel safe with him right now and my dad called me “ a fucking liar” and told me “ you’re an attention whore he never bit you shut the fuck up” and told me that he’s never bit him or anyone in front of him so I was a liar.

I tried explaining what happened but he wouldn’t believe me and said that he would take him and after he told he bit no one on the walk and that I’ve always been a worthless idiot who’s been trying to break him up with my mom.

164,"Not sure if this is the appropriate place to ask but, I'm really curious for other peoples opinion. Also, I am a female. 

When I was a freshman in high school, my friend at the time invited me to a youth group she had recently joined. I then started attending around September. There were around 4-5 youth group leaders and the youth pastor, during the first few weeks of meeting them nothing seemed out of the ordinary. 

It wasn't until almost a month later when I noticed I was being treated differently from one of the male leaders, who I will call Bryan. I don't know Bryan's exact age but I know for sure he is in his late 40's, maybe 50 now and he is married with a kid. (I've only met his wife a handful of times)

 It was during a Halloween event Bryan was in charge of, when I noticed he clung to me. Throughout the event he stood constantly beside me and only talked to me. There was a haunted house at the event my friend and I were in line for when Bryan came up to go in with us. Right before entering I was holding on to my friends arm, then Bryan asked if I could hold on to his arm, which I did. During that night we exchanged phone numbers, when I got home he texted me how happy it made him that I was there, next to that many emoji's including hearts. I was 14 at the time this happen. This might not seem like a big deal and it might not be, but I remember feeling uncomfortable and even guilty that I was the only we he payed attention to that night.  

Then during a Thanksgiving event that couldn't make it to, he texted me to take pictures of his son there. I did but instead of saying thank you, he began texting me like a peer would. I believe he used his son as an excuse to talk to text me. I left the youth group for the rest of the year since I felt so uncomfortable being around him 

Then during my sophomore year of high school when I just turned 15 I started going again. It was like nothing changed. Bryan was always next to me talking to me and gave bear hugs every time he saw me and when I left. I must add, he never hugged anyone else at youth group besides me. I always got text's from him asking if I would be at youth group. I remember a specific text from him saying ""Hey girl, will I be seeing you tonight"". I feel like him texting me was questionable, but the way he texted me was even more questionable. Bryan also announced the announcements in front of everyone before the sermon would start. While he was up there he always stared as if he was only talking to me. My friends caught on to this and began teasing me calling him my ""creeper"". With my friends catching on I began to see this as a game. 

This went on until my Junior year of high school. Bryan constantly called me cute and invited me out to non-youth group related events (which I never went). I felt like his pet at youth group. He always took selfies with me and complemented me, again he never did that to anyone else but me. I was the first one he told when he said he was leaving youth group and would no longer be a leader. During that time he texted me things like how much he would miss me and how he loves me. 

The last time I've seen Bryan I was 17, and a senior in High school. I only went to youth group for a short amount of my senior year and stopped going after October. During a high school football game I ran into Bryan, I hadn't seen him since he left youth group. He gave me 2 hugs during the first three minutes of interacting with him. He asked if i wanted to go to the snack bar with him, I agreed to go. The whole time he complemented me on how good I looked. He then offered to buy me food, I asked for a Coke. When I thanked him he said ""your welcome, I want to buy you more things"" then hugged me. When I got home he texted me saying how great it was to see me and how he would like to continue seeing me with many heart emoji's. I've seen him once after that at yet another Halloween event (which he wasn't with youth group). He texted me to hangout with him at that Halloween church event and I did. It was very awkward and I knew something wasn't right. Again he complemented and took selfies with me. Bryan talked to me as if there wasn't an big age gap between us. After I left he as always texted me how nice it was to see me. I felt guilty and disturbed after. 

Bryan still has my number but now chooses to message me through Snap chat. To this day he still texts me randomly and even comments on my selfies. Although, I haven't had a conversation with him since the last time I've seen him. 

Now during the four years I interacted with him Bryan NEVER touched me. Bryan NEVER asked for anything sexual from me. Was Bryan just friendly or was he too friendly? I'm not sure if I'm just over thinking this. I knew something was off with Bryan but I allowed him to get close to me. I think maybe out of lack of attention I lead him on. I would brag to my friends how Bryan would text me and how he was nice to me. I feel embarrassed by this now and guilty how I went about this. My two friends knew everything that happen but we just joked around about it.  I am now 18 and think about this a lot. I never told anyone about this so I'm not sure about other peoples thoughts on this.  I've missed so many other details but this post is long enough. Am I over thinking this?",06Sep2019,6

She gave me great advice as I told her my life story and my struggles with my life and the relationship. 

Fast forward, I made the decision to end the relationship. However, I feel that my boss is taking his side. She is constantly liking his Facebook statuses where he is “moving on” and “realized he deserves better”. He posts for attention that he lost 40 lbs at the gym, she liked it.  I don’t get any feedback from her whatsoever nowadays on my page. I posted that I graduated, and accomplished so many things and nothing (she usually likes everything her employees post). It’s unlike her. I can’t help but feel betrayed and like I did something wrong.

168,"Hey all. I'm in a bit of a pickle.  (TW for abuse) 


I (20F) am supposed to graduate college next semester, and I'm being pressured to come home after graduation. Going home would most likely put me in an early grave. 

I have 2 sexually abusive brothers (albeit, one's moved out but the other just came back from college), an older sister who moved as soon as she could and refuses to come back (not that I blame her), and 2 physically and emotionally abusive parents (including a hoarder for a mom) with no sense of boundaries. I've already attempted suicide once while I was there, I'm reaaaally trying not to do it again. 

I moved away from home for college, and a lot of things quickly went wrong. I was sexually assaulted exactly a week after I got to college freshman year, and a lot seems to have gone downhill since. I haven't really stopped to take a break for the past four years and I've working multiple jobs to make ends meet and start paying off loans as quickly as I can.  (The only way I could take a semblance of a break would be going back to that hellhole. I came back for a small visit last week and left with a viral infection and more anxiety).  

I was diagnosed with PTSD last year and depersonalization this year and I've been going to therapy, but the thought of going back after graduating is really impeding my progress. I had a low moment earlier this year where I went to a bridge near my apartment and debated jumping off because I was so tired of scared of everything. I'm so fucking scared. 

I'm almost out of school, but my GPA is mediocre. I wanted to go to grad school but I can't do that in the near future, not until I get myself together and actually show I can do a program successfully. I keep having anxiety attacks over my future, and I'm so scared that I don't have it in me to keep trying.

172,"Hi. So this may be a long one, but I honestly just need to get it off my chest and hopefully I’ll find some answers.

I joined a discord server maybe 3 months ago, and ended up meeting someone through that server. I began to talk to them more and more until it was discovered we liked each other. We were already aware that it was sort of dumb, especially with the server being filled to the brim with e-daters, but we decided to give it a shot anyways.

He was patient with my anxiety about things, helped me have a little more self confidence in my appearance, and was overall a great boyfriend, though there was one glaring issue that he seemed to have noticed as well. The love was unbalanced. I felt like I couldn’t always say “I love you” and the guilt for that was intense. I thought maybe that was a sign the relationship just wouldn’t work. The thing that really made me decide to break up with him was when I talked to another guy, just about school and life, and felt like I was attracted to him. So the day after that I was just trying to figure out if I should break up with him because of all these things. I felt disgusting for having feelings for anyone else. And I missed the freedom of being single and not being ashamed of yourself for thinking a guy is just cute. And so, the day after all that stress, at about 8 pm, I broke up with him. I listed other reasons too, like the distance and what the future would hold, but the main ones were the things listed above.

Once I left him, I just felt sad. I know a breakup is supposed to be hard, but I didn’t expect that. It’s been a month or so since the breakup happened and I still feel like I may have feelings for him. Me and him started talking again and I just feel like it’s all gotten so complex. I know I can’t be with him because it’ll most likely end up not working out and hurting him, but by talking to him, am I hurting him anyways? He has admitted to still having feelings, and I really just wanna make the right choice.

I honestly feel a lot better after typing this all out. And I’m sorry if this all sounds really stupid, especially it being an online relationship. But if anyone has advice on what to do, please comment. Thank you!",06Sep2019,1

It was a neighborhood full of empty trailers, and then I figured, Oniontown is a dead end, and the man down the street, his face was covered in intrigue and dark black canker sores. the dishes were dirty as the Collyers and it was time for adventure, intrigue, and excitement. here in oniontown? Of course, the mail. So i write to Nicolas Sequeira at 1424 Columbine St #1 in the idyllic almost heavenly suburb of Denver, Colorado, and then I had heard the rumors, you know, how couldn't I have? Don't send in for these comics. And yet I was bored out of my head in this broken neighborhood, so I sent in my money. The envelope came back a day later. I opened it up. It was empty, no comics, I should have known, everybody said it was scam. No wait, there was a leg sticking out, a little blood on the flap and a leg sticking out, the leg protruded even further, and now good lord a whole hand ripped from the envelope, and now a face full of teeth, a somewhat angelic face. It was a nude fellow with no clothes on, and he came from the envelope and asked me if I wanted to play a game of cribbage and I said no, you just came out of my envelope and even then we don't have cribbage in oniontown. this fellow was nude! Now he shapeshifts into Pennywise, the scary clown, with red makeup and his eyes looked like Fred Flintstones. each eye looked like Fred Flintstone, and his hands was named georg and Bill. And he says ""Please float my paper boat"". I said OK and reached for his balloon but he bites my arm and then he LAUGHED and said ""Prankd u bruh"" and then he gave me the Nicolas Comics and now I'm in the hospital and I'm missing an arm but at least I got my comic. if you want a Nicolas Comics, don't write for it, its not worth the hassle because a nude fellow will pop from the envelope andf then turn into Pennywizz the dancing clown. hes called that because he wizzes on you after he kills you, I dont know its kind of weird. OK bye

OK wait that was too short so I need to give you a bit more info about Nicolas Comics. basically the comic which Pennywise gave me is College Buddies, which is stick figure with dum joke and it sucks and I know that you asked where Oniontown is, the answer is it's a suburb of Seattle and I smell like carrots now that Pennywise has gripped my flesh. Also in case you're wondering if I'm going to sue the demon clown I'm not going to because in retrospect it was a pretty dope prank but I still think nicolas comicis rather sketch, and if a nude fellow come out of your envelope it could be Pennywise but its probably not so thanks for listening to this story I swaer it was real it really happened to me, and remember DO NOT write for Nicolas Comics",06Sep2019,0

Anyway, I leave the front door unlocked on accident. And I wake up the next morning to a text from my mom saying that she was going to scare me by waking me up with a gun in my face and wearing a mask so I didn't forget again. Never mind the fact that I have someone else's child sleeping in my bed that does NOT deserve to be threatened like this. 

I bring this up to my father, and tell him that it was a little more terrifying than I think they meant it to be, to which he gets directly in my face Ana replies—very loudly, directly in my face—with something along the lines of ""Fuck you. You're not going to tell me what to do in my house."" This man has seen firsthand how yelling absolutely breaks me down. I shut down and shake and cry. He knew this, and still did it. And I swear, I saw this man smile when I started shaking. 

It's been about a week and a half since the whole gun incident, and looking at my parents makes me anxious. And then I get in trouble for not talking to them, as it's seen as ""having an attitude.""

182,"So.

This will probably need a TLDR but i need to put it all out there. For as long as i can remember i have been unmotivated about my goals, my dreams and my improvement. Ever since early high school i never tried, i could barely study if at all i never put in 100% and i skimmed by on average results on most, some bad results and some very good results in my academics. I was very passive and never stood up for myself when it came to people. I had friends and social life but i could never balance what i needed to do to achieve my dreams and going with the group. I just wanted to please.

Fast forward 4 years after a pretty bad breakup with a long term girlfriend and a whole lot of bad decisions, lieing, destructive,unproductive behavior and finally self-reflection i decided to change.

I went to GP because i thought i saw pretty clear signs of something being very wrong, I took advice from self-help books, talkers and the people around me and tried to put in small good habits. It had mixed results but a big shock after consulting a psychiatrist  was the diagnosis of ADHD focusing on the inattentiveness part to be specific.

I had treatment in the form of medication and small amounts of therapy and for the past 3 months iv'e noticed massive changes in myself and my work ethic in terms of my goals, my job and my future. I can see myself improving.

Now onto the self created hole. I lied to please my parents, my girlfriend, my friends. i told them i did well in uni(college) even though i failed and dropped out of my first year. I said i'm on a career path for STEM( my dream) when i clearly have not been and i haven't even told anyone about my diagnosis. I NEED TO FIX THIS.

Do i just sit them down and tell my situation? Do i keep working towards my goals which i am now by currently going back to studying until i can show them my progress or do i keep up this veneer of doing great?

I'm guessing you're wondering how somehow could lie about so much and such important stuff. I wanted people to not look at me like a disappointment, I didn't want people to pity me or feel like they need to help me. And i was a coward and couldn't face the truth. Help.",06Sep2019,1

However, when im not horny i do not like wearing thongs and regret wearing it when i was horny. however, it has been years and everytime after im not horny and decide to throw out my thongs i end up buying and wearing thongs eventually the next week or the next next week. I am basically in denial about that i like wearing panties so when im horny as fuck i feel good about wearing it but when im not horny and more sober or level headed i hate that i wear thongs and wanna throw them out. 

Should i just own the fact that i will never stop wanting to wear women panties and just wear thongs all the time even when im not horny just to get used to it and kind of accept it?",06Sep2019,1
187,"This is going to take a bit of explaining: I am in my final semester of college about to graduate with my graduate degree in taxation accounting, I need to take the 4 parts of the CPA exam in order to be a CPA. I also have to take a class where you just take the CPA and do nothing else, they encourage you NOT TO WORK AT ALL COSTS during this period. I had a co-worker tell me that he took the class while working full time and maintaining his family. So I tell my boss I’ll work full time while doing this. Come to find out my coworker “took” the class but because he had already taken multiple parts of the CPA he didn’t have to attend the class or do any of the assignments at all. He essentially lied to me to get me to come back early so he can push more of his work on me. Also I can’t say no when someone hands me work because I’m the literal bottom of the totem pole until (if) we get an intern or I work up but this problem will be resolved by then. I emailed my prof asking what he thinks I should do hoping he will be lenient and say “prove to me that you’re working and you can go at a pace that works for you”. Wishful thinking. He says “work less, everyone who works struggles in this class.” Final problem to add onto this cluster of problems; I have a disease in which when I get stressed out I start violently vomiting until I am either given a ton more medicine or I die. That’s an oversimplification of my disease but if you want the gritty details just look up Primary Adrenal Insufficiency (that’s the disease type) and then if you want to know more about the vomiting episodes look up “adrenal crisis” which is what happens to me when I get too stressed out (last time it happened I worked tax season and took two undergrad classes). I’ve been back to work for three days now and I’ve already fallen behind my study schedule and also had three break downs/panic attacks. I don’t want to reneg on my boss since he’s been nothing but amazing (and I mean AMAZING) to me since I started working there (this is not the guy that lied to me about being able to handle the situation I’m in right now). I don’t want to let him down, it’s the absolute last thing I could ever want and he was so happy I was coming back to work. Thinking about disappointing him is making me want to cry. I’ve been waking up at 3 am every morning to get some studying in but I’ve so exhausted I’m not learning anything. The final tax returns that are due are due on October 15th, meaning I PROBABLY won’t have much work and I PROBABLY will get to study a lot during work.

188,"Financial situation: Currently have a community college subsidized loan offer of $5,500 for the fall and spring semesters, I already have $2,839 in both subsidized and unsubsidized loans from a previous school. I don’t know wether I want to take out another another $2,750 for a semester and then try to pay next semesters all out of pocket or just take some time off and save money this semester

Background and emotions: I’m 20 y/o and have already taken a year off of school. However I’ve been pondering the idea of taking a year off, maybe two to move out of state before I continue my education, I currently have 21 “transferrable credits” to most public universities in my state and a few bordering states. A year off would give me time to get my money together and make the move, and another year off would allow me better financial aid packages, as well as qualifying for in-state tuition. I have no obligations to my hometown other than most of my family , my dog and new car. Im tired of being here &amp; don’t want to stay any longer than I have to.
My parents are saying stay take out the loan and get my assoc before moving . I however would like to use this time to save money and try to pay off all my student loans before I move,

Questions: 
1.) is this even remotely reasonable, did anyone try this and succeed or fail? How do I go about preparing myself for financial independence as well as simultaneously attending college
3.) if I were to move would it be worth it to take the community college route or should i just go straight for a university ?",06Sep2019,1

192,"Hi!

I'm in an awkward position.  

I am a member of a committee that is very prestigious in my field, and through this I was elected the Vice chair of a program that is run through this organization on a nationwide level.  My employer was required in both cases to submit consent/support to allow it but otherwise does not offer support (they do not necessarily pay for me to attend conferences or committee meetings, these are things I do on my own - they just ""allow"" me to be on the committee).  At my present level, it is unusual to be on these types of committees, but not unusual to have to fund yourself to go to these meetings or other conferences. 

My company allows me to do these things, but these committees, while generically looking good that we are ""involved"", are not in areas that my company prioritizes. 

Very soom I am attending the annual conference for my industry's largest/most important conference.  This is also the organization where I am on the committee and Vice chair of a program.  I am paying for myself to go to the committee meeting portion of the conference.   For the program I am a part of, both myself and the Chair are quite new to our roles.  Following the committee meeting, there is a session for our program for all the stakeholders in the industry.  It is the first time this has ever been planned.  As it is the first, the Chair of my committee will be primarily hosting the meeting, but it is a chance for the shareholders to bring up questions,  concerns, and discuss the goals we have laid out for our program, as well as meeting the program chair and I.

Today, the President of my company discovered I was going to the conference.  He invited me to attend a closed-door meeting relating to our company and our certification with the industry leaders and heads of this organization.  This is normally a meeting only attended by upper management. I would be observing, but this is an honor not typically involving people at my level.

Presently, I have been offered another important role to be Chair of a program through my committee and this organization.  I will need the President of my company's approval.  He will likely find out within the next 2 weeks, if not before the conference.   The person offering me this position (on my committee) is who is leading the planning and goal setting meeting for the program I am Vice chair of now.

Unfortunately, I just learned these meeting are at exactly the same time.

I have no idea what impact declining the President's invite would be.  I personally have a lot invested in the program planning and goals meeting, and would actively be participating (while also learning how to co-host these meetings).  If I were to tell the other two people hosting this program meeting why I had to miss it, they would 100% understand the importance of the other meeting (just perhaps not my involvement, but it would not be questioned).  The program meeting would 100% benefit me personally more and my current role, but I feel there are politics at play with schmoozing my company's president at the other.

So, which is better to attend?",06Sep2019,1
193,"Soooooo... I was seeing this super charming guy and he wanted me to get tested before smashing. I had just gotten out a relationship where I got cheated on and I actually have never been tested but have been practicing safe sex etc but after that I knew it was probably time. Better safe than sorry.. anyway I told him I was clean because honestly I didn’t think we’d have sex any time soon and I wasn’t planning on getting with him quick either so I guess I was goin to get rested behind his back and make it my business to do so, not because someone asked me to, to have sex . So one night we kiss and we get drunk and we have sex. Thankfully he brought a condom but I also gave him head no condom. I got tested because that night I told him I hadn’t got tested before we did it cause I guess I felt bad and what not but I had told him before we had sex. That night was really blurry and I also blacked out. Anyway. Fast forward I get my results and I am positive Chlamydia anal and urine. So I tell him today, found out yesterday but really wanted to tell him in person. I realized it was better to just say it before more days start to add up so I message him today telling him. I send him a pic and an apology explaining blah blah and he’s upset and starts saying I’m an idiot idk what, so of course that’s his reaction I honestly feel the same because if I feel gross I can just imagine how he feels. So he then said “So ima stop talking to you.” and then deleted me off snapchat, (we only have each other on there) and I didn’t bother replying or begging for him. I said I was sorry, did my best and I just thought he wants his space and doesn’t wanna have anything to do with me anymore which is fine I get it and I respect that no matter how much I was into him. But now he added me back few hours later and just texted me “I’m so angry, not even at you” So I just know what that means. Angry at himself for doing it and letting his guard down. I answer him yeah I’m honestly embarrassed and he says “ It’s fine it happens. Not to me tho honestly” 
Dude all those feelings are valid, I get that. But I have no one to dump my feelings to. Yea, I gave it to him, unknowingly but also it was fucked up. I don’t know, is he still considering to see me after this? The fact he kept messaging me and asking me to get tested even after finding out I *sadly* lied. I feel terrible and embarrassed but I also haven’t been put into this situation and always am On the side he’s in usually forgiving the other but deep down I know it’s not right what I did. I guess I just want someone else to validate what I’m saying. I hope he still wants to see me but at the same time I hope he has self respect and doesn’t wanna talk to me anymore. Sigh. 

  SORRY FOR THE FORMAT. i’m on my phone. 


TL;DR - give unknowingly a guy an STI after lying about being tested thinking I was clean. get tested have chlamydia, is super upset then tells me he doesn’t want to talk to me anymore, deletes me off our only communication system then hours later adds me back to tell me how angry he is. and that it happens to people but not him. What’s his deal? He should just get rid of me huh?",06Sep2019,1

199,"I just moved into a new house with some people I had not previously known. I have only been in abusive households or lonely households before, as well as I have not had a lot of experience in friendships in relationships, so perhaps this is why I am confused.

Roomate # 1 is a little moody, but appears to be generally kind and just pretty fucked up. Roomate #2 is chill, not very talkative, and knows roomate #1's gf. Does not have beef with her.
 

Roomate #1  has an apparently crazy ex gf. I met her, she seems kind but unstable, but no evidence of abuse. She is friends with roomate #2. She and roomate #2 decided to hang out with roomate #2 in his bedroom in roomate #1 - her ex gf who is claiming she is abusive -'s house without his knowing. After all, they are friends and allowed to hang out. Apparently roomate #2 did not know of the seriousness of their ex-relationship/ does not care about drama.

Ex gf came by three nights ago. Roomate #1 was furious and triggered- how dare ex gf use his roomate to get into his house and get on his nerves? That is what he thought. Roomate #1 raised voice and made her leave house. Roomate #2 confused, ex gd says he is my friend, I want to hang out. 

Roomate #1 blames ex gf for triggering emotions and ruining mood. Is mad and grumpy. Talks about how perhaps roomate #2 shouldn't be living here anymore since so accommodating to ex gf and other small issues.

My question is this: is it reasonable for roomate #1 (legal owner of house) to make ex gf leave even though ex gf came to see his roomate and hang out with him alone? Or is it not? 

Is it possible that both roomate #1 and ex gf are abusive? Should I stay living here?

I am worried because what if he decides to go all moody and not want me to live here anymore and then I'll be kicked out in the middle of the semester with no family to go to. I am worried that he will not like me staying in my room a lot because he says he enjoys and needs to have people around, and I will not be doing that forever as I like to be alone a lot.

I wanted to study business, then computer science, and now it's life sciences. I don't even know if I really want to do it anymore. My ultamite goal is to become a lawyer but I have no idea what majors I should take to get there. I love learning about science, but I am in no way good at it. I'm not bad but I don't think I have a uni level skill. I have been tempted to take a more artsy route like philosophy, psychology, political science, etc. to become a lawyer 

So what I'm basically asking is should I continue on this science path I paved for myself or should I burn my bridges to take an art degree, which I know I will be better at. My only fear is if I don't get into law school I am pretty much screwed as these types of courses don't tend to get many jobs. Science would be a better fall-back in case things don't work out.

202,"I've been playing football (american tackle) for 4 years now, and have been bench 1 year, starter the next year, bench half the season, then starter the rest. This season has really started slow for me, but I got on my horse and have been doing pretty good recently. But one problem almost every athlete has is the coaches. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now that we're in the regular season, all the 2nd and 3rd team players are trying real hard to earn their spot. I'm on the 2nd team offense, and 2nd team defense, and after 4 years of experience, blood sweat and tears, I can officially say, I don't know what I'm doing wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today we had a normal practice, conditioning, hitting, plays, team drills, etc. We have some talent in our lineman core this year, so we have a lot of competition going on. The practice starts off normal as usual, going through our regular conditioning drills etc. 

We got to the point where we where going through some individual position drills.

Were going through a pass rush drill, where O-Linemen are down, and 3 D-Linemen are down with 1 linebacker. 

I'm lined up as an O tackle

First play, the end doesn't even move an inch towards the backfield.

Second play, I downblock on a defensive tackle and our double team sends him falling over.

Third play, A defensive linemen who has been a backup for a while, but started a few games last year, barely gets past the O-linemen, but the coach is cheering him on.

Fourth play, I pancake one of the starters (he wasn't that good) but the coach doesn't say anything.

Fifth play, I'm holding a block against a D-lineman while one of our starting O-Linemen pushes the D-Lineman all the way back.

Sixth Play, The defensive end gets past me after I hold him in the front line for about 4 seconds, and the coach starts talking about how I need to be better and that I'm on the second team for a reason.

Seventh Play, I chip up to the linebacker and force him outside of the play

Eight play, I'm set up, but coach ends the drill

&amp;#x200B;

It get's much worse by the way.

&amp;#x200B;

We start heading into a live team session, and we are told to go full on, except it's thud.

One of my buddies was getting beat up real bad by one of our star O-Linemen, so I went in to take him out and give him a breather.

So I step in, and coach looks at me for a few seconds, then switches me out for a 3rd string d-tackle

I'm pretty mad at this point, so I start cussing under my breath, and just try and brush it off.

Coach asks for a d-tackle, which would be me, so I run in.

Coach instead calls in the kid I was talking about from earlier who was the new 2nd stringer.

I'm more pissed than before, and now I'm visibly mad. I quickly responded with a ""Gotta be f\*\*\*ing kidding me..."" under my breath, to make sure that they don't hears it.

The second stringer gets demolished, pancaked twice, thrown to the ground, etc. 

The second stringer, who I forgot to mention, was my friend, comes back and I tell him ""You got demolished dude."" in a joking way.

Me and him laugh a bit, and coach finally calls my name.

I finally get my name called, and I head in with no fear in my mind.

First play, I break through the line and ALMOST got a sack. (Almost 1 second late)

Second play, I hold my ground with the O-lineman (the good one) and split off to meet the running back in the A gap

Third play, I break through again, and tap the quarterback, ALMOST GETTING A SACK AGAIN!

Fourth play, I push forward and me and the O-lineman just stick together

Fifth play, I break through the line and meet the runningback

Right after that play, coach tells me I need to ""show more contact"" and ""be more physical""

203,As the title states I deal with extreme social anxiety. I think it stemmed from past issues with my partner and although we are trying to work on our relationship I can’t help but to feel like I’m not fully healed from emotional trauma and I get when your angry you do get to name calling but he would always bring up my weight. To the point where mentally in my mind I thought I was just too gross and fat to go out in public. I would start contemplating about going out because I was so fat. And that’s the first thing people see. I am losing weight though I’m not as heavy anymore it still affects me to this day. I’ve gone from 240 to 181 and I still feel so fat. I wear big clothes and cover my arms and when people stare at me at work I feel like I’m being judged and it’s a very stressful feeling.  I do quality control checks. At first they had me working this station that wasn’t too bad there was at most 13 people working there and I was okay with it but recently they moved me to the main floor where there’s 100+ people in there. Even going to my car is so scary to me because my anxiety. I want to mention it to my boss but I feel like she’s going to judge me because it’s not something I like saying I have. I know I don’t deserve special treatment but sometimes I feel like crying because I start hyperventilating when I pass a line of people and they stare to see what I’m doing when it’s nothing new and do it literally every 30 minutes. Plus it’s gotten to the point where I can’t even make eye contact cuz that makes me scared. I am scared to make eye contact with people and I’m not even sure if that’s normal. I just know I feel so jittery because my anxiety and I’m scared I’m going insane like that one lady in shameless where she didn’t step out her house like I’m scared my social anxiety is what’s preventing me from being successful and no I haven’t sought out treatment as I’m broke but I hope to one day be able to get it as it’s seriously ruining my life.

As a background, I've worked at this job for a long enough time that I've survived numerous firing cycles. I am competent in the position, if not above average (I was considered for a team leader position, but said I would prefer not to be considered as I didn't want the additional responsibilities). I also work a specific block that is historically hard to fill and maintain. They periodically employ temps to supplement the team (I was originally hired as a temp), and I recently found out that the new crop is being paid comparable to my current wage w/o benefits, most likely for retention purposes. Upper ceiling for my position is around double where I currently am.

Should I bring up my desired number before the review? There isn't usually much formal feedback beyond ""good job"" and ""here's how much of a bump you're getting.""

If you've seen the recent movie goodbyes, it's pretty damm close, except we all met in hs and none of us sing. Those 3 personality types are super damm close to us now. But growing up I didnt have many friends, I was the super poor kid who got bullied alot, father died and mother worked 3 jobs, so of course I was weird. It wasnt until i met them in hs that i really started to grow into my own. But now lifes moving on, were seeing less and less of each other. We love each other to death and we always talked about moving in together, going to each others weddings, being godparents and the typical stupid shit bros do. 

But with time moving on, and us all having our own things were branching out. I know it was gonna happen, we had our own paths to take, and I know they're gonna do well, I'm proud of all that they've done. We just saw the movie today and laughed like hell because of how relatable it was, but then we just came out feeling super fucking depressed. 

I guess for advice, idk. They're the only real friends I've ever had that didnt treat me like shit. They brought me out of a real sad place as a kid. I'm sure well still be friends as we get older, but you know distance and life has a way of keeping free time short.

We have a rough dynamic, and trust is very thin.

She has invited me over to her house when her parents are not home, and my brother and sister-in-law would have happily let me go, if it wasn't for my mother. She is a very controlling mother, and my relationship with her has always been rocky. We would have to have a very long conversation with her, and it would have taken weeks. So, my girlfriend came over. Although, it just so happens that day my brother came home early from work. He walked in on me and her half naked, and immediately told me to call my mom (who lives about 30 minutes away) to pick me up and to take me home. He also told my girlfriend to call someone to pick her up.

So, I waited outside with my girlfriend while she called her Uber. When I came back in, I was immediately apologetic and asked to talk with my brother. He was really upset, and told me to go to my room while my sister-in-law came back. She came back, and she sat me and my brother down, and began to ask me questions. She said they both felt taken advantage of, and did not know if I had just always been lying and began questioning if the ""progress"" we were making was progress at all. I explained my thought process, which was that my depression, anxiety, and self-deteriorating actions have made me always think that I have nothing to lose. This, coupled with the fact that teenagers do this sort of thing all the time, caused me to not think through my decisions.

They are not angry or upset at my girlfriend, they are focused on me and my lying and sneaking around. They are okay with me having sex, but it is the fact that I lied and snuck around that is angering them. I have no clue what to do. Is there anything at all that can possibly help my situation, Reddit? I am going insane being stuck in my room. Thanks.",06Sep2019,2
211,"So I just started studying at a big and famous school where the community is full of competitiveness and selfishness, I hated it so much. I felt like the dumbest student in the class even though at my previous small school I was an honor student but the community there is helping each other out to get higher grades. My concern here is what is better for my college application form? To continue studying at my school today but lower grades or to study in a smaller school but higher grades?",06Sep2019,1

What should I do to make sure I am successful? Should I approach someone or are there things I can do to be approached?

213,"To clarify, this position involves working with youth and delivering supplemental programming to them. I was responsible for developing and delivering program and curriculum in multiple categories and subjects. I LOVED the job and my heart was in it fully, but the position I was in at the time made it difficult to maintain with full functionality (for both myself and the others in my same position) and healthy mental conscience considering the allotted hours and scheduling. This new open position is more clerical and administrative, which is more in my comfort zone anyway.

214,"Throwaway because my coworkers know my main. My workplace is an absolute shitshow, but I’m not quitting because I need income and I don’t have other opportunities right now(doesn’t mean I’m not looking) my boss, who’s a high level VP managing a handful of managers has decided that yet again, after only three months of her previous reorg is going to reorg again and place me under my friend, let’s call her Ana, who recently was removed from multiple projects and cannot manage an existing team. Ana called me today after work and told me that our boss has told her that tomorrow, boss is going to tell me that I’m going to now managed by Ana. I was like “what does that mean” and Ana goes, “well I guess that means I’m going to approve your time cards” LOL WHAT. 

Even better is the fact that Ana’s not getting a promotion, I’m just being shoved under her in the hierarchy so I guess I’m getting a demotion? We have always technically been at the same level, and our coworkers and high level VP’s are more likely to approach me than her because she has the tendency to get stressed and be mean to people. I’m frustrated, I’m mad, and Ana’s a terrible person for communicating the way she did. Ana knows I need time to process so I’m sure she thought she was doing me a favor but I feel like burning the world right now. This company, on an ongoing basis has shoved me though 3 different managers and 3 different jobs in my time here. I was finally getting my bearings and leading my own team and now this??

I don’t know how to approach the situation, I don’t know what to say to my boss, and I don’t want to sound petty, but Ana’s not good at her job, gets stressed easily and likes to lash out at people to the point where the company has had to talk to her about the way she talks to people. 

Does anyone have any advice on how I can communicate to my boss or steps I can take to make my life easier for a moment?

TL;DR: shitty company I can’t quit is putting my direct coworker with the tendency to fly off the handle as my manager without promoting said coworker. How do I communicate that she’s incompetent without being a bitch or sounding petty?",06Sep2019,1

-I tapped a wall in a parking garage with my license plate and on a separate occasion backed into a wall, both left little to no damage 

- Most recent one I was working a car event and when I was pulling out the Jeep tire scrapped the wall. I’m not used to driving trucks or in tight spots so I felt really dumb.

It's kind of disheartening to realize that accidentally offending someone was because I had no filter.

But the recourse in my mind to fix this is always to not say anything. so it's always been a difficult to find the median between that talking and not talking. I think being 26 is kind of sad and disheartening again to realize I don't have a filter and I don't know what's the best way to adjust my behavior.

222,"Hey. I’m starting a new year in high school and I had chose Choir as a choice of elective. I was excited at first, I even asked a friend to recommend me so that my chances of getting in were higher. I was happy and looking forward to enjoying the class with other friends. But..The first day I went to class, I was completely alone, none of my friends were in the class. I was just surrounded by only the “popular” “cool” kids. I had a lot of people in the class who I also had bad history. This made my level of anxiety high throughout the entire class. I stuttered multiple times when speaking in front of the class. I messed up so many times that during the majority of the class I was just thinking “Oh god I wanna crawl into my bed and just cry” . I’m even surprised that nobody made fun of me. After that class, my head has been hurting really badly too. I get sharp pains at my temples. They’re really annoying and distracting since I have classes after choir. Even right now, talking about it has made my head begin to hurt again. My friend suggested I speak to the counselor about it during choir, but the thing is that I chose to take choir. My other teacher has told me and others that you cannot show up out of the blue to the office without an error in your classes/schedule. The last day of changing schedules is also TOMORROW.. I don’t even know what I’m going to be changing choir to. My friend also recommended me to the teacher.. If I were to switch out, it might cause the teacher to think bad of my friend. I don’t want that... I just can’t survive another class. Yes, it may sound exaggerated and maybe it is, but experiencing it is a lot worse than hearing about it. Any advice??

229,"Let me start off with saying that I’m 17 turning 18 years old very soon and I have read online that I cannot be diagnosed for psychopathy or sociopathy due to the brain still developing at my age. I understand this but I have always wondered why people react the way they do when something happens. I witness people crying and experiencing happiness and I can’t understand it. The only things I’ve cried for are myself because I felt like it was right to do. I enjoy getting reactions out of people and seeing them in a state of panic/emotional distress. I don’t remember my childhood very well but I do remember my father leaving me and how I would fight my mom, sisters, and brothers because they got in my way. I had a very short temper and would go into rage and often was beat for it. I remember how I wanted to get revenge by murdering my family. I would get suspended from school weekly and never knew what I did wrong. I don’t feel remorse for any bad actions I commit but in order to satify people I fake my apologies and act like I care in order to get what I want. I have a lot more control over my behavior now but when I get angry all I feel like doing is getting rid of the person. I don’t want to throw away my life so I don’t act, but I probably would if there were no laws.

Backstory:

My school is k-12 and i'm in grade 10. ( our chill is only around 250 students) during our breaks, it's also Pre-k through first grade's recess, and i'm the ""teachers aide"" you could say. There's only about 15-25 kids in the small play area ( monkey bars, different shaped ladders and a twisty slide) . I'm not alone with them during recess, always with Ms. X*. 
Ms. X is the schoolwide teachers aide and substitute teacher. She's from boston and she does NOT fuck around. she's also a bit intimidating to smaller kids and 99% of them listen to her, since her voice is  a bit raspy and loud/commanding but if you stay on her good side she's funny and nice.  I've stayed at this school since kindergarten, like most of my classmates and we have all learned to respect her.  Once a week, another teachers aide, Ms. W* , Is firm but nice. haven't had too much conflict with her.

Story:
This year, a new kid ( Wyatt*) has joined the first grade class. A few weeks ago in the second week of school, i remember Ms X benching him, and he would get up and run around even  after ms X yelled at him. i brushed it off as "" he's new and probably a little iffy here."" but no. 
he's the spawn of satan himself.
Last week, he wouldn't go down the slide butt first, which i scolded him about a few times. 

This week, he started going down the slide either 
A. head first 
B. with 4 other kids
C. forcefully dragging other kids down with him 
D. walking up the slide while other kids are going down 
E. All of the above.
Last week, it would be me saying "" please don't do that"" and then call Ms X over and he would stop.  

Today was the worst. He tried to go down the slide and make a "" traffic jam"" numerous times and i've told the other kids the "" slide rules"" ( butt first, one at a time, don't go up or wait at the bottom) and most of them have listened with the exception of a few kids who got it the second time.  

Today, Wyatt was going on the monkey bars the wrong way, and running into others on the monkey bars. Ms X was watching but letting me handle it. 
Conversation:
M: Hi wyatt, you're supposed to go on the monkey bars the other way please.
W: i'm practicing
M: that's fine, would you like me to show you where to start? 
I gestured for him to come over and start at the right end so he doesn't bother or hurt anyone else, and he started making a high pitched scream and hitting the play structure platform. 
I let him "" cool down"" and he was tired of the monkey bars.

Next, Wyatt decided to terrorize some T-K ( transitional kindergarten/ preschool) kids. He regularly forces kids to go down the slide with him and will hold onto their feet, dragging them down or pulling their shoes off.
Today he tried to do it to Max*, whom i babysit and is my family friend. He's a little sweetheart and never starts fights, and he's shorter/smaller  than the other kids. he's also a little too nice and doesn't know when to say no. Wyatt uses this to his advantage. Wyatt will drag Max down the slide and pull on his legs. Today he tried it with a little boy similar to Max, ( let's call him Sam) but i'm not close with sam's family. Also, sam is aware that he can say no or that he can disagree.
Conversation/ what happened
Wyatt does his routine, going down the slide but at the last minute before going down, he grabs whoever is behind him in the slide lines ankles and just drags them down. Wyatt tried to do this to Sam, but sam kept saying "" Stop, you're hurting me,"" etc. I s
Ms W. comes closer and both of us tells Wyatt to stop and let go. Wyatt tries to say "" oh but i need him with me"" and i basically told him "" no, one on the slide at a time. Sam decided to crawl back up the slide and put his shoe back on, but wyatt stops mid-slide and starts screaming and hooting and hollering none sense, and then the  bell rings and i have to go to the next class

One day me and James are hanging out to get smoothies and he just grabs my hand and starts holding it ok I thought it was weird but I went with it. Fast forward It’s summer so around the beginning of July on my bday I’m talking to him over the phone because he’s out of town and I’m telling him about how 2 girls sent me nudes and then he acts if he doesn’t believe me and asks all these questions and wants to know there Snapchats ok. Later in August the day after we hung out he has a gf now ig they’ve been talking for a minute they’ve been on and off a lot according to them but they come to my house I’m barefoot but I walk down the street with them and we are sitting at the end of my street and I say as a joke “bet I can’t suck your toes” I was joking he took his socks and shoes off and I didn’t do anything but he says to me “hey look at those people over there” and my toe is in his mouth ok cool. I’m not gonna lie to you Guys I got a boner that moment was not only I questioned my sexuality but I questioned his as well.

We head outside me James and Monica are all chilling on my deck with my karaoke machine and idk how James got a hold of my hand but he just started feeling it and complementing how soft they were. On the mics he would say “bro let’s make out” or “bro let’s kiss” I play it off as he’s joking but nope because now we have the fire going music playing and he pins me to the ground and starts kissing me repeatedly my friend Anna just shows up and records videos of James grinding on me and a video of him proposing to me and kissing my hand so all that calms down and so now I’m recording a video and it’s random and after James comes behind me and starts kissing my cheek on the camera y’all I shit you not the look in his eyes is what got me if I could show you guys I would but he starts kinda above my neck and moves up looks at the camera and does it again twice and I kinda liked it we go to my driveway and was like “lemme get some pics of your cute ass” and then we are star gazing and he asks to hold my hand now his gf shows up and he kinda chilled the rest of the night but he gave me a kiss on the lips and asked me how was it and he was deadass serious not even joking looking right at me when we were sitting at the fire. Now recently he’s been busy and not active on social media but when he is he doesn’t text me and leaves me on read like I get we have our own lives but he’s been avoiding me and it’s like I really kinda like him now it all felt good I’m just wondering what should I do he has a girlfriend despite everything he did with me now my heart warms every time I think about him or just look at pictures",06Sep2019,1

My mom has never been the best mom. She went back to back with boyfriends after my dad and her separated when I was 3. Half of her exs were psychos. The last one gave us PTSD from 7 years of mental and psychological abuse. It eventually came to an end though.  


 Now a new problem arises: New place, she decided to take in a friend in need who turned out to be a crack abuser and a violent, 7ft, 300 pound guy. She also brought in her new boyfriend (good guy afaik) but he decided to convice my mom to bring in his friend, a weed dealer. He has a dog and he shits all over the backyard and he never once picked it up. I was in college back then but I quit because it was all too much. Shit was getting worst and worst up to the point where I could not stand living there anymore, so I move. More or less naked.  


Now in a new city, sleeping in the living room of a friend who does have a room for me but I don't have the rent for it.  
I tried looking for a job... In three months I got nothing.  
I tried looking for welfare.... They denied me because I need proof that my mother is on welfare ( which she is, but refuses to give me the proof I need)  


Right now our internet is about to get cut because the last roommate was in charge of that but left around 3 weeks ago.  
My phone is about to get cut too because I can't pay for it.  
I barely eat, mostly at a soup kitchen.  
I've lost 5kg since I got to the new place.

I'm about to get kicked out because I can't pay rent either.  
Im around 4k in debt ( 2.5k from student loans, 1.3 from a my old credit card that I can't pay either)

236,"I'm dealing with my sister right now and when she drinks she gets very combative and defensive. I know she's sad a lot and regrets things and is insecure. I'm trying to build up her confidence while at the same time bringing up the drinking. She gets really defensive about the drinking because she said she needs it to relax. I wouldn't have the biggest issue except for how she treats our mother when she drinks. She's stressed about money and other things. I try to talk to her and she's been happy talking with me. But I found myself being more demanding about the drinking lately and trying to come up with reasons why she should stop. Other people have said she needs to stop too not just me. She's very manipulative when drinks, like she genuinely thinks she's saying these profound things when she's drunk. But it's like that episode of family guy where peter and Lois get high before playing a talent show song thinking they played wonderfully. Then they see w tape of themselves seeing it wasn't that good. When she's sober she's easier to talk to but at the same time she still bought the alcohol as a ""celebration"" and we got in a argument about it then she said this was supposed to be her day of happiness. She went 7 months without a drink before so she rings that up a lot. But I remind her alcoholics don't have a time period before they recover. Idk I guess I'm asking am I the asshole for confronting her about the drinking on a day she sold a house and Got some money for herself? I told her I was proud of her and all that but then the conversation just turned into a alcohol one and instead of all being happy we were all depressed. I guess I'm asking just your opinions should I have just let her drink without saying anything or should I keep being consistent with bringing up the drinking until it finally seeps in. I'm very scared of being an enabler. My sister has kind of dominated my mom for awhile because my sister's personality is so much stronger than my mom's. But I recently told my mom let me deal with my sister so my mom won't have to deal with my sister while drunk because she's a handful. I'm trying to take a more authoritative approach whereas my mom has always been permissive. I try not to be critical at all but I'm trying to get her to see how personal actions affect other things. And how her drinking makes it harder for my mom to deal with her. And it's just extra stress on everyone

What kinds of things or approaches would you say I could try going forward?

I’m about to start my senior year of college after taking time off— I’ve dropped out twice before ( the first time due to intense anxiety and side effects from medication) and the second time also due to anxiety. I started college at 19 and I’m 25 now so it’s been a really slow and painful process, dropping out completely and starting again, doing part-time, dropping out again and now I’m in my first week of Fall semester after taking summer classes. I was pretty miserable during the summer, I tried to stay positive but I just couldn’t help feeling like sitting in a classroom with 20 year-olds spewing jargon about Robert Mapplethorp and Frank O’Hara in a self congratulatory way is pointless and so privileged when there are people who are literally starving and homeless outside on the street. I might sound bitter and it’s probably because I am... Don’t get me wrong I believe that there is beauty and importance in learning about these things it just seems silly to be paying $23,000 per semester for it. I’m very privileged and lucky that my parents are paying tuition but I feel terrible like I’m wasting their money. 

I started college even though I was undecided because where I come from that’s what you’re supposed to do: get into a prestigious college, get a generic well-paying  job, and you’re set. But I feel like as I’m getting older and finding my own inner voice/ interests, that kind of life doesn’t interest me anymore. 

I am now considering dropping out and doing an online 3D Animation program instead. I’ve been doing little personal projects here and there but I want to commit to it full time and become a freelance artist or work for a small studio. I researched online and it seems like most forums say you don’t need a degree, you just need a good portfolio. I’ve always been creative and I really like 3D modeling and I would love to make a career out of it. 

I was so convinced but now I’m having doubts: am I being naive? Should I start on anti-depressants again and endure another 9 months of school to get a diploma? What if I fail and disappoint my family again? I just feel confused and alone. I like spending time alone but I am very anxious and depressed these days and rarely go out to do anything. It’s really exhausting to be around people and try to socialize these days. I have no self-confidence. I also hate that I’m being so indecisive and whiny...  and I just want to make a decision already... Half of me wants to have a stable job and income and make my family proud... prove my peers wrong that I CAN finish college but at the same time I want to dedicate myself to becoming skilled in 3D arts and start my own business as a freelance artist. 

Tl:dr — I don’t know if I should finish my liberal arts degree from my top tier college or drop out and pursue a career in the 3D arts...",06Sep2019,1
238,"Recently My family moved all the way across the country for my parents work. I found out in the last few months of my sophmore year of high school, and I am currently a junior. We left a community that my mom has been in since her youth, and I was attending the high school that she graduated from. We have a great support system there, a ton of family friends, and a ton of help. The school I went to was pretty small, and the faculty and students are basically a second family to me. All of my friends there are basically brothers. I had plenty of people reaching out to me, and letting me know that I could stay with them for my last two years of high school if I wanted to. This community has my heart and my soul. I don’t love my new community, and I am having a difficult time adjusting. Right now, I have the option to leave my family and go home to finish high school while staying at a friends house for two years, or I can stick it out and stay with my family for the next two years and try to adjust. I am really conflicted and don’t know what to do. Any help is appreciated.",06Sep2019,1
239,"Mid 30’s male, smoker, underweight, generally unhealthy. Educated but never worked in field of study. Dealing with life has got me depressed so thought maybe writing down what’s on my mind would help, any input would be much appreciated. 

In no general order, just what pops into my head in a 15 min period. 

Have a loving family that cares about me, has provided me with anything I can need or want but I keep them at a distance and limit my communication deliberately. 

Have a degree in engineering, never found a job in my field. 

Feel worthless since I’m throwing life away. 

Have a loving wife whom I love but treat like a roommate at time. 

Have emotions but refuse to show them to anyone. 

Love being alone. 

Make a dating profile (no intention of meeting anyone), talk for a few days and delete it, repeat

I’m good at what I do but dislike what I do

I get mad easily 

Want to go back to my field of study, don’t know where to start, Don’t remember much from college, has been years

Am a quick learner but forget as quickly as well

People in general drain me

Want to go to the gym and get healthy, but being around ppl puts me off

See the worse in ppl 

I know I’m depressed and am trying my best to deal with it myself. No one knows since I keep interactions short and have mastered faking it for a few hours here and there. 

Generally, unhappy with myself. How would I change that mentality and improve ?",06Sep2019,1
240,"I (19m) have been dating my girlfriend (18f) for a little over a year now and we’ve both recently started college but not at the same school. We’re less than an hour away from each other, which is good because we can still see each other pretty frequently. However, I’ve been feeling so distant from her lately. We kind of fight about the same things a lot and I feel like I’m expected to read her mind or just intuitively know what she wants but I’m not good at that stuff because she’s the first person I’ve been with. Sometimes after we argue she’ll cry or get really emotional and I try to console her and just let her know that I’m there for her but it doesn’t really seem to help and it just leaves me feeling down too. Until a few weeks ago, I always felt like we were high up on each others’ list of priorities, but now I feel like just a best a friend, at most. Sometimes we’ll text and she’ll randomly stop replying and come back a few hours later saying she was out with friends. I guess now is a good time to mention that most of her friends are guys and she tends to hang out with them pretty late at night (there is at least one other girl there sometimes). I’m ok with it because I trust her but I feel like I’d be even less anxious about it if they knew we were dating at least. Ever since college started, she doesn’t want anyone to know we’re together because she doesn’t want that to be the first thing people know about her. I guess this is understandable but people she regularly hangs out with still have no idea and it honestly makes me feel like she’s ashamed to be with me. She recently got really angry at me for telling someone we were together and afterwards she told me to tell everyone we were “just friends” if anyone asked. I’ve talked about everything that’s mentioned in this post before with her multiple times but she just seems to want to justify her reasoning. I really love her a lot and I definitely would love to spend the rest of my life with her but I just hate the way I’ve been feeling. Any and all advice on what to do would be greatly appreciated.",06Sep2019,5
241,"Hello, I am typing this on my phone so please excuse any errors.

I live in California and was recently told that I cannot return to my school because I did not receive a credit for a core class. I’m a senior and it was a private school. I find this appalling considering I’ve been going to the school for several years. I know my options are public school / homeschooling. I feel as though their decision was unjust and that there is more that they could’ve done to help me, considering we’re giving them money. I’m in trouble and my friends asking where I am is beginning to stress me.",06Sep2019,0
243,"Okay so my apologies if this is a bit long, but here goes.  

Backstory:  I met this couple through my old job at a salon. Let’s call them G and S.  I bended the rules for G, and after they both approached me saying that I am so nice, and they are looking for someone to replace the manager at her store. I was content with my job, so I said I could ask around with my coworkers and friends. Next week, G came in alone and asked me again if I would be interested. She said she would pay me more than my current job, it is full time, etc etc. So the next week I came to the store and talked with her and accepted the job.  After a month I quit my other job as I couldn’t handle not having a single day off. 

So this job is at a high end jewelry store, they vaguely train me, and by that I mean they showed me how to handle online orders and list inventory in one day which I wrote notes on.  This store is only open by appointment, so I mostly am handling online orders and listing on the website.  I am the only employee at the store running everything. It is G’s store and S comes in to help sometimes but he has another business so he is rarely there.  

In the beginning it was great, G would buy me lunch all the time and a lot of orders were coming in. After the first month however, G would rarely be at the store and I would be running everything by myself which was quite overwhelming because it could be a lot at times.  

Fast forward to the last two months I worked there.  Neither of them are EVER at the store. G maybe comes in once a week for an hour or so then leaves. They also start having me drive 10 miles away to the workshop to pick up product and ship it. They also stop paying the people who craft the items, then blame it on me when the items take a month to be finished and the customer is upset. Basically, everything that goes wrong is my fault.  And it’s also my fault that sales are declining. I will admit, sometimes I would forget to reply to an email or tell G that someone stopped by, but it was due to the fact that I was running everything in store, online, shipping, everything!  

Eventually I realize this is not going anywhere, the business is clearly struggling and I am being unfairly blamed for every issue, and I decide to go back to school, I’m only 20 and want to start soon while my parents are still letting me live at home.  I tell G this, she seems very happy for me, says she thinks that’s great, etc.  I planned on working there for a few more weeks so I could help train my replacement, but at the beginning of the next week, an hour before I was supposed to come in, G sends me this text:


“Good morning 
You don’t have to come in today love. 
S did analysis on the website , he found many errors .
I’m sorry for the short notice but we have to talk and it is best if we take time on our own to re built the errors right now. I hope you understand.”


I just changed the name to an initial and removed my name.  So I texted again tomorrow if I should come in, and she say no nicely, my boyfriend &amp; I come to the conclusion that she nicely fired me.  


Only problem is, she never paid me my last check.  Or any of my commission I had been accumulating for the whole time I worked there (around 5-6 months)

And also she had been paying me under the table in checks / cash every week. 

How this started was in the beginning she would always say we should go to her accountant and get me on the books, and I would always agree but she never did, and she would say it’s better this way for me because I won’t have to pay tax. I was also promised a 2.5% commission on every order I sold or processed on the website. She also said she would give me health insurance or money for it which never happened. 

So later that week, I send her a very nice paragraph thanking her for the opportunity to work with her, and wondering when I could come in to there store and pick up my check.  A family member of mine also had a ring made that she still wanted to pick up and pay for, and one of my friends wanted a ring custom made

No response. 

I texted her twice more that week, and called too. 

Nothing. 

I texted her the week after as well. 

Again nothing. 

I finally texted her again today, which of course she didn’t respond, so I decided to text S, who I probably should have reached out to earlier. 


Below is our conversation ( I am E btw) :


Me: Hello S, I have been attempting to contact G for the past few weeks regarding my last check and commission. I’ve texted and tried to call multiple times, I was just wondering if everything is okay? I haven’t gotten a single response at all

S: Hi E, I told you there is no more  commission on the orders. Since the sales dropped drastically. Also so many mistakes you made. And didn’t save so many files from 3D design that cost us so much making them again. Also so many of the listings you made have mistakes which I am in the process to hire someone else just to fix the mistakes you made. Also the last package you bought and shipped you forgot to put the customer name on the shipping label when you purchase it. So it never got delivered to the customer and caused a refund. 
I would like you to come in so I can share all your mistakes and miss doings in the business. 

Me: I had stopped writing my commissions after you told me that. But the ones I did before I am still owed along with the last week check i never received. I had saved all files to the STL folder, some do not open due to issues with preview and 3D also has them saved and does not charge to re send the completed file which i had to do multiple times because they would not open to send to Christie.  Each listing i did on the website i did exactly by your instructions, if the website has glitches that deletes listing when a new one is posting that is not my fault as i was just following directions that were given to me. Many issues were out of my control but i always tried my hardest, and most of the time i was alone and doing all work in office as well as going downtown. 
I had also asked G for my commission check multiple times over the time i had worked there and she would always say yes but forget. I stopped accounting for the commission after i spoke with you. But i never got paid anything that i had earned prior 

S: Okay I think it’s best for you to come in and we will calculate your commissions prior and the lost you cause for the business . 

I didn’t text back after that because I showed my mom and she told me not to reply before talking to a lawyer to see how to proceed. 

What do I do?? It’s clear they don’t want to pay be, the total cost they owe me is around $1000 which doesn’t seem like much but I am a student and I don’t have a job right now and also just got surgery. 

Please, any advice would be soooo much appreciated.  I am in California btw. 

Thank you",06Sep2019,1
244,"One of my best friends just went to her ex boyfriends house under the guise of “talking it out for closure.” While there he beat her and raped her. She ended up getting out and calling me. Problem is, I’m across the country for the next 7 weeks. I was able to call a mutual close friend and have them pick her up and bring her to a safe place.


I’m one of the few people she is willing to turn to about this but I’m at a total loss as to how to support or assist her at this time but I want her to be able to come to me with it. How can I best go about tackling this issue in a sensitive way?",06Sep2019,1
245,"2 weeks ago, my 2 friends (**call them A and B**) went on a trip to Thailand and rode elephants and watched an animal show where the animals were chained up and forced to perform circus stunts. Before their trip, I expressed that they shouldn't go on to ride elephants because it's cruel. 

I see that when they're there, they've done exactly that, and put it all on snapchat and instagram stories, and sending me snapchats of this. Upset, I went to Twitter to vent my feelings. Mind you, my twitter is private, and both of these 2 girls do not follow me. I have probably less than 50 followers on Twitter.

I tweeted, in the heat of the moment after seeing these snaps and stories, ""People who have the privilege of travelling but still choose to enjoy animal shows are idiots"", my second tweet right after said along the line ""if you do enjoy those shows, your parents are probs half related or something"". I deleted the second tweet after leaving it up for 30 mins because I regretted my choice of words and really didn't mean it (they would not have seen it). I know these tweets were really bad, and I feel so upset that I did tweet them.

Another girl from highschool (**naming her C**), who is also friends with **A** does follow me. We don't agree on everything, but we follow each other and it's cool between us (like no hate). Granted, she was a terrible person in high school who got into a lot of fights with girls and liked to cause a lot of drama, telling girls what other girls were saying about each other (even though it would have been expressed in confidence/private). We became friends when all her original friends ditched her because of this, but after graduating 6 years ago from highschool, we do not speak or see each other, except on social media.

This girl **C** ended up screenshotting my first and second tweet (before I deleted it), and sending it to **A**. Background: **A** and **C** got into a massive fight 1 year ago and C is still trying to repair the friendship. I am convinced that **C** used me to get a bit closer to A again.

I have to say again, I am extremely sorry I tweeted those things. Like really upset and shattered that I tweeted the second tweet. It was heat of the moment and I was extremely angry and upset about seeing those animals, and seeing A and B's snaps whilst laughing at the show made me mad. 

They had been ignoring me for the first week back from their holiday, but didn't know why. I didn't know that C had sent those screenshots to A and B, until yesterday night, when in a group chat, with A and B in it (but not C), 5 or 6 other friends started sending mean memes, pics of my face sad and crying at the bottom of an elephant, with A and B face on top riding the elephant. Messages started popping up from them making fun of me, calling me a bitch and mocking me about not liking elephant rides. 

This hurt me really bad. First, I didn't realise they saw the tweet up until this point, and they've had a week to confront me about it. Second, instead of confronting me, they've told 5 or 6 other people about this, and now the 5 or 6 people are harassing me and won't stop. I can see that A and B are reading these mean messages to me (because it's all in a group chat). 

I feel betrayed because I thought I was close enough with these girls for them to confront me and not betray and talk mad shit behind my back, attacking me and bullying me. I thought because we were close, they would come up to me and say "" saw your tweet and really mad about it, explain"" or something along those lines. I would have been fine with that

I messaged A to ask her if she needed to speak to me about something, but she hasn't replied. 

Again I'm extremely sorry that I tweeted them, but do I have the right to be upset about what happened? What should I do?",06Sep2019,1
246,"Back story: Pictures for yearbook was due and my friend group decided to take group pictures. Friend A missed the pictures due to class and asked us to retake the next day. We all waited for 10-15 minutes for him to show up but he never did. After we left to hangout in the quad, Friend A texted asking where we were, but no one responded. Friend A found us and stormed over to us furious. Friend B stood up to him and a full blown argument started. Friend A sucker punched Friend B in the balls but luckily no damage was dealt. 

After the incident, the whole group rallied behind Friend B and excommunicated Friend A. To be honest, I feel very uncomfortable and unsure how to act around Friend A. Friend A has always been kind of a dick to everyone which is why we were all quick to stop talking to him. Friend A is currently dating She-Friend, whom we are all very close to, but since the incident, things haven’t been the same with us and her. After talking to both the group and Friend B, I am convinced things aren’t going to get better. What do I do?

248," crosspost from redditorsinrecovery.

I am a 29 year old woman from Europe. The last few months have been difficult. Following the end of a very complicated relationship with an addict, found myself with mountains of debt and a predilection for stimulants and alcohol. Career was going well, but chronic pain that has escalated over the past six months has meant I have not been able to work and not received sick pay. I have already sold half of my belongings and I will be homeless at the end of October (though I have a couch to crash on thanks to a friend).

This week has involved being on suicide watch for my ex boyfriend, receiving a court summons for unpaid bills and almost constant panic attacks. I caved, and called my plug. Then needed money. Found myself on an online gambling website. Now I am 800EUR in credit card and short term loan debt and have no way of paying it. By next month it will be double that. I don't know what to do, and I didn't know how to stop. What do I do.",06Sep2019,2

He also blocked all of my msgs on facebook asking why he was tellimg people it was his kid and if he knew even she was telling me it was mine and was with me.

251,"The first time, I didn't even find out until a week ago, and it happened over a year ago. The second time was miscommunication about a break on his part. The 3rd and 4th time was a couple months ago and didn't find out until mid August. His reasoning behind the last 2? I wasn't putting out enough, even though I offered every night to do something. We did have some minor problems (what couple doesn't?), but no effort was made on his side. For a while now, I've been thought to be asexual because I've had no interest in sex, but I still wanted to do for him. I don't see a problem with that. He had a whole second Snapchat account for cheating. Another email and multiplw dating sites. Saw the Snapchat over his shoulder by mistake one day. He lied about everything when I caught him. And yes, I did find some of it out through snooping.

I love this man with my whole heart, I have for a while. I live with him. He's the best thing to happen to me until recently. We've done so much together, and have so much. But, its made me feel worthless, ugly, useless, and whatnot. 

I'm so confused on what to do. I don't have anywhere to go, but its painful to even look at him. He hates talking about it, and never wants to express his feelings. I don't want to leave a relationship that we've built for so long. But I do at the same time.

Do you think we can rebuild what we once had and move on, or should I drop him and leave?",06Sep2019,2

Anyone who’s a Marvel fan has probably heard about the fact negotiates between Disney and Sony broke down so Spider-Man unless something is settled can’t be in the MCU anymore.

And I hate everyone in this situation. I hate Disney and Sony for being greedy jerks who only care about making more money with a popular property instead of caring about the story and fans, and I hate Marvel Studios for making the bone headed decision to end Spider-Man Far from Home in a cliffhanger(a cliffhanger for the record I didn’t even like and it bugs me no one seems to agree with me even with the power of hindsight but that’s another topic). It’s made me so mad that I refuse to watch anything MCU or Spider-Man related until both Sony and Disney get their heads out of their asses.

255,"My Ex (19F) and I (21M) broke up several month ago. We decided to still be friends and it's been a struggle for me. I've been open and honest with the feelings I have for her through this time, but haven't acted on them as they aren't mutual.

She told me that she just got into a relationship with her best friend from home (her and I go to university together, but are not from the same home town). I felt slightly betrayed because she didn't tell me until 3+ months after they started dating.

Her and her new boyfriend have an agreement where they don't necessarily share the entirety of their personal lives with each other:
He doesn't share the girls that he spends time with, and she hasn't told him about me.

I would cuddle and sleep with her (without doing anything sexual) and he would do the same with his female friends. However, they mutually agree to not share this information with each other, but they agree that is falls within the boundaries of their relationship.

Well, learning this all a couple of hours ago immediately brought back the feelings of my last 2 relationships where I was cheated on. Extremely painful and I felt betrayed. I felt that she left me for one of her friends from home, which she would cuddle/sleep with. This bothered me while we dated, but I told her that as long as I knew where she was and who she was with: I would suck it up.

She would never cheat on me or her current boyfriend, but I know that he would not be comfortable with the cuddling/sleeping together, and it would even make me feel strange knowing I was doing that to someone.

258,"Hello there. Need some help figuring out if I should keep this person around as a friend. 

My friend and I will be graduating soon and we're looking for jobs right now. He is a nice person and is always there to wish me good luck or say congrats. He is also quite funny at times and helpful with completing some of my courses. (As you can probably tell, we're not BEST friends, but rather just classmates that have been together since we just have a lot of classes together. Regardless, I'd say we've become more close over the past four years).

Anywho, it seems that he is only ever interested in meeting up with me if he has some sort of personal motive, whether it be convincing me to help him do his work or to vent his frustration about his job. Our conversations are becoming extremely one sided and he doesn't seem to care or be aware of what is going on in my life. I recently told him that my uncle was diagnosed with cancer and he asked me if everything was alright with me. I proceeded to say things were fine, but I must admit that i was rather shocked to see that his immediate response to that was ""did you find any decent jobs to apply to?"". It's almost as though he did the absolute minimum to address my concern and move on. He wasn't always like this. I think it has only happened recently now that hes more anxious about graduating.

I should also note that he sometimes implies that I OWE him my friendship because he helped me before. I say ""implies"" because he's smart and not direct about it. For example, I once told him that i would be joining a different group in our class because his group was selecting a topic that i really didn't like. To that, he responded with something along the lines of ""so you're going to leave me dry here after all I've done for you?"" He said it in a joking tone, but I can't help but think that he has an underlying sense of entitlement. I appreciate everything he's done for me and I'm always happy to chat with him when he wants to vent, but should i be worried that this relationship is becoming one sided?

As I’ve gotten older I’ve realized I have a thing for “alpha”/masculine men. On some level I’m aware that my preferences could be due to sexist conditioning but I’m not sure how to break out of this line of thinking. I have a semi submissive personality but I buck up and take charge when I’m with someone more shy than me. That’s the case with “Mike” I’m typically the one to decide what we do, where we go, what we eat etc in dates. We also always split costs or I pay. We’ve been seeing each other non-exclusively for some time now and recently he brought up taking things to the next level and becoming intimate. While I was thinking about how I should go about giving him my finalized response to this I realized I have no sexual attraction to him at all and that I barely view him as a man. There’s two other guys that I’ve been talking to as well and I want to see where things go with them, but I’m also worried that maybe I’ll be missing out on a great relationship with “Mike” as a result of being shallow.

263,"I'm 21M with virtually no dating experience, and not for lack of trying. I've tried many different approaches, but constantly get rejected, I think I'm closing in on 100 soon.

Sometimes what I will do is get to know a girl for a while, hang out a few times on non-dates, and then ask them out on a date after a month or something like that. They usually say they only see me as a friend.

Other times, I will invite them to a coffee after one or two conversations that went well. This worked once I think, but she was not very compatible with me (she was a christian fundamentalist).

The thing is, I don't actually know how to successfully land a date, or what the best way to do that is. Some people say I need to build a rapport first, but when I invite them to friendly gatherings, they say no because they don't want to lead me on. When I am more direct sooner, they say no because they hardly know me. What is it that I am not getting?

268,"Hey Reddit,

Hoping for some tips and tricks from the internet hive mind. I broke up with my boyfriend in January, we were together for 4 years and we both knew at the end that we had to go our separate ways. Initially I was just healing and not really interested in meeting anyone. I also moved from the city back to my quite small hometown in late March.

 I'm happy living back here, I'm having a great time, and have made a lot of new friends, however I seem to have totally forgotten how to flirt/initiate something with someone. I would say I'm a reasonably attractive girl, and quite easy to get along with for most people. Before I met my boyfriend I was pretty good at getting laid. I think the problem is that I'm so used to interacting with guys in a friendly manner that I don't really know how to be flirty/sexy anymore, the idea seems a bit ridiculous. The other problem is that while I'm ok looking, I have a lot of girlfriends who are like 10/10 gorgeous. Now I'm worried because there's not too many people to choose from where I'm living and I've befriended all the cute guys, who all call me ""mate"" or ""man"" lol. I was chatting to one of them about this whole issue the other day and he said that I should have no problem getting some so I know I'm not ugly and delusional haha.

Next time I meet someone I'm interested in, I would like to avoid the friendzone if at all possible. What are some small things I can do to send a signal that I'm available without looking desperate/silly?  


TLDR - Just ended a 4 year relationship. Don't know how to flirt anymore. Help!",06Sep2019,1

Long story. but after graduation my job required me to go travel abroad for 2 months. I was sick before flying and therefore got more sick after landing. My apartment as I walk in was also not ideal, and therefore I did not enjoy this abroad experience that much. I even went to therapy a few times.   
I did get a lot better in self relationship and self love, but for the past few days I have been feeling just a complete lack of motivation and the ability to enjoy the now and just crazy homesick. I am one week away from heading home, but the past few days I havent been able to eat too well (lack of appetite), I also havent been motivated at work at all as my project is basically finished and I dont have to work on a lot anymore. For most of the day I just think of how much I miss home, which my therapist said it is ok (which I agree, missing home is normal when u are sick abroad and conditions arent ideal). but I am wondering - am I depressed? I planned out a few things to do for my last weekend here and I dont feel that excited at all. I dont really feel excited going to work in an hour, and there just isnt a lot that I am looking forward to other than going home in a week. What are some advice that you have ?",06Sep2019,2

275,"Hi guys. I specifically made a reddit account to ask for some advice regarding my future mother-in-law. This is a LONG ass post so buckle your seat belts.

First, here's some background: My fiance could get deployed in December or February and wouldn't be able to make it to the wedding date that I already had in mind. Therefore, we moved it up to the end of this month. My fiance proposed to me *before* I had met his family and, after spending a week with them, I understand why.

Things were going very well yesterday. I booked the reception venue that I want, I have my hair appointment set, and I may have even found a DJ that is willing to do our music for cheap. The groom and I wanted a small wedding with ONLY our closest friends and family, well, it changed a bit and we are expecting about 60 people to be there. Anyway, my MIL called the groom yesterday and said that she was going to invite her neighbors to our wedding.

Fiance calls me and asks me to deal with this because I'm the one keeping track of the guest list. I told him that because this is *his* mother, that *he* needs to be the one to situate this situation. He called her back and told her that, no, we don't want her neighbors at our wedding. Instead of accepting it and moving on, she argues with him and eventually texts me.

She wrote, ""I know ur upset about the neighbors. It's a long story I would like to talk to u maybe over this weekend when u have a moment""

I replied with, ""I'm not upset at all! However, I'm not inclined to discuss it because \[fiance's name\] and I want this to be an event for our closest friends and family.""

Y'all think she'd let this go. But nope. I get hit with a, ""In my defense this was sprung on me too quickly so forgive me if I shared the joy with my friends, actually, they overheard the conversation. In any case, both you and \[fiance's name\] have to understand my confusion at how quick everything is happening. I'm trying to take it all in and maybe the choice on my side is not the best but it's called compromise and, honestly, I don't even know for sure if they would attend. I don't know anyone on your \[side of the family\] and yes it will be a new experience but I have people as well that would like to wish you both the utmost happiness. I will respect your wishes because ultimately it is yours and \[fiance's name for the last time\] day but I also feel that some things in life are not worth arguing over. We don't have to talk about it if your wish is to have your closest friends and family, which, by the way, should be read 'Closest Family and Friends', that is fine I will support you both. I'm not trying to be mean or anything, life is too short for that. I wish nothing but good things for both of you. Love always.""

I didn't think it would be appropriate to respond because, even though she's asking me to ""compromise"" on something that I already gave a definitive answer to, she said she didn't want to argue about it so I went to sleep.

Today, however, she calls my fiance right after he got off work (he works for the military and his work days are *very* long) because she didn't like that I never replied to her text. And that she is also upset about what I wrote in a description box on an event page. (I basically told people that if they plan on bringing a plus one, we need to know that no later than next week and that if they brought a plus one without letting us know that their date would need to bring their own chair and a sandwich. I'm obviously joking about bringing your own chair, but I need to know the amount of people coming so I can tell my venue how many people we plan on feeding.) She calls him and says that she's inviting her neighbors anyway literally JUST BECAUSE I didn't reply to her text. MIL said she didn't want to argue about it so I thought it was done with. She then asks the groom, ""Are you guys getting married so soon because \[insert my name\] is pregnant?"" (I'm not pregnant. Having a child right now would actually ruin my life.)

My fiance explains to her that he wants to be sure that I'm well taken care of should he get deployed and, God forbid, get killed. I would get a butt-load of money for his life insurance policy and, as he already has told me and later told MIL, I would use the majority of the money to pay off my school loans, have a home, and groceries. He explained to MIL, also, that he would want me to give her 1/4 of that money to her (MIL) and another 1/4 to my own mother. (This is when the shit hits the fan.) She dead ass asks him, ""What has \[my name\]'s family done for you in the past two years that I haven't done for you in your whole life?""

Like?? MIL?? *MY* parents are footing the bill for this whole wedding. *MY* parents always made your son feel welcome in their home. *MY* parents always ask him to come over and visit but also take initiative and text or call him just to see how his day is going. Y'all, my MIL isn't contributing SHIT to this wedding and is only adding stress to my and my fiance's already very full plates. I don't like these neighbors that she plans on inviting (out of spite at this point) because all they do is get drunk and argue. If we exceed the venue's capacity, we have to switch locations and I'm NOT giving this place up.

That can I do as a bride-to-be? My fiance tried handling it and it only got worse. I'm scared that MIL's neighbors are going to show up and I'm going to have to ask them to leave because I literally can't stand them *that* much. Is there any way I can do anything like this without anyone thinking I'm being a bridezilla? Give me any decent advice you've got. Thanks!",06Sep2019,1
276,"So for context, when I was 17(F) my brothers best friend (19M) said he had a crush on me. I decided to start dating him because I was curious. My dad found out and told me to stop seeing him. I said what he wanted to hear, ""of course, you're absolutely right."" 

I was lying, of course.

I started seeing him during lunchtime at school (he would pick me up for lunch) and when I stayed over at my moms house (divorced parents) she would let me go out with him. 

We never did anything sexual, we just went on dates and had fun. One night while I was at my dads, where i lived full time, i went out around 12am to go for ice cream with him. My dad saw me leave and got my step mum to follow me outside, in the snow, to his car and confront me about it. I got in the car anyways. He started calling my phone but I ignored it. He then texted me, saying if I ""didnt come back right now I was never welcome back."" So I said, ""I'm done with you and this family"" and promptly went to my moms house.

My dad started accusing the boyfriend of being a pedophile and saying he was only friends with my brother to get to me. He also threatened to call the cops on him.

My dad and I are on good terms now, although I live with my mom full time now, but he still says things like ""if you hadn't snuck out with that night maybe this family would still be together"" or other nonsense. 

(My brother also recently moved out and took my dog with him because my dad and step mom neglected him so much it was practically abuse.  They made my dog wear a 'diaper' and would leave it on, dirty, for days, causing my poor pup to get blisters in his crotch)

I have a stalker who was an online friend before. This stalker has gone to great lengths to follow me all over this livestreaming app

I'd be more keen for his input if he weren't inconsiderate and very very rude to all of us.

 I have a well-ventilated room, and I know this because that same roommate decided to light a joint in the living room, and I didn't smell it until I went out; so I don't think that litterbox smell will be an issue. (Especially if I nestle the box waaay in the back of the closet).

My partner has a problem when we go out drinking together has he doesn’t like when people look at me or talk to me, he has tried to control this jealous side to him and agreed to come with me. The night was going amazing he even requested our song and we danced and my thought in that moment was this is what it will be like when we get married. 

Later that night he argued with one my friends and even though the situation was resolved i decided we should leave and go somewhere else while thing were sorted. Skip to the end of the night we were both drunk and stumbled in to a taxi now i am fuzzy on the details but out of nowhere he got really mad (maybe i said something he didn’t like?) i was paying the taxi driver and then he opened the driver door and started screaming at him i got out and told him to leave it alone and come inside. He pushed me i fell to the ground and sprained my wrist.

When we got in to the house i was angry and hurt that he would do this but was just raging, i asked him to leave plenty of time and he wouldn’t. He then trashed my kitchens and when i tried to stop him he got in my face. He was scaring me, i’ve never seen him like that in all the time i have known him. I slapped him because he wouldn’t listen to me (I know this is wrong) Then he punched me three times. On the third on i passed out. 

I now sit with two black eyes, a bruised jaw and sprained wrist. He sits with a scratch right across his face and a grab mark across his chest. 

I used to think i knew who i was and what i want, what i would do if this happened. If you hit me once your out the door cause you could do it again. Now that this has actually happened i am heartbroken. He has always been there for me, he’s the first real boyfriend i’ve ever had. I’m 21 and i never thought i would want to settle down so early with someone but then we got together and that changed. I saw us growing old together, i saw us seeing the world and helping each other achieve the best we can. 

Now i just don’t know, i know i need space which is what i have demanded and i that later one down the line we can see where we stand but my is so fucked. Not only is he my partner but he was my best friend and i now have no one to speak to about this because my family don’t like him anymore and no one understands. 

He has apologised profusely and is generally remorseful. 

Do i give yet another chance or do i risk putting myself back in to depressive state by giving up the one love of my life and be alone again like i was for three years.

282,"Exuse me for my dreadfull writing.

So school starts again and I have something bugging me.
Last summer I (m21) spent a lot of time with a good friend (f22), and we had a good bond. She's experienced with fwb's and me not so much. We decided we could start one aswell, but this evolved in a more relationship-like fwb (relation without feelings for each other sorta). This meant hooking up with other people could happen. I never really had a doubt that I would develop feelings, but I do have a problem of feeling jealous sometimes, which I actually find very frustrating. 
I think the reason for this is that I don't have enough self esteem sometimes. This only happens when I bond with someone tho. 

Now the last week I helped her move to a different city to get her started on going to a new university. we already talked about how we weren't exclusive for eachother and that we would seek different people for sex/fwb/relationships etc. afterwards, but still be friends and when we meet up and we're in the mood also have sex.

This week I went back home and started school and while going home the feeling of missing her kicked in. Something I wouldn't think would happen that bad. 
I've concluded it's not just the fact I miss intimity or her as a friend. But also have some feelings which she doesn't share. And which would lead to a bad relationship anyway since we don't fit that well. We're best friends, but a relationship wouldn't work definately not long distance.

Anyways, she said She'll be meeting up with an old friend next week from a different country, with which she had a ddlg/fwb going on a year ago, but not at the moment. And after I got a bit jelly and asked her if they would have sex she said offcourse, and I can't stop feeling a bit jealous. 

I want her to do whatever she wants and be happy. But I want to be able to do the same thing and not make a complete fool out of myself. 
I also feel a hypocrite for not sharing the same feeling that she's free to see anyone she wants. I know it's ok to do so, it just doesn't feel right for me when she does it, but when I do it's no problem (humans are strange creatures)

I have feelings I don't wanna express since I know the answer. My parents weren't sure either if I could do this type of thing. I think I'm able to do so, but not with someone you ever had a slightest eye on.
I want to get rid of these feelings (harder said than done), so the friendship doesn't change, and I'm able to enjoy on another while we see eachother and not feel jealous in the mean time.

I hope someone was able to read al of this, and is able to give some helpfull advice.

It does not let me sleep and when I tell him to shut up he just goes mad, covers his mouth and yells as a sort of aggression against me. (He does this all the time, for example when we tell our brother to turn the volume down he just yells: ""I'M GOING TO TURN THE VOLUME TO 0 THEN!"", of course he says this on our first language.)

Keep in mind that english isn't our first language in our family. His english is above average but still, it's broken.

He sometimes walks around the house with a thing on his hand and gets it close in front of his face and either he makes music from his mouth or just rambles nonsense. This seems abnormal to me but it might be because he is a kid. But it doesn't cover the fact that he is a brat sometimes, for example he yells ""Water!"" and ""Food!"" when he wants something, and when he doesn't get what he wants, he makes noises that sound like a 3 year old baby crying.

So... any advice on how to stop my brother from yelling in front of the computer like he is Jacksepticeye or Captainsparklez???

293,"I've had a poor diet for most of my life, I travel a lot for work so I live off of fast food/snacks more than real food. The problem is that I've had the same diet, ate the same food, ate the same amount of food for as long as I can remember. Recently however I started a new job at my work where I am a lot more active, I went from 10,000 steps/day to about 25,000 steps/day. 

Here is the weird part. I maintained my same diet, however I've suddenly started gaining weight at a very fast pace, I've gained 15 pounds in 2 months. I'm not sure why being more active would result in weight gain with no other lifestyle changes but it has. I know changing my diet can help but any other advice to quit gaining weight?",06Sep2019,1
294,"to give some kind of essential background info: i’m a 21 year old woman, black and mexican, an aspiring author, and have been having what seems to be something like an existential crisis for about three weeks now.

i started my second year of community college on august 19 and since then, i feel like i’ve been going on a downward spiral. my classes this semester have essentially been punching me in the face nonstop since they started and while i understand that college isn’t an easy ride like high school, i‘m just not enjoying any of it. i’m tired of being stressed. tired of losing time to write. tired of back to back to back homework and quizzes and exams and trying to stay afloat. tired of being tired, really.

people always tell me that i’m the type that’s meant to be in college. my grades have been stellar and i’ve gotten a lot of praise from my family, boyfriend, and even professors. and while i do appreciate the compliment, i can’t help but feel locked in a box. i didn’t grow up wanting to go to college. hell, i’ve struggled with depression for god knows how long and could never even see myself going to college but that’s beside the story. even now, i still don’t have the desire to be there. it all feels meaningless to me. taking these classes with intentions of obtaining a degree. and while, yeah, it’d be a degree in what i want, i still don’t feel the urgency or dedication or passion that everyone else has. i feel rather confined, and i’ve come to realize that i’m someone who hates feeling trapped, particularly with academic and creative endeavors.

but all of this isn’t an easy fix. i don’t feel like i have control of my life, despite being 21. i still live with my mom because i don’t have the means to support myself quite yet and it’s because of her that i’m even in college right now. i took 2 years off after high school graduation and by the end of it, she gave me a choice of either starting college/getting a job or she’d send me to live with my dad. so i enrolled in college. not just this but as a POC, education has always been the priority. making sure i make something of myself because others in my family couldn’t. to make sure i don’t fail. as if my life will never have any meaning without a college degree. and i feel like dropping out, or even taking a simple semester off, isn’t something i can do or even think about doing. i feel a bit like a puppet. 

and it’s so strange to say that i’m tired of the life i’m living, as if i’ve even truly lived at the ripe age of 21. but what i’m doing now doesn’t feel quite right. honestly, i think i might be happier working full time in an environment i like instead of being a misplaced student. but even then, it’s complicated. my work experience is limited and i have no degree yet. everyone that’s hiring wants experience or someone with a degree and i have neither of those things. and although i could do with working just about anywhere, i absolutely refuse to work in fast food (ie. mcd’s). it just feels like my bubble of options keeps getting smaller and smaller by the second.

i don’t really know what to do or how to navigate all of this and needed advice, since my boyfriend’s asleep and i have -12 friends to ask for advice from. so yeah.",06Sep2019,3
295,"So I have been reading about how to control your (lucid) dreams for a while now but never have successfully done it. Although i almost realize it every time after waking up that I was lucid dreaming / dreaming, like right after waking up.

But last night was different. I had slept in the noon after coming back from school and woke up almost near midnight. I was hungry so i had dinner and went right back to sleep. But i don't what time it was but i slip into a dream and suddenly i realize that i am in control and i am able to walk and feel like i want. So i check my hands and my wristwatch to make sure i am dreaming, the usual. And sure enough they are blurred and time doesn't show up. So the first thought that came into my mind was sex. I know i am not supposed to rush in but i already had made the mistake

But as soon as i realized that i was Lucid dreaming i started pulling out of it. Like Black lights started to flicker and it was as if i was sucked back into sleep. I really wanted to be there for more time. So is there any way i can prevent this from happening and so that i can Lucid dream properly?",06Sep2019,1
296,"One thing I don't understand is, when is surgery necessary?  I've recently come to understand that healing is something the body does on it's own. Growing up I always had the impression that doctors and surgeons fix people, but I've learned that a surgeon will just make way for the body to heal itself.

So now I'm wondering about a knee injury I have. I've over done running and cycling for two months and I'm hurting pretty bad right now. The outside of my knee started flaring up just after four days on continuous running. The pain would cease as soon as I walked again but the knee would hurt in that area if I went too hard again.

Recently I did a faster than average 4 mile run, and started cycling for a few days around town after that and it felt bad so I took a week off of cardio, despite that, after one week I walked around for 2 hours and felt aching pain on my knee. When I have my knee bent for a while, I feel like I need to unbend it slowly or it can crack or get hurt. When I am sitting and my knee is at a 90 degree angle, and I stand up, my knee pops.

I have no pain when I walk, but my knee has been continuous aching/feeling flared. Even taking aspirin I can still feel it.

It's been two weeks now since I've done cardio. My question about this is, will my body be able to heal itself miraculously if I allow it? Will it be able to somehow reverse the popping in the knee when I stand up? I've had the aching in the past before and it went away but never had popping/crackling sound. What kind of situation is surgery needed? Can it potentially be need in a case like mine, or is it when something more obvious has occurred like a tear?",06Sep2019,1
297,"So I have been informally asked what are my thoughts in moving to another city, holding the same position that I currently have although I'd have bigger responsibilities.
Very similar salary (probably a bonus here and there, but nothing major) but the project it's interesting.

The question that comes up to my mind is if this have been asked to me because I'm the last resort or because they trust what I do. I ask this question to myself because I was recently promoted to position that I currently have, and I would expect this to be offered to more senior roles.

My manager also told me that ""there is not a bad answer; if you say yes or no, we are going to be fine with it, we just want to know your thoughts"".

One of my closest friends I’ve had for years acts really chill and cool when we hangout or talk but on the bus ride and at lunch when there’s a few girls around he acts like a asshole. He tries to act “funny” by purposely being stupid like mispronouncing words and whatnot. He’s  super insensitive and recently a kid me and him knew pretty well committed suicide and we are all sad about it but on the bus he was making jokes and shit about it. The girls on the bus find him so fucking funny when he’s a dick and he’s a dick to me too sometimes. For example this year there’s a autistic kid on our bus. I mentioned it to him before the school year started about the kid coming and some of the stories of stuff he said to me. And he said I was being a dick because he has autism. When on the bus he would taunt and pretty much bully him and be a fucking prick. The moment we get off the bus he’s super nice and relaxed. The girls who enjoy his humor are nice people but don’t really realize the shit he’s saying/doing. I like being friends with him but shit like that pisses me off.

So I have this group of friend that I always go out with and they hang out at my place and we have fun, and one of these friends is a friend whom I consider my best friend, let's call him tom.

A week ago my friends decided to go on a 4 days trip, I told them to wait 3 days so I can go with them because I had exams and they didn't even THINK about it, they just acted as if I didn't say a thing, even tho I asked twice once on text on the whatsapp group we have and another IRL.

So the day they decided and wanted to start booking, I told tom tell them to postpone it like they always do for anyone (last year we postponed it  2 weeks for a friend) and tom said they can't because a friend is already where they are supposed to go, so he didn't want to come and go back again.

In short a group of friends that I have been for 8 years and one of them is my best friend fucked me over without even giving it a thought or even apologizing, and when I said what I felt they made fun of  me even tho I said I wasn't joking.

307,"So I have recently been on the hunt for a new job due to the fact that I am moving.  
For all my career so far I have worked hard, so that one day I have enough experience and checkmarks on my resume I can apply to certain companies and positions in my industry that are extremely hard to land.   
As it happens, I decided to go for it now, and I couldn't believe when I started landing phone interviews for the jobs of my dreams! I was over the top and couldn't believe it was finally happening. I prepared for the interviews by reading up a lot of tips online for nailing phone interviews, and doing research on the companies and their products before each call. I prepared extensive notes and potential Q&amp;As to have at hand during the calls, and also took notes during them to make sure I don't miss anything.

However, my nerves seemed to always get the best of me when the time for the calls came, and my brain went all blank when asked questions. I was never really happy with my own presentation afterwards, and felt like I was not able to express well what I've achieved in the past and how I'd act in situations that the interviewers asked. And ALL the companies I interviewed for eventually ghosted me after the calls; no thank you message, no rejection email, no offer, no ANYTHING.

And only to make things harder, I don't in general feel too comfortable talking on the phone with people I've never met before, because I cannot read body language, nor distinguish the nuances of the voice that well if I cannot see the person in front of me.

310,"I (25F) currently work a (night shift) job in a hard sciences field. I won’t specify which one just for privacy reasons, but let’s say it’s Physics. I graduated 3 years ago from college with a BS in Biology. It would increase my opportunities greatly to take these extra classes to essentially double major in Biology and Physics. I feel immense pressure from family (as in my parents) to do this and do it quick. 

However... there are still 8 classes to take, and I feel like this just isn’t fitting into my life. My current employer made it clear that it isn’t necessary, but that it will increase opportunities in the future, and even if I do go that there is no urgency to finish. 

I took one class during the day after working my night shift, and it nearly wrecked me mentally and physically. I got a B, but household chores fell so behind and I felt disgusting. All I did was work and school and sleep. I am married and my husband and I essentially just want to start our life together. We want to focus on buying a house and having children. Taking classes while doing all of this will be incredibly hard, and I am just not willing to put off having children until I’m done taking these 8 classes one at a time (that would be 3-4 years) due to possible fertility issues that could mean conceiving a child will be difficult and take a long time.

I feel like I’m being pressured to do the one thing that made me borderline suicidal - go BACK to school AGAIN. My husband is supportive of whatever choice I make, but does admit it will possibly narrow my career options in the future. I just feel so done with that phase of my life, but I feel like my extended family (parents) will be disappointed if I don’t do it, and I’m afraid I will regret not doing it in 10 years. I also just want to get off of night shift. However, this company is nearly perfect in how it pays and what great benefits it has, and the people I work with. But neither being on night shift nor going back to school are things that are helping my family (my husband and I). 

Should I go back to school anyway? Should I not and just sit on night shift? Should I take an approximately 25% pay cut (yes, that is what it would be) and find another job?",06Sep2019,1

312," No matter however pricy your insurance policies are, they can't prevent from paying fines because of traffic offenses like rushing, careless driving, or DUI (Driving below Influence).

He works full time and pretty much takes care of both of us financially, while I go to school twice a week and only work a couple of hours a week. Therefore I'm the one taking care of our apartment and doing all the chores, such as vacuuming, mopping, dusting, deep cleaning, etc. And I'm perfectly happy with this set up, it works for us. What drives me absolutely nuts is my boyfriend not cleaning up after himself. I'm talking a pile of dirty clothes on the floor, socks in random places that he just doesn't bother to pick up, leaving dishes everywhere instead of carrying them to the dishwasher, when he comes home from a trip he leaves his bag half unpacked for days (if not weeks), when he's fixing something/working on something, he'll leave the tools and things lying around for weeks. Eventually I always cave in and just clean up after him because it drives me crazy to live in a mess like that. I've tried talking to him, but he doesn't seem to understand my issue, and I have a hard time putting it to words, because it's so many random little things. I wish he'd just care enough to clean up after himself. It feels disrespectful and makes me increasingly more frustrated with him when I have to be the one throwing his tissues from a cold 2 weeks ago away, sorting through his dirty clothes or putting away his things. I understand that he's the money maker and takes care of us that way. But I really do everything around the house, I just want him to clean up after himself. I don't want out relationship to fall apart. Am I in the wrong here? How do I talk to him and make him put the things away properly after he's done with them?

I genuinely believe I'm a fun and kind person when I'm relaxed and feel safe but I just clench up every time I talk to my co-workers even if they all are the nicest people. The more I think about being relaxed the tenser I get. It's especially an issue with my boss which means I'm also the weirdest with her. I'm constantly afraid of saying weird things so of course that's all I'm doing. I'm really scared it's affecting my relations in a negative way at my workplace. I love my co-workers and they really do try to include me but I just can't help but create distance. I feel such an amount of anxiety with them that I'd rather back off and be content knowing I haven't wronged any of them than become a part of the group with the risk of saying something weird or offensive.

320,"So to put it simply, it’s 4:30 AM, and I haven’t fallen asleep yet. I’m wondering if I should give up on trying to fall asleep and just pull an all nighter. Of course, if I get tired before I have to get up, I’ll go got sleep.

The reason I haven’t fallen asleep is that whenever I get comfortable, literally the moment I lay down, I have to pee. It’s really infuriating. I’ve had this issue before, but not to this degree. So I’ve been getting up to pee every half-hour since midnight. I don’t think I’m going to fall asleep at this point because it’s not just regular insomnia causing this. 

The only issue with pulling an all-nighter is that I have to get up tomorrow and be a functioning person, as I have a funeral to go to. I’m concerned that this might effect my health in some way. It’s very rare for me to be awake past midnight so maybe not.

I’m sure I’ll probably be able to catch a nap at some point today, but I’m still concerned about what would happen to me if I didn’t get any sleep at all. I tried to research it, but all of the articles seemed to only exist to deter people from staying up all night, which doesn’t really help me.

I’m also kind of afraid that I won’t be able to sleep tomorrow night either, and then I die or something.

321,"We were best friends for 3 years and then we dated for 2 years. She was never behaving like ""that"" before we dated. Then we dated. Then she breaks up with me all of a sudden.

2 Weeks after the break up I hear from a friend that she screwed at least 10 guys over the last 14 days.

2 months after the break up she is known as the ""uni slut"" because she slept with every guy at her uni that wants to sleep with her.

I don't know how to deal with it. It was my first relationship and I still love her and it breaks my heart knowing that she is behaving like this.

322,"I'm currently working a third shift job in the Media realm, and I want to leave to find another job, but I'm worried about my current issues.

First, why I want to leave my current job: it's not as creative as I want to be or I'm not given enough time to do anything creative with it. This will probably not change much if I stay in the same position at another place.

The organization and communication here is awful. We try things at the last minute so many times, and hope by the skin of our teeth that it works out. It stresses us lower people out, while management has the mindset of ""figure it out and try to make it work"" when they don't help us make it work by better planning. They also are very vague and are too general with what they expect from us. I have to ask so many questions to know what I need to do. Some may like that kind of freedom, but I do need some guidance.

There is also the issue of management not holding anybody accountable for repeats of failing to do the job right, which makes us look unprofessional. Instead, they group email everyone to do better, but not individually telling who to do better, or give help/guidance on how to improve. 
I know I myself can do better and I find myself making a lot of the same mistakes. However, I've tried to get guidance/suggestions from those who have the same position and from my immediate supervisor. Currently, my supervisor is suspended due to legal issues (not with the company), so he can't help me, but he's so old school that I don't think he could be a mentor for me. The others in my same position are either too busy, or just don't want to be a mentor. They also are on different shifts, so that makes it harder as I'm the only one on third shift.

But, my biggest issue is that I find I have more down time than actual work and I hate being idle! Maybe it's more of a personal feeling, because I feel worthless when I'm not being productive. I offered to learn other aspects during this idle time, but was told no.


Now, the reason I'm hesitant to leave and find another job is due to: being over weight, adult acne (which is more of an embarrassment), anxiety and depression coupled with low self-esteem.

My weight does make my job a bit difficult, as it varies in degrees of physical requirements, but my current job is rather laid back so it's a rare occurrence to be tired from physical activity (exhaustion is more from if I work long hours, as overtime can be spontaneous). 
I'm worried a new job would be more demanding with physical work that I wouldn't be able to keep up with and be fired. But, on the other hand, I feel that being more physical would help me lose the weight better/faster.

The low self-esteem is definitely driving the belief that nobody would hire me due to my issues. I am trying to get things under control, but being depressed is a stumbling block to my success.

I feel that getting a new job and new location would help give me a jump start and motivate me to keep up my improvement, but then I worry it might overwhelm me. I can have a mousey-type attitude, and just allow people to walk all over me which is not good for the type of work I'm involved in.

Am I just being a worry-wort that just needs to go for it or are my thoughts valid?",06Sep2019,1

I've lost my apartment, my license, my cars registration just expired, and I have about 800 dollars in tickets I need to pay to fix it all. During all this time she has not kept a job for longer than two weeks. We've been sleeping in the car for 6 months I can't bring myself to leave her cause I would feel guilty just leaving her in the streets by herself (shes also suicidal with past self harm that I've helped her overcome). Shes still not working shed rather be in a car all day watching videos on a phone that I pay for as well. She has a ""job"" but she won't start till the 16th because it's a new restaurant and it's under construction..... it's been 3 weeks.

It’s only $200, and it was already approved so I’m not sure they would catch it.  It’s a very big corporation so $200 isn’t really a loss.

327,"I am 20 and I have lied about so many things in my life. It feels like I embellish and lie to compensate for my lack of self worth and adequacy. How do I stop lying? I guess first step is admitting it. 

I lied about being addicted to Xanax. I was taking Prozac, lexapro, lorazepam from my psychiatrist in high school. What I would do was save up my medication during the week, and take it all at once over the weekend and sleep. I would do this every week for 6 months until I dropped out of school and attempted suicide. I would say I was anxious, but never say what about. It was embarrassing what I was anxious about. I was so anxious that no one liked me or wanted me that I never left my room and did this to myself. I was in a relationship at the time and he was there for me until I broke up with him to overdose. I was wanted, but I somehow felt like I wasn’t and I don’t know why. I am not sure how to overcome this... 

So now this is what is happening:

I am now 20 and I have moved overseas and created a new life for myself. Moved continents, lived alone at 19 (last year), made a good group of friends, had a boyfriend for the last year. He just broke up with me because my anxiety is so much that he cannot handle it as he also is struggling with mental health problems himself. This just triggered me to finally have the courage to admit I am a liar. 

But instead of facing what happened in high school, I have been using lying as a coping mechanism to compensate for that feeling of worthlessness. 

I lied to my friends and family that I got into University, but I didn’t even apply properly. I was halfway through the application process and I stopped because I was scared I was not going to get in. 

I lie about being anxious for no reason, but the reason is because I am anxious that I lied. I do not like lying, it makes me feel like shit. Keeping this in is tearing me apart. Sometimes I lie so much that I believe it. Even small things. I make up lies to make myself seem better than I am, and then embellish. 

I have confessed to my best friend who is overseas about my lies, and she was very supportive. I confessed to my mother about my lies, and she told me she knew the whole time. 

What’s the next step?? I have no idea what to do and I feel so lost.

330,"Okay, so I'll try to form new relationships like a normal person would, but I'll usually reach this point where I'm just like, 'God, this is so much effort and I don't even really care so why am I doing this?' and then I'll end up ghosting them.

There are a few people that I'm extremely close to, but it's because we've formed these sort of unhealthy, destructive, codependent relationships? Like, I either can't give less of a shit about a person, or we're living inside of eachother's heads and feeding off of eachother like parasites.

Also, I feel like there's a giant gaping void of emptiness that's eaten away at most of my soul? And it usually makes me either not care about anything or try to stuff it down with booze and drugs and sex.

I just feel like normal depressed people aren't this apathetic and self serving and horrible and needy, you know? I've always wanted to be able to put a name to it so I could try to maybe understand it better and work around it, but I wasn't really ever able to get that far in therapy.",06Sep2019,0

I have a crush

\- I'm a 15 year old guy (almost 16)

\- I've been friends with her for almost 3 years

\- I can't get my mind off her when she's not around

\- I'm not the only one who likes her (friend of mine likes her too but doesn't know I do as well, although she rejected him many times)

\- She has no idea that I like her, although I may have tried hinting it once or twice

\- She's definitely one of the popular girls in my school - pretty face, nice body, short-ish

\- I'm more of a reserved person but can get along pretty well with everyone - average face, slightly muscular body, tall-ish

\- We both play for the school basketball team, have dogs, and some other things we have in common

\- None of my friends know I like her either, I've never told anyone; most people I don't fully trust, and I'm too scared to tell those who I do trust

\- Not my first crush, it's hard to explain but this time around it feels a lot more different, definitely my longest crush so far. 2 years ago I had pretty bad depression, and she was a huge factor in getting me out of it. Back then she seemed to be the only person that really accepted me outside of my close circle of friends (I used to be quite fat, 82 kg to be exact, and was generally sad all the time). Now, we don't seem to talk as much, although we still do talk, and I feel like I have drastically improved as a person as well (65kg, due to intense dieting and gym, somehow never sad, seeing the bright side of everything, generally how 2 years ago me would picture a perfect version of myself).

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to ask whether there is possibly any advice I can get in terms of like asking her out, telling her I like her, etc. Right now I feel like it's very difficult to find a good situation to do so, for we only have 1 subject in common in school (PE), and I can't really find any suitable place/time to tell her how I feel. Probably also the fact I have a HUGE fear of rejection, for I feel like 1 wrong move and I'd suddenly become the laughing stock of my school, since my other friend who likes her too gets a lot of shit for it (not by her, but by her friends and other people in the school, she's nice to him). Also, I'm worried that if I don't do something about my feelings sooner or later, I would regret it in the future, gut feeling I guess.",06Sep2019,2

334,"In the early parts of summer my older brother extended a hand for me to come live with him in the state of Connecticut, him, along with two of my nephews. One is 15, and the oldest being 17 years of age. Which I was extremely thankful for, because he helped get me out of a shitty living situation back in NYC. Before coming here, he and I both agreed that I'm going to follow his footsteps and get into security since I wasn't just coming to life off him. Fast Forward to the month of July when I officially got the ball rolling into finding work. Went in and passed my initial testing. Now this is where things start to get a bit weird. My brother at the moment is struggling a bit financially, and there's an $175 fee that this security guard agency requires before they can set you up with their clients. My brother from the start said he'd gladly pay for it. But it's been 3 weeks now and I haven't heard nothing being said about it. Not that I'm in a rush or anything, because I know he can't just drop $175 on his little brother like that and his bills needs to be paid

Onto his two boys. These two have little to no respect for anyone's sleep. I realized this around the second week of me being here. My brother and I have both had arguments with them about the late night noise. But it simply doesn't registry for long with them. They'll just resort right back to being inconsiderate a day or two later. Mind you this was when they were still on summer break. Recently they returned to school, which made me very happy. Because that meant a quiet household and better sleep, right? Boy was I wrong. Both come home around 3 in the afternoon, make something to eat and go right to sleep. No homework and studying. Just today the oldest of the two literally slept from 4PM to 3AM and is now walking through the house and playing music. Completely disrupting my sleep because I'm simply not on his wacky sleep schedule. Now you must be saying where is the dad.

It‘s very important to me that I can play the thing without my pc nearby, but I would love to try the thing on my fruity loops as well, so I can put in melodies for fun.

I honestly thought he did it on purpose given the context. He also shares a lot of his music, among other things, with me because we have the same taste.

I'm a little dense sometimes and I can't really take any hints. Someone will literally have to tell me word for word that they like me, in order for it to get through to me. 

I asked him today if he liked me or if he was just being nice to me. I told him I was dense, and I think he was annoyed with me after I told him. He said to me he already told me, and I swear he never did. He also told me I was being insecure and looking for reassurance which I wasn't. And then told me I need to work on my confidence.

345," Hi all,

I am in my early 20s (male). And i don't like to spend time around my parents, they are not bad people, nor i hate or have anything against them. Just whenever i'm around them i feel myself worthless, very pessimistic and have some kind of depression. That's probably the energy they have around them. Thus, i don't like to talk to them, nor involve them into my personal life.

My mom told me that i am an ungrateful son, as i owe her whole my life since she gave me a birth, raised and feed me.

Am i obliged to act the way they want me to? After all that blaming from my mom, deep down inside i started to feel myself guilty.

I only like to spend time around certain people, who boost my energy, gave me a good mood and i strive for new things, new achievements, around those people i feel like nothing is impossible for me, but when im around my parents it's a different story.

Even my girlfriend always says why i dont introduce her to my parents, the reason is i don't like them myself very much and not willing yet to introduce her to them. As i think, it will be a fake meeting since i don't value their opinion very much. i mean they are not bad people, just if they weren't to be my parents i wouldn't friends with them, just not my type of people they are.

We have a lot in common and so we quickly become good friends. It only takes a couple days before we are spending entire days together, and hanging out at her house until early morning for multiple days in a row. Now I’ve never really had a strong attraction to this girl but my feelings for her are growing, and I realize I’m now attracted to her. Things feel comfortable, and a lot of stuff happens. However, I know she has a boyfriend who is going to college out of state- they seem to talk a lot still because I always see message alerts from him on her phone (I don’t snoop at all, I just notice them when she’s got her phone in her hand or something). As time goes by I feel like we have a mutual feeling but I can’t be sure. I don’t consider myself attractive in any way and I’m not confident that a girl could be interested in me, yet for the first time I feel like she does BUT she has a boyfriend. She also occasionally refers to be as a friend, or guy friend. I know I’m being a bit vague but there are just little things that seem to say she likes me. Overall it feels like mixed signals. I like being her friend so I don’t want to blatantly ask about it and potentially ruin what we have, but at the same time I can’t ignore that we are just “friends” yet we’ve spent most of the past week together in person, and FaceTiming as well. I’m not trying to pursue her as a SO but this has come naturally and unexpectedly and I feel like we have mutual feelings. What the fuck you think is going on lads?

But yeah, I’m a 19 year old guy with very intense depression, anxiety, loneliness, guilt, etc. whose been starved of any attention or love or friendship ever my entire life pretty much and has very few things I can relate to with normal people that isn’t just talking about my pain or what I’ve gone through in my life, which isn’t what I want people to have to talk with me about every time, and I was raised in the ghetto and projects most of my life too, where everyone’s rude or dangerous or are drudged out or are disrespectful, and I am too squishy and sappy and a crybaby and hate having to even kill bugs or tell a teacher that I don’t know the answer to a question cause I’d feel bad. Not to mention, I was the only white boy in my neighborhood or school for a long time and that made me feel extremely alone in I didn’t act like, talk like, think like, or look like anyone around me, and I more than once was bullied or targeted for being either white or for being just so different. I still live in slightly similar areas but they’re less dangerous and stuff, though there’s still no one I can relate to or properly interact with anywhere near me. Anyway, I’ve been struggling with something lately and want to know how to stop it or something without intense pain. First, I’ve been raised in a family of almost only girls, and since I’ve had no friends my entire life and have left the house very little and had no reason to look for personal pleasures or interests or hobbies a large chunk of my life in an attempt to numb myself so I could be less of a bother for my mother when my dad was alive and my parents would argue or fight physically even, and after he’d died when I was around 9 when it was left just up to my mother to raise me, my little brother who was 5 at the time, and she had to do a lot of the work to raise our half-sisters on my dads side because their mother was a large alcoholic and no one was being there for them, so she took that upon herself despite struggling to properly raise her own kids, but anyway, I have little I know how to talk about with others and talking to girls is far easier for me than talking to guys. With guys I feel afraid or insecure or like I’m just not one of them, regardless of their personality, so it makes it difficult to have guy friends so I look for girls to talk to instead. Second, I’m addicted to being nice to people and trying to make them happy or smile or feel cared about. I hate the way I’ve felt my entire life and I almost always have had this deep cold crushing feeling in my chest and throat and stomach and it’s the most agonizing pain I’ve ever felt and I’ve always been extremely empathetic towards others so me having this much pain is only really helped by me being able to bring someone else any amount of joy or happiness or pleasure, despite me also feeling like there’s nothing good about me and I’m a burden to all I talk to and anyone who decides to be my friend is setting themselves up to be hurt. The only good friend I had in my life was a guy I met online who we stayed in touch with for 2 years, but during that time he attempted suicide or wanted to every few days, and every time I had to convince him otherwise, and it almost always worked. It kept getting harder and harder to help him, and the pain it caused me having to see someone that was important to me being pained and miserable drained me of what little energy I had in life but I couldn’t give up on him, so I kept trying and trying, eventually I had a bad day before we even got to speak, and I was in a horribly depressed mood when he told me he was gonna try again to kill himself. I wanted to fight to keep him alive until he could just listen and get the help he actually needs but there was just no energy in me and I barely tried to help... A month of anxiousness and pain and guilt and anger at myself passed where I heard nothing from him leaving me to only believe he succeeded. Then his mother leaves me a message to contact her. Being the fucking coward that I am I spent 6 months just rereading the request, over and over knowing that I should but I don’t think I’d be able to go on living having to hear out loud what had happened, it would’ve shattered me far more than I already was broken. After the 6 months, I unfriended him and deleted the chat out of frustration with myself and needing to move on but being too afraid to just call them. It hurts so badly but I stand by it enough. I’ll never get closure possibly but I couldn’t go on like that and at least after some time had passed I could think about things other than that in the day. But anyway, back to like, my point and stuff. During that time when he was suicidal every other second, I needed to get rid of all that pain and I don’t have any other interests other than people and talking with them or learning about them or trying to make people happy, and it led me to talking to some girls online separately. They were all really wonderful people and they deserved more happiness than they were getting in their life, and I was too friendly and caring, both because I just am that way to everyone already, but I also had developed the issue from my loneliness that I fall heavily in love very easily due to just being desperate for attention or love or to be cared for and seen as important in some way, and I just have issues seeing any bad in most people and being too understanding of even the worst problems a person could have. Anyway, it led me to being in multiple relationships, it killed me inside so much to be with each one and to not be honest with them. I truly did love each one, that’s not a good thing but I really cared for their feelings and worked towards their happiness in every way I could, and they were each happy and cared about me and I knew it was so wrong and disgusting but I couldn’t help myself, they got to hear the amazing aspects of themselves and to feel cared for and I tried to even make them not love me I tried to explain to them I’m a horrible person and they’d be hurt if they were with me but they wanted me to not push them away and I just dug myself a hole I couldn’t get out of without feeling even worse during all the other stuff. Worse yet, one decided to start being sexual and stuff and sext me and things like that, and the way they talked made me blush and get flustered and feel way to good and happy inside and like I was wanted more than ever before and it served me better than it should because I’d been an extreme pervert since I was like 7, even younger but I hadn’t looked at porn of any kind before then, but yeah, and I ended up being selfish again and ending up doing the same with the others. I had no self control and if I did I don’t know what kind of pain I would be in now if I barely held myself together beforehand. But after being with them for a while, one slowly drifted away and one day just stopped messaging me, which I was relieved about because the guilt had began to eat me alive from the inside stronger than ever, even if I was able to be rid of the loneliness and sadness from before the guilt wouldn’t let me be okay with that and eventually I managed to get the others to lose interest too. One didn’t but is in a relationship and was the entire time so they didn’t care about whatever I did, they were just lonely too and wanted me to continue giving them love and attention too still so they’re around even now and I feel bad but I have no intention on getting in the way of their relationship directly and I proposed that I’d leave the picture fully once they are planning marriage and all which is hardly a good thing still but I dunno, it’s a lesser evil I guess. Anyway, I then avoided contact with anyone other than them for a long while and the loneliness hurt incredibly but I didn’t trust myself around anybody. I let my best friend die and I just don’t talk or act the way nearly any guy I’ve ever met does, and I don’t like many jokes they make and can’t relate to much of what they talk about or how they talk about it, and I just am generally uncomfortable in most ways with them, and any girls who give me the slightest amount of attention 90% of the time I fall head over heels for them, so I went without it and tried to go back to being entirely alone like before, only it’s even worse as I got that taste of the good feelings and joy I felt in being with them and being wanted or making them smile or talking about dirty stuff with them, but I went okay with that for a while. Now the loneliness is unbearable again and I find myself wanting to go back to trying to find girls who could love me or give me attention or affection or something or who I could flirt with and talk dirty to and things like that, since I still have no clue how to talk to guys and they’re hard for me to enjoy being around at all, and I just wish I could be normal and just have friends normally and not want all these things so badly or to have myself hurt so intensely by not having it because I hate when I’m selfish even in the slightest ways, but it’s like the part of me that would do anything for anyone else is fighting with the part of me that desperately wants to just be selfish and take what I want and stuff and to pretend that since I make them happy or feel good then it’s okay to lie or something, even though I know that’s untrue. Just does anyone have any advice on how to stop these things or for me to be able to control myself without the heartbreak and pain and everything? I just want to not be selfish and to be normal and to have friends I can talk to and enjoy the company of but it just seems like the rest of my life set me up to not be able to have that without more problems than I can handle. I haven’t slept longer than an hour or two every day for the past month and have eaten barely anything either for that long because of me wanting to just have that affection again and to have girl to talk to or make smile and to let them know in what ways they’re beautiful or valued and stuff, but I know it would make me a far worse person that I already am right now to do that again. Just, I don’t know, how do I fix myself? I’ve wanted to go to therapy but my family has had really bad experiences with them, and I know I’d be too stubborn in that environment to let them help or for me to help myself. Not to mention it will cost my mother money and I’m already a financial burden and other burdens as is. I don’t know what to do and I feel like killing myself non stop and the pains unbearable. Don’t worry about me in that part, I’ll never kill myself as that 1) would be selfish of me to do that to my family, even if they don’t show it at all properly I know it would be devastating to them and that they care, 2) It wouldn’t be what my friend would’ve wanted for me and like, that’s all I have left that I can do for them which is to keep myself alive and stuff, and 3) I’m just stubborn, I’ve yet to ever cut myself or anything even, even though I have the worlds most tempting urge to. I can deal with doing nothing about my problems, but I’m afraid I’ll crack and become bitter or angry or mean or a bad person, worse than I am at least, if I don’t find some way to at least get rid of my loneliness soon cause I feel like my brain or heart is just gonna split in half. That’s all that I wanted to say I think, but yeah, if anyone has any advice or help they could offer at all, id appreciate it a lot, even if it might not be what I want to hear. Just any help I can get is so needed. I can’t stand being alone anymore but I don’t want to be this way where it ruins any chance I could have of just being friends with people.",06Sep2019,1

Hey, I don’t really know where else to put this. Basically this is a really nuanced situation with a lot of different aspects to consider. I’m asking for advice, but I also just need to get this off my chest. 

I have a crush. Yes I am 16, yes I’m a teenager, yes I know this happens to almost everyone. I just have never had a lot of luck in the past with crushes. When previously I liked someone, it always failed. One crush said I’m ‘annoying’ and that I ‘talk too much’ (which granted is probably true, but still). Another one admitted to my wingwoman that he had a crush on her when she was trying to help me out. Those both happened when I was 14 newly 15, so over 18 months ago. Since then I haven’t really had any feelings for anyone. 

Until recently. I don’t ever get complimented on anything other than my academic skills. However, the other day I got a compliment totally out of the blue from a boy, I’ll call him Zach. Zach doesn’t really speak to me, as we aren’t in any classes together or anything. However, we used to be closer in middle school, although we were never close to best friends. Anyways, Zach randomly told me in the hallway that he liked my hair, and specifically my hair color. Now I have a very love-hate relationship with my hair, so this means a LOT to me. 

Of course, because I am a teenage girl, I’ve been obsessing over this a bit. Although the more and more I think about it, the more and more I am crushing on Zach. He is totally my type: geeky, nerdy, passionate about what he loves, and confident. Yes, I realize that this is high school and in the grand scheme of things there isn’t any way we would get married (I’m not even sure I want that with him!). But these feelings are very real to me right now. We also don’t have too much in common, although we do have a few things. 

I am a big believer in the fact that girls should take initiative. You like that boy? Ask him out! And considering homecoming is right around the corner, I would love to just get up the courage to just ask him. 

Here-in lies the problem though. There are rumors flying around that he might be gay. I go to a very conservative Christian school where being gay isn’t exactly okay. I refuse to put someone in a position where they feel they need out themselves or endanger themselves in order to explain themselves. 

There are a lot of people that have previously thought me and Zach should date. He is aware of this fact. Zach can not possibly be oblivious to the fact that he has rumors about him floating around. I don’t want to put him in a position where he has to choose anything suddenly. Maybe my anxiety is just really really abnormally high, but there are a few outcomes, even fewer of which are good, that come from me asking him to homecoming. 

1. Zach is not gay, likes me back, accepts, everything goes smoothly. 
2. Zach is not gay, does not like me back (was just being nice with the compliment), accepts anyways to save face/keep rumors at bay, is unhappy
3. Zach is not gay, does not like me back, does not accept, everything is okay
4. Zach is not gay, does not like me back, does not accept, rumors continue to fly anyways and it gets bad
5. Zach is gay, accepts to save face/keep rumors at bay, is unhappy
6. Zach is gay, does not accept, no one bats an eye, everything is okay
7. Zach is gay, does not accept, everyone freaks, he gets outed/put in a dangerous position 

As you can see, in my 7 possible scenarios, only 3 end up with things okay (#1, 3, And 6). I am aware this all is in the mind of a hormonal 16 year old girl who is probably WAY overthinking a very simple compliment. (I am also aware of the possibility of Zach being attracted to more than one gender, considering I am myself, but in my school that’s almost worse than being gay, so put those ideas where you will in my list.)

At this point, I don’t know what to do. I just want to know something rather than be trapped in this area of limbo where the ball is in his court, and I don’t know if he knows that fact. 

He Reddits, I know that. Hopefully he doesn’t come across this. There was so much more backstory, but this is the most relevant info. I also don’t want to put in too many identifying things. 

Help? Either support or advice, or a harsh dose of reality if you think that’s what I need. Thank you. 

TL;DR: I have a crush. He might be gay. Help?",06Sep2019,2
357,"I live in Sweden and I think high school here are a bit different from American high schools. Basically you have to pick a school when you’re 15/16 depending on what you want to become as an adult. I have no idea what I want to do so I decided to study economics ( business and law).  And now I think I might have made a mistake. I’ve always had an interest in art and there is a school for people interested in art (estet). But there is a couple of problems. 
1. It is in another city which means I’ll leave my best an only friend behind here. The city itself has also bit of a bad reputation and isn’t the most fun.
2. This is the biggest issue for me. Going to an art related school is very frowned upon in Sweden. The people that goes there are known for being a bit “strange” (which I have no problem with)
These things normally wouldn’t bother me especially since it’s for the most part just jokes. But I’m terrified that my family wouldn’t respect me if I went there instead. I know they would say they do but I know them. They have always looked down at people from art school and said that they have no future. Even my cousins and my grandparents have been very vocal about their opinion on art kids. 
Our family is very small where I live and I really don’t wanna become the laughingstock. I mean my grandparents were disappointed in my cousins just for deciding to study Chinese instead of German. Everyone in my family has a tendency to be a bit judgemental.
I know they’ll try and support me but they just seemed kind of relieved when I said I would study economics.
I don’t know what to do. Should I just keep studying economics with basically no one to relate to but keep practicing art in my spare time. Or should I switch schools and MAYBE be happier and make more friends.

358,"So I work at a certain city alone ( no family ). My family lives in a different city that’s 1 hour and 20 mins away almost. In the city I work in, I do have a family house but I’m bored at out of my mind and I’m very very lonely. My question is, is it worth it to drive from work to my parent’s house everyday after work and come back at night to my house ? Or at least every other day? Instead of just the weekend.

359,"So today I caught my mum cheating on my dad and I really don't know what to do.

 So basically this yesterday I was supposed to be at my bands practice which we have every Thursday. My mum knows this as it's a weekly thing I've been doing at the same time for like a year now. Anyway, we cut the practice short as one of my friends was feeling ill so I headed home about an hour earlier than usual. As I got home I headed up stairs to my room but I could hear some noise coming from my mother's room. I could hear her making noises that were clearly from sex but I could also hear 2 other men in there. I carefully had a peek through her rooms door and I could see my mum having a rough 3 some with 2 other men... one had his penis in her mouth and another was inside her from behind... 

I've never felt so sick in my life as I do right now. Seeing my mum having sex with 2 other men is absolutely vile. After seeing that, I managed to creep back downstairs and I left the house and drove to my grandparents house which is where I am now.

I'm confused on what I should do. My dad usually works away for 1-2 weeks at a time and I know their relationship has been a bit rocky but I never thought this would happen. I really want to tell my dad the truth of what I saw but I don't want to ruin their relationship and cause the family to break up and I don't know what the best thing to do is here.

361," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ttthe company name I said then  ‘ohhhh/mmmm...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look at my hair funny in a wtf face if I had it styled or just untouched is that a bad sign?

When I seen the cage, it was not broken and it would have definitely collapsed if it had that impact fall on it. I am almost convinced he killed him on purpose and I wouldn't be surprised since he has raped kids and beats woman. My mum (alcoholic) said she found him on the cage and kicked him out. I asked her how she found him and why the cage wasnt broken and she didnt really say anything. It also wouldn't surprise me if she knows the truth and lied for him.

However things at home as you can imagine have been pretty strained since this has happened I feel like affection is being forced by both of us rather than being naturally shown and I’m wondering wether this is a natural part of the healing process and we will get through it or that I’m simply delaying the end of the relationship, I don’t want to break up with my SO but at the same time if it’s the best thing for us both it might be less painful in the long run.

School started about 3 weeks ago and when I got to my AP Physics 1 class I realized that I knew absolutely NO one in my class except 2 people. Everyone in there was my same grade level, it’s just they came from another feeder middle school and I’ve never seen them in class before. I’m pretty sure more than 95% of them don’t even know my name. Almost all of the class is composed of males (and most of them are in band, so they have their tight friend groups already). The remaining 5 or 6 females fall into one of these two categories: either extremely stuck up and popular OR creepy/weird girls who slack off in class and just sit on their phone or flirt with guys (not being mean, it’s really how it is). And me, a female. I’m pretty introverted but I work very well with most people in all my classes except this one. 

Anyways, around our third day we were assigned the classic mouse trap car project which is due on September 17 (a little less than 2 weeks from now) and it’s supposed to be a group project with 2-4 people. Me, knowing no one in the class, decided to get in a group with another girl who didn’t know anyone. But here’s the problem - she got moved out of my class and now I have no partner. The project is due in 2 weeks, I need a group, and everyone already has a group. All my friends who are taking Physics are in another class period, and my teacher already told me I have to find someone in the same class. Now here are my problems that I’ve been restlessly stressing over for the last few nights

1. Most everyone in the class has a full group already
2. If I were to ask a group of guys to join, because the project is to be completed out of class that means I’d have to go to their house or something and work with them (don’t think my parents would feel entirely okay with that)
3. I could just suffer and work with the popular girls but I know I’d be doing all the work and I just don’t think any of it would go well
4. I wanted to ask my teacher to work alone but I’m afraid of what he’ll think. He’s a good teacher but is very sarcastic and I feel like if I explain my situation he’ll just say “well you just gotta find someone and get in a group”

I probably waited way too long to resolve this issue because almost everyone is in a group already and starting on getting materials this weekend. I don’t go to that class until Monday, soo...

I have two options at this point:
1) Try and explain this as best as I can to my Physics teacher and find a solution or see if I can work alone (highly doubt). If this gets denied then I’ll have to stick to option 2
2) Message one of the popular girls on Instagram and try to introduce myself and get in a group (the other girls are already in groups and I have no way of contacting them anyway)

I just feel terrible and I’ve been stressing nonstop over this. All my other friends are in great groups with people in their class periods. I’ve never been in a situation like this because I’ve always known at least 2 people in every class who I can work well with. In fact, I feel like I’m being over dramatic about this situation but I just want to get the best grade possible. I know people on here will probably tell me to just suck it up and find someone, but that would be super hard for me. AFAIK everyone in here has a group already and I’m pretty sure I’m the only loner 

TL;DR - don’t know anyone in class, most people already in full groups for project and I need to find a partner(s) ASAP!!",06Sep2019,1

373,"*Background:*

*Together for 2 years like a married couple. He has past unresolved traumas that make his doubt about us way too often. He reveals to still have feelings for his ex. Doesn't know if they're grounded in reality or not. We break up*

Conversation 2 weeks post breakup:

Him: ""I feel like fixing my doubts, whichever way this will take me. Of course I am very scared of losing you and of course part of me doesn't want to just let you go. But I don't think that I will just fix my doubts easily like that, and I don't know what the outcome will be. Therefore I don't think it would be right for you to wait.
[...]
I don't know if fixing my doubts means that I will realize that actually I should be with you or that actually we are not right for each other
[...]
all I can say is this: I had all these doubts which I was not able to fix, so there must be some reason for it. I don't really understand it, but I don't think it will just be resolved, so I think you should just live your live without waiting for me""

Me: ""so you want me to just forget you?""

Him: ""Selfishly no, but the right thing is probably to move on..
[...]
When I try to be reasonable, I have to say that the fact that I have all these doubts is in itself enough to say that we cannot be together. So as sad as it is, I don't think we have another choice than moving on
[...]
Don't you think we should try to be rational?
For now, my doubts were there and I guess that's a sufficient reason to move on, no?
[...]
We understood by now that something doesn't work. And I will not be able to fix it like this, I don't know if it is something to be fixed. We tried this last time..
[...]
I feel I can only really understand all this by moving on.
I have no idea if I will give another chance to her. 
Unless at some point I am calm and think it's the right thing. I will tell you in case I come to that realization. Right now I don't have any interest in this, I am a mess and I am trying to get some peace and clarity, that's all.
I just feel like I need to be by myself, without anyone waiting or depending on me, to get some clarity.""

Him: ""I still think the same thing as two weeks ago: I have doubts which don't allow us to be together, and I feel that to understand them I have to be alone, and not just in the sense of a break. So I don't think we should wait for each other, I think we should both just live our lives""

Me: ""why not just a break?""

Him: ""Because I would not feel free and calm, I would feel guilty and I would feel under pressure to figure things out. That's what we tried last time..""

Me: ""If you finally feel this is how you wanna deal with it I just have to make peace with myself and accept it""
Him: ""I don't think there is another way...""
Me: ""I did my best, that's the only thing I can say for sure""

Him: ""Yes you did""
Him: ""I'm crying like crazy but somehow I feel that we are doing the right thing""
Him: ""Just take good care of yourself and try to preserve your sweetness and purity in this harsh world""

(Knowing him, I'm sure he was pretty destroyed when writing these words, he is never so tragic)

Me: ""I'm not crying and I don't think we're doing the right thing ;)""

Me: ""I just think that I cannot solve your doubts and I did my best, so my job is done here...even if I wanted to live my life with you. 
But yeah, it cannot be one sided""

Him: ""You did everything you could""

Him: ""No, I am not ready for this I think""

(Typical goodbye talk after this)

374,"Hello.

Today I recieved a letter in the mail. Its a regular evelope with german post stamps on it -&gt; possibly by a private person.

Its one of those ones with a clear window. Behind it you could see my name and address so the address wasnt written on the envelope and its printed not hand-written.

I opened it and - other than the address - there was nothing on it. I am expecting a delivery of rubber belts for a stereo from poland but not from germany.

When I looked up the return address I got a different name than on the envelope. The name is also just a single word so I presume its fake. Name: ""Niewiadomski"" - not doxxing him since its not identifying and im sure its fake. Looking it up its some sort of polish writer or something.

375,"I am sixteen years old. I am 5”7 and 145 pounds. A few years ago, I had some body issues and I would skip meals because I saw myself as fat. Then due to some trauma I became depressed and really stressed, so I started eating a lot. Now I am evened out mostly, even though sometimes I’ll relapse and stress eat to where I’ll throw up, and  skip meals. I am naturally really skinny and have eaten healthy. Though, recently I have quit band so I can’t burn off what I eat now, so I’ve been trying to stop stress eating and eating less and very little to no snacks. Not really a diet, but more of watching what I eat since my stomach does have some fat on it that I’m trying to burn. I also have been doing more things to keep my depression in check. Though recently, my step dad has been really worried about me and he made a rule saying that you have to finish everything on your plate, so I’ve been taking less things for dinner or ordering off the kid’s menu. Now when I ask for half a chicken breast, he gives me one and a half, I ask for a happy meal, he yells at me and makes me eat a whole ten piece meal that I can’t even finish and I’ll probably throw up later.

381,"I’m having massive anxiety thinking about this situation. I am a lifeguard at a resort that was hit by Hurricane Dorian. My boss wants me to return back to work this weekend. Im not sure if she wants us to lifeguard or not. 

Well, last week my coworker decided to confront me about an “attitude I’ve had” meaning he was mad I wasn’t speaking to him because he was being a VERY shitty lifeguard and a very toxic friend. And my mom taught me if I have nothing nice to say, say nothing at all. I will be making a sexual harassment complaint and go to HR. (He has sexually harassed me in the past and said very inappropriate things to me.)

While coming in on my day off to help evacuate and prepare the resort, my boss proceeded to yell at the whole department, not including lifeguards, saying that we weren’t helping evacuate the resort, and that we were lazy, despicable and in her words “horrible, disgusting and I want you all to get out of my face.” The whole department had worked our asses off to get the resort ready for the hurricane. She overheard OTHERS saying that they didn’t want to do a certain job. I was too busy to do a certain job but instead she took that as I said I refused to do certain things. 

After that, I lost it and became emotional and angry. My coworker who has never liked me thought she was high and mighty and proceeded to call everyone out because she did that certain job (just like the other lifeguard, can you tell their friends?) Well, I called her out and told me I am not going to let her speak to me that way like she has been for months. She then yelled at me to shut up, over and over and over. I have witnesses to everything. It is also on camera. 

I do not want to work with them anymore. BUT, i’m supposed to be transferring to the front desk soon. So I think if I tell them I do not want to continue working in that certain department my job at the front desk will be gone. 

How do I handle this situation? I’m so stuck and I don’t know what to do. I’m scheduled to work on Saturday but I’m thinking about telling my boss I won’t be in this weekend since my college classes have been redirected online which is 100% true and I’m taking very difficult classes.

385,"Hey all. I’m having a lot of anxiety about a group project we’re doing for school.

First, I should preface that I strongly dislike teamwork. I know it’s to prepare you for IRL career, but I rarely have good team-project experiences.

So we’ve known about this project for at least a month, profs kept reminding us to come up with topics and groups. The other group picked their topic like 2 or 3 weeks ago, &amp; been doing preliminary stuff.

My group kindof formed a week or two ago, &amp; last week we presented our ideas to the class. No consensus, so we met yesterday to decide. Still no consensus, we’re doing a vote today.

Well, at least we can do some work on the weekend right? Nope, they want to meet on Monday, discuss more, then start together.

I find the situation frustrating! I don’t know what I’m building, they won’t let me start, I feel like we’re going to get stuck with a topic I don’t like, and it’s really making me tense.

Also 1 of the teammates told us yesterday they’re taking 2 days off to do their own thing. Didn’t ask, just told us like it’s no big deal. :( Sure, it’s not like our final project is due very soon.",06Sep2019,2

I was laid off yesterday and I want to make certain I handle everything appropriately. Here are the details.

- Rcvd rest of current check hours + two weeks severance pay
- IF I sign their severance paperwork (which I plan to have two family members review), I get 3 months access to a company paid job placement program, am still eligible for unemployment, and get another check for $4k gross. 

Finance:
- Husband makes 3 to 4 times as much as I was. He would like me to use the money to payoff my credit card, and the rest to cover one bill payment going forward. He thinks he can support us until I get a job. Today I am going through my necessary payments and cancelling subscriptions. I really want to payoff my card as well so I've decided to use the opportunity I've been given. 

- Filing for unemployment today 

- I know I need to review my 401k? I don't know anything at all about that, any advice here would be helpful

Paperwork:
- Today I am reviewing the paperwork I was given and sending it off to family for review
- I'm going to cash the live checks I was given and put them in my obligations account, and budget out future expenses so i know where that money needs to go


Job Search:
- Going to review and update my resume, upload it to Glassdoor, Indeed, and Monster. I reached out to a recruiter yesterday and if I sign the paperwork I'll have the placement program as well

- Any advice on salary jumps to find a new position?  I feel I don't have the right to be picky about jobs right now and would love advice on traps to avoid or when I have the right to say a job isn't good enough to consider 

- A good handful of people reached out to me yesterday for References so I have plenty of those

391,"A few ~~weeks~~ months ago I had a week of bad depression for the first time in years and happened to ask myself when did I start feeling unworthy of everything from girls to jobs to university's. For context, I have declined relationships and given up on job and uni applications because I feel worthless.

I wound up having an epiphany by remembering something I had shut out of my memory and now I can't bring myself to speak with my two best friends (BF 1 and 2) from way back in high school. 

In the beginning of sophomore year, I was good friends with my first crush. The feeling seemed mutual - the class queen even asked me why I hadn't asked my crush out yet - so I asked her out and she said yes! I was friend-zoned the day after. Ouch but hey we were still good friends and remained in the same inner circle of friends going to loads of party's and concerts together until the end of HS.

Then just a few weeks after, at a mutual friends bday party that was probably a little too fun we went crazy with lots of alcohol - but the first thing I see when I wake up the morning after is BF1 and crush arm in arm on the couch looking at me. I acted like I wasn't even surprised and just went with it. They had a long happy relationship lasting until she moved away for uni.

I never spoke with anyone about how I felt about that and I pushed it out of my mind with surprising efficiency on the rare occasion I thought about it or the one time BF2 asked me about it many years later. (It came up when he mentioned that BF1 had asked BF2 if it was okay for him to date BF2's X. BF2 said yes but wasn't really ready for it). I don't think I said anything meaningful during that conversation just sorta zoned out..

Throughout high school our group of friends grew like crazy. I was the kid with the cool parents who let me throw awesome party's all the time. I had an amazing experience but I was always a third wheel despite a few missed opportunities.

Only ever ended up popping my cherry to what should have been a drunken one night stand. My first sexual relationship was at 22 with a woman I was not attracted to but was with for a couple months. I then had a 5 month relationship with someone BF1 set me up with and I loved her but she broke up with me because of the long distance plus I have poor communication etiquette.

10 years after we first met, BF1 and I talk to each other about once a month if not in the same city and do stuff together when we are.

Three months or so ago is when I had the epiphany and I can't bring myself to even read any of the messages from the old group of friends. I know they must be worried; I've had similar depressed vacations from reality before but never this bad or this long. I haven't answered any of the old friends who wanted to meet up over summer because we were in the same city because I'd feel guilty about answering one and ignoring others. The moment I think about BF1 or the old crush, it has the potential to fill me with all sorts of emotions that start a positive feedback loop of self pity and misery that can last days. I am afraid to share with friends and loved ones because I don't want to infect them with bad vibes or make BF1 or anyone else feel guilty.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, that's what I'm going through rn and I really wish I wasn't. I'm starting a new job today in a new city and the baggage follows. Sorry for the wall of text I have no idea what's even relevant at this point.

My mind is all over the place right now so if there's anything missing, let me know and I'll elaborate asap.",06Sep2019,2

394,"So I (19m) very recently moved back in with my mum and sister (16) because I broke my wrist, meaning I can't work until November, and I can't pay rent without working. 

That being said, I work as an assistant manager at a popular pizza place, and we recently had quite a few people leave because of school starting, so there are a total of 2 people (including me) who know how to close the store. While the manager trains more people, I decided that I'd come into work anyway and help take calls/customer complaints/close the store to help out a bit. Anyway, this means that I'm usually working from 9pm-2am most nights. 

A couple of years ago, while I was living at home originally, my family got a pet dog, a golden doodle called Obi Woof Kenobi. I love that dog so much. She's cute, energetic, but also super cuddly. However, over the summer, my little sister got another puppy. This puppy is a 4 month old beagle called Leia. Very cute, but is still untrained. 

Because she's untrained, when she's left home alone, they keep her in a crate to prevent her from going to the bathroom everywhere. The problem of this story though, is that the second my mum and sister leave for work/school, Leia won't stop crying and barking as loud as she possibly can. 

The problem I have, is that I've been getting about 3 hours of sleep a night for the past week or so because I can't sleep with the sound of a terrified dog wailing echoing throughout the house. I've tried moving the dog into another room on the far side of the house, and it doesn't work. I can't just leave her out of the crate because she'll disgrace herself every, and she'll destroy everything because she's teething.

It's been great so far and has given me energy to do the regular things that ppl do like brush my teeth, leave my house and what not. But all of a sudden I've been having paranoid thoughts and start thinking that bad stuff is going to happen, is happening or has happened. But recently I found out my wife is pregnant. We have been trying and honestly she's a great person she doesn't hide anything and she's just works comes home and hangs out with family. But for some weird reason I just keep thinking that maybe she's been cheating and that kid may not be mine. As I type this out I feel very stupid and don't want to post it.

How do I get over this feeling?I really just want to be happy like am most of time.",06Sep2019,1
400,I’m a 21 year old female who’s been living with a roommate for the past two years. They recently told me they’re going to move in with their s/o in January and I’ve since been trying to decide if I should look for another roommate or get a place on my own. I have a full time steady job and can easily afford a studio or one bedroom and I think it would be exciting to have a place to myself but on the other hand I can tend to be forgetful and irresponsible and also have had trouble being alone a lot due to my anxiety. But on the other hand my social anxiety makes looking for a roommate and living with someone I don’t already know very scary. I would like to try it out on my own but I’m worried ill be miserable and lonely for a year since none of my friends live in the area I want to stay. What are pros and cons of living on your own? Has anyone had the same dilemma? Also if I decide to get a roommate how early should i start looking for someone? Thanks in advance for any advice!,06Sep2019,1

But less than 20 mins ago out of the blue they say 'it's best we don't talk anymore', and I'm very confused. I tried to see what the problem was but I never got an answer. We've been pretty chill with each other for as long as we've known each other and we've never had a fight at all so I can't figure out why they don't wanna be freinds now?

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ttthe company name I said then  ‘ohhhh/mmmm...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk.

She seemed like a nice woman, we hung out for over a year, doing things as a group with my friend group and one on one at each other's houses, which is nice because our daughters are close.

Now she has started accusing me and others of my friends of talking behind her back, running her down to others, and even of isolating her child by saying negative things to other moms. The messages seem paranoid to delusional, and I can guarantee none of it is true. This is a nice group of friends and we are supportive of each other, so this is our of nowhere.

Looking back she has told us in the past she had problems with her daughter being bullied and isolated and she has problems with her neighbors. Maybe this should have been a red flag. I told her flat out, you are wrong and no one is speaking ill of you, but she continues. She still comes out with us and doesn't discuss, except to say things like okay, I just want you to know I am aware. I am just being honest about it.

I wanted to ask for some advice on a big problem i have... There is a lot i want to achieve in life.

My problem is... i can't get myself to actually start, or continue doing any of this. Most of the time i just play games on PC, read a book, or procrastinate in any other way. Sometimes, i'm super bored, and i want to open up some japanese lessons, or blender, or do some exercises... but i just end up not doing it most of the time, and staring blankly at the screen.

Did anyone have similiar experiences? If yes, how did you overcome this, and started... doing something with your life instead of wasting it?

I'm not huge by any means (4'10 and 150-160) but I'm not small at all either. My height makes me have larger ""assets"" than most but I've still got a little chubby stomach. I haven't felt comfortable since me and him had started dating because I always saw what his 'type' was (super skinny and fit girls) and I'm nothing close. After the conversation last night, I finally brought it up to him and about how I wanted to feel sexy because I don't most of the time with him. He initially pushed it on me as I just wanted validation from him to be sexy, but I dug deeper and he finally admitted that yes, he likes smaller non-chubby women. I know he loves me for me, but I'm having a hard time with feeling okay myself. I don't feel sexy and he doesn't tell me my body is beautiful or that I have a sexy body.

I lived with him and his family for abit, they treated me like a maid and expected me to clean their house daily (thats 5 people, including me and I was the only one cleaning. They didnt even scrape their own plates/put stuff away after them/make coffees or anything), i left after being spoken to like s*** one too many times, moved on and was polite to all of them. Anyways, im pregnant with his child and since weve found out, they havent been involved at all. My family has bought everything and they havent bought a thing, I dont hear from them and they dont often ask my partner how im getting on. My partner started having seizures and his family was rude to him so i ended up having a massive argument with them all (a few weeks ago). Now we dont see eachother or hear anything from eachother (fine by me). Ive only seen them once since for about 5 mins and I was civil but they were all ignorant, bar his nana (the main one that was rude to me) who gave me a hug and asked how i was doing. I was polite and told her i was well and asked how she was. Anyways, fast forward to this week:

I blocked his step dad after it happened because hes always been the worst and i dont want him seeing anything to do with me because hes always been a c***. I have his family on this game that I play and they started attacking my village out of nowhere?? (They never have before, i found this very childish and just thought it best to delete the game). And yesterday, when we announced our childs gender and name on social media, I tagged both of our families. 

Now i always tag them and my family to make it fair and thought that it was the most respectable thing to do, to just keep that the same. NOT ONE of his family have liked/reacted/commented on the post. Ive told my partner that i find it really rude that none of them have even liked it when we are super excited yet all of my family have commented and reacted. I know its only a little thing but theyve all been online and if this was before the argument, they would have reacted and most of them would have commented too (which they all did to the pregnancy announcement). My partner doesnt get why i think its rude. Am i just overthinking? Im so fed up of his family being rude to me and me not being able to do a thing about it. Advice/opinions please???",06Sep2019,1
426,"So I have had a very sexually peppered life and have enjoyed a lot of “out there” things. I love kink, swinging, and even the occasional gangbang. I started a new relationship in a city far away from my friends, family, and lifestyle. The guy I’m with is really kind and thoughtful. He has done a lot to help me with moving here and to take care of my pets. Really a great person over all. The only problem is that he is only interested in monogamy. I respected that so I got into the relationship and let go of taking action on my poly, kink, Fetish lifestyle. Two years later I’m frustrated and angry that I had to close off this part of my life to be with him. He has tried to open up to the idea of a multi-way but it’s more like “something we will do a little before we get married and settle down.”  So it’s more or less a no. 

Recently I received an offer from my friends back home to fly me in for a weekend, all expenses paid, to see everyone and possibly get a little naughty.  Old me would have lied and just told him I was going to a theme park or something, current me wanted to be open and honest so I told him the truth of the situation. That did not really help. Now it’s the ultimatum between me going and doing things to reopen and explore that part of my interests or staying with him in the relationship. I want to see my friends, I want to explore with them sexually, I want have fun but he feels it’s a betrayal. 

I’m bored sexually and he keeps saying “well just have some ideas of what you want to do and we will explore.” Unfortunately, my interests are usually too extreme to test out on him. I just feel like I’m in limbo. 

The move here provided me with a stable job, stable boyfriend, a house, and routine. Which is nice but it’s so boring. I’m used to going to fetish parties every weekend, making videos and selling them online, having internet slaves sending gifts every day, getting to play with my multiple play partners.  I miss the fun and discovery. Now I’m just a corporate drone in at a 9-5 pace. I feel like I have no sex drive, I feel like I’m 40 and have no energy to be the fun young woman I am. 

I have to get him to open up or I guess I have to leave him. Have I made a terrible mistake?

The agency I am with have a policy that if you are currently in a job they do not look for another even if you ask, only if the contract ends.

Recently I've been applying online for various jobs and today i got a phone call from another agency asking me to register with them on Monday 10am.

My current job is 7.30 per hour with no increase of pay to happen and this new one is 8.26 per hour with it going up to 9.41 per hour.

On the application it stated urgent, people needed but when I asked about an actual start date they said they cannot give one as they don't have exact dates until they have someone.

My concern is I call my agency up saying I've found another job, register at the new agency but don't start straight away.

He has been married for 4 years and recently had a newborn, his first child. He was always known for being a little flirty, and before I started working for him I hardly knew he was married as he never posted about his wife on social media at all, or rarely ever mentioned her. We had known each other for a few months just through the community and he asked me to work for him at his family's new resturant. I took the job, and thats where trouble began. His family went away for the week, so me and him spent about 10 hrs a day together alone which obviously created room for flirting and tension. If im being completely honest, he made the first move and I told him no because he was married. But I kind of caved in after a little bit. And the worst part was, I actually began to develop deep feelings for him and vise versa. This whole affair lasted about two weeks, but he was so charming and it was like he was the male version of me. We were both the same soul, and everything just made sense. Our jokes,we had the same favorite songs, everything. When his family came back, we played it cool infront of them. His mother loved me, his younger brother would call me often to ask for advice, his little sister confided in me as she was homeschooled, his older brother relied on my for work, and his wife thought she could trust me..... we never had sex, but we did pretty much everything else and he was inside me but we just couldnt go through with the sex. Anyways, the other morning a get a call from his friend explaining that his wife went  through his phone and saw our messages and that his wife will soon try to contact me. Since then, I've had two missed calls from him that I did bot answer because i thought it could be her and a missed call from his mother! (The whole family knows at this point, safe assumption for yall to make but I quit the second I got the call from his friend). Im freaking out! I deleted my instagram and blocked his moms number. I dont know what his mom wants from me? To call me a whore? To curse me out for tearing apart their family? If the wife tries to contact me, should I answer or just remove myself out of their lives completely. I dont even know what to say!

436,"I am almost 30 year old guy who just get married and I have a kid on the way. I am terrified! Beyond terrified! I don't know why I keep losing everything! It happens almost everyday. My phone, keys, and wallet. I forget my keys literally every time I set them down. I forget my phone in the car or on my desk at work. I forgot my wallet on the train, bathrooms at airports, and parking lots at shopping centers. I forgot wallet at the same shopping center twice at the same publix. The second time was yesterday, and yesterday was the breaking point, because I forgot more than my wallet. 

Breaking Point: Yesterday morning, I took off my wedding ring and left it next to the bathroom sink (I dont remember how or why I took it off).  I then went to work, but when I arrived to the office, I realized that I did not have it on. My wife was not going to be home until 8pm because she works really late. I went to publix during lunch time, and I somehow forgot my wallet in the shopping center. I didn't realize it was gone until I got home when a good Samaritan found me on facebook and messaged me saying that they turned it in to the sheriffs department.

I arrived home around 7pm and started cooking because my wife was going to arrive in about an hour. When she came in, I remembered that I dont have my wedding ring and that I had left it next to the sink. I ran to the sink to put it on, and my wife follows me into the bathroom (She followed me because she knew). I try to discretely put on the ring but she notices. I make up the stupidest lie possible. ""I had cilantro under my ring. I had to remove it and wash my hands"". She asks: ""Did you have it on today?"". I said ""Yes"" and the quickly diverted my answer ""No"". She catches my lie because while I was at work, she actually came home and saw the ring next to the sink. She then proceeds to call me a liar as she is very upset and disappointed in me. 

I made up a stupid lie in order to shield myself from embarrassment of how I forget things all the time. This habit of losing stuff is destroying me and now it has put my marriage in jeopardy in terms of trust. I dont want to lie to my wife, I don't want to be a coward about telling the truth and I don't want to lose things anymore. I think I have an attention problem. HELP!",06Sep2019,2
438,"( I'm also paranoid if anyone I know sees this but I need some help ) This is also a copy and paste from another subreddit but I thought this sub would help. 

So I've been crushing on this girl since the end of term 2 ( around 3 months ). We haven't known eachother before highschool but we got put in the same class for year 7. 

I started talking to her and hanging around her more. Something she would do all the time is push me around ( In a jokey way, nothing bad ) and we would mess around. And my friends, being basically immature would always ship us and make jokes and rumors that I hated. She didn't take offence because this is happened to her before in public school.

At the start of term 3 I noticed a few cuts on her hand. I simply said whats that and she said her cat scratched her. Which sounded believable because she actually had cats. So we would keep hanging around eachother and keep talking and texting. I never knew if she liked me back but I was sure at the time.

She would always joke around about jumping of the balcony of the schools block that went pretty high and always made death jokes and stuff. But recently I've been confused 

The pushing and touching has been getting worse and she finally came out that she had been cutting herself. She wasn't angry or embarrased or sad but happy? Yep, she didn't seem bad about it at all. I told my friend that went to her public school last year why she did it and he said ""I don't know, shes been doing this since last year and I've tried to stop her but I've given up."", So she had been doing it for some time.

Whenever I ask her why she pushes me she either says ""Because I can."", Or ""It keeps me occupied"" So she basically meant she pushes me around and runs into me to take her mind of cutting herself. Which made me very confused. 

So from all this week she kept getting more cuts on her wrist ( around 4 to 5 ). Always covering it or looking like it hurt. Which I felt bad and kept questioning why she would do it. She kept saying problems at home, but she never told me what problems. But she joked about her cuts whenever she got the chance which made me sad.

So like I said earlier. The pushing has gotten worse. I got home after this week of school with bruises on my arm, Saw legs and back ( From pushing me into stuff ) I may sound like a bitch saying that but I genrally felt useless to everyone, like a tool. 

So today before school ended she pulled out her scissors and started cutting herself IN CLASS I kept on pulling away the scissors and telling her to stop and she kept on smiling. Almost playing with my emotions until it started to bleed and then she stopped. I was about to cry right  then and there. I don't understand how this is funny and I just felt terrible for her to just do that in class.

Whenever she pushes / touches me I never do it back with force. Just a playful push. But she's been doing it  worse and w o r s e and more annoying. I never talk shit about my friends when they joke about me. Even though I am pretty sensitive and formally had really bad anxiousness. 

After that happened today I rode home and walked up to my bedroom and just cried there for a while . Like that feeling when you NEED to cry? Yeah, that.

So I've been used by a girl, pretty much abusing me if you could say that, to cope with her not cutting herself.  I just feel like a fucking fool for doing this to myself. For what? To get more hurt and for people to humiliate me making me look like a loser. I'm just over it and I'm pretty much done with crushing with her now after knowing the truth. 

Is there any advice to stop her from abusing herself? I feel like I can't tell any of my friends since they would tell everyone so just PLEASE help me out. Im just about done with life.",06Sep2019,0

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ttthe company name I said then  ‘ohhhh/mmmm...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk.

So for the past week I thought we had a fruit fly problem. Then upon closer inspection, these bugs do not have red eyes which is apparently a marker of a fruit fly. They also don't seem very interested in any of the food we had out (which has been removed just in case). Then I thought they might be drain flies, and I draino'd every sink in the house, followed by a gallon of boiled water, followed by a 5:1 water:bleach solution. I then used a bleach based chemical to scrub any bleach tolerable surface in my home (laminate, marble, granite etc.) and they are STILL here. I kill about 10 per day, and when I go to sleep I think they are gone then I wake up and find 10 new ones.   


I was able to trap a couple and got a picture of decent quality, and as you can see the fly has a striped body. The second photo is included for size reference.

450,"No idea if this is the right place to post, but yeehaw.

I've noticed that the way I've been acting isn't normal, and I want it to stop. 

Examples:

Staring at people. If I see someone cute, or who's wearing cool clothes, or has cool hair, I always tend to stare. I never realize I was staring until I look back and recall a good minute of staring at this person.

I also til this day have a weird need to hide. For no reason I'll go and hide in my closet, or under a table, or under my sheets until I'm found.

In public, with no music on, I always just dance and jump around. I do little dances with my hands, arms or feet. I only realized this was weird after I saw people staring at me with ""wtf"" looks in their eyes.

I also have a bad tendency to scream if I find something funny, or if I'm overwhelmed.

There's other things- but even writing those things down would embarrass me to my very core.

I'd quickly like to mention that I'm not doing these things to seem ""QuIrKy"". I don't know why I do these things, and whenever I look back on doing them i feel so so embarrassed. But it feels so natural in the moment- I don't know how to catch myself

Also, as a side note, I feel like my brain doesn't work.

This happens most when I'm doing math or studying anatomy. (I like art)

It's so hard to explain. It's like my brain can't fathom what's happening. Like I'll hear my dad explaining a math problem, (home schooled), but it doesn't like, click. Like I can hear him but nothing he's saying is actually there. I can't comprehend anything that's happening, I guess. Same with anatomy, long text, or generally questions.  I try so hard to focus but I can't see, or hear what I'm doing.

That sounds silly, I know. But it's really really awful. It's horrible having to get something explained to you ten times only to feel like you've been told naught.


So, those are the things I'd like advice for.

452,"Okay, so I’m in a bit of dilemma wondering if the way I’ve been using my medication is abusive and if it could hurt me in the long run.

I’m taking Dextroamphetamine for my ADD, and I notice that it does two things: it gets me high, and reduces my appetite. Both of these things only really happen when I haven’t been taking it on a day-to-day basis. So I’ll essentially purposely not take it on weekends or days when I don’t need to focus especially hard so that I can feel high the next times that I take it. My doctor has told me that I don’t have to take it every day, and I don’t see any withdrawal effects on days when I don’t take the medication. I also find it useful not to have a large appetite on work days, because I often don’t have time to eat a full meal at lunch.

All I’m wondering is, should I stop doing this? I know that trying to get high off of it sound bad, but I’m taking the recommended dosage and NEVER go above it. I also legitimately need the medication as well, not because I experience withdrawal but because my ADD has a huge impact on my focus.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",06Sep2019,1
453,"So I have just moved to a new area to be with my boyfriend. I have a hard time meeting people and making friends sometimes, so I was really proud of myself when my coworker said they were starting a new campaign for newbies and I asked if my boyfriend and I could join. At this point he had wanted to do this, and seemed excited when I told him about it. We are now five three hour sessions in and I absolutely love it. We have so much fun, and while I had noticed that he didn’t seem as engaged when I would ask him he told me that he was having fun too and nothing was wrong.

Now last night after our fifth session he tells me he doesn’t really like D&amp;D at all and he wants to drop out. My immediate reaction was just disappointment. I really like playing AND having it be something that we do together. Also, I feel that it is a bit upsetting that every time previous I would ask him if everything was ok when he clearly didn’t seem as engaged he told me he was having a good time.

That's when I remembered something I had always hidden in the back of my mind: my best friend got with my crush way back in the beginning of high school only a few days after she changed her mind about going out with me. It wasn't a one off thing, either: I got to stay good friends with my crush throughout high school often getting a little TMI. No one ever talked to me about that despite the whole class explicitly confirming to me that my feelings weren't one sided before I asked her out.

2- made out with her friend about 4 months in and at least told me she did. But to me that felt wrong and like cheating. We talked about it and she regretted and aid it wouldn’t happen again. So I guess I’m ok with it 
3- dominant sort of person, unsure as to whether she would actually stick by my side. I think in my mind I wanted a ride or die girl and instead I ended up picking one who is strongly opinionated 
4- our values are different she’s super liberal, I’m conservative 
5- I feel like I put in 75 and she puts in 25 in regards to the relationship 
6- has this issue where she never asks to see how I feel about doing something. It’s just always doing what she wants 


Where it gets conflicting in my mind is that I like her but all these factors really dwell down on the relationship. I’m in my mid 20s and thinking well this could be as good as it gets. Or do I just move on and cut my losses?

And the more twisted things I do the more I want. Like more and more and more, fisting, pissing, scat, you name it. I have done it. I have the endless desire to be humiliated and forcefully fucked by guys. My therapist says this is all deep psychological trauma from my unbearable and horrible relationships with men in my life- my father, my uncle being the worst abusers.


I have a new fantasy now that I am planning to make happen. It's sick and crazy but I am obsessed with it. The rough pretend gameplay is just not doing it for me. I want to insinuate a situation in which a guy or guys will rape me for real. Like a real rape. I have been trying guys at local bars to see if someone would look or sound in any way as a person that would do it. Then I invite them to my place like I really wanna have sex, we start doing something and in the middle I break it and say I don't want to. Like in the hottest moment. And I ask them to leave. I always pretend to be super drunk too so they wouldn't think I can put up much of a defence if they try to rape me. I have tried that on several guys so far but no one has done it so far. 




I have also been walking around the streets at bad neighborhoods at night wearing really tight girly short pants that my ass is basically out of but nothing has come of it either so far. A few guys yelled something at me the other night and I was hoping they would engage me but they didn't.

Years back I had normal regular life and I was working on my career. I have a degree in biology and I was on my way to medical school. Studied for 2 years to take the MCATS and didn't score well enough to get into medical school. Then my fiance left me and a few other huge personal grievances. Friends and family started dying around me. 

The culmination of these events caused me to have a mental breakdown and eventually fell into deep depression. I got treated for it but somewhere during the treatment it took a turn for the worst and I fell into such a deep depression that I didn't even leave my house to see the psychiatrist. For the next 2 years I mostly spent all my time in bed and rarely even spoke. Had to move back in with my parents. 

Luckily I eventually got better and got out of depression. Today I am fine and normal again with the exception of my speech. It has become harder to speak out loud but I have made huge progress and I believe I will fully recover my voice and articulation. 

Once my depression was over a year later, one of the few friends I had left got me a off the books job which I was eternally grateful for however, the working conditions was so bad even a desperate man could not continue. Eventually I quit, that was 2 years ago.

I had been trying to rehab myself back to my normal. It's amazing how much one can be atrophied in isolation. In not just skeletal muscles but in skills such as problem solving and memory. Currently I believe I am well rehabbed but I would like some guidance on what to do. 

My only goal now is to become a normal functioning member of society again. I am so broke that I don't even have a phone plan anymore. Due to my extended periods of unemployment, I am very worried I can no long pursue a career much less a career in the science fields. 

I lost many many friends over the years from my self imposed isolation and have very few resources left. My credit is shot and I am lost. Although I feel mentally healthy again, I must admit I am rather nervous about the prospects of my future. I don't even care about having a comfortable living, just enough to support my parents.

Oh and I didn't realize I could have gotten unemployment during the period of depression so is there a concern about proving my period of unemployment due to medical reasons? Would having the history of depression also affect my chances of getting a job?

471,"So I met my roommates online and I really like them both, I’ve been living with them about 6 weeks but haven’t actually spent much time with them. I’ve been going to AA meetings a lot after work and I can’t really tell them about that, and a lot of the time I just stay in my room because I’m pretty socially anxious. Often I’m even too scared to cook for myself. 

My roommates both hang out with each other a fair amount and usually have a couple beers or smoke a bowl. I don’t want to become the weird reclusive roommate but I might already be that honestly. Plus I managed to leave a pair of my underwear in the dryer which then ended up on the kitchen table and I didn’t realize it was mine for several days. 

I feel like I’m often brusque in conversation because I don’t want to bother or interrupt anyone. I may or may not actually be coming off that way. Whenever I do spend time with them, we usually end up laughing and talking about something enjoyable. 

I’m thinking of trying to just be out in common areas doing art more?

474,"DISCLAIMER: ENGLISH IS NOT MY FIRST LANGUAGE.I APOLOGISE FOR SPELLING MISTAKES.

So I train basketball, but our trainings go to the extremes a lot of times. I don't know what happened but me and my team mate were fighting for the ball (jumping when it bounces of the board) and I felt pain in my left knee. It wasn't super bad but I couldn't get up with that leg for 2 days.

1 day after I only felt a little pain because I didn't exercise but I had to prepare for the season and I thought It would be fine until we ran for 15 minutes on quite a fast pace without stopping or slowing down and you weren't allowed to stop. It became a lot worse and hurt even when I walked normally but no one really believed me so I still had to do half the hellish trainings and then some exercises that don't get a burden on your knees.

I'm back home and I'm training again after a period of about a week of rest and the second we started running It hur like hell again. I tried telling my parents to take me to a doctor but even tough we have free healthcare in the country they hate wasting their time, while they still force me to train. I used an excuse up until now to get out of training. What do I do?

P.S No one believes me because I have an amazing pain tolerance and always stay calm, like in 6th grade my finger got severly broken and I was just calm, even fooled the doctors into thinking it wasn't severe so they got a big shock when they found out it was really broken.

477,"Hi r/advice, appreciate this forum and you reading what I have to say as I do not have many friends or family and therefore lack a good sample size of people to poll for advice.

A few years ago, I founded a company with my partner (yes, romantic partner). We both have similar skill sets, and we are both quite alpha and decided to co-CEO the thing - whilst sometimes that doesn't work, we have worked together before and had seen other companies start to do it. He is more technical than I am (it is a tech company), and I am more idea-focused, but both of us wanted to be on the commercial side (he had no interest in leading the tech or product side) so we decided to share all responsibilities rather than split it up (yes, in hindsight, bad idea). This evolved into us using joint emails, us always saying 'we' for work we did even if one of us did more (or the entire thing and the other just reviewed it). It also resulted in our personal relationship taking strain. 

Now, I am a woman (and he is a man), so it was normal to me that most people would look at my partner, favour what he had to say, and even sometimes ignore me. However, partially because of the way I behaved as a person, and the way he is, there was also certainly a disrespect to me from key people in the company because my partner is quite honest and to the point and would therefore tell people certain things, or disagree with me passionately in front of others (again, can't blame this, because some of my behaviour was flawed in the beginning as well) - in fact, a senior employee and I had different disagreements over time because of our relative personalities and the above, and ultimately it exaggerated the disrespect and made his team (most of the employees) also disregard my opinion and trust my partner, also because he is better on the technical side than I am and proved that over time. All of this has made me quite miserable in the work place and actually feeling inadequate - like I didn't have the potential I thought I had, and maybe that I couldn't do it.

As we have been growing and doing well with the company, we have started hiring more. The newest senior hire suggested we split up responsibilities because he noticed that the way it currently was was actually causing problems. Now, I wouldn't mind taking the technical side of the business - I would potentially quite enjoy it - but given my partner is better, the team and senior employee have verbally confirmed not trusting my views relative to my partner (and do not treat me with too much respect), I would be in a shitty situation every day that would just ruin my self esteem and make me feel terrible. I want the other side of the business because I feel like I could build it well and also have a chance to grow my self esteem again and prove that I can do a good job, that I really am the founder I thought I would be. My partner refuses to give me the half of the business that I would want, because he wants it too (fair enough - completely - you have to look after your interests too). 

So, now I am wondering, since he isn't budging - should I stay and come up with a compromise that would make me sad every day, or should I go and just start something different? Of course I'd be sad with leaving, but I am trying to get more content with it since the alternative seems to be really suffering. 

FYI: the senior employee cannot be replaced for many reasons, nor should they be because they aren't doing a bad job.",06Sep2019,3

Recently I’ve been dreading going into work with all of my soul, for the past few months every time I’ve been called in to do a shift I’ve felt physically sick and I start to panic. I think that this is due to the fact that the customers at the place I work (venue for parties) really bother me. They are loud, drunk and often rude and insulting. I don’t really blame them as they usually are absolutely shit-faced but I find it harder to work in that situation each time. I have a shift tomorrow night and I feel terrible about it! I cancelled a shift last week as a friend was coming around for a catch up and my boss asked the day before for me to work, so I feel trapped and not able to cancel again. In addition to all this, I’m going to university soon and I think the pressure is building up even more and making me feel worse. As scared as I am to do this, should I cancel my shift and quit completely due to the stresses it puts on me? I have worked there for almost 2 years so I feel like I’d be letting my coworkers and my parents down for not being able to hold the job. Once again, sorry for the rant but I’m already in a bit of a panicky state about tomorrow’s shift.

487,"When I first met my ex I had also met another guy within that same week. I wanted to get to know the both of them. But things were moving much faster with my now ex than the other guy. So I politely told the other guy that I was seeing someone and to just remain friends. My ex knew about this guy because I was hanging out as a group with the other guy. But I reassured him I had cut off hanging out with him and that we don’t really communicate. 

Almost a year later my now ex broke up with me. We both still love each other but he was “ready” to be with me. He wanted to get himself together and then come back in the future. I was frustrated because I wanted to work things out together but he needed things to be done his way. So we parted ways. He unfollowed me on Instagram. Which I was confused because he wanted to stay friends. But whatever. 

Soon after I ended up reconnecting with the other guy again. We’re still just friends. We haven’t gone out together or anything and that’s fine. We’ve been commenting funny comments on each other’s photos cuz we both have the same sense of humor. It’s nothing but playful banter. But I guess my ex noticed cuz he unliked all of my pictures. My profile is public so he could go and check my stuff if he wants. I guess he noticed and got upset. Does this make me look some type of way as if  I was not being truthful to him during the relationship? I was was down for him I picked him over the other guy for a reason and I fought for the relationship but he’s stubborn and ruined things so I mean he’s not entitled to who I decide to socialize with afterwards. 

Would you get suspicious of me even if you were the one that broke up and you see your ex reconnect with someone you kind of were concerned about from before?

I've seen this said by other people in regards to, say, someone who is trans or bisexual or another orientation.

I don't understand why this would be offensive, so I guess I'm looking for an explanation as to how this could be taken the wrong way? I don't think having a ""type"" is seen as being racist or transphobic or not being inclusive. You're not drawn to people with that ethnicity/race/gender/orientation. It's not a big deal, but apparently it is? Like, I'm into guys who happen to be engineering majors, or have beards. How is that different from saying you're not attracted to a trans person or a black person?

* Freshly out of a 10 year relationship. I desperately wanted to get away from everything I knew.

*Never lived out of state, so I applied and took an east coast job in a midsize  city. (Im from the south.)

* I did not know a soul  in this new location.

* Social life in this new location is better, but not perfect.  I now realize I was the cause to 50% of my social problems back home. And those problems have followed me here. With this knowledge I want to begin therapy. So my thinking is  if I'm going to be fighting my personnel demons I might as well do it near family.

491,"My manager is so bad it's having a psychological impact on our small team. 

He had clearly overstated his experience for his current position, and therefore isn't helpful when we need to learn something. 

Moreover, he is incapable of setting priorities other than ""make it a priority"" along with 4 other priorities. Normally I would find it easy to prioritize if we were made aware of project requirements/intended result etc, but he either doesn't know them himself or is just making up tasks to keep us busy.

He is incapable of scheduling to the point where we all work extra hours, or opening on a morning after closing (less than 9 hours break).  He doesn't acknowledge when we work extra hours or seem to have any awareness when it's shift end and makes no comment about lieu time etc. 

He disregards my suggestions for troubleshooting issues despite it being a fix that has worked for me in my last experience, or straight from a manual/forum.

He is absent from his workstation most of the day and is seen simply walking around different areas of the facility not really doing anything. Which the team perceives as not doing any work while we are barely taking breaks and trying to get work done. On top of that, he pressures us to work faster. 

So while he is not making any off-policy jokes or remarks, or being outright abusive/bully, he has killed team morale and we would all like to see him go, or we would like to get out from under him. 

We have talked to his manager (who hired him) but we have not seen any improvement. We are now concerned he is falsely presenting information about our working abilities up the chain, and distorting return information to us in order to protect himself. Basically, he tells us that his manager thinks we are slow getting work done, and as a result we don't get bonus days off we are entitled to/offered upon hiring. We could probably get projects done faster, but he keeps pulling us off tasks in the middle of working on them to do menial work like inventory and junk removal ( which could be assigned to other people). He changes up things so often that it's hard to focus on specific things. 

I have never been so stressed and unappreciative of a role before in my life. I fit in with my colleagues and we get along fine. 

I see other people in elevators happy and smiling like they enjoy their work and people attending free training sessions that I can't even think about because I'm exhausted/worn down by his behaviour. I'm sure I look like the total opposite. Normally I'm one of those happy, friendly, smiley people. I can barely fake it in front of some of the other managers.

She was running late to a meeting, got lost in the city, parked in the first garage she saw, ran to the meeting (getting lost again on her way), and in her rush, completely lost track of which garage she was in. She left the garage ticket inside the car.

Her google maps was shut off on her phone, so there is no record of her location data. Apple maps gives approximate locations, but she was all over the city so the area is still spread out.

The vehicle manufacturer cannot help as the GPS is not activated and cannot be activated unless you're inside the car. The police will not help as the car was not stolen.

We have almost no leads, except that it is somewhere in a garage somewhere in The Loop. That's about 50 garages spread around downtown.

501,"Hi guys. I'm 30 years old and I live in quite a shitty country. My life has been shit for the most part but in the past 2 years I managed to turn it around.

A little more than 2 years ago I got my first proper job as an assistant (excel tables, etc). The company is privately owned by a millionaire. I steadily climbed ranks and gained more and more responsibilities (starting with helping fill our site with content and now I admin 3 sites and manage 5 social network accounts), my salary is currently 3.5 times higher than 2 years ago. 

Because it's privately owned, you can pretty much get fired at any moment by the boss (depending on how close you are to him - most people don't directly communicate with him and do his assignments, so they are safe). Usually he gets close to one particular worker, gives him a lot of work, praise but then when they do something wrong (even a small thing, one dude called him when the boss was at a meeting and got fired) they get axed on the spot. He fired 3 guys this way so far. We have HR but owner's word is the law. 

A couple of months ago I started getting more attention from him. He says he sees a lot of potential in me, says I'm smart, effective and not lazy (lies lol). I'm now being swamped by his assignments (I used to have 3-4 free hours a day at work to browse reddit or do side jobs). He gives me assignments I am literally not qualified for like arranging TV commerials or partnerships with huge instagram accounts (I only have a community college education and it's not marketing - I hate dealing with people in general).

Last month he said he can give me a ""way out of Mordor (he calls our country that) and into the riches"". He says I can become a top level marketing director under his guidance (he's not great actually but his ego is huge) but I can only grow under his wing working in our European office. And he wants to do it sooner rather than later, in 2 weeks I'm going there for 2 days just to take a look. Then I'm supposed to give my answer. I really don't know what to do.

In my head it's like this:

PROS:

* chance to try myself 

* leaving my shitty country 

* chance to earn serious money (though he hasn't mentioned any numbers yet)

* chance to build good career

* if I don't go the ""what if"" will stay forever

* if I don't go he might consider me a coward and fire me?

CONS:

* being completely dependent on my boss and his mood. I know that I'm likely to get fired when he gets bored of me.

* probably having to work A LOT and I'm not a workaholic. In recent months I have started to become the person I hate: being on the phone well after my working hours replying to people about work stuff or posting instagram content. I want to leave work at 5 PM and BE DONE with it until the next morning.

* though it's Europe, it's Eastern Europe and obviously not a country I dreamed of

* Leaving behind my lonely mom who has weak health and can't even use smartphone properly (though she encourages me)

* he wants me to lead marketing and I am an IT person to the core. Machines &gt; people in my book.

* My GF doesn't want to go and we plan to get married next year

So I started writing a book almost a year ago. It's a fantasy story, the first part in a series, currently sitting at about 80,000 words (so I'm serious about it). I'd like to get it published my the end of school year and hopefully it'll kick off.

I also exceeded the amount of credits needed to graduate when I signed up for classes this year. Fortunately, our school offers a free period option in those cases. I took two free periods this semester and planned on 3 next semester. Most students just go home early or come in late in those cases, but I can't drive, and even if I could, I would still choose to stay at the school, so I could work on my book. I find that I work on it far more and better when I'm at school than at home.

So I come into the first day of school. My first free period is at the end of the day (my school switches back and forth the classes each day, so one day we'll have one set of classes, the next day another). When last period is about to start, I head to the library (which is referred to as the ""learning commons""), have a seat and get to work. A few minutes into the period, one of two ladies who sit at a desk in the learning commons walked up to me and basically told me I couldn't be there. Well, she said it was fine that I was there for that day (Tuesday) but after I couldn't be there. She said I'd either have to find a way home or sign up to be a TA, teacher's assistant. I asked her why I couldn't be there. She said it was primarily the principal who enforced the rule, and she agreed it was a weird policy. Apparently his reasoning is that if there's an earthquake (unlikely where I live) I need to be in a class, and that I need to be under adult supervision (I guess the two ladies at the desk don't count, for some reason). 

I went home and told my parents. They've always been hugely supportive (love you, mom and dad) and were rightfully pissed, particularly my mom. She said that when I get on the bus she expects me to be safe and under school supervision at all times, especially as a minor. She also didn't understand why my school has absolutely no option for study hall.

As for the TA option, first off I don't need the credit, and second, I don't get why I can't sit in the library to write my book. I've always been an A or B-student and haven't gotten in trouble since the 6th grade. And the earthquake excuse is an awful one.

So the next day, I have a free period first thing in the morning. I hop on the bus, ride to school, and walk a mile and a half away to find the nearest bench. I sit for fifteen minutes before I have to head back. There's a lot of forest around there, and we've got a lot of bears/cougars around. Not to mention people walk on that path, and while most were joggers or old people, a few were shady as hell. Not to mention it's 8 in the morning.

I tell a close friend and he tells me that last year he had a free period between lunch and the last period of the day, and he was allowed to sit in the library. The only difference was, he always had a visitor's pass. So I thought I'd try that, and he said he saw no reason why it wouldn't work. I walk into school today, ask for a pass, and am denied. Worse yet this lady sat and smiled as she told me I'm not allowed to be there. Meanwhile I'm on the verge of tears (I'm not the type of person who cries often, but the fact that I'm a student and a minor and am being told to screw off and then am expected to come back in time for next period really frustrates me).

So here I am. I'm considering going with the TA option - I would rather not, it doesn't make sense why there's no study hall, but I have a teacher in mind who knows I'm working on a book and would probably allow me to do that most of the time. It's not even that I'm super pissed about, it's the fact that I'm not welcome at the school right now.


It's especially hypocritical for this school to do this - they have a huge program that's dedicated to helping students work toward their future in whatever way they can, and yet they won't let me do that by writing my book, something I'm passionate about.

But what bugs me the most is the fact that all this tells me is the school doesn't really care. They'd rather send me a mile away in the middle of the woods than let sit and work toward my future, all while two adults sit in the same room and I'm in plain view of them the whole time. As a student this makes me feel awful.

TLDR: My school doesn't offer a study hall so when I try to use my free period to actively work toward my future by writing my book, they kick me off campus and force me to sit on a bench where bears/cougars live and shady mfers hang out. 

So my end question is, do you think the school is justified? Should I go with the TA option, or try to talk to the school w/ my parents? 

Thank you for your time. Have a great day.",06Sep2019,1

516,"Basically I'm a customer service manager for a clothing/swimwear company. I answer all customer service inquiries via multiple channels. In addition to this my boss and coworker in charge of social media, treat me like an office assistant. I wouldn't have a problem with that if it was disclosed during my interview or was listed in the job's description when I applied but it was not at all. So basically I have to do my actual job (which already should be at least be a position for two employees) and whatever other assignments are thrown at me, which are typically important and time sensitive! So I have to prioritize one over the other and not everything can be completed correctly in the allotted time frame. Obviously this ends with either customers upset at the time frame in which I respond to them or a boss constantly hovering over me until something is done. This has caused me so much stress that just thinking about going into the office makes me so anxious I become physically ill at times. I know quitting will be uncomfortable but I have to do it for my own sanity at this point. The one thing that makes me extra nervous to quit is that the office I work in is VERY small.

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ttthe company name I said then  ‘ohhhh/mmmm...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look at my hair funny in a wtf face if I had it styled or just untouched is that a bad sign?

518,"So I posted a similar question like this a day or two ago, but I wasn't very specific last time, and I've considered several other factors which might jeopardize my little adventure to gayland. 

For context; I (19F) haven't traveled much in my lifetime. Most of the more 'exciting' trips (to other countries/to larger cities) I've been on happened when I was a child/teen, and in the company of my family. So I don't have much experience in traveling alone. If any.

I live in a small European country and we're having our first Pride event on the 8th. Me being a careless daredevil and all, I've already planned my trip to and back from the event, despite not having anyone to accompany me there. I *thought* I could pull it off, but now I'm doubtful.

I only now realize how risky this is, considering;
1. I'm a young woman traveling to a city all by myself. Go figure. 2. This country is NOT LGBT+ friendly, and there will literally be counter-protestants in the same place as us. Which probably means a brawl will erupt the moment we arrive. 3. The cab drivers of this city are apparently notorious for being scammers. So that's just swell. 

So considering these factors, should I go or should I just pass this one up (as much as I'd hate to do that)?",06Sep2019,2

521,"Hello. I'm in dire need of advice, I'm really not sure what to do at this point or where to look for help, especially since the person who needs help lives in a different country, so I don't know what steps are available for me to take.

I have an online friend in the US, Pennsylvania who's 20 and currently lives with her family. She's constantly, emotionally and sometimes even physically abused. They will eat her food, control her phone, manipulate her relationships, call her work, take her car. Her brothers are unemployed and so is her mother, who depends on the check they get from the state and my friend's salary.

I (and a few other friends she's opened up to) have tried to help her through this situation, either by simply being there for her, looking for organizations and places for her to stay, offering to let her live at their place for a while, trying to talk her into reporting them and/or moving out etc. A couple of weeks ago, things deteriorated. One of her brothers tried to kill the other and when she tried to stop him, he hurt her. She called the police, the brother was taken away and kept in a psych ward for a week or so. Her mother got really mad and told my friend that she wished she'd die. 

After not hearing from my friend for a couple of days, today we got a message from her that she's in the hospital with a collapsed lung and muttered something about her mother when asked what happened, without going into the details.

We've respected her wishes until now, but I'm getting seriously worried that something even more serious is going to happen and there will be no turning back. I've talked with a couple of friends who are also in the know about this and everybody seems to agree. Does anyone have any advice on what we should do? Do I contact the police? An abuse hotline? Should I ask a friend from the US who's also met her irl to report this since I'm in the EU and may not be taken seriously?",06Sep2019,1

525,"I’m a paralegal that works in a law firm that practices multiple areas of law: personal injury, business, employment, criminal defense, etc. It’s my first job as a paralegal after graduating paralegal school and have been on the job for 6 months.

So far, I like my job. I have flexible hours, work from home days, the bosses are nice, etc. However, I learned that I am absolutely terrible at personal injury. I did really well in the first 5 months when I worked criminal and business cases, but since last month, I worked slip-and-falls and car accidents, and I kept making a ton of mistakes in case work, not on purpose of course. I’m trying to learn from my mistakes,  but then I make new mistakes, and it’s just a mess. Personal injury is just not registering with my brain for some reason, and it’s really frustrating.

However, I don’t care for personal injury. I hate that field of law with a passion. I tried liking it to make it easier on myself, and it didn’t work. 

My question is should I start looking for another job that will be more aligned with what I want or should I stick it out and build at least a year of experience? Or should I tell my bosses that they can give me all other cases except personal injury?

526,"I'm assuming I'm SOL here and posting mainly to release some frustrations and to pass some time sitting in an airport, but maybe someone out there can help.

I had finally upgraded my camera to use while traveling and bought a Sony A7III. I was finally able to travel with it. I didn't want to take my kit lense and rented a much nicer one.

My girlfriend and I went to Cuba. The trip was great. Traveling home, we had long layover in Ft Lauderdale FL, so we decided to rent a car to go see some sights.

When I returned the car, an agent quickly met me at my door to go over everything and finalize the rental. My girlfriend grabbed our backpacks from the trunk, handed me mine and I put it on. With my backpack on, I didn't notice I didn't also have my sling bag with my camera in on my shoulder. It was still sitting on the backseat. A very stupid misobservation.

I noticed I didn't have the bag and was back speaking with a manager within 30 minutes. They assured me they were looking for the car, but it could be in a few different places, being cleaned, parked up in their massive parking lot, or sent to their ""base"", where they send cars to go to other locations, but the good news was that the car hadn't been rented back out. I said goodbye to my girlfriend so she could make the flight home. I missed my flight so I could be there for when they found the car. 

I was feeling completely stupid at this point but confident it would turn up as they kept asuring me they were looking everywhere for the car. I spent five hours in the airport, checking with them occasionally for any updates and even wandering their massive parking lot looking for the car. Finally, I spoke with the person over lost and found who told me the car was in fact sent to their base, but it was closed for the night. I was given a phone number to call when they opened in the morning.

I got a cheap hotel, a few hours of sleep, and called first thing in the morning. I was told they would look into it and call me back in 30 minutes. I headed back to the airport. It had been about an hour since the phone call. When I got there and again explained the situation, I was told that the car had infact been rented out again. It was rented two hours after I had originally returned to find the bag the day before.  They said they had called the customer who said the bag was not in the car.

So, last night when they assured me over and over that they could not find the car, but we're looking for it, it was actually 100 feet away and being picked up by another customer. 

I'm now still waiting in the airport for the car to be returned so they can search the car.

I've checked online classifieds and called local pawn shops. I've made a lost item report, which is what I've been recommended to do over and over. I've talked to several managers and at this point I just don't know if they're actually trying to do anything, because I was obviously lied to the night before.

If the car comes back and the bag isn't in it, I'll be filling a police report. Do I have any other recourse here?",06Sep2019,1

Pros: 
* I'd want me to if I were in her shoes
* Being blindsided is horrible
* She would at least have a chance to try and head off the situation
* It is morally right to be loyal.

Cons:
* Messengers get shot. Somehow, it would be me that ends up paying the price, wouldn't it?
* Snitches get stitches. It is morally wrong to repeat things said in confidence and tattletale on  your peers.

I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest she looks like a drug addict. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

545,"My girlfriend just entered college and im a sophomore in college. She has been struggling with depression for a long time, and as she is getting into this year it is getting worse as her financial situation has destabilized.

My problem is that throughout last year i think ive become a different person and when i saw her over the summer, it just didn't feel the same, and felt like there was no love there.

Frankly, im worried that im the only thing keeping her from a complete breakdown and possibly from attempting suicide. Ive suggested multiple times that she get professional help with her depression, but she doesn't have the money for therapy and her parent is no help at all, basically throwing her in the deep end now that she is out of high school.

546,"So in 23 now and I've not seen or spoke to my Dad in a couple of years. Having divorced parents since before I remember he's never really been there for me, and I can literally count the memories I have with my Dad (which are mostly bad anyway) on one hand.

We don't live in the same city, but whenever I have seen him since I left home five years ago, the effort was always made by me to go and see him, never the opposite - It's always felt like a chore for me to see him and that side of my family.

It got to the point where I just decided that I'd rather have no Dad than a shit one, so I completely blocked him out of my life and have been doing relatively well for myself since, and haven't looked back until now.

I miss the guy for reasons unknown, and he's been in touch with my other family members to try and get back on track with me.

554,"He (16) used to be fun and laughed a lot until he hit puberty. To summarize his current state:

* Spends almost his entire day in his room with the door locked.
* Has cut all contact with his friends to  the point his friends have stopped inviting him to anything.
* His only hobbies are playing games and watching anime.
* Whenever he gets invited to something by me or one of my parents, he replies with ""no."" If I by some miracle get him in my car to get some McDonalds, he wants to go to the McDrive and eat his meal at home in his room. If I go into the restaurant instead, he will just sit in the car until I change my mind.
* Doesn't even want to come when I invite him to something that interests him, for example gaming conventions, or when I ask him to watch an anime series together.
* Wears only black and rarely ever goes to the barber.
* Is underweight and refuses to eat properly or hit the gym.
* Takes walks at night and brings his pocket knife. When I offer to join him, he refuses firmly.
* Despite what one might think based on the points above, he does take good care of his hygiene and skin, and he had a job for 6h/week a few weeks ago, but his contract was not extended due to him 'not working enough'.
* Never really shows emotion. Always speaks quietly and monotonous.
* When asking him something that doesn't interest him, he does not reply at all and looks the other way.

I do realize that this might just be a teen phase and that he will change as he matures, but his social skills are so weak that he'll struggle both in college and in the workplace in the future. I know working out is a magic cure for unmotivated people to change their lifestyle, but I can't even get him to do a few pushups at home with me. Am I worrying for nothing, or is there anything I can do to help him? 

I just want him to enjoy the time when he's still young because time goes fast and he may waste his youth. I'm not asking him to completely change who he is, his hobbies can stay the same.

556,"Hi there,
So  some back story to this situation. I've been with my partner for 6 years. Our first year together we lived with his family (mom, dad, and two sisters) and it wasn't the best. Specifically because of his mother. She would constantly make passive aggressive comments and judge situations without knowing the whole story. It caused a lot of tension and I felt like I was constantly being attacked and living under a microscope. It wasn't until my husband and I got married almost two years ago, where I felt like I could have a normal conversation with her, without there being tension. And I can finally say we have a pretty good relationship. 
A year after living with my in-laws, my partner and I had our own place. But then his brother fell on hard times and moved in. And this situation was worse. He would not clean, and if we asked him to do something, for example dishes they would sit there for two weeks (I still cringe thinking about it.) So I would always cave in and clean. He also has a dog with VERY high anxiety and constantly barks. He was always gone and refused to do anything to help his dog. We were even receiving complaints from the city in regards to the dog barks. My husband also doesn’t have the best relationship with his brother so there was a lot of arguing. This lasted for two years.
Fast forward to now. My husband’s father passed away 3 months ago and his mother and brother are moving back to NJ. Currently we are all located in NM. My husband and I were originally going to go but we found out we were pregnant (16w) and I took a hard stand that we should stay. I was (and still am) scared to be away from all my family and friends during my first pregnancy and am also concerned about the stress from living with others. My husband has been helping them move this week and has been really depressed. He's never lived this far away from family and although they don’t have the best relationships, they are close.
My MIL has offered to pay for our own move later in the year if we change our minds, and would like us to move in with them. My husband thinks this is a great opportunity for us. The schools are better, there is a lower crime rate, and he has a lot more family in NJ. The downside is that we would be spending that 1st year living with his mother and brother. And I'd be leaving my entire family and friends during my first pregnancy. I feel incredibly guilty every time my husband and I talk about it because I know it’s my fault we didn't go. I hate to see him hurt, and I can't help but second guess myself. I feel like there isn't a winning choice. Did I make the right decision in not going? Should I suck it up for the chance at something better?
 
This is my first ever reddit post, so any and all help is appreciated. Also sorry, I know its supper long!",06Sep2019,2

562,"The snap read “f*ck me please” and was her doing like a kissing face. This friend is currently engaged and cheated on the dude in the beginning of their relationship with a previous ex and I’ve always felt guilty knowing about it. She knows my moral compass VERY well and knows I’ve exposed cheaters many times in the past to their partners. I HATE cheating and the selfishness that goes along with it, along with, you know, a plethora of STDs that the other person doesn’t deserve exposure too if they’re being loyal and happy to be in what they thought was a monogamous relationship. I have been cheated on various times by women I really loved and it broke me.  Have never trusted or loved the same since (spare me the lecture about seeking help I’m not interested cause I’m happy). I have no qualms with non monogamous relationships though as long as they are consensual on both ends. I know for a fact this one is not and the guy has equally as strong feelings against cheating as I do. 

The only thing that’s really bothering me is that I have enabled her behavior by not telling him the truth about what she was doing in the beginning and now somehow she thinks it’s even okay to attempt to sleep with me, a person she should know full well would never consider doing something like that. What do I do and what do you think is going on here? My experience with telling people about cheaters in the past is a 50/50 mix of unbelievably grateful people who have spoken well on my reputation and name ever since, &amp; people hating me and wanting to kill the messenger because I must be interested in their girl or wanting to split them up. I don’t want the drama  or losing a friend that could come with this issue because I’m very focused on my success and school but turning a blind eye to these sort of things makes you as guilty as if you participate imho. I’m a very logical person so just looking for people’s reasonings behind what they would do. Thankful I don’t have a relationship or much of an interest in one anymore for these reasons.",06Sep2019,1

564,"One of my co-workers (m) and I (f) have a relationship that's pretty complicated. 

Not long ago I had seen him struggling after a bad break-up and some other difficulties in his life and being that we're pretty friendly I asked him how he was doing and offered to listen if he needed to talk. Well, I listened and the next day things got kind of... interesting. 

He reached out to me and at some point during the conversation he propositioned me and it was clear he was drunk. At first I didn't know what to think and told him no. A few days later though after I we talked and it happened again I played along.

Fast forward a few weeks and we do have a pretty great night together. I messed up, I own that and let slip to another co-worker what happened. A few days later I'm talking to the guy and he's like ""why's so and so yelling at me"" turns out she was telling him off for getting involved with me when he was talking to some other women and trying to hook up with them. He reached out to one pretty much as soon as I left that night. I wasn't confrontational about it but I kind of told him that finding out about it made me feel kind of used.

We both apologized because we had each been somewhat unfair to one another. I kind of avoided talking to him for a few days and eventually he messaged me and told me he wanted to go back to being friends and to having the good relationship we'd had before.

My problem is I can't see him as just work friends or whatever we are now anymore. I still see him as the guy I hooked up with and talked about seeing outside of work again. I'm kind of at a loss... I don't know how to move on. I usually don't have a one night stand which originally I saw it as potentially more. If it were just some rando it would be easier but I see this guy pretty much every day.

569,"I (19f) have about five different roads I could take as I enter this next chapter of my life, but none of them seem ideal. I just want some outside perspective so I can make the most well informed decision possible.

This all goes back to about four months ago, back in May. I and many in my hometown lost our homes to a forest fire and were forced to evacuate indefinitely. I was in my second semester of community college at the time, still living with my parents. After bouncing around the homes of extended family members for a week I settled with my Boyfriends (20m) parents so I could finish the semester in a stable home, and they were very welcoming. 

Then, his sister in another state offered to house us while we searched for stability there, as the job and housing market in our immediate area had been thrown into chaos due to all who were displaced by the fire. We decided to go for it. I took my finals and two days later we were there. 

Well, we’ve been here for three months and all the luck we’ve had has led me to a part time job at a retail store. Despite all our searching, we just don’t have enough job experience for anyone to want us, and it doesn’t help that we’re not locals. But, that doesn’t matter anymore. My boyfriend has decided to join the military, and I will support his decision. He leaves in October. He hopes to be stationed in a different state, to which I plan on following him. I am very confident in our relationship, we have been together for four years, stayed strong through everything, and and now survived a natural disaster and homelessness, together. We know what we both want, and we are in this for the long haul. I don’t doubt that. Now I just have to worry about what I will be doing while he’s active duty. My options aren’t ideal.

I could marry him. I would be guaranteed a home off base to live with him, health care, and so many other amenities I couldn’t dream of affording otherwise. Not to mention marrying someone whom I love and trust more than anyone else. But I know that I am still so young, and I have always frowned upon marrying young myself, it would be so hypocritical to then turn around and do it when it suits me, yet just seems like the easiest thing to do. I recognize that divorce is a very real, very expensive ordeal that I risk if I do this, but that all seems so distant, I can’t really imagine a situation where we would do so.

Or, I could not marry him, in which case my options are:
- live with my abusive, manipulative parents and attend the local community college while working part time to pay my mother rent, all while living potentially thousands of miles from my partner, the only one to help me escape my abusers in the first place 
- follow him to wherever he’s stationed, find work and roommates so I can afford living on my own, while likely giving up college for now
- follow him and take out student loans to attend the local state college and stay in a dorm, living in debt indefinitely into my adult life
- follow him and work as much as needed to afford a cheap place to live while working on college, with a total lack of financial stability (scholarships and financial aid are not guaranteed, and if full time work is required to keep myself stable then completing college will take twice as long)

I am at a total loss. Everyone I have talked to in person has said, quite literally, “well, I don’t care what you do as long as I’m invited to the wedding!!!” When that wasn’t the point! I wanted some perspective and no one would give me any. I cannot talk to family, they will be no help. So now, I am turning to reddit. Any relevant information, personal experience, or just your two cents on the situation would be really appreciated. Thanks.",06Sep2019,2

572,"This is my super cool throwaway I use when I refuse to use my main account but into the actual problem. The majority of my day at school is absorbed with me thinking about how much I fucking suck. I believe these thoughts most of the time and have mostly accepted the fact that I am a monumental fuckup whose only joy is video games, tennis, and kayaking. Everything feels like shit and I often think about why am I even alive. I have recently started a new anxiety medication and am wondering if this could be contributing to this. So here’s the part where I give a quick rundown of the thoughts I get:

I can’t talk to people.

I’m weird (like ew that person’s weird).

I look like shit.

Etc.

So this really sucks and I kinda just realized it’s a problem. So now I’m some quiet kid who is anxious all day and deprived themselves of human interaction to try protecting themselves from humiliation. I also struggle with OCD which sucks. So here I am, typing this in a hallway watching a bunch of happy people walk around. Literally everyone fits in but me and it’s making me feel like I don’t belong. No one’s mean, just no one has incentive to talk to me. I seriously need some help with this. I transferred schools because last year was shit as well and now I’m wondering if my life was meant to be shit. A good day is someone asking me how my day went or maybe saying hi. I cannot stop believing that I am a shitwad who would be better just running off to go be by myself so people don’t have to deal with me.

573,"My wife is a 2nd year engineering student. It’s coming up on that present giving time of the year so I’m starting to think about what presents to get. Her interests include: space, engineering, math, physics, programming, and basically everything I don’t understand lol. She’s the smart one (and the pretty one) in our relationship. 

So she mentioned a few months ago how she’s never been in a robotics club or anything like that because she was homeschooled. She said she was always jealous that dorky kids on tv shows got to build robots in school. She’s never build a robot before but I assume based on her ability to learn so quickly, I shouldn’t buy her a robot kit for kids. 

Also I looked them up and a few of them seem kinda useless and a few seem like toys, idk what would be best. I don’t want to ask her and ruin a surprise...but I don’t know what robot would be best to buy. I know she’d enjoy one she can program, which I saw was an option. Another thing I saw was something about soldering? We don’t have anything for soldering so unless it came with the kit, idk what else I’d have to buy. 

I don’t want to spend thousands of dollars but like $100 seems okay? Maybe? Is that too low, I don’t even know. Our budgets are usually a few $100 for each other depending on how well we’ve saved up, and how much we spend on our son lol. But I don’t want to only get her one thing this year so if robots are like $300 per kit I just cannot do it yet. In a few years maybe. 

So how do I figure out which robot building kit is best to get her for Christmas? Are there any robots that have a use? Like...building a roomba or something haha. She really wants a roomba. I don’t want to buy something below her skill level but also she’s never built a real robot.",06Sep2019,2

He was looking to become friends since his ex hadn’t allowed him to become friends with girls when they were together, and he did lay out that he was hoping to maybe go on a date or two with a few people to figure out what he was really looking for in a relationship. We kept talking until I came back home (I’d been on vacation to see family), and we went on a date not long after, which was really great. After, he started talking a lot more about us forming a real relationship, something that I was excited for. We got along well, laughed a lot, it seemed nice. The only issues are that my friends aren’t the most comfortable with it due to him dating Grape in the past and that he is black, and most of my family is kinda racist. Both things seemed like they could be handled though, so it should have been fine. Except it wasn’t. This past weekend, he actually asked me to be his girlfriend. And I freaked out, felt overwhelmed, and left crying. 

After leaving, I went to see my best friend (Cereal) and told her everything I was feeling. I have a lot on my plate as of now with college, theatre, a family murder, and a lot of other family mess, so it was a rather big meltdown. During which, I accidentally told her that I was also confused because I had liked her for a while. She likes me back. I can admit that few people make me as happy as her, but I’ve also (despite kinda liking her) never thought about it very romantically. She’s my best friend. But now I’m wondering if I just want to be with her. My family would freak out; my dad is a baptist preacher who is extremely against homosexuality. It would have to be completely private until I could move out or I would have 0 freedom and would be forced to quite theatre. It would be terrible. I don’t know if I could be with her knowing all of that was at stake. Not only that, I just don’t know if I WANT her to be more than a friend to me. Despite freaking out that day, I still have strong feelings for Noodle. Him and I talk everyday and any time I’m around him I have to resist the urge to be really affectionate with him. But at the same time, something also feels right with Cereal, and that’s who my other closest friend is pushing me towards. If it wasn’t for Cereal and the other friend, I probably would be with Noodle already (not they they were rude and made a stink or anything, but it’s just a lot of tension due to them taking Grape’s side in the breakup), but would that even be the right choice? I’ve been told that I only lean towards him because it’s more likely to work out with my family (which does mean a lot to me) and not have to be hidden. Do you guys have any thoughts? Ask any questions that you need to.",06Sep2019,1

576,"Hi redditors

The situation is the following. I have been unable to find an apartment in the city I work since I got kicked out of my dorm after graduating. My brother has an apartment that he pays for but he is never there because he has mental issues and lives with my parents (for emotional support I assume ....). He plans to stay there for another year, he is not working and has no income so he is just draining his savings for that time. He does not intend to rent it out to a stranger as he is very protective of his stuff and wouldnt want to rent it out furnished to somebody he does not know. Meanwhile I am in need of a place to stay. He offered that I could stay at his place, but only if I pay his full rent (I would be living with his furniture and stuff and not be able to bring my own furniture there, only clothes etc). 
Thing is, whether I stay there or not, he will pay the rent for it. So basically he does not want to help his sibling without getting full payment. Is it weird of me to think this is a d*ck move of him and that he is taking advantage of my situation?",06Sep2019,1
577,"I guess this requires some backstory, but I'll keep it as short and sweet as I can.  I moved into a roomshare situation where my roommate is my landlord and it's an illegal rental, and I really just rent a room and don't use the shared spaces much except when I'm cooking or using the bathroom.  I chose this living situation because I was in a jam and I needed a place immediately, but I don't have good credit or a lot of money right now.  She said she needed a person to move in, and didn't ask about my credit or ask for a cosigner so I thought it was the best choice.  We just signed a sublease, decided to go month to month, and I gave her a months rent in security deposit money then we agreed to give each other a 30 days notice if either of us wanted to terminate.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I didn't think about the reason why she didn't want any of that information from me.  She always says ""If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is"", and she's right.  After I moved in I realized that she was asking me to buy supplies for the apartment almost immediately, and uses them rapidly.  She uses up an entire tall kitchen garbage bag each day, and she wants me to pay for half of those when it takes me a week to fill one on my own.  She uses an entire roll of toilet paper a day, the scott 1000 ones, and expects me to pay for those.  And she is constantly using lysol wipes to clean and expects me to pay for half of those as well.  When I said I wanted to buy my own supplies she called me cheap, and it has been going on like that, with her being rude if I don't comply to what she wants.  She has a four year old daughter as well, so splitting things halfway doesnt really seem fair.  It's mainly the rudeness and insulting behavior that I didn't expect, because I'm just not used to it, and I don't know how to respond.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to that, she sends really in depth text complaints about anything she has a problem with, she knocks on my door way too often, and she gets into late night arguments with me where she sounds illogical.  I found out from her neighbor that she has lied a lot.  She told me her daughter's father died in a car accident on his way home from a party, but she told my friend he was murdered, and she told her neighbor he OD'ed and that she didn't even know him very well.  She gets benefits from his death for her daughter, and she also gets welfare and wic and rent controlled housing.  She makes me pay her in cash so that her benefits aren't affected, and I pay her 750 per month.  She told her neighbor she charged me 350 because she owes her neighbor a lot of money already, and she doesn't want her asking for it.  I also found out that she has a cocaine problem, and that that is why she gets into strange and upsetting moods.  Her neighbor said she's physically assaulted people and cursed people out, and I'm afraid of her doing that to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I lasted two months and gave a thirty day notice because my job is going to get busier and I need a calm home to come back to.  I found a place and told her I'm moving out and gave her the exact day.  She told me it was disrespectful of me to pick the day without her approval and that I can't move out unless she's there because I have people helping me move and she doesn't want anyone there without her being there too.  I said that wasn't really something I can adhere to but that she is welcome to be home when I move out.  Of course, she was mad about that too.  

&amp;#x200B;

I guess the interaction I'm most worried about is that of me and her and everyone helping me move at the end of the month.  I'd like it to go smoothly, but I know there is animosity between her and my friend who installed a lock on my door because there wasn't one, and she said he ""broke the door"" in doing so.  I don't want any arguments to take place, but I don't really know how to make sure it goes smoothly and how to make this month go smoothly as well.  So far, I have been minimizing contact and not really cooking.  I've been spending most of my time outside the home except when I need to sleep, take a shower, or get ready to go out.  It's terrible.  It doesn't feel like a home at all.    


I know that this post goes in so many different directions, but any advice or wise words would be much appreciated.",06Sep2019,2

582,"I just came home from a bit of a shocking school trip. The trip was fine until the last evening. I, along with 4 of my friends, witnessed a girl getting beat up by 3 other people, and I was holding her as she was slipping in and out of consciousness.  The girl was under the influence of drugs, and I thought several times that she was going to die in my arms. My friends were in shock and so was I, as I had to call 999 for an ambulance and the police.   
Considering that we are only 18-16 years old, and have never had an experience like this, I was quite porud of how we took action. We tried to joke about to avoid getting upset, but when I finally came back home, I was dying to tell my mom about it, just to get it off my chest and finally cry about it. The other girls also told their mothers, who freaked out and fussed over them. When I told y mother she didn'tcare. She wanted to hear only about the High Lands, and seemed almost angry when I tried to talk to her about the incident.   
I don't know why, but it made me upset and sort of jealous of my friends, because their mothers showed so much concern. Itis not unusual for my mom to behave like bad things doesn't happen, but still I hoped we could talk about it.

593,"New to Reddit so excuse any mistakes please :)

Context: I am a bisexual male who is recently diagnosed with long term depression and anxiety, so on top of this I also had the belief that sex meant something and that I wanted to do it with someone that meant something to me. This meant that although I had opportunities, offers even, to have sex with either gender, I declined every time and I did not search for relationships. Recently I decided that I didn't want to be a virgin, surely what almost everyone says about it meaning nothing and that you should just do it is true? I don't want to die alone, I don't want to become an old virgin and I don't want to mess up potential relationships due to lack of experience. So with all of this together I decided to make a Tinder, I  listed myself as looking for a serious relationship. I found someone who didn't have a profile pic but had a bit of info so I thought that they'd be inexperienced like me, we ended up snap chatting constantly and decided to have a friends with benefits relationship where he could teach me all that he knows. We both got tested for HIV etc even though I'm a virgin because we decided we wanted bare sex and I was to be his first bare. I am around 6.5 inches uncut although there's not much skin there so it seems cut and he was cut with a small dick maybe around 4 inches. Although I had a bigger dick, I'm a 5'10 beta male body and he was over 6' and quite big.

What happened: We recently met up, I am a very open person who wanted to experiment so we did basically everything, he stripped me, taught me to kiss and we made out, he eventually took my work boot off and making out with my toes and feet which I found very nice, I also enjoyed him pleasuring my nipples, and the area around my dick (inner thigh) as these were all sensitive areas for me apparently. We spent about 6 hours together pleasuring each other and took some breaks i.e. dinner. I feel it is key to mention that I am on an antidepressant (escitaloprám) which side affects include impotence, and I had experienced it as I've been on it for 2+ weeks and find it a lot harder to reach orgasm. When he sucked my dick I found next to no feeling/pleasure unless he gave solely the head attention, and when I fucked his ass I found next to no pleasure, although we did try different styles such as him riding me, him prone and missionary. Why am I feeling no pleasure from this? (I know I should discuss the side affects of the drug with my doctor) Is it just the drug? I think I know myself and my body well enough to tell that it's not the drug. Am I just not attracted to him enough as I only see him as a friend with benefits rather than a crush or lover? Sex is meant to be a glorious thing that feels better, but I enjoy just masturbating way better. I decided that night that I wanted to take him in my ass although that didn't even feel that good either and I way enjoy just sticking my fingers in there myself, although that may have something to do with his size. I made him cum 4 times, once in my ass (couldn't even feel that he came! although from watching a video of me squirting out the cum it was a decent bit), on my feet, also didn't feel, in my mouth (definitely felt that one lol) and then on my chest. The one time I did cum was near the end of the night where we were both masturbating side by side as he really wanted me to cum (he had wanted me to cum inside but I couldn't), and I finally came from the fingering and masturbating I was giving myself and he stuck his head on my dick and sucked it all up, although as soon as he did that I could tell my excitement was going down and I couldn't tell how much I came to see how hard I had came unfortunately. This was after his 3rd time of cumming and the event just before his 4th cum. I plan on having sex with a girl next week to see if it is any different, and to learn the ins and outs of girls so to speak.

Any advice is appreciated, although my main topic of concern is why I am feeling nothing from having sex like this. Ask literally any questions I will not hold back.",06Sep2019,2
594,"So here is my dilemma:

I'm married and currently living with my spouse and our dog. I'm currently unemployed and seeking work.

I have one job offer that is 2 hours away from where my spouse and I currently live (and where their job is), which would require me to rent an apartment there as the commute every day is too much. This is a very very good job for my career, very good pay, and the city is a lot more interesting than where we currently live now. But the costs of living far away would mean that, in terms of savings, we wont be able to save that much more because I'll have to buy a car and pay for an apartment and all that. 

I also have another job offer from a company that is a 15 minute cycle away. The pay is far worse, but my expenses will be much lower as I'll be sharing my apartment with my spouse and won't need a car payment either (I'll just ride my bike). It's not as good career-wise, but it's an enjoyable job that is far less stressful. After doing all the math, my savings would be only 300 usd lower than the savings I would get with the previous job. It's also a plus to be able to live with my spouse every day of the week (vs just seeing them on weekends) and it's nicer for my dog to not have to move. But is it a dumb decision for the long-term?

What are your thoughts? What would you do? My spouse absolutely cannot move because their job is in the military, so it is out of their control. I'm not too keen finding a place that is directly in between both jobs (1 hour to work for both of us) because that would kinda be in the middle of nowhere. Thanks!",06Sep2019,1
596,"Quick run down: I am in my mid 20’s and have had quite the year.

To get to why I fell apart, I want to give a brief backstory on who I am.

I’m a combat veteran, I served 1 tour in Afghanistan as an Infantryman. I came home feeling empty inside and decided to get out after my contract was complete instead of re enlisting. 

I moved to a big city and life went relatively well for a long time. I always had a roof over my head and good friends. I met an amazing girl who I completely fell in love with, got my dream job as a firefighter for the city and life was smooth sailing for a long time. I lived with her for for a few years, and things seemed to be getting very serious between us. Her family lived in the area and for once in my life I was spending time with a true family who I loved dearly. Her step father was like a dad I never had (my biological dad died in 2009 when I was still in high school and was a raging alcoholic my entire life) her mom was great to me. Christmases, thanksgivings, New Years, birthdays. All of those were small family gatherings that I honestly had never experienced in my life. I felt like I had made it, and loved my life.

January 2019, she and I moved into our 3rd apartment. A couple days later she came home from work and abruptly ended the relationship.

I came completely unglued. Not only was I losing her, but with that... the family I had. The holidays and love and all that happiness and hard work. All those memories... just boom. Gone in the blink of an eye.

I self-medicated and stopped going to work. I locked myself in our empty apartment and binged for a month straight. I was drunk 24/7 and it was the only thing I felt helped numb how I was feeling inside. 

I got in trouble for not going to work. Told my superior to fuck off because I felt abandoned... (ignorant and immature of me). I also ended up having to go to an inpatient rehab to get off the booze and get my mind right.

Once I got out, my now ex had taken the apartment and I had to find a new place to live. I’m on my own in a small 1 bed 1 bath apartment and I’m getting by. I was luckily able to keep my job and was punished with an unpaid suspension that’s now over.

However, it’s been 9 months and I still can’t seem to get out of this rut I’ve fallen into. I don’t drink, I try to stay positive and happy... but I just can’t get it together. I feel like I’m going through the motions everyday. 

I’m not necessarily depressed, but I’m by no means happy at all. I try to be, I really do. But it’s just not there. I feel empty.

I’ve considered going back to the Army, but I know I’ll regret it. I’ve considered changing jobs, but it’s not going to solve anything. 

I guess all I’m asking...  anyone who has been in a rut, what eventually helped you get out of it? What advice do you have for someone who is in one?",06Sep2019,1

600,"I'm in a committed relationship and I've run into this problem a couple of times. When we are in person, I feel the love from my girlfriend 100%. Early on in our relationship, through text, this was translated 100% as well. Everything from multiple texts and lots of emojis and generally what seems like a lot more interest in texting me. As we've gone forward, I feel that has faded quite a bit.   
Here's the specific situation that led me here today: So last night, I had sent my girlfriend a selfie. The context is that I've never been a big fan of selfies, even though my girlfriend would occasionally tell me she wished I would send more. I think she adapted to my personality in that way enough to understand that selfies do not equal love. Anyways, yesterday I decided to send her one. I was expecting the usual reply of her complimenting me, etc. All I got was something along the lines of ""oh wow"". No further typing and no other messages. I then kind of said, ""I thought you would like that I sent you a picture"". She then replied with ""Oh baby you're so cute &lt;3"". This frustrated me because I hate when things like that are forced. You're either legitimately happy about it or not. We spoke about this today, and she told me that she did reply happily to my picture but I explained that It came only after I said something about it. She kind of chalked this up to ""oh you always take things wrong through text"" + ""you know I love you"". There have been other situations besides this where I felt like the love she gives me in person doesn't translate at all through text.  
So part of me is still frustrated with this, but the other part of me wants to be able to not treat texts as reality. Do you have any advice or suggestions? Thank you all lots.",06Sep2019,11

604,"So my dreams are so real to me that I think it's real life. Even if it's something absurd it never crosses my subconscious that it isn't real. So I end up staying asleep for way longer than I should because I'm convinced that I'm actually awake. Every once in a while I'll have that moment when I do realize I'm dreaming and I try everything to wake myself up but I can't. The dream keeps on going (I can feel the pinch, I feel the sensations as I try to go off a cliff or be underwater, etc.) and I have a freak out because, again, I now confirmed that I can't wake myself up so this has to be real. Then I'll wake up 10-12 hours later and be like WTF.

I've tried setting an alarm, sleeping pills, no eating before bed, but when I finally do wake up I'm so exhausted I just want to rest.

605,"I (F21) met a guy(M27) on a website similar to Omegle. We really hit it off from the beginning and have some things in common. 

We got connected 3 times now and agreed we like to talk and want to continue but he only has facebook and i thought Facebook might be a bit too personal but on the other hand people can always see me when i comment something on facebook so why should it be a big deal right?

Whenever one of us has to leave the chat we literally say that we want to chat again  and hope we get connected again for like a few more minutes because neither of us wants to leave.

I have bad experience with giving strangers my real name and social media accounts so i'm more careful now but i really like talking to him.

607,"Basically title says it all. My best friend A and I got into a fight/disagreements regarding our other friend B. 

There was some miscommunication and Friend A wants to cut Friend B off because A feels like B isn’t giving into the friendship as much as A is. Which isn’t true at all. And I tried to have A look at it differently and to talk to B to understand better. (Friend A pulled a similar stunt in the past and about a year later told me how she should’ve listen to the other side of the story first before cutting that person off). Then A throws a fit saying that I’m protecting B and “what about me”? Then A wants to take a step back to rethink the whole friendship. 
Friend A really got me and Friend B fucked up but she doesn’t see that. And I can’t tell her that either because I just want to give her some space right now. 

Then Friend A wants to be petty and post a quote on her story saying “you must love yourself more than these people claim they do” 

So my question is, is it really self love? Or is she just being straight up selfish and claiming that it’s self love??? I don’t really get it. Maybe I’m the selfish one??? 

There’s A LOT of details to it but I just want to keep it short and simple for now.

611,"I met this girl about 2 months ago. We’ve been seeing each other for a month now. In my 23 years of being alive, never have I met someone that I connect with as well as I do with her. We share so many things in common, and we just get along better than I’ve gotten along with anyone else. I’ve been through many toxic relationships in the past, and I was about ready to give up hope and just focus on myself. But I met her, and as much as I tried to keep myself from catching feelings and focus on myself rather than a relationship, I couldn’t help but realize how amazing she is. 

For the past month, I’ve made some of the most unforgettable memories with her. Things were going so well, and I for once in my life, I didn’t have a shred of doubt that I wanted to be with this girl. And I knew that she felt the same way about me. 

Things changed today, however. Her mood was off, and she seemed really down. I asked her what’s wrong. She came forward and said that her ex has been non stop bothering her with calls and texts, and that she feels she’s being harassed at this point. She went on to say that she doesn’t feel it’s right to involve me in this, and that it’s not right for her to be complaining about her problems with her ex to me. 

We talked on the phone for a bit, and eventually she said that she doesn’t think she can continue with this. She said that she wants him out of her life completely before moving on to someone new. She said she was sorry, and that she doesn’t want it to be this way at all but that she feels it’s the right thing to do. I tried telling her it didn’t have to be that way, and that I can help her get through this. 

Of course, she already had her mind set. She already made the choice of letting me go. And I’m so fucking bummed about it. I’m having a hard time accepting it, and I feel like a fool for allowing myself to fall for her so quickly. I want to fight for her and not let her go, but I don’t know if that’s the right thing to do. I’ve got no one else to talk to about this right now, so I thought I’d just share my thoughts on here and get some unbiased opinions.",06Sep2019,7
612,"Hi I’m 21 F graduating this winter from university. I am excited to graduate, but suddenly have been given 3 opportunities I never could have imagined. I’m not sure what to do.

The first opportunity happened on an off chance meeting with a former mentor of mine. I was given his business card and told to email him. I just politely sent an email thanking him for the conversation and he is offering me a position full time out of university. It would be in a communications department, but I need to still send a resume. I figured I would follow it to see where it went.

The next opportunity was a professor I never met requesting me for a paid summer intern position. I’ve never heard of this professor in a different school, but she said she heard many great things about me wanting me for this position. I need to send her my resume and contact information. I just feel weird cause I’m not sure if this normally happens or what? I’m first generation in my family to go to university. 

The third opportunity happened when I ran into my dean and former professor of my major. I mentioned how I wanted to get my masters degree, but I would need to probably work in corporate America to fund it. The dean mentioned how I could apply for a stipend and work as a sort of assistant to a professor? My professor said our degree is 100% online in the masters program and will contact the department chair to write me a letter of recommendation. The dean was super happy to meet and talk to me and I talked to her, but on the inside was screaming cause I never talked to her in person before. The program is very small with 10 people in the online program and she wants first generation students to be given the opportunity. 

I am stunned. This has all happened within the past 3 days and I’m not sure what the hell to do. I was planning to graduate a semester early this winter, apply for some run of the mill job, get money, and go back for my masters. Do I take a corporate office job (I’m not sure how it will pay), do I take this summer internship, or do I get paid to basically get my masters? My parents don’t know as they never went to university and I feel I can’t ask them for advice cause they may want me to side with them. I feel I have to pick a path. Any advice?

615,"So I've already had a similar problem with my old schools fasfa office ending up not telling me what I actually needed and said I was okay and covered to find out at the end of the semester I wasn't. So I went to a community college last semester and loved it. The problem was they go through a verification program for their fasfa called inceptia. The thing is the fasfa office can't verify You or tell you what finances you have until the inceptia goed through but when you ask the fasfa office of the inceptia progress they say they don't have connection and that's a completely different thing. So me being confused just constantly called both inseptia and fasfa and kept making my dad and I continuously e sign. No biggie and months ended up going by with just being told we had to e sign then at the end of the semester the fasfa office said I was just missing a tax return. No biggie right? Wrong. After a month into the summer I still am stressed and not verified so I called and I was told I needed to re submit the papers. So I did. Then last week I got verified and was told to go to the fasfa office to talk about my coverage and they closed last semester and fasfa is no longer gonna cover 2018-2019. I called the busar and fasfa back and forth. They said I can take out a private loan. I go to do that and the loans that can go to a passed semester don't work with my school. Great. I asked the school if they provided private loans and they said they couldn't for the passed semester. Then I asked if I could pay last semester in some plan while still being able to register and go to class. They said no and I will need to figure out how to pay for it.

Now my boyfriend's mom helped me go to the community college when I had the other fasfa problem at the other school. I'm terrified of telling her I can't go this semester and I'm gonna work to pay for the last semester. It sucks because I really like college it's just tge money and that's something I never had. I'm just scared of disappointing as well as she may think I'm doing something wrong and am not putting effort into trying to get my stuff done. Am I over thinking? I mean I could've done something wrong. I'm just scared to tell her.

Tdlr: Fasfa problem twice now I think it seems like a coincidence that I just don't know how it works and I think my bf's mom who loves me will be so disappointed and upset. Possibly disown me

618,"I work a seasonal job, at the beginning of the season my new manager seemed amazing. We got together perfectly, we opened up about our lives and I thought I found a good friend. She started saying she was going to fix me and make me a better person, and I should stop trusting the people I trust because they aren’t good for me. I was skeptical because I knew these people for years compared to her.

I suffer from depression and anxiety and the beginning of the season was rough for me. I started on pills to help me overcome my issues. I started feeling better and getting more skeptical of the things she was saying to me. She always wanted to start shit between employees and I was just starting to catch on.

Now that I don’t feed into the drama and tell her everything, she barely talks to me. I’ve also realized she’s been breaking a lot of the work rules. She’s constantly lying to us about head office and saying they’re making this rule that rule and another... but i called the other day and they had no clue what I was talking about. 

Head office called and told her she had to stop. Now she keeps talking to the staff about a “rat”. Do I go back to head office and tell them ALL the things she’s doing wrong? Do I confront her and tell her I went and told them the issues?

620,"I hope I don’t come off as an ungrateful jerk, but here goes. Also mobile so sorry for formatting issues.

Backstory on me: I (30sF) was diagnosed with Relapse/Remitting Multiple Sclerosis recently. I am currently in remission, so I have no major symptoms. I am on treatments that do cause side effects, and I am relearning what normal is in my life. You wouldn’t know anything is wrong with me if you saw me, I walk fine, I talk fine, I see fine, just a little more tired that I used to be.

In terms of day to day, I have a better job than most in my family, paying 2/3 rent on an apartment that I share with my sibling. I have a boyfriend and it’s looking like he’s the one. All things considered, I am doing fine.

Backstory on my family: my mom is very overprotective. A lot of my family is that way. They all talk and gossip (aunts, uncles, cousins, siblings, parents) to the point that there are no secrets in my family. It doesn’t help that I am the youngest in my family. Everyone has always treated me like a baby, but it has gotten much worse since I was diagnosed. 

I knew my mom wanted to be involved and I originally offered to let her join me on initial doctors appointments and shared all of my detailed notes on the disease. I really regret doing that in retrospect. My mom would sob in doctors appointments or she would change the subject to be about friends with MS. On top of that, she shares everything, so I then would get calls/texts/emails from family and friends about what was going on medically. I stopped telling her when appointments were so I wouldn’t have to deal with the drama and honestly things got better.

Well recently we took two steps back. A few weeks ago I got very sick while away on a work trip and feared I was relapsing and was taken to a local hospital. I couldn’t get myself home, my parents were the closest people I could contact to come pick me up. I really thought I handled it maturely, but they immediately started treating me like a baby until I convinced them to bring me home so my boyfriend could help me. And again I start getting the calls from friends/family on my health. 

Now she won’t stop asking me when my upcoming doctors appointments are, which I don’t want to share. I got to a breaking point at a family dinner, the first dinner with my brothers new girlfriend. 

Mom - when is your next appointment?
Me - not sure
Brothers new gf - why don’t you know when your next appointment is?
*What I wanted to say - this is not your fucking business, we literally just met*
What I ended up saying - not interested in pulling up appointment dates while I’m trying to eat dinner

I can’t take it anymore. I want people to butt out. I’m fine and when I’m not fine, I know when to get to a doctor. I have a loving boyfriend who has been my partner through this. I love my mom, but I don’t need her checking up on me, I don’t need her telling my family, and I don’t need my family checking up on me. I am just at my wits end and ready for things to change.

So, I have a sister and we don't get along at all.
It's been like that since we were teenagers and we're now in our twenties. We haven't lived together for 4 years but whenever we see each other (Christmas or summer) things get ugly because we don't really talk and we just argue a lot. At this point I don't even know about what. It feels like any tiny little thing we do is annoying or hurtful for the other person. 
And I had just kind of accepted we don't like each other but our mom has played a big part in all this story. 
She constantly tells me I'm being hurtful and mean and that my sister loves me a lot and I just treat her like shit. Which I'm not gonna lie, I know I've done things wrong a lot of times (probably more than her) but I don't seem to be able to apologise or do things differently. I've thought about calling her a couple of times before to apologise or to talk and try to reach a middle ground but I never do and I wouldn't be able to list the reasons why I don't like her but when we're together she just get on my nerves.
And my mom continuous to tell me how bad I am and then my relationship with her gets also ruined. I honestly think the best I could do is disappear from this family.

I feel like I'm the reason why our family is broken and I should try to make amends or something but I don't know how or what to say. Does anyone have any advice or has any insight I'm having a very bad relationship with family members???

From Puerto Rico here.
For my whole life i've been dealing with shit here and there. Due to bad choices she took and others my older brother contributed to, i know what having 0 food is like. Absolute starvation. After 6th grade she never enrolled me in another school. I spent all my teen years just playing games, chatting, drawing and wishing i could be a normal kid who went to school and made friends. Had it not been for my aunt, i wouldn't have a highschool diploma and had studied in college. She supported us money-wise a lot and i'm forever grateful. I've struggled through depression, anxiety and insecurities my mother passed down to us. Have struggled to be social or excell in college. But over it all, i managed to actually do it for a while. 

For a year now, i finally got jobs and stuff. A lot of things happened  but the latest one i had was in a call center, overnight, while i studied during the day. It was a lot for me. I began to fall back into heavy depression, had zero motivation. Specially since there was mandatory overtime every first week of every month. We dont have a car and she never taught me how to drive, so i paid Uber everywhere. I recently quit because i was going to do my internship and they cared little for it at work. However  internship plans were ruined by my program director and now i dont have a location to do the internship.

Ive been depressed and gloomy lately, but i try to not let it show. We had an argument just a bit ago over something so small and she just came out and told me that if i was so depressed to kill myself, to shoot myself or something.

I cant say it hurt like oh i wanna cry. But it hurt differently, idk. Like i expected something like this from her but it is still shocking.

629,"So I would describe the current status as:

com·men·sal·ism 

1. an association between two organisms in which one benefits and the other derives neither benefit nor harm.

We were close years and years ago, and even though we haven't lived in the same area for a really long time, we have kept in touch ever since.  But now, looking back on it all, I can see that he has always placed a significant amount of personal identity in our friendship and defines it by what we went through back then (and it was some very serious shit: abuses and parents' splitting up and a girlfriend's pregnancy/miscarriage) and I guess that's the big issue...

It seems like, to him, our relationship is defined by what we went through back then.  And I've changed A LOT since that time.  I'm barely the same person now.  He hasn't changed that much at all, except to become generally more bitter, cynical, and misanthropic.  With serious stuff like his relationship with his son's mother and his struggle with depression, he either deflects and represses with cynical snark, or (if he's drunk) he may let it all spill out into a giant rambling dysfunctional mess.  So yeah, actual productive conversations about something meaningful?  Those are few and far between.  And fun hobby/interest conversations?  Those can only happen if they're firmly in his sphere of passions, and I mean specific: he likes video games, but if you bring up a game that he's never played and has no interest in playing, he won't respond in any way that flows naturally; he'll say something like ""Oh, okay,"" or make some sort of mildly derisive joke about whatever it is, and then abruptly shift the convo back to something he likes.  Conversely, if he would goes off on a hour-long ramble on comic books (which I don't read and don't particularly care about), I listen and try to respond as meaningfully as I can.  (I've long wondered if he has very mild Asperger's.)

And for the earlier years since we parted ways geographically, I didn't mind this at all.  We had a lot in common and the fuel of our shared hard times when we were younger, plus our shared interests, kept things strong.  In recent years, we have less and less in common.

I've moved on from the very narrow, specific interests of my youth to broader interests; I've become more liberal-minded; I like traveling and exploring new cultures and new things and new ideas.

He still reads the same comic book series and plays the same specific video game series that he liked when he was young; he has explicitly stated that has no interest in travel; he casually uses derisive terms like ""euro-trash"" when talking about other, non-American cultures; he's become more entrenched in the politically conservative views he'd always held.

In short, if we didn't know each other, and we met each other as we are today, we probably wouldn't become close friends.  We might not become friends at all.

I guess I'm wondering...if you have a friend who becomes like a brother because of hugely powerful and formative experiences you shared, is there are point where those early bonds no longer sustain the friendship?  And if there is, what is that point?  

And as for my specific situation, I don't think he has much positive influence in his life, and I'm confident that his life is probably better with me in it, but--especially since it's long-distance and requires extra effort to sustain--how much consideration does that merit?  I am the busiest I've ever been in my life and it's starting to become a drain making the effort to sustain it.",06Sep2019,1
630,"I'm 17, I live in a small town of SC, and I'm just not having a dandy time. I'm stressed because of college application frenzy and I've cut off a lot of my friends this past summer because they have either been incredibly rude (like fucking my ex or throwing tantrums about how I'm selfish for not wanting to go out) or have tried pressuring me into sex. #thxjordanpeterson #hotvigrinalert

My family doesn't live in the US, my guardian is now preoccupied with her new boyfriend, my BFF is focused on his own problems right now and associates with people I find revolting (the ones I cut off). Even though I got 1400 on SAT (for SC - incredible; on the world stage - I'm a cockroach waiting to get squashed) and I get the ""first-gen American"" and ""Russian Jew female going into STEM"" cards, I feel useless and naive for believing I could get into a high-class school like Stanford with its relaxed environment and diverse crowd and classes (*COUGHSPACEXhiremeCOUGH*). My parents are incredibly successful, so I feel pressured to get into a high-end school. Georgia Tech would be a good choice as well, but I'm too in love with liberal arts and fear that my artistic side is gonna die off in the monotonous crowd of math geeks. What if I don't even get the time to paint as a hobby? Outrageous. I want to do Aerospace Engineering, but Nuclear Physics sounds neat too, but all my math and science courses in high school have been incredibly boring and fruitless; compared to my math-god father, I feel incompetent.

I've successfully suppressed my longing for physical contact and sex. I do sports for 2 hours a day. I have a good diet, no sugar or dairy or bread, but forget to hydrate.

637," let’s skip all the anti-muslim islamphobia bs and get straight to the point. in the 5th grade my mom remarried to this dude whose daughter wore a hijab (headscarf) my mom then asked if we wanted to and i being the kid who would do anything to please her said yes as well as my younger sisters, but my older sister however declined. (we were muslim already btw) that’s how it was for a while and it was okay. after a while i realized that the person who my mother wanted me to be wasn’t the person i wanted to be. so instead of going to her and talking to her about it (afraid of her opinion) i cowardly started doing my hair before school and then come home into a hijab. i’ve been doing that for 3 years. yes 3, in those years i’ve almost gotten caught, got caught by my older sister who understood, and caught by my mother once as well. Her reaction was predictable, she went through my phone found that i was texting a guy (a friend) and pictures of me at school with no hijab. i don’t know if she was mad that i was lying or just about the hijab but i knew then i couldn’t have a coming of age moment where i pour out my feelings cause our relationship didn’t work that way. afterwards she would taunt me and ask me if i went too school to “show my hair to the world” and just bs. after a few weeks of that she stopped and it was okay. school started back up and freshman year i wore it for a while then revered back to who i wanted too be.  fast forward to today i get off the bus and see my mom start pulling out of the driveway, her car is too the right so i put in the good of my jacket and walk to the left, burrito put on my hijab and then walk back home while she calls my phone many times. it sounds so simple but it was a lot in that moment and it’s utterly embarrassing that my bus driver saw and everyone on the bus as well. i don’t know what to do or how i’m gonna go back onto that bus again and again for the rest of the year and until i graduate.",06Sep2019,0

644,"Hi there. So, today during lunch break a few colleagues (let's just call them Marianne, Claude and Felix, we weren't the only ones but the others don't matter) and I were talking and I overheard them talking about a barbecue and I asked them about it. Claude answered me enthuistically and said that he, Marianne, Felix and Hilda (not in the room) were having a barbecue at Felix's House in Sunday and asked me if I wanted to come? Without really thinking about it said ""Sure, if the others agree with it, alright?"" Claude nodded at me so I was like okay, then I'll come. Marianne and Felix didn't say anything at that point, we talked about something different and then Felix mentioned I should choose which drinks I wanted to drink while there and Marianne said we could travel there by train together. Lunch break ended and only then I thought about it a bit more.

It seems to me, that the barbecue was Hildas idea (she and Felix are a couple) and then she invited Claude and Marianne, it definitely isn't a spontanues idea like I thought it was during lunch break. While I get along with Marianne, Claude and Felix well and talk to them often, Hilda and I are a bit more distant, while we talk, it only rarely ist about things not related to work, we also don't really have much things in common. While I do like her a lot, she probably thinks I'm an okay colleague and nothing more, which is alright since you don't mesh well with everyone and we don't have to be best friends :) 

So, she probably deliberately excluded me, especially since she invited Marianne who has been working here for only 5 months while Hilda and I have been working together for 4 years, which is fine of course. So, when I went to Felix and asked him if I should really come and that he should also Hilda what she thinks about it, he said he already did and that it would be okay and then we talked a bit about what I should bring and so on. 

He also said, after I apologized and explained a bit about me thinking that it was a spontanues decision (which it was not, Felix showed me the  emails with plans about the barbecue which were from a few days before and yes it was Hilda's idea) and he said: ""Yeah, me and Marianne were a bit taken aback by Claude but you know, that's how he is"" 

Hilda has now sent me a text about how I should bring my own meat to the barbecue since she and Felix don't have time to buy it, (which the others already told me) but let me tell you, that text absolutely REEKS of reluctance lol. She probably is a pissed off since she planned a nice barbecue and only because Claude couldn't keep his mouth shut someone else comes along.
I have yet to answer her.

Soooo, i now have several Options:

1) Go to the BBQ and just try to not offset Hilda too much 

2) Ask her directly if it would be better for me not  to come and explain that I'm not mad or anything, I just know that she did not plan for me to come along and that's alright :)
But which makes it kinda an asshole move from me since I'm kinda putting her in the spot and it would be kinda difficult for her saying that she doesn't want me there without her looking like an asshole (maybe?) which she isn't :D 

3) Just make something up on Sunday that I can't come like, that I'm feeling not good or something and then stay away? 

What do you think? Am I overthinking it too much? Should I just go? Or stay away before I risk having to suffer through Hilda's wrath the next few weeks at work? (She get's easily annoyed but other than that she is a great person :))
I just hope Hilda doesn't hate Claude too much now lol

TLDR: A co-worker invited me to a a Barbecue which is hosted by another co-worker who didn't invite me and now I'm trying to determine If I should go and make everything kinda akward between me and the co-worker who didn't invite me or just staying away and escape the situation gracefully?

646,"I went to Physical Therapy in May, June and once in July. 11 visits total. I was self pay as my insurance didn't cover this specific one, who I preferred over the  one they did cover. It was $90 a visit, my first visit I filled out a financial hardship form, signed it and it was reduced to $50 a visit. I didn't pay as I went, because this was due to a fall and was waiting on the settlement check. On my last day, they asked me to fill out the form, but I told them I already had, and they seemed very unorganized and scatterbrained about this kind of stuff. So they said ""I'll find it"" Well that was July 6th. 2 months ago. I still have no heard a word from them. The last time I went, they billed me, and I paid prior so we had to work that out (this WAS covered by insurance a few years ago) so I know that they DO bill. I just haven't gotten one. Well, my settlement check came, and I know I owe them 660 (110 for consultation) but no bill, no invoice ever came.

647,"Let's call this friend ""John"". My roommate and I are basically John's only friends, but we are starting to get tired of him as well. We are currently at college and we live in different dorms. He asks us to hang out all the time, which is cool, I like hanging out with people, but he's very toxic. The reason that he pretty much only has us is because he's so polarizing that he has pushed every one else away. He always believes that everybody hates him and everybody is about to get him. He is gay and he has ostracized himself from the LGBT+ community on campus by claiming they were spreading rumors about him and didn't accept him because he was just a gay, white man and therefore not ""white"" enough. I've also participated in the LGBT+ community and I know that's not true. He's constantly complaining about his weight, the fact that he's single, that he has no money, etc, but he doesn't seem to do anything about it. I have lost over 40 pounds since joining college. I've offered advice, as has my roommate, but he doesn't follow it. We've offered relationship advice, but he doesn't follow it. We've offered financial advice, but he doesn't follow it. He has all the newest Apple products, but then doesn't have enough money to even buy his textbooks. Neither my roommate nor I enjoy hanging out with him anymore because he only ever complains and is extremely dramatic. He also wants us to help him start a Gun Violence Awareness club, but both of us avoid participating in politics other than to vote, because especially on a college campus, it is extremely polarizing. We're afraid to drop him because he has been suicidal in the past and we don't want to be the ones that mean he has no friends, but he acts the same around everyone, which is why they all avoid him because they don't want to be his therapist and listen to all of the very toxic and very polarizing things that come out of his mouth. So far we've been too nice to call him out, but our patience is very thin. We were going home this weekend to have a nice, relaxing weekend that included drinking, and he's invited himself along and we were too nice to say no. It's even possible he might end up being our suitemate. I'm not sure how much more of it either of us can stand, especially because if he started to live with us, there would be no way to avoid it. I don't want to drop him, especially because if he did anything that would have him admitted into a hospital, I would feel extremely guilty, but I'm not sure how to handle him.

648,"This is pretty lengthy. TL;DR- I complained about my neighbors being trashy and they started harassing my family, so I began to watch their suspicious activity more closely and realized that they are (most likely) selling drugs. The police know and want me to say I'll testify when the time comes, which would put me and my family in danger. In the meantime, we're stuck living directly across from them.

&amp;#x200B;

My neighbors across from me are drug dealers and they hate me. They've been renting that house for a little over a year now, and it has been a literal nightmare.

Throwaway account because, for whatever reason, I'm kind of embarrassed to even admit I'm having this problem. Probably because I'm ashamed that as a 29 year old man I'm helpless to do anything about it, and everything I have tried doing has only made it worse. 

**Some Backstory**

Before our first (and only so far) child was born my fiance and I decided that one of us would leave our job and raise our child until they grew to toddler stage. We're first time parents and day care, especially for babies, is extremely expensive. She had the better job (including the better health care plan for her and the child) so I was the one who became a stay-at-home parent. I'm mentioning this to explain why I'm home so much and how I came to know all of this about my neighbors.

They moved in a little after my kid's first birthday. At first it was just a few guys. At one point a few months ago there were 6 adults living there. Aside from the initial three guys, it's hard to tell how many actually stay there permanently. They're all about 20-30. Their circle of friends and family is massive. On Cinco De Mayo there were probably, no exaggeration, close to 50 people at any given time over at their house. This is not a big house by any definition. Their party consumed the entire block, and seemed family oriented because unlike their normal weekend parties they set up tables and had a ""professional"" carpet cleaner come out beforehand (another friend of theirs). 

They have parties every single weekend and often at various points during the week. The people who attend these parties give zero fucks about the other people who live on the block. They park in front of driveways, slam their doors at 2am and then remote-lock their car 20 times as it ""beeps"" every time (although I'm now fairly certain they do this just to spite me personally). They pull up BLASTING music with the bass turned up to where the windows in the back of my house shake. The trash that was apparently sitting on the floor of their car falls out when they exit and they leave it there (or they'll intentionally throw trash in my yard). For the past 60+ weeks I've picked up their empty soda bottles, chip bags, and beer bottles (the ones that aren't broken) from my front yard bi-weekly without fail. The music that they play from inside their house is loud enough to be heard in the back room of my basement. 

The first issue that came up us involved them parking on their front lawn. Now, while I consider this to be trashy, it didn't bother me enough to actually say anything until one of them got swiped coming out onto the road by a passing car. The ground outside at the time was slightly frosted over, and there was a tree (no longer there) that kind of obscured the car from the road, which itself is a bit narrow. I didn't witness the actual crash but I saw the aftermath, and all I could think about was the same thing happening to my fiance with my kid in the back. A few weeks after the accident passed, as the winter got harsher, and they were still parking in the lawn (same guy, same car, sans front bumper), so I contacted the city. Soon after that they were no longer parking in the lawn... and my real problems began.

**The Harassment**

After being told they could no longer park in their yard they began parking directly in front of my house. Where previously someone would only park there when their driveway and the front of \*their\* house was full, they began making the front of \*my\* house a priority. At night, they were backing into their driveway, which is on a slight decline, and putting on their high beams, which has the effect of illuminating every room of my house on the second floor. Initially I thought I was being paranoid. There's no way they were doing it to spite me, right? But then I'd watch as they'd sit there for 15-20 minutes while blasting music right up until the 10:30 noise ""curfew"" and then flicker their headlights a bunch before finally getting out and going inside.

That's also when the trash started piling up in front of my house. And not just along the street, but specifically in my yard. I started watching as their friends would come around (at literally ANY point in the day or night). I watch as they park in front of my house, look towards my windows, and kick some trash out while laughing to whoever else is in the car with them. It wasn't long before broken beer bottles started showing up in the \*\*grass\*\*. Spots began developing in my yard where almost a year later grass still doesn't grow from whatever they poured. Oil spots litter the road in front of my home. I can't play with my kid in my front yard.

I've talked to some of them on several occasions. After they started shining their headlights and leaving trash specifically in my yard I bought them a bottle of liquor and brought it over as a ""peace offering"" and said I should have talked to them about my concerns of them parking in their yard during the snow season rather than complaining to the city. The guy I spoke to, which seems to be the main lessee of the place, told me that he and the people he rents to have a lot of friends over and sometimes they are messy and that he was sorry for the trash. I thought everything was good, but a little more than a week later was when the first broken bottle showed up.

I decided to complain to the city again, but this time I didn't want to name any specific houses, I just made a general complaint about the trash on the street. The next day I see a city truck drive by their house slowly. Later that afternoon a red van pulled up in front of \*my\* house and three guys sat and stared at my home for 20+ minutes. I wasn't sure if they were just waiting for someone but after they pulled away without anyone having gotten in or out I became suspicious of it being malicious. This was all but confirmed when I came home from the store later on that night to find a truck backed up right in the middle of my driveway, which hauled ass going right past me as soon as I got there. I reported all of this to the police.

Over the course of numerous complaints to the city it became obvious that the complaints I was making were being disclosed to the people I complained about. After the incident with the truck and van I complained again to the city about the trash, this time naming them directly, and mentioned the large spot that was starting to form in my yard close to where they parked. The next day I saw someone park, get out and walk over to the spot, look down directly at the spot I mentioned in my complaint where the grass was no longer growing, laugh, and walk back towards the house. The day after that where was a broken glass bottle right in that exact spot. It was clearly intentional as it was a whole glass bottle that was somehow crushed on the grass. I don't know if they have friends that work for the city or if the city just forward the complaints in their entirety. 

One morning I awoke to find they were parked nearly halfway in front of my driveway from the night before. My wife could hardly even get out of the driveway to work. I waited until around 10am before I called local dispatch. A cop came, talked to me, and then told them to move the car. It was after 12:30 when someone finally got in and drove off. They don't give a fuck about what the cops tell them. That whole week they'd have their friends and family park directly in front of my driveway while ""waiting"" for people to come out. That's in quotations because it didn't seem that any waiting was actually necessary since often times they're all out on the front porch drinking. 

There have been a couple instances where guys with tattoos all over their face and stomachs, with no shirts on and pants hanging halfway to their knees, are standing on the sidewalk in front of my front door, every once in a while glancing over. At any given time there's 3-6 cars that belong to them parked along the road, not including any friends/family they might have over at the moment (as I write this there are a total of 8 cars that belong to them outside. Yes, EIGHT). There's at least one person ALWAYS out on the porch, watching both sides of the road. They know every time I leave or come home. One day after the trash started appearing in my yard I decided to throw a can of beer back onto their lawn. A few days later the exterior glass panel of my kid's window was broken and we had to get the whole unit replaced.

**Drug Dealing Suspicions**

During this time I purchased a surveillance camera. Well, I made one using a Pi and a $25 camera module I got off Amazon. I started reviewing the footage every night. Long story short (too late, I know) I have countless examples of chives pulling up, someone from the house going up to the vehicle, and the vehicle driving off. Not just several a week, but sometimes several a day.

I started noticing how people who visited often times would bring in power tools. Then I started noticing that at night they were loading something(?) in black trash bags into their vehicles. Sometimes two of them will carry the object out and place it into a trunk before one drives away and returns half an hour or so later... in the dead of night. At first I thought they were moving out, but this has gone on for months now. I'm clueless as to what they might be doing, and I've certainly considered the possibility that they AREN'T doing anything illegal, but... well, that seems highly unlikely given everything I've witnessed.

**Current Situation**

I'm in contact with the local chief of police directly over all of this. He's well aware of the harassment, but there's nothing that can be done legally.  He wants me to provide the footage and tags I've been collecting these past 6+ months, and he wants to say I'll testify in court when the time comes to prove how they got said footage and information of the drug dealings. I simply can't put my family in the kind of danger that would expose us to. 

I'm at a complete loss of what I should do at this point. I feel like I'm going to mentally break at some point and take a baseball bat to their faces. The more I talk to the police or city the worse off it gets. Because I haven't worked in two years we can't afford to move. I'm literally afraid of even getting a job at this point because I'm afraid to even leave the house. I'm afraid to take my daughter to parks unless either me or my wife is home. There's little doubt in my mind that the only reason my house hasn't been burglarized is because they know I'm home so often. I don't want to risk leaving my dogs home with the possibility of some revenge attack. I'm terrified of them opening my back gate or throwing tainted food over the fence where my dogs roam. I'm losing my sanity and there's absolutely nothing I can do to remedy this situation.",06Sep2019,2
649,"So I was staying at the house of a ""friend"" of mine, and he was doing me a favor so that I would not book a hotel. While I was out, I told him I would meet some guys because I wanted to go back home alone (otherwise he would insist on giving me a ride and I really wanted to walk alone)... As I was walking to his house I saw him and his girl sitting in a cafe and I immediately turned around... I am pretty sure they spotted me since his gf called me but I didn't respond... When I returned home (he wasn't there) I gave him a call saying that I returned and to find out where he was in an attempt to show that I was ok with having contact with him.

If my girlfriend of 3 months (first one) doesnt even appriciate my opinion, and says that my opinion doesnt have any weight on her decisions, which I understand but its the way of throwing my opinion to the fucking garbage, when I care for her but clearly she doesnt for me.

I honestly dont know what to send her. I want out, I tried once and I couldnt. 

I need fucking advice 😭

so there’s this boy i really like and he said that he really liked me as well. we used to talk and we were kinda linking but after about a week and a half he stopped talking to me. like completely stopped, i didn’t hear from him at all
some stuff happened with his mates (nothing bad) a few days after and he asked me if i was getting with any of them and i said no cos i didn’t like them at all tbh 
he only dms me when he’s asking if i’m getting with his mate and it really annoys me cos he knows i still like him. he’s responded to this stupid sticker thing i put on my private story asking if anyone would get with me and he put “yes” (i only put it on just so he’d see it and hopefully he’d put yes lmao)
i want to talk to him again cos he’s really nice and really funny but idk how to start talking to him again cos idk if he even wants to talk to me

657,"So this is definitely one of those ""first world problem"" scenarios, but I really need help.

So a few years ago I started a fanpage for the office on Instagram, and it has grown into a page that is quite successful. I am able to make $100 an ad. Also last year I got a under the table job for a company where I am getting paid 150 a week to review movies. 

Recently, I got a job at a froyo/ice cream place, which I really wanted as it close to me and my parents have pushed me to get work experience. After the interview, I got the job and I found out what my pay was 8.84 and hour-below minimum wage. They are able to do this because I am technically a ""seasonal worker"". Working 11 hours in a week gets me a little over a hundred dollars and that's before taxes. 

At this place you set the hours your available to work, and even then you might not get those hours. I have just started my senior year of high school. Although I have just been working here two weeks, I don't know if this job feels worth it as I can do less work for more money on my page and review job, while here I do more work and I am compensated less.

When I brought this up to my parents they said I should keep the job as I need work experience, but I have worked as a camp counselor before. I am grateful to have been hired here as I tried hard for the job, but it doesn't seem worth it, but to them it doe.

Im really asking for any advice here. Should I keep the job? Do I get one somewhere else? Is the work experience worth it? If not, how do I convince my parents that the work experience isn't with it?",06Sep2019,1
658,"I got divorced about 5 years ago, my daughter was 4 at the time. It was a lot of change and I sort of put off thinking about changing my name (I took my ex husbands name when I got married). I just kept my married name after the divorce. 

Over time it has begun to bother me that I still have my ex husbands last name. It just doesn’t feel right. I don’t want his name. 

However I would not change back to my maiden name, which I do not like, because (1) it is slang for something gross - obscure, but I don’t like it and (2) it doesn’t flow well with my first name. So, I think I would like to change my last name to my dads middle name, which is still a family name and which sounds very pretty with my first name, and also feels very “me”. 

I mentioned this to my daughter and she freaked out. She doesn’t want to have a different last name than me. She says it is “our” family name. 

I also mentioned this to a few friends and they didn’t think that changing my name back was weird but did think it was weird to, in their words, “just pick a new last name”.

I know I need to do what is best for me (although my daughters well being and feelings on this matter very much to me). So, I am now conflicted on what to do. Has anyone been through this and has advice?",06Sep2019,1
659,"I was never great at keeping jobs, but I was okay at it.  I noticed I have an easier time keeping a job if I go to therapy at the same time. Here is a breakdown of my tenure at jobs from 2008 through 2017 (before my father's death)-

Amusement park job - 3.5 years (I liked this one a lot but a family member convinced me to quit. I made various people pretty damn mad here though, but I got along with others very well. I was able to speak my mind here freely which I haven't been able to do at other jobs).

Seasonal cashier job - 1 month (I got the feeling my manager didn't like me on day one and at the end of the month he said I wasn't a culture fit).

Fast food job - 1 week (Half me getting fired and half me quitting).

Cashier job - 1.5 years (This one was pretty good, my co-workers were mad at me for leaving).

Shift manager job - 8 months (I just wasn't good at the job, but I tried really hard).

An internship while I was at the 1.5 year long cashier job - This one was fine, but I basically got told my work was sub-par.

Another internship just doing random administrative tasks for a few months - This one was fine, she didn't want me to leave, but I didn't do much.

A help desk job for 2 months as a contractor - This one was great. I worked there for a month and then they called me back to do another month. I basically got on well with everyone. This was where I went to college.

An analyst job for 2 years as a contractor (I did therapy during this time as well) - This one was okay. I worked with some rude people but overall the job was fine and paid well. I did get very sick working here though, several health problems emerged.

A help desk job for 4 months as a contractor - Neither me or my co-workers knew what they were doing so I think they just kept the popular people. I was fired four days after my dad died.

After he died, things got shitty.

I moved to Austin and took another help desk job. I got abused a good deal. Verbally harassed, made fun of for what I brought to lunch to eat or what I ate for breakfast, made fun of for how I smelled (starting at that help desk job I developed a bad odor, which I think is under control now). made fun of for how I walked, had my lunch tampered with and drugs mixed in (if I'm being honest, based on my fast heartbeat and issues after eating one day). I didn't feel safe here. My high anxiety while working probably made my odor worse. On top of that, it appeared that my car was getting vandalized while at work and so I had harassed the police department on the phone multiple times because they weren't doing anything about it. I'm talking key scratches all the way around the perimeter of my car among other damages. My life was also threatened while working here and several other shitty things happened such as a coworker playing beheading videos in the bathroom and other shit I am not even going to get into.

Other jobs -

Working data entry at a bank - More harassment and verbal bullying toward me and a girl who became friends there. Fired only 2 weeks after the job started and I was good at this. All you had to do was data entry and balance. The middle aged women here couldn't stand me.

The last one was working as a dispatcher for 4 months. This one was fine, but this 18 year old wanted me out so I extrapolated my experience from Austin and was just didn't want to experience that again and left.

While I was in Austin, I'm pretty sure I made the cops hate me. When I was accused of a crime I didn't commit, I got sent to jail until a relative of mine was able to post bail and while I was there I was sent to the floor where people who have been to jail before go and I hadn't ever been there. On top of that, I have photos of conversations with people who I can't prove are linked to the cops there, who said they were glad I went to jail. The guy who sent me to jail was jealous that I cheated on him, basically. I got into a relationship with a guy from another country because I was desperate.  I was dating around a lot there but I let a few good potential partners fall through my fingers so I settled on him and it was the wrong decision.

I have to go back to Austin in a week to see a doctor down there. And I'm job searching, again, story of my life.

When I think about that city (Austin) I have a lot of negative memories. I lived on the north side which is basically the country side for all intensive purposes.  If you want the real experience, you need to live on the south side. People were really keen about flaunting their intelligence in your face for no reason.  When I moved into my apartment, the woman who lived right beside me was getting evicted and was hounding the people who lived across from her for letting her kids be so loud, play on the stairwell and curse all the time, and lo and behold, someone from that household threw some breakable shit at my door in the middle of the night.

I try to reconcile these experiences sometimes to try and figure out why my experience here was so shitty in some very serious aspects.  On the other hand, I did have some great dates and some good short situation-ships.  I wouldn't call any of what I experienced a true relationship. But yeah, I met some really cool people. And if my decisions had been slightly different, I could have really snagged someone up for a good relationship. I got to party, something I don't do in Dallas, and I generally felt more free.  Partying was fun, drinking was fun, going out was fun, dancing was fun. That part of it was enjoyable and fun but the lows were so damn low. 

I have been applying for so many jobs and even ones I am for sure, without a shadow of a doubt good for will not come through for me and it doesn't make sense. I've had better luck after taking a class on getting employment but the search is still sucking and not bearing much fruit. The felon that my mom is dating just makes me sick. He can't get a job anywhere, so he sells metal and mows lawns and does random house mechanic-type work for people. There is honestly so many things wrong with him, I cannot even start. But the living situation with him and her gets worse by the day to the point where I'm trying to figure out how little I need from a job to live on my own.

Oh yeah, something else about Austin. I got death threats through dating apps as well, which doesn't happen in Dallas either, and they were scary, like all the threats I got were actually scary, they aren't like they are here where it's manageable to me.  People in Dallas are nicer, but I also have no life here.

Anyway, I haven't applied to any jobs in Austin. And I thought since I'm going to be there in a week anyway, why not apply for some jobs in north Austin? The thought almost turns my stomach a little bit but I honestly don't know what to do.  Living out there is so expensive, I don't think I would be able to forward even going out to eat this time around.  I would probably just do the free stuff which kinda makes me sad but I'm just kinda desperate.

If I do have to move back out there, I guess the changes I would make would be the following: I wouldn't call the cops ever, for anything. I already have a therapist, so that's different. And I probably wouldn't let anyone move in with me like I did last time. I just really do need advice. 

I have applied for jobs in other states but the require me go and interview which I cannot even afford. I'm also kinda scared that someone I angered (for good reason or no good reason) in Austin will try and get revenge on me somehow. I really did no one wrong, the worst they could be mad at me for is saying something mean or not wanting to be with them.",06Sep2019,1
660,"I know what you’ll say before you hear my story, millions of people suffer with depression and I should just get a diagnosis if I’m unsure. For me it’s different, I’ve researched depression and there are different stages to it, it’s like the autism spectrum, there is mild and highly severe depression. I’ve taken 8 tests and all indicate I have severe depression. I don’t really want to get into it but I’ve had a very rough life so far and a lot of trauma, my father is now in prison. After a court case my step father was driven away and so were my two foster brothers who left because of the court case involving my step dad and me. My mother loved my stepdad despite some of the things he’d done and my foster brothers had been living with us all our lives, my only other family member is my older brother who recently just moved away. In the house it’s just me and my mother, she is known for having a boisterous attitude and positive approach for everything to the point of annoyance, after I’d driven away 3 family members whenever she looks at me it’s with disgust. I don’t blame her. She used to be so happy, now she just acts deadened it’s like I’ve killed her, she doesn’t even look at me, she can’t stand the sight of me. I’ve struggled with anger issues ever since my father left he left an imprint on me which made me wreck less around the house, even before everyone left things were bad. My family would generally just pretend I wasn’t there and if I did something wrong they said that I was lucky I wasn’t being disowned and I was my fathers son and I was sworn at too many times daily by them. I don’t really have any friends, I have a generally high IQ so at a young age I realised that I wasn’t like every other kid, my father beat me as a child from as early as 3 and I was given alcohol from an early age, my mindset became deadened, every other kid was laughing and joking etc. and learning new things like dating and things like that (this was at an early age) but I had already grown up and seen too much of the world and saw the roadblocks where other people saw possibility. I don’t mean to be dramatic but as a child I went through some shit that most people don’t go through in their whole lives, I wanted to escape, so what I did was at an early age I became a sociopath. The person I really was wasn’t anything i wanted other people to see, so I crafted “characters” for different places, for school I would be the popular guy, at home I would be the formal guy etc. I even came up with names for my personas and I made sure each character was completely different to me making different laughs and hairstyles etc. This was my way of trying to fit in with everybody else, I knew because I’d been through so much I could manipulate others, I was highly smart for my age, so I controlled people verbally through 4-5 different acts. This went on for ages, people started calling me an “ass” in school for being a popular jerk, that’s what people get with popularity. I yearned to tell them that it was just an act but I had successfully made a cluster of devoted “friends”, I felt nothing for them though they were all obnoxious assholes but I don’t think I truly love anyone. I’ve always felt deadened emotionally like all the things happening to me were happening to somebody else. I feel drained all the time and lack the mental strength for anything. I’ve isolated myself from other people, sure my characters are sociable but I make sure it’s always just in school, if someone asks me to go out with friends I generally say no and shut myself in my room the only times I ever say yes is when I feel I need to solidify friendships with key people for future needs. I think of suicide every day and have begun self harming, I’m not emo or anything , in school I am generally known as one of the popular clique because I made sure to involve myself with sports and such for the sake of my character. I wear a smile and talk but it’s all manual in my head I’m thinking about my mother’s dead expression when I get home. The only person besides maybe my mother I’ve ever cared for was a girl i know who is the only generally kind person I know and is truly a pure person, she is beautiful. I don’t even entertain telling her how I feel, I don’t deserve someone like that, somebody pure, I am so contaminated by all that’s wrong in the world and I’ve hurt so many people. I don’t deserve love, I don’t deserve to taint someone else for my own gain, I couldn’t do that. I’ll probably just die alone anyway, I can’t tell anyone I think I have depression, they won’t take me seriously and it will compromise all my characters. I need advice or I may kill myself.",06Sep2019,1

My main question is: How do you find classes at a time when you are either working odd hours or an unpredictable schedule? I work night shifts, and I can never seem to find stuff close to me. 

Is there a given place people can find classes that aren't prohibitively expensive?

I'm in a place in life where I just feel stuck all the time, and I work but I feel like I never have time to take a class or do things, like kayaking, or piano, or learning how to work in a museum/garden professionally, or welding.

How do you find events that are near you?

666,"My current boyfriend doesn’t want me to talk to my ex boyfriend but the reason I ask this question is because he lives in an area where a hurricane Dorian is hitting and I just wanna shoot a text saying “hey hope you’re doing okay, be safe” which I did that before last year when they got hit. My ex boyfriend lives so far from me and I don’t have any feelings towards him. We used to be good friends before we dated.

Not that there is anything wrong with this, but she is now advertising a diet presentation which will cost an amount of money to see this weekend. 
We are not involved in the health or diet or fitness industry and our jobs don’t relate to that, it just seems to be something she is interested in (which is fine).

I don’t really want to see a presentation over the weekend and I don’t really want to pay the money either. I’m feeling pressured and have been reminded of it several times, even texted to remind me after work. (I don’t think any of my other coworkers will go either and that plays into my feelings of guilt.)

Just curious how to indicate that I’m not interested after having that conversation a month ago that probably started this (I feel guilty as though I mislead her, but I never indicated that I’d want to see a presentation for a few hours over the weekend, etc.)

670,"She’s actually serious about this. 

When my sister first told me about our mom’s suspicions, I laughed it off. “It’s gotta be those TV shows,” I told my sister, “I mean, she’s always been paranoid, she can’t possibly think that!”

My mom has suspected my dad is seeing other women, and often suspects my sister is on hard drugs. I’m pretty used to her (annoying but mostly harmless) paranoia. My mom also works in business as a VP head of Human Resources of a big company, so maybe she’s just seen too much shit at work. 

That’s what I thought. 

My sister told me that apparently my mom’s been suspecting this for years, and now feels confirmed enough in her suspicions to tell my sister and my dad. Apparently, my mom thinks I’m going to murder someone (she especially thinks I’m gonna kill her and my dad). She’s thinking of making me come home or even lock me up, but thankfully my dad and sister are on my side. They’ve convinced her that she’s just overthinking things. 

To be fair, I’m a little pissed. This is going a little far, even for my mom. I have no reason to want to murder my family, especially after all they’ve done for me. Not to mention it’s well,,,, murder, it doesn’t make sense. My mom knows me— I’m always keep a cool head and I’m almost always rational in my approach to life. I’m not going to have some fit of rage and murder someone, in fact I’ve never even felt properly angry in my life. My family’s great, so this is quite out of the left field :/

I do understand where my mom is coming from. As a kid, I did have some issues with communication and some problematic behaviours. I did hurt small animals, but I stopped after people told me it wasn’t allowed (it was only for my butterfly collection and science experiments anyway, haha I was such a nerd). I got expelled (not *expelled* per se but indefinitely suspended so I decided to go to first grade) from kindergarten for starting a business— to be fair I was just redistributing new stationary from the storage room to the masses in exchange for snacks. I have drawn and acted out some violent things in my youth, but *have you seen* Tom and Jerry? That shit’s violent af man. When I was younger I used to fake illness or anxiety attacks to get out of tests I hadn’t studied for, but who hasn’t when they were young and stupid?

But I completely reformed by the end of middle school. I got straight A’s, I was school president, I went to a prestigious high school and I’m now attending a top university. I’ve racked up a hefty amount of awards and accomplishments already. I also volunteer and I raised 5K USD for the kids from an underfunded school I taught at. Almost everyone likes me, and those who don’t are teachers who didn’t like my propensity for debate.  I’ve told my parents many times that when I’m older and successful, I’ll definitely get them a big house to retire to. Yes, I could call more, but don’t they understand that I’m trying to be successful and make them proud?

It seems absurd to me that my mom still thinks I’m some sort of psychopath— no one other than her thinks that. Just from the general consensus, she’s probably taking a paranoid thought too far. I confronted her about this and she started being real upset, saying shit like how she was right or something. I told her I’ve never treated her badly and I will never neglect my duties as her child— make her proud and take care of her in her old age. She tells me that only a psychopath like me could do what I have done, and that she’s “done making excuses”. She says there’s something wrong with me if a “sweet girl like (my) girlfriend” would leave me. I’d already explained to the whole family that we just didn’t match and it was nobody’s fault. My girlfriend had deep emotional issues and conflicts with her family, and it got between us. I needed to focus on my academics and career success, and I couldn’t spend my attention on my gf. Why does my mom think that’s psychopathic? It’s perfectly reasonable!

Now I’m not sure what to do. My sister told me I best talk to our mom some more, but I feel as if I’ve hit a wall. I know this mostly won’t get much attention, but any advice is appreciated.",06Sep2019,1
671,"So for context I work as a mechanic and that means you have to buy all of your own tools to do the job.

About a year ago I bought 3 sets of stepped drill bits (on sale from 30$ a set down to 10$ a set) for 30$ total. I ended up never using them for the purpose I envisioned as I found a different method that I preferred instead. They sat in my toolbox collecting dust until a work mate decided to use them. I don't mind if people use my tools so long as your respect them and pay for non warranty tools that may break due to use. 

So workmate uses them and Burnes all the bits. I'm cool with that just give me the money that I put into them. So he gave me 30$ to replace the set(s). I figured that since I don't use that tool and only he does I'd rather spend the 30$ on a tool that I do need. Plus I would need to go to Canadian Tire to buy it.

Yesterday he goes to my box looking for the replaced set and it's not there and I told him I used the money on other tools. He loses his shit... Accuses me of theft and raises his voice and starts to make verbal threats to my health (assault me) and threats to my property (tools). I remain calm and disengage from conversing with him further as it would be futile to do so.

The way I see it is say you get in a fender bender and instead of going through insurance you decide to pay out of pocket to the other party to cover the damage. The other party is not bound by anything to go and get the repairs done and can leave the damage there and use the money on other things. It's their money do as you wish, that's not theft you were compensated for damage delt to your property. 

This guy is saying that since I didn't replace the tool I stole the money. He is suggesting that I take the money and spend MY time and MY gas money to purchase a tool that will effectively only be used by him. I call bs, you pay me for my monetary loss and you spend your time and money to procure a tool that you need. 

It should be noted this guy is related to the owner and has very few tools that he personally owns, he mostly borrows other people's tools and shop owner tools.

Did I steal or did he get blinded by rage and act completely inappropriately? Please help as I really do feel that I am not in the wrong and this event is distracting me from being focused on other tasks.

She went outside to meet with friends maybe 3 times over the whole summer. The only other times she went outside was to bike with me maybe 5 times when I really forced her. She doesn't do anything productive nor entertaining. I literally do not understand how she could lie in bed for 20 hours a day. She has no (physical) illnesses so I don't see what's the problem. She does not act depressed (even if she was depressed, she'd never go outside, especially not for a therapist), she just really prefers to stay in bed. It's the worst phone/internet addiction I've ever seen. I am not exaggerating how much time she spends in bed, on her phone.

Me and my parents have tried everything we can think of. We've tried to give her heart-to-heart talks, bribe her with money/food/etc., given consequences to her actions, given her rewards for anything we can think of... and we've come to the end of the line. We can't think of anything else to do. It pains me to see her wasting her life away during her most critical years of her life (so far).

She just does not want to change. I've asked her if she enjoys it and she says yes. She's literally just addicted and there's nothing we can do. We've taken away her phone but she throws weeks-long tantrums but we have to give it back eventually because unfortunately her school gives her online homework and she needs online up/downloads.

I have the following options:

1. Stay with my parents until next August at which point my fiancee should get a raise and I can move in with her to continue my job search in Dallas. (assuming I still haven't found something near her
   1. This likely involves trying to work in HVAC (not what I want to do or get trapped in) for a company which formerly employed me as a laborer but might take me as an assistant engineer.
   2. HVAC has a reputation for being difficult to transfer out of after working as an engineer, so I'm worried about essentially unusable experience and facing the same issue as I have now when I do want to move.
2. Move to Indiana and pursue employment with the company that I had my internship with in manufacturing
   1. I don't know how long this would last.
3. Move to Dallas now and take a job doing whatever I can and largely burden my fiancee
4. Significantly broaden my search and possibly find work away from everyone I know and love but gain money and some personal freedom (from parents).
5. Things y'all can suggest?

676," Throwaway account. My boss told a coworker that he will talk to our country manager to get me fired and he (my boss) is laying the groundwork that can get me fired. This coworker spilled the beans to me.

Now my boss hates me because I answer his emails strongly - nothing insulting or demeaning whatsoever just that I can get defensive on writing and when his emails seem like an attack. He can be very threatening in his emails sometimes.

He also threatened me before that he’ll fire me as he feels like he can’t work with me because I am difficult just basing on the way I respond to him on mails

The thing is, all his complaints about me in the past I’ve addressed with him and I have always performed and delivered my part. And we also talked about this issue a while ago and I thought this has been settled and resolved as we reached an understanding. I have done everything he wanted me to do though when it comes to work and being accountable. Then I hear this kind of gossip and it’s spreading around.

I am planning to report this directly to the country manager as we are small company and no proper HR to deal with this.

We do have a company code of conduct that says employees behavior should not be detrimental to the quality of the environment of fellow employees. And that the company opposes intimidation. I will cite this code of conduct to file a complaint. And the person who spilled the beans to me is willing to testify for me, that my boss told him this.

I am also going to report about the threats as part of intimidation complaint - although not quite sure if I should. Or should it be considered a verbal warning for me? 

In terms of insubordination, I may respond strongly on emails but I never defied orders. My tone is usually defensive.

My state is not at-will state and dismissal of an employee follows due process. We get severance pay if we get dismissed without proper process.

The only reason I am reporting this is because I thought I have settled his issue with me and honest to goodness I always do what he says except that I can get really defensive on emails.

What would you do in my position?",06Sep2019,1
677,"Hey everyone! I have a situation that I want to handle with as much professionalism as possible. I recently had my 2nd interview with 2 different companies, and both went well and I am expecting an offer from both. I would prefer to work at Company 1 because it pays more, and the commute is shorter. However, I did the interviews with Company 2 because nothing is a guarantee and I want to make sure I have a job ASAP. I also want to be clear that I could see myself happy at either job, so if only one offers the job to me that is okay as well.

The job with Company 2 would start October 21st if I accept, and the job with Company 1 would start as soon as I am available. My worry here is that Company 2 will call and offer me the job before Company 1. Would it be okay to tell them I am waiting for another offer to come in before accepting? Or should I just accept the job from Company 2 if it comes in first, and then if Company 1 offers as well revoke my offer to Company 2? I want to be professional and refuse on good terms, so I really am hoping that Company 1 calls first so I can avoid this whole situation.

678,"I don't want to give too much detail away but I took a job a few years ago, after I couldn't find a techie job I really wanted.  It kind of worked out for me because they were actually looking for someone with technical skills and the job I applied for I only really did about 25% of my time. I kind of had some side agreements with my boss to do this techie stuff. 

I loved the job, I would get into work 2 hours early, leave late and often reply to emails late into the night. I really loved my job and it allowed me to innovate and be creative.

Then, we got bought by a conglomerate, my boss didn't come with us. After we moved into a new company things just kind of went downhill. All the little side agreements I had with my boss evaporated so the 25% of stuff I didn't like, became 100% of my day. 

I feel pissed off about it but I can't really blame them, all they're asking me to do is what is in the job description that I signed three years ago. I guess they would be confused that I want to do stuff not related to my job role  They're pushing me to manage, start building up my own team. I have a great opportunity, I could get paid well but I don't want it.

I still leave for work 2 hours early but I don't go to work until 9am. I go somewhere to study hoping that I can qualify myself to do the techie things properly. I've thought about quitting but people tell me to stay until I find a new job.

I did talk to my new line manager about this who is really just a colleague who's been given management responsibilities , I did get some positive noises telling me he can find some stuff when things quieten down.  And he did eventually but it took me all of 5 minutes and that was it. 

I guess I should just put my CV out there. But having the wrong experience may make it hard. I feel like just telling my boss, just so he at least knows why I might seem disengaged. I don't know if it will do anything though.",06Sep2019,1
679,"Hi r/advice. I really need someone right now.

My girlfriend, best friend and recently domestic partner dumped me last tuesday. I recieved a phone call saying it’s over and not up for discussion. I still don’t know why she did it, but she doesn’t want to talk about it or to me at all. 

Ever since then I’ve only been able to eat breakfast, I can not get myself to cook a proper meal and even if I am served food I can only take a couple of bites before feeling full and wanting to throw up. I wake up every night from nightmares and cannot return to sleep as the thoughts in my head are just too many. I feel extremly tired, nauseous, light headed and just drained of will to get anything done. I don’t know if it’s okay to say such things but I really just want things to end, I don’t want to experience another day.  All I can think of is giving up

680,"I work for a salon in Tennessee. It’s 100% commission based pay wise and I am NOT paid anything hourly. I get 50% of the services I do and they get 50%. Meaning if I am not booked I am not being paid. 
When I am not booked I go “on call” which means if someone calls in and wants an appointment with me the front desk will call me and I will come in earlier than my next scheduled appointment. (Say I work 10-6. I don’t have anything booked from 10-2, I can go on call and leave and then come in for my next appt at 2.) 
However, my boss is now saying that we aren’t allowed to go on call longer than 45 minutes OR take a lunch longer than 30 minutes. Sometimes I won’t be booked for literally HOURS. Last week my schedule was open from 9-6and I only had appointments from 4-6. So this means she now wants me to sit at work without being paid for all those hours with no appointments. 
We make our own schedules and I twice a week work more than 9 hours in a day since other days I only work 6 hours. And some days I’ll be 100% booked up and won’t have a lunch at all. 
I’m aware this isn’t legal to say we can take only a 30 minute lunch when we aren’t scheduled breaks. But how is she getting away with this? And what can I do?
We already don’t get any benefits or PTO because she calls us “booth rent” or “self contractors” when it’s not- it’s commission. Which means we are employees and not “booth rent” (self employed) and we have uniforms we have to wear as well and we also don’t book any of our own appointments or pay for our own supplies. 

What all rules is she breaking and how can I protect myself against this? Also where can I find a list of laws she has to comply with? I can’t find these anywhere other than just heresay.",06Sep2019,1
682,"Firstly, I want to start by acknowledging that I’m not an adult yet. I don’t need to be told that and my parents and I have a relationship where if I act like an adult I get treated like one. I pay my own way, pay all of my bills, contribute to the household chores and help with babysitting weekly.

There are a few things that have made me reach my breaking point with my mother, each situation itself is not a huge deal but as a collective whole, I think I’m about lose my crap.

I’m going to number the situations so you can tell they’re separate.

1. A printer for Christmas:
So since I became a teenager my parents have been really stingy at Christmas, there’s been a few incidents that piss me off really bad. One year they bought me a used laptop, it worked perfectly and I loved it. At the time I was only 13-14 years old so I can’t exactly recollect what was wrong with the laptop, if there was any. Well my parents took the laptop and sold it saying there was something seriously wrong with it, to my knowledge there was nothing wrong with it. We’ve always been tight on money so I understand needing to sell it, but that was my only Christmas gift and it wasn’t that expensive to begin with. Fast forward a few years, December 2018 my mom told my grandma I was in desperate need of a printer for school. I didn’t need a printer at all, although it’s nice to have. My moms printer doesn’t work and she specifically told my grandma I needed one. My mom says she had no thought of herself when telling my grandma that but I realize that’s total garbage as my mom is mainly the one using the printer and it’s on her desktop, not mine. My mom also uses this printer more than me but I’ve got stuck paying for half the ink (which is super expensive) and I barely even use the damn thing???  

2. My brother poops his pants:
So my brother (7) poops his pants a lot, he’s got a few behavioral problems but he poops his pants a lot during he school year, at least 2x a week. Anyways, my mom always washes him off in my shower and leaves the shitty underwear in the shower for me to handle. It’s really frustrating me at this point because she never cleans out the shower and I’m a pretty big germaphobe and it drives me nuts. I’m not like crazy, I just think poop is gross to just leave around...

3. Towels:
My mom has my brothers take a shower before me and I even have my own towels but she just lets my brothers use my towels instead of theirs. It really sucks getting out of the shower and having to use a wet towel that someone else used. I just think it’s gross to swap towels with another person but ALL 4 towels will be wet after my shower.

4. Errands:
I’m always running errands for my mom, I’ll run to the store, I’ll get her food or coffee. She never thanks me and I always go out of my way to do these things for her. I’ll drive all the way across town to go to her favorite coffee location (DD) even if I’m already by one. She just likes the drinks better at one location over the other for some reason. I always use my gas for this and put a ton of miles on my car running her errands. On top of that she lets me carry groceries in or bags of food and won’t even open the door for me so I’m struggling to unlock the door while carrying her shit.

5. Driving:
This is my biggest pet peeve. I hate when people talk on the phone when driving and I hate being called when I’m driving. I’ve voiced this to my mom several times saying that it makes me uncomfortable to talk on the phone while driving and EVERY time I’m driving she calls me and wants to talk forever. She can’t go 5min without talking to someone.

6. My mom blows everything out of proportion, it’ll be a tiny incident or miscommunication and she throws a huge tantrum and makes everyone miserable. 

7. Sleepwalking:
I’m a huge sleepwalker, I’ll just wake up and do weird shit and not even know until the next morning. Some thing I’ll do is get ready for school/work, clean up my bathroom, or take my retainer out and throw it or set it on my bathroom counter. I do some other weird stuff it’s just not notable. Anyways, my mom has my email on her phone so she can’t see what I look up on google. A few months ago I talked about college and my mom freaked out on me for wanting to move out of state to a location I was in love with. Anyways I guess I must’ve been sleepwalking the other night and looked it up on my phone or computer. My mom freaked out on me saying I was a liar and wanted to move away....
I have no recollection of looking this up and don’t think I’d look that up in my sleep, she could’ve looked it up herself. She kept calling me a liar.

8. Moving out:
My parents literally guilt me when I say I’m gonna move out one day, tel me I’ll fall flat on my face and will struggle.

9. School:
So I just started my prerequisites for nursing school and last minute my mom decided she wanted to do the same. I now have to sacrifice my study time to babysit her 5 other kids so that SHE can have time to study. We have some of the same classes so she uses the textbooks I purchased and uses my notes and essays as an example. She didn’t even thank me for this and I asked her to my mark up the textbooks as they cost $300 out of pocket. She said she’ll mark them up and then just pay my back for them, meaning I’ll probably get $20 a book from her when I could easily resell for $80-$90. 

10. My parents have screwed me out of so much money. I’ve let my parents borrow over a $1000 and I never saw that money, I was told they raised me so they deserve it. In March I began driving and my dad sold me his old crown Vic for $800 until I could purchase a decent vehicle. Well after I bought my newer car, I had a buyer willing to pay $1000 for the car. My parents begged me to hold of selling my car so they could buy it back for $400!!!! They never bought it back and my dad decided to do a V8 swap with the mini pick up he just bought for $1600. So I’ll never see the money for the car I put money into because of my parents. My parents are in a lot of debt and over the summer they asked me to pay some rent, I thought they’d ask for maybe $100-$200 because they own their house and only pay util and the land our house sits on. It’s maybe $700 on average and they originally asked me to pay $500 a month covering almost all the util and house stuff. We decided on $400 which was okay, but all the bills split almost every member in the house would give me what I thought they’d ask for. My parents are super irresponsible and had just opened up a motorcycle payment at this time, conveniently the monthly cost of the motorcycle was $400.

Halfway through the summer I lost one of my jobs, I was working 60-70 hours a week to save for a car and pay my $800 total worth of bills. My parents still expected me to pay even though I had lost $1800 a month. I was really frustrated and stressed. Nobody really cared.

11. The dogs:
I’ve had my dog about a year and my parents just got their dog. They use my dogs brushes, food, shampoos, food bowl and everything I’ve bought for my dog. It kind of pisses me off because they never helped me buy any of these products and didn’t even bother to ask. My dogs products are pretty pricey because she’s a husky and requires a ton of upkeep for her coat. My parents say they’ll pay a really small portion of the food because their dog is small, not even acknowledging all the other things I’ve purchased.

My parents also expect me to take their dog out all the time. When I take out my dog, I’ll take their dog too. My parents WILL NOT take my dog out when I’m working or not home but expect me to always take their dog out. It really makes no sense. I take care of their dog but they can never help with mine 

Thank you for anyone who read this, there’s so much more and I know these are all small things I just get so frustrated because it all adds up to a breaking point.  

TLDR; increasingly frustrating with my mother",06Sep2019,1

684,"My current bf and I have been together for about half a year now. I'm 18 F and he's a little bit older than I am. My parents do not know we are together. I have been stressed out over this relationship for many reasons (telling my parents being #1) we went through a bit of a rough patch because of the stress and everything and I had planned to call it off with him temporarily (or permanently depending on how things would go after we broke up). I needed a break from the stress until I was ready to tell my parents. 

I'm young, I'm pretty much just starting out life and this is the time where everyone dates and has fun, goes to school, get a foundation built for themselves and just enjoy their youth a bit.

I have a coworker who I get along great with. We work really well together, we have great conversations, and we cut up with each other and before I began dating my current bf, we definitely had an interest in each other. The reason that fell through was because we started to get different hours and didn't see each other as much.

If I were in a relationship with my coworker instead, it would be so much easier and less stressful in many ways. Sure we would have problems just like any relationship, I know that. We are closer in age which means, no stress about telling my parents and we are on similar paths. My current boyfriend is at the point where he's seriously thinking about getting settling down, moving in together, getting married, having kids. I thought I was ready for some of those things, but I'm just not, neither is my family. I've told him that and he says he understands. 

Anyway, I had planned on taking a break and just seeing where things go, maybe get back together and maybe take a breather and when I'm ready, go on a date with someone new (maybe my coworker). A week or two after I had been planning to take a break, I miss my period. Took a pregnancy test, I'm pregnant.

He wants to keep it and I really don't want an abortion, but I don't want to throw away the life I had planned for myself. I feel so selfish. If I go through with my pregnancy I'm going to disappoint so many people that I care about and that care about me. I don't know if I want to bring a baby into this world at 18, with someone I may end up wanting to spend the rest of my life with, unwed, and not financially ready. I'm devastated.

I dont know what to do about my situation. Is it a bad idea to stay with my bf, is it a bad idea to keep the baby, should I live my life like I planned at 18 or should I throw it away along with school and become a mom? I'm not ready for this, I'm not happy, my parents don't know I'm dating him, let alone that I'm pregnant.",06Sep2019,1
685,"So, long story short, I applied for a job that I figured would be fine for now, pay was good and great hours 8-5 1hr lunch and only a few people work there, so I’ve been out of work for about a year cause I quit my last job that I loved due to the boss being an absolute dick, anyways, found this new job and went in for an interview not expecting to be hired on the spot, I said yes and we settled on a start date, well I was nervous and my daughter was suppose to be looked after by her grandmother until preschool starts, so I turned the start date down and gave a new one to the boss which he was fine with, well the second date came and went too, I gave excuses and we parted ways, then he emailed me wanting to come by and start and I said sure and that cane and went.. basically there was about 4-5 start dates confirmed and I never showed up (emailing the boss and saying I couldn’t make it due to this or that) finally I told him I’m having a hard time getting back into work cause of social anxiety and it’s killing me, I want to start work again and make money but I’m so awkward and embarrassed now about the 4-5 times I’ve missed that I’m surprised I even got that many chances and now o feel embarrassed and awkward if I did go in... my anxiety has been eating at me, I’d get up for work and get ready and be in a bad mood and just talk myself out of it then later on I’d kick myself for not going... would I be a dumbass for asking for the job again? And going in? Would other people think I was some crazy idiot? For not showing up at the start... idk 😔",06Sep2019,1
686,"So I wanted to attend the university of Washington since I was a kid. After high school, I got rejected so I went to community college for 3 years and got rejected multiple times again. I literally drove all the way to the UW campus just to study in the library and walk around feeling how nice it is at the campus. All of my friends went there too.

Well last year during spring I decided to go to the university of Washington Tacoma campus. And it sucks. The campus is awful. It feels just like community college. The campus is extremely ugly, there’s very little people and I just hate it. I feel like a total failure.Nobody wants to be here because all it is is a low level degree factory that accepts anyone. There is no Greek life, no fun. People just come in their classes and leave.

I know lots of people who want to transfer to Seattle but it’s almost impossible because UW Seattle hates accepting people from their branch campuses. (Many people from UW Tacoma and bothell want to transfer to Seattle but not much the other way around) 

Now my brother is going to UW Seattle and he talks about how depressing the UW Tacoma campus was when he visited and how glad he is he doesn’t go there. Everyone in the family congratulated him, shook his hand and everything but nobody cared when I got accepted to UW Tacoma because lmao why should they? I still remember when my friends who go to UW Seattle asked if I go to UW after seeing me at the Seattle campus. I said I go to Tacoma. One of them laughed, the others looked in pity wondering why I’m here and just said “oh” and then walked away.

Every single day I see the UW TACOMA I’m disgusted with myself. I wish I could go back in time. I wanted to see the cherry blossoms of the Seattle campus. I wanted to walk around and see the hundreds of people enjoying life on campus. I wanted to see the tourists who were in awe of a place that people could actually be proud of attending. (I get so embarrassed when I see kids being toured for UW Tacoma because I know the only thing that’s on their mind how how crappy the campus is). I wanted to walk around the quad. I wanted to see what it’s like to want something since you’re a kid, work hard for the goal and achieve it. But of course the world doesn’t want me to be happy. 

I applied to UW Seattle for the third time but it’s impossible for me to get in. I can’t stand being here. Sometimes I still go to the Seattle campus just to see what it’s like and boy is it amazing. Idk how to end these thoughts. Every single day and at least once every hour I wonder how happy I would be if I went to the Seattle campus instead. How do I stop? Why can’t I just grow the F up and get over it like a normal person?",06Sep2019,1
688,"Ok so there is this Guy who is always staring at me when I go to the place that he works at. I am just a regular customer there and i dont know this dude at all. Here is the thing though, over time the more I observed him the more I felt like I should probably go over and just talk to him. He isnt some dangerous creep. I know he isnt. He is the total opposite of that. Ive seen the way he interacts with customers and his coworkers. He is a nice guy, a sweet guy.

 He probably just sees something in me for whatever reason and just wants to have a conversation with me and share his life problems etc and the truth is that I am more than willing to break the barrier between stranger and friend and just become his friend already. But I am not doing well in my life right now and honestly I hvent been doing well for four years. I dont feel confident to become someones friend. Im unemployed and live all alone with my parents. Ive had no friends for four years because I wanted to be alone and I was going through intense social anxiety and depression. 

So what do I do? Do I go up and talk to him and listen to his life story and just be his friend, or do I walk away forever and have him forever remember me as just some random customer he should'nt have pinned his hopes on to somehow take an interest in him and genuinely care for him?

Anyway, what I wanted to know is, am I being offensive by saying I don’t want to date a trans person? I’m friends with a few trans women and most of them have agreed I’m not transphobic but one of my Cis friends says it’s a form of discrimination. The reason I don’t want to date a trans person isn’t because they’re trans, at all, but because a trans woman’s vagina isn’t like an actual woman’s, and if she hasn’t yet had bottom surgery she’d still have a penis, and like many other lesbians I don’t like penis lol

693,"My uncle started a low-income housing nonprofit in California in the 90s. He was getting grants from the city to purchase buildings. He asked if I would be a board member. It seemed like it was in a voluntary capacity &amp; I didn’t have anything to do with the business., so I agreed. The family joke was that I was a “board member”, when, in reality, I was a stay-at-home mom. 

In the early 2000s he suffered medical issues that precluded him from running it anymore. His kid &amp; wife stepped in and have completely run it into the ground. They have used the money for vacations &amp; other personal stuff. 

I know nothing about how nonprofits worked and I assumed they knew what they were doing. Even if it was shady, I was sure they wouldn’t be do anything illegal! 

At this point, I guess I’m still a board member (I thought it was, at best, a token title) &amp; they have promoted me to chairman or something like that without my knowledge. I even found out that they’ve been forging my name on important document. Like tax docs! 

I was ENRAGED when I found out &amp; consulted with a lawyer in my family. They told me to give a written demand, that included that I knew they were using my name illegally, forging my signature, as well as to cease using my name immediately  &amp; to take me off their board.

I would say I am pretty good at it and I am for sure happy with myself. example: I am currently in highschool I have come up with a business which generates about 800 euros monthly with not even putting much effort.

However, recently I have come across a bit of internal conflict. I seem to always take something which I enjoy doing and try to turn (or at least think of ways) it into something where I can make money from. An example of this would be photography. I enjoy taking pictures of skateboarding and I have created an Instagram to just share the pictures I took. I made it for fun and for the sole purpose of sharing something I like doing as a past time. Today, I couldn't stop thinking about how I could turn this Instagram into something which I could profit from. I was thinking like if I grow this page enough I can start creating a brand around my page, then start selling clothing, open up a blog, etc, etc. 

I seem to think of these things spontaneously and can't keep my mind from it. I know this is how I think but sometimes I feel like I just want to do something for the sole pleasure and not for monetary value. Is this really a problem for someone like me? How can I work on this? Any tips?

PS. I am very happy with who I am and I find business and entrepreneurship very fascination, however, this is just something I have struggled with for the past week. 

Any advice, would mean a lot?",06Sep2019,1

699,"Let me start off by saying I do believe in finding a sense of fulfillment and happiness in the now, and not attributing that entirely to external goals and the enigmatic future. But I do also think it's human nature - and a necessity - to set goals and actively work towards them. In fact I think the two things - goal setting and present fulfillment go hand in hand.

But the past few years have felt like I've been in prison, and effectively robbed of a functioning life. Now I'm desperate to fight for a good life again. I'll try and break things down as succinctly as possible:

**Prior to 2013**

Lived a fairy normal life - had the privilege of being able to travel around the world, played sports to a high level (the tier just below professional) and successful trained with a post-grad qualification and worked in a professional role.

**2013 (Age -early twenties)**

After the medical community missed a serious illness that came out of nowhere, I was put on a strong medication to deal with the PTSD that arose from a year of having reduced breathing capacity (and not being believed).

**2016**

My lungs healed but I had started developing other symptoms such as heart palpitations. Without knowing the risks I became effectively disabled overnight due to coming off said medication cold-turkey. I lost my job, home, social life, all my finances and my ability to function almost overnight. Since 2016 I've effectively lived in a room in isolation (bar the odd short walk/afternoon out/visit from someone) and not been able to do much due to the physical symptoms and severe brain fog/fatigue.

**NOW**

I've found out recently I should make a full recovery at some point (what effectively happened was a poisoning of the brain and nervous system, and apparently the brain does eventually re-balance itself), but I don't know when this will be. In some cases apparently the damage is permanent, and whilst I'm trying not to allow myself to think about this I feel I have to be responsible in considering all possibilities.

**THE DILEMMA**

I've been staying with a family member recently after having some bad luck with stressful housemates. But there's been a lot of drama in my family and I feel for self preservation I need to leave fairly soon (3-6 months). But, my family is fragmented; I have no home base, no place to really ""go back to"" and I feel very vulnerable. Before this situation I lived abroad and have always been very adventurous and independent. But now, aged 32, I find myself feeling the most scared and isolated I've ever been - right at the time I need to be the strongest.

I basically need to find somewhere to live that will allow me to recover and get my life back on track.

**THE OPTIONS**

I have a very small amount of money I've saved up over the past year, and I just don't know where to move to on a tight budget. The options are:

**a)** live on my own, where I have complete freedom and no risk of stress from other people, but be in almost complete isolation again if I still can't go out much due to symptoms.

**b)** share with a complete stranger, but have less space to work on my project work (I currently make some money as an illustrator/artist) and risk there being drama with said unknown person (especially when it's hard for someone to understand why I can't do much)

**c)** possibly live with my brother or a friend - not definite options yet but possibilities. Could be great as they're both very understanding of my situation but I'm worried living with either of them might strain the relationship - two relationships that are very important to me right now.

**d)** The two places I'm considering living in are a liberal, bustling city near the sea (but it's expensive, and how much am I going to enjoy of that if I'm still kinda ill over the next year) / or/ a quieter area surrounded by nature which is cheaper (but is less ideal for career opportunities in the future and I don't want to continuously be moving.

**THE GOALS:**

**THE 5 YEAR GOALS:**

* **To be functioning at my potential mentally and physically**
* **To have at least X money, my own home and established my couldn’t-be-better career and a fully autonomous life.**
* **To be a successful musician/songwriter (by success I mean being part of a great band with an organic fan base and able to do some great gigs and low-key but exciting tours and festivals). This is not necessarily a career but a kind of calling I've always felt I guess.**
* **To be settled in a town/city, be a part of the community with a great network and work/life balance. To feel like I belong.**

**THE ONE YEAR GOALS:**

* **Make a full recovery**: Time is the only healer but I'm a big believer that if you're living a healthy and happy life this will encourage healing. Apparently 3 years is a pretty average time for people to heal from what I'm going through - and I'll be at 3 years in October.
* **Make a decent amount of money to not feel financially vulnerable anymore:** I do have options with this with the remote work I do, but a comfortable home life and space to work in is essential.
* **Decide on a long term career/life plan that accounts for all scenarios (making a full recovery / still feeling the effects**
* **Launch the music portfolio I'm proud of (songwriting on the mac / producing/launching on social media-basically start putting myself out there as a songwriter).**

**ADVICE I'M SEEKING:**

&amp;#x200B;

1. How would you approach the dilemma of where to live, with so many unknown factors involved, and taking into account the healing (being as healthy and happy as possible) and making money as the main priorities?
2. Any ideas on how to avoid the awful feeling of isolation when I can't go out and do much? Living with others seems like a good solution but if that becomes stressful it becomes counter-intuitive (which has literally been the case for the past 3 years).
3. How would you spend your time over the next year if you had around 3-4 hours of productivity-ability in a day and you're trying to create a better future for yourself? (I do believe I could improve my health and be more productive but honestly the stress recently has made it very difficult and I'm not sure HOW to make that improvement).

708,"Okay, so throwaway account for obvious reasons on my part. I'm on mobile so I'm sorry for bad formatting or any and all misspelling(s). 

I was diagnosed as having Autism just this year and that really helped me understand myself a lot. I now understand why I obsess over certain things, can't have certain foods with certain textures touch each other, why screaming/loud noises affects me worse then other etc etc. All that stuff. I'm still having some problems though.

It started before my diagnosis simply because I couldn't understand myself. I felt like I was stupid and a weirdo. I couldn't make and keep friends. I started isolating myself more then I did before, I started feeling lonely. I started to lose motivation to do things. 

I lost lots of friends by doing this and it hurt. I was only about eleven at the time when I started really going down hill. I would pinch myself, I would bite myself and at one stage, I hate to admit, that I started cutting my inner thighs. I'm embarrassed by this. I hate the fact I got so weak as to do that to myself. Long story short my parents found out. I know they were trying to help when they told me I was bringing the chances of me becoming a model down, but it didn't have the effect they were hoping. I know what they were going for but telling me 'You're ruining your chances of becoming a model!' Really effected me. I felt like my worth was determined by my looks.

Thats when I started looking in the mirror. I noticed every flaw. My nose was an odd shape. I had too many freckles. My crooked teeth. My curly hair always looked messy. My head shape is weird.

Then I started looking at the scale. My weight became my top priority. I started to obsess over it and would cry and have panic attacks when it went up. I started starving myself then but my parents stopped that quickly. They didn't think I was starving myself intentionally, but as a parent they obviously wanted me to eat. I started looking for more ways to quickly lose weight. I started making myself sick after meals. It worked but it caught up with me. I stopped having a period for ages and it affected me physically, as in you could see it, as well.

I did that for a year before my parents found out. They yelled and threatened to send me to a orphanage again. I cried.

I stopped the cutting and my problems with food but I'm still affected by it. I'm still scared of weight gain, I still think I'm ugly, I still think I'm fat and more. On top of other things I really believe my mental health is in a worrisome state. I'm not okay and I know it. I just don't know what to do.

I felt no such excitement, I was pretty socially isolated, and felt really anxious about driving so I pushed it off thinking that there would be no point since I don't go anywhere.

713,"TD;LR  I have called the CPS, and i am in a situation where i am unsure of what i did was the right thing after all.

I am a 15 (soon to be 16) year old girl. I live in Norway so the rules are kinda different. Me and my mother had a very unstable relationship, sometimes we are happy with each other and sometimes we get mad at each other. It goes like a pattern, an argue can start, and then it can get worse and so on, then we are like on the top of the argue, we will probably yell at each other, at worse times mother will start get violent, where i will ,at all cost, try to avoid to get hit. 
and that has gone for years, and i have seen a pattern in my mothers behavior, There is a invisible line i have noticed, and try to avoid to get across. 
That had gone for a long time and i just wanted it to end, so i decided to stand up and do something back, where the violence has increased. I was very sacred of my life, she was very threatening. She would guilt trip me and tell all the bad things she have done for me, i find it understandably where she wants to be respected, but its kinda hard when she starts shouting at me when she get irritated. 
Then there was yesterday, where i was so threatened i called the cps cause she picked up a chair and went towards me. We live in a small house so i had to get out before she put it down.
when i did she would try to talk over me when i tried to tell them, she was very tense and it was understandably you would try to do stuff to avoid consequences, though later she calmed down where i can finally tell the information they needed, they said to wait for a different call, and during that period she would say that everything is over, she have to go back to her home country, we would get separated and it was all my fault. It was very upsetting to hear, both of us was stressed, living in such a tiny home where no one gets space. 
When the phone called i answered, they said to meet me somewhere that was luckily close to go. It was a lot of talking about the situation and a lot of waiting, it was hard cause i am the only wittiness. They talked to me first before my mother. She denied everything i said, but they had to belive me cause it was apparently a part of the rules. 
We agreed (me and my mother) for me to move to a temporally home with a family that had teens like me before. A day has passed.My mother have apparently told about what happened to her sister where my cousin ended up calling me. She was not mad and she said whatever i do, i should try to avoid at all cost to go into a foster home. and that was today. which leaved me here, dont know what to happen other than that i'm gonna have a conversation with my mother again in 4 days and talk with the company about my future in 5 days.

715,"So for context I work as a mechanic and that means you have to buy all of your own tools to do the job.

About a year ago I bought 3 sets of stepped drill bits (on sale from 30$ a set down to 10$ a set) for 30$ total. I ended up never using them for the purpose I envisioned as I found a different method that I preferred instead. They sat in my toolbox collecting dust until a work mate decided to use them. I don't mind if people use my tools so long as your respect them and pay for non warranty tools that may break due to use. 

So workmate uses them and Burnes all the bits. I'm cool with that just give me the money that I put into them. So he gave me 30$ to replace the set(s). I figured that since I don't use that tool and only he does I'd rather spend the 30$ on a tool that I do need. Plus I would need to go to Canadian Tire to buy it.

Yesterday he goes to my box looking for the replaced set and it's not there and I told him I used the money on other tools. He loses his shit... Accuses me of theft and raises his voice and starts to make verbal threats to my health (assault me) and threats to my property (tools). I remain calm and disengage from conversing with him further as it would be futile to do so.

The way I see it is say you get in a fender bender and instead of going through insurance you decide to pay out of pocket to the other party to cover the damage. The other party is not bound by anything to go and get the repairs done and can leave the damage there and use the money on other things. It's their money do as you wish, that's not theft you were compensated for damage delt to your property. 

This guy is saying that since I didn't replace the tool I stole the money. He is suggesting that I take the money and spend MY time and MY gas money to purchase a tool that will effectively only be used by him. I call bs, you pay me for my monetary loss and you spend your time and money to procure a tool that you need. 

It should be noted this guy is related to the owner and has very few tools that he personally owns, he mostly borrows other people's tools and shop owner tools.

Did I steal or did he get blinded by rage and act completely inappropriately? Please help as I really do feel that I am not in the wrong and this event is distracting me from being focused on other tasks.

725,"I am a 23 year old college student and I feel like I'm failing in all aspects of my life and I am trying to pick myself up and be resilient but tbh, it's been incredibly difficult. 

First off, here's a little bit about my personal life. I work at a family restaurant and it's just me and my sister who works along with my Mom and Dad. So my sister and I put a tremendous amount of our mental/emotional/physical energy into this place. From that, the obvious solution would be for us to hire someone so that my sister and I wouldn't have to carry the burden BUT we have tried that. Not once. Not twice but NUMEROUS times. We can't hold an employee bc my parents are push over managers and my dad is incredibly mean. My parents fight a lot at the restaurant and it's very stressful for me to hear them fight while I'm out front trying to carry a happy facade for the customers. On top of that, my parents say very unpleasant things to my sister and I while we are there working (and doing homework) and we are convinced that we basically suck. My self-esteem has been horrible my whole life because I am convinced that I am not smart and that I don't do well enough. So why am I there? Because I care about my parents and they are immigrants and the only reason I've had such a privileged life is because of this restaurant and because they came here in the first place and worked hard to get to where we are now.  I'm torn because they work hard. In fact, so hard that they both are starting to get health issues but at the same time, I feel extremely emotionally distant from them. I often feel that I just work there and nothing more. 

Now, I also go to school and I have been in college for 6 years now pursing a math degree with a concentration in computer science and who the fuck knows when I'll graduate. I love the field that I'm pursuing but...bc of the personal stresses that I endure at home, I can't focus and I don't have the self-confidence to pull through. In addition to that, I have faced sexist remarks from my peers and that is another discouraging component that I have had to deal with. I've been in school for a long time and I'm getting burnt out. I've repeatedly been failing my classes and I feel so so hopeless and embarrassed. I feel like a failure. When I email my professors and ask what I can do better to improve or how I should better approach the class, they don't respond. I suppose that's fair but I don't know what to do. A part of me feels like I'm capable, but the noise in my head that I've heard my whole life tells me that I'm not smart or good enough to be doing this. 

So that brings me to this. I guess I'm posting this because I'd like some advice on how I can overcome this difficulty and I'd appreciate some encouragement. I'm tired of feeling this heavy weight on my chest and I'm literally tired from losing sleep because I stress so much about my future and the nature of my living situation. I don't mean to be whiny or anything. I just feel very very lost and sad and I feel that I lack a lot of self-fulfillment. Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ttthe company name I said then  ‘ohhhh/mmmm...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look at my hair funny in a wtf face if I had it styled or just untouched is that a bad sign?



Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",06Sep2019,0

But here's the problem, back when I was in High School I tried asking her out after she told me that she also had a huge crush on me.

733,"Over the past few years I've found myself lying about the smallest things, such as what music I listen to, etc. I hate myself for this and I want it to stop, because I'm afraid I'll lose the trust of the only friends who care about me.

I don't know for certain why I'm doing this - partly because I'm so insecure about myself that I feel pressured into conforming with standards, but also because I'm afraid of being judged and blamed for something.

I manage to stop myself from lying about larger things, but I lie about these small, insignificant things almost without thinking, and I yearn for this to stop.

How do I stop myself from lying all the time?",06Sep2019,3
734,"So idk where to start with this because I’m hopelessly confused. About a year and 4 months ago I met this girl over a summer program. During the program we got along very well. Nothing too crazy, we were just good friends. Afterwards we did not really plan on talking much and left it at goodbye because we live about 700 miles apart. But then out of the blue one day she called and after that we hit it off. From September to June we talked on FaceTime every night for hours and hours even though we both had school in the mornings. 

Very quickly she became my best friend and my rock. Around a certain time, maybe around February of 2019 she knew literally everything about me and I knew everything about her. Yet, despite knowing all each other’s worst secrets and most desperate sides of ourselves we grew even closer. Around the same time we each developed feelings for each other, but neither of us could admit it out of fear of the distance between us. 

Come July, we started the second half of our summer program from the previous year. I wanted to keep things strictly as friends. But, we both discovered that something was undoubtedly there and neither of us could hide it. So, the second to last night we kissed and immediately we both felt that there was something undeniably powerful between us. The next night, our last night together, we decided to up things a bit and get a little more physical and that was the best night of my life. I’ve never felt so natural, alive, calm, accepted, and in the moment. 

Now I’m at university over 3,000 miles away and because of the time difference we can’t talk as much and things are going to be different. I’m going to visit her every now and then, but I’m scared. I want to enjoy my college experience, but I spend every free moment of time thinking about her because I love her and I know that for a fact. 

Before I had romantic feelings for her she was my best friend and she still is my best friend and I got to know her better than anyone in my entire life. The hardest part is that she feels the exact same way. I don’t know what to do. I can’t move on to another girl because I love her so much and one day I want to be with her for the rest of my life and I want to stay true to her. We’ve had fights and ugly moments, but even after those moments I still love her all the same. I trust her, I know she wouldn’t do anything to hurt me. I’ve spent more hours talking with her than I spent in school all of senior year, I know she wouldn’t do anything like that. But, I’m terrified I’ll never be able to get to her again. I just want to experience life with her and make her happy because she is my world and has been for so long. Please, somebody help me. I don’t know what to do and this is killing me.",06Sep2019,0

Hi, so little bit of info on 2 jobs currently possible for me. Both full time 40 hour weeks.

Company A

13.50/hr+Benefits(Health and Dental)

Stockroom setting

It's a bit closer and commute

OR

Company B

$15/hr + Benefits (Health and Dental)

Office Setting

A bit Farther commute.

I'm  just not sure if taking the $15/hour job is worth the extra 20min  travel time going then another 20 going back. Gas is pricey after all.  Company A is $1.5 less /hour but taking public transport is cheaper 30  days unlimited for $100

Advice? Please and Thank you.",06Sep2019,1
742,"She ghosted me everytime I replied her this month. I have no feelings for her and she has no feelings for me. The point is I don't want to go but I don't want to hurt her at the same time. She's been a nice friend to me but after both of us left college we don't keep in touch anymore and I get these occasional messages.

Like out of the blue asking me how my brother got to be a pilot and I explain the bit and end of convo. Or a simple 'r u home?' 'yeah, why?' end of convo.

Last time I saw her was when we met up with a teacher with our other friends and she was just being really stuck up. When I got home she texted me asking what I work as part time now that I'm free. and I explain what I do and she doesn't reply back.

I don't know what her deal is.

Now my birthday was yesterday and she knew because she mentioned it at the teacher meet up and she didn't wish me a happy birthday or anything and now she sends this.

747,"Sorry this might be a bit long.
There’s this girl that I’ve been close friends with for about 6 months. In about the last month or so, we’ve been getting closer and closer. A few days ago, we ended up holding hands so I decided to ask her on an actual date. The date was fun, I think we both had a good time, and at the end of the night, I kissed her before she left. Now, there’s a lot that I really like about this girl, but there’s a few things that are kind of holding me back and I would like some advice. The biggest thing is probably just the fear of hurting her and losing our friendship, but that’s also something a lot of people worry about when starting a relationship. However, there’s other things that I feel hesitant about. One of them is simply the fact that my older brother and her older sister are actually dating and it’s honestly a little weird for me. Another, I’m going to be moving out of home in probably about 4-5 months from now and the place that I will be moving into happens to be her family’s home. I really like her whole family and I’m close friends with her brother as well. I would be moving into a studio kind of thing that is connected to the house that I would share with her brother. Where the hesitation comes in is that I do value my friendship with her brother and the rest of her family. If this girl and I were to continue dating and then things go south, that could potentially make my living situation a bit awkward. My living situation was not at all motivated by her as this was established before this was really a thing. (Not sure if it matters or not but I’m 19 and she is 18 btw) I’ve been kinda stressing myself out on the whole situation and I’m hoping to get some outside opinions on what I should do. I do like this girl but I also have hesitation. Should I try and not focus on that and see where things go? Or should I cut things off now to prevent potential damage and awkwardness? Thank you so much for any advice you guys could give.",06Sep2019,1

749,"I'm a 15 year old guy from Belgium. My uncle was euthanized this morning, after being in the hospital for about three weeks. Sure, I'm sad, but I'm not as sad as most of my family (mom, cousins...) because I was never really close to my uncle. During his last week, I went to visit him in the hospital twice, but my mom went there every day. Today was my first school day, and after coming home, I had to rush to my uncle's house because they were bringing his casket there so that everyone could say goodbye. The thing is that no one my age is there, and there's no one I can talk to. I had to stay there from 4 pm to 10 pm without doing anything. Tomorrow and Sunday, I'll have to go to my uncle's house from 5 pm to 9 pm to be there when people visit his casket. (I really don't understand why I have to be there). I might have to miss school on Monday to do the same thing. On Tuesday, I'll have to miss school to attend his funeral, which makes sense.

750,"The man who was the closest thing to my grandfather passed away in February. Before he passed I tried getting him to let me buy his car from him. It’s a 2003 Lincoln Town car and it only had 70k miles in it. He didn’t want to, but for the last 2 years he had not  driven it. 

When he passed in February his wife gave me the car. We flew down and drove the car home from FL to DE. 

Fast forward to now and I want to leave my current employer and I want to start a business. I really could use that money. I also have 3 other cars, one I still owe on, one I need for my business and the last not worth a lot ($1500?). I want to sell the car because I don’t need it but I also have this big fear I will regret it. Years ago I traded in a Honda I had and regretted everything about it.

751,"I’ve been thinking about moving to a different US city recently, but it’s overwhelming to narrow down places without being able to visit them all first. I’m 25 and have lived in Philadelphia my whole life so I’ve been traveling a lot to get a feel for other cities I vibe with. But without any ties to a particular city,  and with no commitments, I feel like theres so much to consider and I haven’t been able to narrow down my list. So I’m curious, how did you decide where to move? Putting careers aside (since I’m considering switching careers), how do you find a new home? If you’re not relocating for work or moving to be with a spouse, etc. how do you decide where to start a new life?

I think part of my problem is that The criteria I’m working with is so broad. For instance, I like all four seasons but would be willing to give one up if I move to a place that’s warm or cold all year round. I love living in the city but I could also see myself living in the suburbs that’s close to a city. I am not biased towards a large or small city either. I work in marketing which has a pretty strong job market across the country. I’m an outdoorsy person but I’ve never visited a place that I haven’t been able to find an activity I enjoy.  You may be able to tell that my indecisiveness is a huge factor in why I haven’t chosen a place.

755,"I am diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder bipolar type and have been struggling greatly recently. I continually fuck up and make my parents not trust me, this has been going on for years now, to the point where I cannot even go to class without sending my mother a picture of me in class to prove that I am in fact there. 

However, their distrust in me is not undeserved. When I was a teenager in high school I would constantly lie about where I what I was doing so I could go hang out with friends or sleepover someone’s house. When I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder I had trouble taking my meds consistently in order to keep the delusions/hallucinations/bipolar symptoms away. This further pushed my parents trust in me to little or none. Over the years I have been battling my illness and have had multiple hospital visits for suicidal thoughts or psychotic breaks from stress.

My parents also have been very “helicopter-y” (I can’t think of the word for it) ever since I was a child and now that they don’t trust me at all (which is my fault granted) I am continually stressed out over whether I am going to fuck something up and get my parents more upset with me. 

My mother says she hovers over my every move because she cares about me and doesn’t want to see me off my meds. I’ve tried to explain to her that my illness makes me sometimes not believe what I am doing is even real or not. I think this has further strained her trust in me. 

There have been a few times where I have been confused about where I was/went because I had not taken my meds; this is what has caused me to send pictures of everything I do to my parents in order to prove I’m where I’m supposed to be without them actually there with me.

I am in college currently but I do not want to go to school and have not wanted to go to school for years now. I have had suicidal thoughts caused my the stress my parents put on me to finish school (in a major I no longer want to pursue) and the actual stress of a demanding major with all of the schoolwork.

I have wanted to move out for a while now however my mother tells me if I move out I will have to solely pay for all of my living expenses including health insurance (which I need a lot of because of my illness), car insurance, rent, phone, etc. I simply cannot afford to live on my own without a well paying job that will provide high quality health insurance that I require. 

I feel like I am trapped in my parents house. I have very bad money management skills because my mother and father control all of my money (any money I make from working part time jobs I have to withdraw from my bank account and give cash to my parents to pay my bills with) so I am also worried that if I go on my own I will crumble from the pressure of holding a full time job/bills combined with no money management skills. 

I have thought about asking some of my extended family if I could live with them such as my cousin and his boyfriend who I am fairly close to but fear that my parents will literally disown me and drop me from all of their insurances/cut me out of their life completely. I don’t want to sever ties to my parents out of fear that it will cripple the great relationship I have with the rest of my extended family. 

I am constantly thinking about how to get out of this situation that I have pretty much brought onto myself from years of lying to my parents since I was a teenager. My mother recently got upset with me today because I did not bring home a receipt that I went to my med management person (even though I did go and got refills on my meds) and told me if I don’t start listening to her and following her direction better then she will no longer help me with anything, in her words “I’m done with you”.

So, I am now writing this post in hopes someone in this subreddit can offer advice on what I should do. I desperately need help out of this situation or I may end up back in the hospital or even worse, dead.

TLDR; I’ve lied to my parents since I was a teenager resulting in needing to take photos of where I am at all times. I have schizoaffective disorder bipolar type. I am stuck in a situation where my parents say they care about me and my mental health yet berate me and watch over everything I do making me feel like I have no freedom.",06Sep2019,0

761,"He says he wants to change one moment then states he believes it is fine for him to shove me, body check me, scream at me, and grab things out of my hands because he's mad. I know he learned this from his bitch narcissist mother. Anything he does is justified by his feelings. If I try to point out that I get mad too but I don't shove him the point goes completely over his head and he starts telling me how he would retaliate if I actually did shove him back. There is no getting through his thick skull that he is not the victim when he misbehaves. When I punish him he says it is my fault he is being punished. Any self awareness is fleeting. 

It has been a year and a half but this month seems to be much worse. I don't know if it is because school has started or what. He is turning fourteen in a few months and will become stronger than me soon. He already weighs at ten pounds more than I do but I can deal for now because I am strong for my size. Once puberty hits I'm worried I'm gong to have to call the police to take him away. 

I'm afraid of my own feelings. When he body checked and wouldn't get off of me I wanted to punch him in the head so bad it shames me. I knew I was on camera because we were on a bus but that that even entered my mind disgusts me. I never would have thought I was the type of person who would want to punch a special needs kid who is in foster care. 

I think that if he had to leave for a couple days and have a time out from me every time he got physical then he would learn but that just isn't possible. There is a facility that I could theoretically send him too but I have heard terrible things about it and there is a chance I might not get him back. I guess I love him given that I am tearing up just thinking about him in that awful place but I know I don't want to live with him anymore either. We are on an island so there is no where else he can go.

762,"For some background, my mom retired from her job around 4 years ago and I've noticed that she has gotten angry, moody, narcissistic, overdramatic and unwilling to listen to anything I say to her. We rarely have normal conversations and most of the time they consist her asking me to help her do something, her complaining about people she knows or bitching non stop about Taiwanese politics(even though we live in America)

Every once in a while either myself or her will get into an argument over something insignificant she will never try to work things out. Her answers/responses always consist of:

1. ""Everything is always my fault""
2. ""I don't wanna talk about it""(aggressively)
3. ""You make me wanna kill myself"" ""I want to die cuz you're so horrible""
4. ""NOTHINGS WRONG WITH ME! WHY DO YOU THINK SOMETHING IS WRONG??""
5. ""YOU NEVER GIVE ME MONEY EACH MONTH WITHOUT ME ASKING YOU FOR IT. YOU'RE A HORRIBLE SON WHO DOESN'T CARE ABOUT ME AT ALL"" 

(For the record, I'm 28 and working full time and I'm covering all the bills at home and paying for practically everything.  Some how not saying the words ""here's money for you mom"" somehow makes me the worst human being there is. And I never have cash on me except for my cards and she expects me to have cash somehow )

6. ""Nobody is as horrible as you are. I regret having a kid who treats me like garbage""
7. Either stays quiet or hours or starts screaming/crying.


And what literally just happened like an hour before I posted this was absolutely insane. I took the day off since we're having a new fence installed and she's been acting mad for no reason after 2 things were brought up.

1. We discussed the possibility of renting out my sister's room since she moved out. My mom said she's scared we'll get a bad roommate. I told her just as long as we're careful we can avoid a bad one like the previous person who rented a room from us. She started screaming and used response #1 and added ""You're always egging about my mistakes""

2. She burst into my room and started rambling about how I need to look up what type of paint we should get for the fence. After frustratingly telling her that I didn't know and that we need to go look in a hardware store, she got super mad and kept screaming variations of response #3 and #6.

I'm honestly getting frustrated and depressed with her antics. It's impossible to have a normal conversation with her without her thinking that I'm either attacking her or an ignorant piece of shit who doesn't care about anyone but myself. The easy answer would be for me to move out, (which I would love to) but we live in one of the most expensive metro areas of the US and not only would my cost of living go up if I moved, she would be unable to support herself too.

I was planning to go out today for an event but after these antics I feel so drained that I don't even want to do anything at all.

769,"I have recently started college for the sake of pleasing my mother, though it is a heavy financial burden for her to bear. I never intended on studying what I currently am studying, much less attending the university I am currently attending. Nonetheless, it is an extremely prestigious school in my country, has a massive library, seminars and workshops every semester with scholars from all over the world, gives plenty of job/intership/research opportunities besides having its own media outlets and thinktank. Attending this school opens doors to absolutely everything. The problem, however, is that it doesn't offer the course I want to study.


On my research online, I only found one university that offers the course that I want and that makes their mandatory schedule available online. I found one other university in the capital of my country (mind you, very far away) but the page for the department is not even working. Both of those are public institutions and, being in Latin America, suffer from underfunding, poor structure and risk of going on strike due to that at any given moment. I got the chance to visit the campus of the first university mentioned and the structural problem stood out to me as incredibly alarming. I just could not picture myself going there without even the guarantee that there will be toilet paper. It is, however, as I hear, a good school due to the professors mostly. Not nearly as prestigious as the place I am currently attending.



Being a good student in a course I do not even like does drain the life out of me. Most of my classes feel purposeless and I have no interest in them. One of my teachers called me out in the middle of class saying I did not seem interested enough, which quite bothered me considering I read and study for all my subjects, but my lectures are all mostly extremely difficult to endure. I have started researching alternatives in other countries in Latin America, and I am currently looking into Chile and Uruguay but I would probably have to attend a public university. Well, that being said, that means 1. I still risk strikes and might run into problems caused bt underfunding nonetheless, 2. I might not even enjoy the course I actually wanted to study depending on the way those universities operate, and 3. I might miss out on all of the opportunities that my current university offers.

So, Reddit, could you offer me some sane advice? Should I try switch colleges or stay? Should I go abroad, to another state or remain here? Or if I stay in my current university, how do I deal with my painful college life?",06Sep2019,1
770,"Hello Reddit,

In September 4th 2019 I was in a motorcycle accident. I was transported to a hospital instead of Valley Medical. I have no insurance. The surgeon at this hospital have refused to do surgery on my broken collarbone and Scapula. They are arguing that it will heal on its own. The break is clean and very significant. 

They are also trying to discharge me when I clearly am not in shape to do so. My blood pressure is a consistent 150 over 80 and higher and higher. My Heart Beats Per minute at rest are 100 and when I get up to move 10 feet or do some physical therapy my BPM jump to 160+ 

Please help me. Please save my life,  I feel like they are just dumping me because I have no insurance.",06Sep2019,3
771,"Sorry this is so long, TLDR at the bottom.  
  
I'm 14F in the US and I just started high school. I don't really know where to start with this, the title pretty much sums it up. It'll make a lot more sense once I figure out how to explain this, though.  
  
Since I was in the fifth grade (10-11 years old) I've learned so much about the social world around me. Before then, I was naive and oblivious to everything going on around me. It started with a loss of innocence. I made a ""friend"" around that age that completely changed the way I was: from an innocent kid to a dirty-minded teen. I became aware that there's bad, bad things in the world.  
I had another friend around that age that was shaping his personality early on. He expressed his interests freely (he loves anime) and for a while, everyone I was friends with went with it because we didn't know what we liked yet. He also came out as bi around that age and gay a year or so later. That's when everyone started to make fun of him behind his back and became mean to him. I didn't understand at the time as to why, and looking back he was very strong for doing what he did at such a young age. I kept being friends with him, but it didn't last long. I fell into the wrong crowd. A homophobic crowd. A weeb hating crowd. The edgy gamer crowd. And for a while, I didn't talk to him. I befriended other boys, but they didn't make fun of me for being friends with them since I knew them long before then. It became hard to maintain friendships over the years because of my mental issues, and I'd put people off. But these people welcomed me, and I let them take me in. Bad idea. Once I became old enough and started being attracted to people, I immediately decided I was straight. Any other thought would be shot down. To be anything else was a social death sentence. But as years passed, those thoughts became louder and louder until I couldn't ignore them anymore. This is my first time acknowledging it, but here, I'll say it: I'm bi. I haven't told anyone, though I've known it for months now. I'm an avid writer, and once I became developing a sexuality, I began writing love stories. Only two of them are straight out of the many I've written.  
  
My whole world is changing before my eyes. One minute I'm an edgy 7th grader who shits on minorities, the next I'm rethinking my whole life. Deep down, I guess I've always known that I was never meant to be someone like that. I just never had the guts to act on it until now.  
  
I've began watching the anime I've always wanted to but never did in fear of being made fun of. I've began drawing in addition to my stories to bring them to life, something I would've been made fun of for beforehand. People didn't even know I was a writer until now, it was something I did for myself to let out the repressed feelings I had hidden. I've started trying hard in school so I can succeed. But the one thing that keeps coming back is my sexuality.  
  
My family is an accepting one filled with allies. My sister is bi, one of my uncles is married to a man. So that's not an issue. The issue is learning how to accept myself.  
  
I think the idea of coming out is shitty. Why should I have to sit my family down and tell them that I also like girls? But I know I'll have to tell people at some point, or nobody'll want to date me. But I don't even accept myself yet, and the thought of telling anyone gives me extreme anxiety. I don't want to be abandoned by my friends (I have different ones now and have been thinning the bad ones out of my life) and I don't want them thinking less of me.  
  
This isn't even where it ends. I'm scared I won't even be able to pull this transformation off. I mentioned my mental issues earlier. I don't want to go into detail about them, but it makes social interaction extremely difficult. Whenever I talk to someone, I have to think: ""Am I boring them? Am I saying something they wouldn't react well to? What should I say that would make them happy? How should I act?"" All relatively simple concepts, but they're much easier said than done for me. I made a new friend this year and connected with some mutual friends that I hadn't talked to much before and they helped me realize that I don't need to be this way forever, and that good things will only come if I do some MAJOR revising to my personality and character as a whole. I'm taking baby steps right now, but the thoughts of ""Will I fuck this up? Every other new kid I've become friends with always left for better people. Why do I even bother?"" always come back. I'm always worried that my idiot self will say the wrong thing (which happens a lot) and drive my friends away from me. It's happened a lot in the past, and history always repeats itself.  
  
I know this is a really long two-in-one post here, but if you made it this far, I have a question to ask: How do I pull this off? Is there anything I can do to make this easier? Where should I start? Any help will be of use to me, so please go for it and give any advice you have to offer. Thank you in advance.  
  
TL;DR: I'm a closeted bi and get extreme anxiety at the thought of coming out due to being a prior edgelord. Also have a huge fear of saying/doing the wrong things and fucking up my friendships. What can I do, and where can I start?",06Sep2019,0

Later on I get called out to the Library where I find The Assistant Principal, The IT Director, and some other dude standing there.

783,"As the title states I want to move. Specifically, I want to move out of my home state which is roughly located in the Midwest for reference and even more specifically I want to move to Washington or Oregon. The reason? Besides family this state sucks. My politics don't align with it, my lifestyle doesn't align with it, my want for more experiences doesn't align with it. The next closest town that isn't basically a truckstop is an hour and a half! I want a change in scenery!!

My only thing is that I'm a bit afraid. I was born in Portland Oregon, but I moved when I was like 4. I've gone on several vacations to Washington over the course of a decade and each time I go there I fall more in love with. But I also know living somewhere VS visiting somewhere is drastically different. I'm not niave enough to think a change in scenery will fix all my problems too. I have other things to worry about like housing, making rent, finding a decent job, the drastic increase in taxes, how I'll know nobody else besides the people moving with me.

That segways into a bright side though. My partner is just as eager to get out and fell in love with Oregon just as much as I did. To boot we have a friend who's also very interested in moving and rooming with us, which is great because I know the cost of living is much higher. We've all talked it over and looked at a few cities. It's a bit daunting for everyone because we're used to towns that are less than 20 thousand people. My Partner is nervous, I'm excited. We've looked at Hillsboro, Oregon as a potential city to move to as it seems to have decent job growth and a comparatively cheaper living cost then a lot of cities in the state.

I guess my biggest questions are how do I move out of state without screwing myself? How do I tell my family I want to move states away from them? How do I make plans to do this. How can I be sure that everything will be okay? How do I handle it if I fail? I would just really like some solid, down to earth advice on the matter.",06Sep2019,1

785,"I graduated this past May and have been looking for a job ever since. I've gone to numerous places to ask for advice, and have gotten lots of conflicting advice and general rudeness (this is a big reason I'm posting here, rather than some sub specifically for career advice.)

A bit about me - I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from University of Michigan. I finished with a GPA of 3.3, which some people seem to say is good and others seem to say is bad enough to warrant me pulling it from my resume entirely. I never had an internship while at University, which is probably hurting me a lot. All of my professional experience comes from working as a massage therapist, which offers virtually no transferable skills (although most people tell me not to list soft skills on a resume anyway.)

The only projects in my field that I've done not related to coursework have been games, although I'm not looking for game development positions so I think this makes my resume unappealing to most employers. Most of my earlier projects are also in Flash, which means it's impossible for me to assemble an online portfolio if someone were to look at my work.

As far as actual abilities, I consider myself an average programmer. U-M gave me an abysmal quality of education, and between that and my own abilities, I can do okay when coding for an interview, but I won't stand out among other applicants.

Some of the places I've gone for help so far:

* University Career Services: I was able to get someone to help polish up my resume, but the person that helped me had no experience in my field, so while things like formatting and wording might be good, I have no idea how it looks to someone that's hiring in the industry.
* Various online resume drops: People are mostly telling me to push things back and forth, to include or exclude extracurricular activities, to change the order of this or that. I've improved my resume a lot but at this point it seems like I'm splitting hairs.
* Handshake/LinkedIn/Glassdoor: I've applied to most positions through these sites, and I've run into some common problems on here. A lot of employers are asking for expertise in technologies I don't have. Even sorting for entry level positions, most results say they require 3/5/8+ years of experience.

So far the only calls back I've gotten have been for people in IT, offering jobs like help desk, tech support, quality assurance, etc. - nothing that utilizes my skill set or will help my professional development. And of the calls I've gotten, I've yet to actually get an offer after an interview. Most people I talk to have told me that unless my job involves programming, it's not likely to make me an appealing candidate for future positions, so it looks like landing those jobs wouldn't even be that great to begin with.

My sister tells me that my credentials are mostly unimportant, and that I need to network with people and get others to recommend me. The problem is that I have very few connections to people in the field. I was in a game development club, but didn't like the people in it and had very little contact with them. The same is largely true for my classmates. Of those that I am in contact with, none are in my area.

I've had a few people tell me that I just need to self-study, learn new languages and frameworks, and put them up on my GitHub. This seems tenuous at best. Depending on the scope of the project, I might be looking at a gigantic time investment to put on a page that employers might not even be looking at, or whose specifics might only interest a minority of employers.

This is all extremely discouraging as MOST people have been telling me things like there's a good job market right now,, I come from a good school and have a good GPA, I'm in an area where tech jobs are in demand, etc. It feels like everything around me is telling me that there's something wrong or unappealing about me as an employee, and that I'm just not wanted.",06Sep2019,1

793," 

Okay, so, I think my mom might be a little abusive. I really need advice. To give some context, my mom and dad haven't been together since I was a baby, and my dad lives a few hours away now. my mom absolutely hates my dad because when they were together (keep in mind this was a really long time ago), he wasn't the nicest. he wasn't abusive or anything, just a dick at the time. but now I don't really get to see my dad often since he runs his own business. however, whenever I AM with him I feel closer to him, and he also is the only one who buys me EVERYTHING for school. he's the only one who gets me clothes as well. I have two younger sisters and we all have different dads, but they get to go with their dads a few days a week and their dads buy them mostly everything as well. WE ALL LIVE WITH MY GRANDPA AND HAVE LIVED WITH HIM FOR SEVEN YEARS. My grandpa is the only one who has EVER provided for us. He's the reason we have a place to live, food on our plates, holidays, and things like that. yet my mom STILL likes to take the credit for literally everything. She's always sitting on her ass on her phone on facebook and other shit. She goes and feeds an old man like once on some days and gets paid barely anything. She always spends money on things for herself instead of saving up for things. She literally gets her van taken away from her all the time because she doesn't pay the taxes. and then my grandpa has to use his own money to pay for it. By the way, my mom is fucking 35. All she does is scream at us and make us do things for her. If she doesn't feel good then OH she doesn't have to do the dishes. But if I feel sick I still have to clean and do the dishes. She always screams at us and says stuff like ""WHATS FUCKING WRONG WITH YOU!?"" Especially at my little sister whos 8. She always swears at us and says stuff like that. its like she doesn't care that it has an effect on us and will in the future. She doesn't listen to anything that I say or try to explain to her. she just wants everything her way and won't listen to what other people have to say. I really hope I don't end up like her in the future. She doesn't even take me to school. She makes other people do it because she ""Doesn't feel like driving all the way across town"". I do all my own shit like laundry (i don't care about that, just wanted to clarify) and literally does nothing for me like ever. She always says ""ask ur dad for it"". Well, my phone charger broke and I need like 8 dollars to get a new one. I told her and she told me to call my dad. He literally lives 4 hours away, and unlike her, has a job. Being around her makes me feel depressed and anxious and I just want to fucking leave. but she won't even let me move in with my dad. she says he's not ""responsible"" enough. I also don't want to leave my friends since I started school recently (im in high school).

Once in a great while, when she isn't in a shitty mood or something else, shell act like were fucking friends. its either shes abusive or my friend. never my mom. Once while we were in the car I said something about how my panic attacks are, and she goes ""Oh mine is WAY worse than yours"" and I was like ""um. Ok..""

794,"I'm not sure how to eloquently begin this post. Either it will look like an essay or just a messy stream of conscious.

The last time I felt I had a solid group of people I could relate too was probably freshman year of high school. I eventually just cut all ties with them due to the fact that home life wasn't great, and the routine ribbing they gave me every few days or so just pushed me over the edge in sophomore year. I always knew that although I was part of the group, I wasn't any of the group's best friends except one of them (who I didn't cut contact with). This friend though was even more reclusive than I was, so despite my efforts often I would only do social things at lunch time during school. 

From my point of view, nobody in high school gave me the time of day, and I couldn't wait to get out of there and go to college. I'm a week into college, and still haven't developed any real friendships.  My roommate and I are friendly, but we only see each other when we are in the dorm room at the same time, which isn't too often. I feel I have learned a hard truth. The reason I have no close relationships is not because of external factors, it is on me. At least a dozen people have approached me to introduce themselves. Subconsciously I feel like they encroach on my space and interrupt what I was doing, even if it is nothing. Consciously I know this feeling is not true, so I make small talk and politely cut off the conversation before it goes too long. I now have come to the conclusion it is possible I will go through the remainder of my life with no relationships. I have never had a significant other, although I am certainly not afraid of women. I do not believe I have social anxiety, I just tend to treat every acquaintance like a coworker, if that makes sense.

So naturally I think about why I am the way I am. That is all I have been thinking about for the past 2 years. I hated my dad for the longest time. Dad had a ~$120,000 salary and we lived in the midwest, so we were never not without food or physical need. He would go to work at 7am and come home at 4pm. He would exercise and shower till 5pm, and then watch TV for the rest of the night, every night. The only times he seemed to want to talk to me or do anything with me past the age of 10 was to yell at me about things that I did wrong or what he otherwise perceived as wrong. Dad never really had any friends after he got married, as far as I could tell. Dad would yell at my mom all the time as well. I remember when I was 11 (my brothers were 13 and 8) he repeatedly yelled at my mom to stop being a volunteer ski patrol member at the local ski hill, and she would always fight back. He thought that we kids all needed an adult at home all the time. Eventually he got to her, and she quit being a ski patrol member. That was 8 years ago. As far as I could tell, that was the last time she routinely visited with friends as well. I know she really cared about that gig, because she still subscribes to the Ski Patrol magazine and gets email updates from the ski hill patrol. Even though we are all older, I think she thinks she is too old to be a member now, so that will never happen again.

Every trip that we go on my dad was a grouch. He bitched and moaned, and verbally abused my mom who always had done 80% of the packing the night prior while dad was watching TV. When I was 16 we took a family vacation to Lutsen mountains. I wanted to prove to dad that I could drive, so I was eager to drive home afterwards. Dad kept calling out my nonexistent mistakes, stressing me out to the point where i had made a minor but very real mistake (running a stop light), I didn't hit anybody or come close, but he went apeshit. I have only lost my mind 3 times ever, and that was one of them. Dad was an asshole all day. He told me that if I didn't pull over and give him the wheel, he would jump out of the moving car. I did not believe him, until we were on the highway and he undid his seatbelt, opened his door and dangled his foot out. To this day he will not apologize. That is just one example of the many things like that.

Despite all that, I know and knew that dad never really hated any of us. It was an overzealous kind of love. I used to be proud dad called me ""deep water"". To him that meant that i was a quiet, deep thinking person with more than meets the eye. To me now, it just means emotionally stunted and where I used to feel ""seen"" when I heard it now feel shame. Last year dad told me that I didn't have a good natural smile, just like my old man. I believe that I have a good smile, and it didn't shake me up, but if he decided to drop that little bomb on me 3 years prior it would have really affected me. 

I know that I am way more like my dad than anyone else, and i hate it. When I went to college, the only person I knew I was gonna miss was my dog. Everything my older brother does pisses me off irrationally, and I guess I sort of feel a little close to my mom and little brother. I used to feel alienated from my mom's side of the family because I always felt invisible. I know now the reason I didn't interact with them was because I hid myself. My dad went through his parent's divorce when he was in his early teenage years, and from what little he and grandpa talk about it I can tell it really affected him. He never talks to his sisters, and rarely talked to his mom. I can see his life like my future mirror and I don't like it.

The saving grace is that I don't have any substance abuse issues or anything like that. I know I am not strong enough to fix myself. 

Who can I turn too to help?

I am a 16 year old female who is extremely awkward.
I know that I am in those years where everything is embarrassing because I’m a teen but my social skills is on another level of embarrassment.

I have lots of friends but they are friends with me because they think I’m hilarious.. little do they know that I’m just awkward and not sure what to say in the moment.

Most of the times this isn’t a problem but there’s been times when I’ve accidentally gotten myself in trouble because of my lack of social skills.

Some examples of the “bad” situations of this is..

—
- I can sometimes talk too much so it gets annoying.
- I can sometimes don’t talk at all because I don’t know what to say.
- There’s been times where I’ve “scared” away some of my love interests/friends.
- I’ve accidentally gotten myself in trouble because people have misunderstood me.
- I can’t really look people I don’t know in the eyes and talk at the same time because I get so nervous so it ends up me staring into a wall.
- There’s been times where I’ve turned down to go to an event because I know that I’m just going to make a fool out of myself.
- Some people think I’m annoying.
—

I know this seems like an easy fix but it’s really not.
I try to catch myself in the act but whenever I say something awkward I can think it’s normal for the moment and not realize it until later.

I can still think of something embarrassing I did several years ago and just cringe to myself. I can’t handle to watch an old video of me because I just get bad flashbacks.

Not really sure what to do or if there’s anything to do.

801,"Hi there Redditors!

I’m in need of a bit of advice/guidance. So for the past year or so, I’ve been thinking more and more to myself about what I am doing with myself. 

I just feel lost in everything. In every direction possible. It’s sort of like the world is just passing me by and I’m here like a static object on a shelf and just feel down whenever I think about it (idk if I would say depressed but just clocked out of reality).

Now I know this is not ideal and that I should probably do more in my life like go out, meet friends, socialise or pick up a hobby. Sure I try and do that but it doesn’t really do anything. In my mind I’m still wandering.

I’m currently in university and it’s really hard to juggle anything with it because I’m just constantly working and I just feel like it’s a waste. Like what is this ever going to do? Sure it may get me a job but what then? I’ll just be working again, and again until my youth is depleted. Even then in this world, having a degree might not be enough which I’m terrified about. I do try and get other stuff in but I’m just worried it may not be enough.

About meeting new people and stuff: I just cannot bring myself to really trust new people anymore. It’s like everyone is out for themselves and deep down no one really cares about others but of course there are some that do but it’s really hard to know that from first impressions so it’s sort of hit or miss but it’s just scary. I’d rather just prefer to stay away since I’m not really a social person anyway so win win.

This is where it leads to me being lost. My question really is what do I actually do? This period is just like a buffer where I’m just studying, time passes by and then done. I do have an ambition of being a really great person with loads of achievements like Elon Musk. I look up to him and all the stuff he is doing to make the world a better place but at this rate how do ever even get to a position like that. All I want to do is change the world.

I guess my questions all sort of revolve around what the meaning of life is and what to do with it. You know like live life with no regrets or life is what you make it. But how do I make it? How do I learn without making mistakes and regretting them? I’m just in need of a bit of guidance just to make sure I’m going in the right way. Like looking at a compass after a long time of walking.

And I know some people may say it’s better if you talk to a therapist/professional but I don’t really have the financing for that. My parents, it’s quite hard to talk to them about this sort of stuff even friends. I guess why I’m posting here is that anonymity makes me open up more. I don’t know how to explain it, so any, really any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for reading through this (i know it may be quite long so thank you). 

I know this thread has been quite full of dead end questions, but it’s just that whenever I think of something there’s just so many questions and on and on and it’s like a giant oak tree and everything in this thread Is so scattered! So again thank you for putting up with this weird format. :)",06Sep2019,3

But how do I make unique ideas due to lack of experience? I don't even know how to code.

807,"Hi everyone, first time posting in this sub.

I’ll give you the background- one of my very best friends is getting married this December, and I’m a bridesmaid. Bachelorette is in October. So far, I’ll spend about $800 on the weekend rental and flight for the bachelorette alone, not including food, drink, and whatever else we end up doing while we’re there. Wedding will probably be another $600 or so when I factor in flight and dress/hair costs. I don’t even know what the cost will be for planning the shower yet.

We have to plan her bridal shower for a weekend in November, and two of the other bridesmaids REALLY don’t have any money to spend right now, so the majority of the costs are falling on me and the MOH, who is a hair stylist, so it’s not like she’s filthy rich either. So needless to say, November is coming up and I’m pretty stressed out.

I do have a decent job. I have a professional 9-5 job and make about $52k a year. I feel very fortunate to be in the position that I’m in. But I’m not going to lie, these wedding costs are making my budget for the next several months VERY tight, especially considering the other bridesmaids can’t really help out. And I do NOT hold that against them at all- I understand everyone has different situations and we’ve all been there at one point. This isn’t what this post is about. 

The point is, I need to somehow find some more money to help with these costs, or think of some different ideas from another perspective. I’ve considered getting a part time job on weekends only, but I’m not sure how realistic that is these days- or maybe it is, who knows. Any ideas? Advice?",06Sep2019,2
808," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ttthe company name I said then  ‘ohhhh/mmmm...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look at my hair funny in a wtf face if I had it styled or just untouched is that a bad sign?

810,"2 years ago I was in highschool. I have tourettes. Technically, it's actually called motor tic disorder. I make movements, but no vocal noises. 

I'm not technically diagnosed with it, but it's obvious I have it and people in my past have pointed it out. I'll refer to it as tourettes through all this to make it easier. 

I can pretty much control my tourettes with a few issues here and there. I generally let it all out when I'm home in my bedroom. 

This one kid in one of my classes noticed my tourettes. One day it was close to exams and I got a little bit of anxiety. It was just general anxiety you get when exams or something important comes up. 

During this one lesson close to exams my tourettes got bad and he and my teacher noticed. I knew that kid was staring at me, but he  had no idea that I could see him. 

He decided to start recording me and even recoded my face. I just passed it off and didn't think twice about it. 

One year later that memory came back to me after my first year university exams. 

It fucking broke me. It really did. I absolutely lost my mind. I was screaming in my mind. I was so stressed that I felt like I always had a fever, I could only sleep for about an hour a day and I thought about that tourettes event every second of every day. 

I couldn't even watch TV or video games to distract me. I kept on seeing that event on the screen. 

I was completely losing my mind that I was getting panic attacks which made me feeling like I was having a heart attack. I thought I was going to go completely insane. 

I couldn't take it anymore so I went to my doctor. I didn't tell him about the anxiety, but I told him about my insomnia who prescribed me some sleeping pills. 

They worked, but the anxiety was still there and wouldn't go away. 

I eventually went back to the doctor's who I told about my anxiety. He put me on medication and sent me to a psychologist. I didn't tell him why I had anxiety, but he was shocked about what I said. About how I kept on thinking about the event every second of every day. 

I've been through so many medications, but they ultimately leave bad side effects. 

The psychological support didn't help me either.  

The problem is that my anxiety picks up a bad thought and I keep ruminating on it. Additionally, my tourettes are much worse because of it. 

I don't really want to go into it, but I've done a lot of stupid stuff because the anxiety would make me think of something bad happening to me and then I would act upon it which would ultimately be a bad decision. This would fuel the anxiety even more. 

It's nothing illegal, but it's damaged relationships and I get anxious thinking it can ruin my professional life when I enter the workforce. 

For example, my sister constantly goes on Instagram and YouTube on her phone looking at memes and videos. She's always sitting there in the living room and laughing. 

One day, my anxiety was so bad as I was constantly thinking of that tourettes episode when I was recorded. I thought my sister saw the video of me as she was laughing. I was losing it and started to think she saw the video of me. I started shouting at her asking her what she's laughing at. I almost said to her ""Have you seen a video of me?"". 

It's not just thoughts about the video. The anxiety disorder started triggering other issues in me such as thinking that people are always looking at me, laughing at me and so on. 

There are other situation that I desperately want to tell you all about, but I just can't. I don't have the courage to do so. They're stupid things that I've done that have ruined relationships with friends. I've spoken about them on Reddit before and people called me a creep, weirdo and so on, but I never mentioned the anxiety, tourettes or being recorded. That was simply to get a gauge on what people thought about what I did as they assumed I was normal and mentally okay. 

They're not all about the video, but the anxiety had caused me to become anxious and suspicious of other people. It's caused me to become obsessed with people and their actions. 

I was never like this. Nothing that anybody did bothered me, but now it feels like I need to keep a careful eye on everyone like they're all out to get me. 

I've recently been back on Facebook because I was so lonely this year. I had nobody to talk to. It was like I was under sensory deprivation. I go so desperate that made a Facebook account and added my old friends. 

I've recently found out that one of my close friends back at school who I'm sure I at least sent a friend request to has blocked me. I have no idea why and I'm now going crazy as to why. I haven't said a word to him since I've been on Facebook and he was a really go friend of mine back in school. He definitely would have remember me. I'm sure of it. 

Has he seen that video of me? Has he seen me do other stupid things with my anxiety? I don't know. I'm going crazy thinking about it. 

I've also been habitually checking the internet for that video. I constantly check Facebook top posts, YouTube trending and so on. I check it everyday hoping that I don't see that video, but I sometimes hope I do see that video so I can finally be put out of my misery. 

As mentioned, my tourettes have been getting worse. I'm part of a tennis club that I joined a few months ago. I'm a very sporty person, particularly endurance sports. 

When I picked up tennis I got really good at it very fast. My coaches who are the club leaders started giving me extra training and even started asking me all these questions about my availability and so on. It's completely obvious that they're trying to get me on the club team so that we/ I can compete with other clubs. 

I went to tennis practice 3 times a week. I eventually stopped because some of the members noticed that there was obviously something wrong with me. It's been about 2 months since I've been. I didn't tell any of the members as to why I haven't been. I just completely stopped and never contacted them. 

I went to practice in the morning by myself 2 days ago because I really missed playing. I was practicing serves. Nobody was there, but a member was walking past and started talking to me asking where I've been. She seemed really concerned and I just lied to her. 

I've got practice tomorrow and I don't know if I should go. 

This is becoming a huge issue in my life. I actually didn't go to university this academic year because my anxiety had become so bad. 

My anxiety fuels my tourettes which in return fuels my anxiety. It's just a cycle. 

Recently, I haven't been going out either. I've just stayed in the house. I only go to the gym at night and people have started noticing things about me there. 

I'm so scared that they're going to record me. 

I don't even want to go to the gym anymore. My new plan is to do home workouts and just go running at 03.00 AM as I live in a quite area so nobody will see me. 

It's also hard to go meet people or date . I just get scared when a lady smiles at me because I keep thinking they saw that video and they're actually laughing at me. 

I've had girls that have clearly shown interest in my such as grabbing my forearm or stroking their hair and smiling as they look into my eyes when they're sitting opposite me on a table, but I just get scared and go off. I never used to be like this. 

I'm so scared to go out. I keep thinking everyone has seen me on the internet and I keep thinking people are going to record me once they seem my tourettes. 

I don't know what to do anymore. My doctors can't help me and my psychologist can't help me either. 

I keep thinking someone is going to record me. Everybody has a camera on them these days and everybody uses social media. Somebody is going to see me. 

I'm completely losing it. I feel like I'm going to go  permanently insane.

I was never told I’d be working 40 hours a week. It was agreed it would be around 38 hours.

Things developed slowly, but eventually we got to the point where we started texting everyday. We still aren't ""dating."" But we flirt often, and have made out a few times. We nearly act like we're in a relationship, though. We bring each other things to work (treats, coffees, etc), he visits our office a few time a day, he texts me throughout the work day, and usually a few hours after work ends we text until one of us goes to bed. We always let the other know when we're leaving work, when we get home, and anytime either of us goes anywhere we do the same. Even if the other is asleep, we always text when we make it home so the other knows when they wake up. We care a lot about each other, even without it being ""official.""

He's had a very rocky past in terms of past dating &amp; his mental health. He has not dated since a bad relationship after which he almost committed suicide due to the way she destroyed his name in the aftermath. Also, from what I've observed in his behavior with me, it's clear that relationship really fucked with him in other ways. When he's had to cancel plans (which has been extremely infrequent and always for understandable reasons), he has been afraid of me being mad at him, and has told me I was amazing for being understanding and not upset with him. I don't know much about what happened, but the first time we made out, he nearly had a breakdown because of his fear of being involved with someone again. We worked past this, and have progressed since then. It's been a slow process, but it's worth it for me to be patient for him.

However, I've been starting to worry about how things are. This week in particular, he seems off. Normally after we get home from work (\~5pm), we go a few hours without texting, but then later (8-830) we start texting again until one of us goes to bed around 9/9:30. However, this week, I have not heard from him at all at night, until I end up texting him first. It's just unusual for him not to reach out. Then, last night, I texted him around 9 after not hearing from him again, and he told me he was emotional. I asked what was going on, and he said that he gets like this sometimes, and just sometimes has a lot of unexplained emotions, like depression and anxiety and it fucks with him. (He is on meds for both anxiety &amp; depression). His responses weren't brief, they were detailed. I gave him support and reinforced that I’m there for him. But, it still makes me worry that he keeps not texting at night like he used to. I guess I'm just wondering if I should be worried, or if it seems sincere and maybe things will revert to normal? 

Despite this behavior, today at work he still popped in our office 3x, teased me and joked with me, and texted me during the day, and still texted me when he left/got home.

I guess I, too, get paranoid from past issues because I've dealt with a lot of emotionally manipulative people in the past. I'm used to people ghosting or slow-fading, so anytime I sense a difference in behavior, I worry and jump to assume the worst. I assume it's me and they're leaving, because that's how it's always been in the past. Am I just being paranoid? or is there reason for concern for where we stand?",06Sep2019,1
820,"I'm a dude doing a long-term stay at an Airbnb. It's one of those ones where the building has a bunch of rooms, and each of us have our own room and bathroom. Basically like a hotel. I've been here 3 weeks now, people come and go, some a few days, some long-term residents like me.

Anyway. 4 AM and I hear someone start fiddling at the doorknob to the room next door. I think it's strange because I'm pretty sure no one's staying in the room next door tonight. This person fiddles about 10 times unsuccessfully. He starts banging on the door and grunting in anger.

I'm thinking about what to do next when he just suddenly opens my door and enter my room, completely butt naked.

I get up and shout at him. What the fucking fuck. What the fuck are you doing. He blinks, stares at me. He makes like a ""sorry"" gesture. Then he just turns around, naked, goes up the stairs, and goes to his room.

I'm so fucking pissed. I also know maybe it's less of a situation since I'm a man and not a woman, but that shit sort of really freaked me out. He was butt fucking naked. Why the fuck was he banging on doors at 4 AM? Maybe he was drunk and came home naked and couldn't find his room, but why the fuck was he naked? If that's not his story, then what the fuck were his intentions?

I already contacted the Airbnb host. I almost called the cops last night. I don't know what else I should be doing or feeling. Don't know if I'm having an overreaction either. This is a weird one. Thoughts and advice would be appreciated, thanks.",06Sep2019,1
821,"The main issue: how can I smash my exams when I'm going to have, no exagerration, no social life for the next year and crippling depression!

Subtext:

I'm homeschooled. I have been for about 6-7 years now. Due to the rural area I live in, and circumstances under which I have been homeschooled, I have essentially had a dead social life for the past 6-7 years. It's been f\*cking brutal, especially considering I'm a highly social person who values relationships very much. Unsurprisingly, I have pretty crippling depression (+social anxiety) and I see little point in doing things in life... i.e. work. I honestly wonder sometimes how I'm still alive after 6-7 years of this sh\*t. Nonetheless, I have very important exams at the end of this year which will essentially determine wether or not:   
1. I can have a social life next year (If I don't smash the exams, I'll have to repeat the year which means more homeschooling and bye-bye to any chance of a social life)  
2. I can go into the sector of work I want to go into   
3. I will be a huge dissapointment to my parents (a brief summary: they're toxic af, decide if I repeat next year (which I will have to if I don't achieve the top grades in all of my subjects) and expect nothing less than perfection).

At least for this year, there is no chance of changing the ways of my barren social life and parents' attitudes (there have been attempts for 2 decades but no luck). So I need your help. How can I absolutely destroy these exams? What should I do?

Thank-you very much.",06Sep2019,1
822,"So university just begun and for one of the class we have group tests and quizzes.

The prof said we should arrange ourselves in groups of 4 for both studying and the quiz/test. On the first day of class, the 4 people (Me, John, Sam, Emily) at our bench agreed to be a group and exchanged contact information. But we have yet to make a group chat or talked outside of class.

Today was the second day of class and only John and I sat together (so 2 out of the 4) and we met 2 other people. We did see Sam sitting far off in the front but we didn't see Emily at all.

Now after class, one of the other guy asked me if John and I wanted to be in a group with them, and I said yes and that I'll ask John, thinking the agreement from first class was called off since we didn't sit with Sam or Emily. I later asked John and he agreed.

Now I'm conflicted about if I made the right decision. I wasn't sure how serious or committed I should be about the agreement from first class. And I'm not sure what I'd say if Sam or Emily asked me about the arrangement. Got any advice?",06Sep2019,1

A little bit about me: I am 20, turning 21 next summer, I just entered my third year of Canadian university and I feel like I am having a quarter life crisis.

So I am one of those kids who decided that staying home for university was the right choice to save money and figure stuff out or whatever. Anyways, in high school I had a good group of friends who almost all left town for various schools across the country. I have really struggled to make any friendships at all as I don't really feel like I belong at my school and it is a smaller program so at this point I just feel incredibly isolated and outcast. 

I am very jealous of many of my friends getting to experience growing up, and dorm life, and moving in with friends, and being active in communities at their schools, and I am not sure how to cope with this.

I just regret my choice to stay at home so badly right now and I know nothing I can do can erase two years of time but I just can't let go of the feeling that I missed out on this cultural rite of passage and I don't know what to do or how to manage.

       She was already saying how she wants to move out bad cause of our other family members but me and her are best friends and she never said anything to me about me “saying this”.

So ever since I was a kid I’ve dealt with Strabismus (cross-eye) but since I was a little little kid, I never really noticed that were my eyes were beginning to deviate. My parents had me go under surgery, but the doctors did the best they could do, and were not able to completely correct my eyes. 

I never thought much about it until middle school when people (mostly children) would stare at me, or when I was talking to someone the person would look over their shoulder because they thought that I wasn’t talking to them.

It wasn’t until High school that I would start to be self-conscious about not only my eyes, but everything from the way I walked, talked, smiled, everything. 

I’m 22 years old now and it has come to a point where I can’t physically make eye contact with anyone because I don’t want to make them uncomfortable when I look at them. I even made a baby cry the other day (or maybe not, I could be wrong. But she was laughing and smiling with everyone but by the time she looked at me she bursted our crying) and it broke my heart because I’ve always loved making babies laugh.

I’ve never truly felt beautiful, even if people say it, they only say it to be nice because of how out of the blue it is. I feel like I’m repulsive to look at, really.

I do have an appointment with my optometrist next month to see if I can go through vision therapy. I really hope it works because I truly hate how I look. I know that people say “you should embrace your differences” and believe me, I tried. But having people look at you everyday as if you’re a foreign object, makes you start to believe that you really don’t belong here.

We're very drastically different people and up until she reached out to me a few days ago, we had been in our most recent spat of not talking to one another for almost a year now. I'm also on the low end of the autism spectrum disorder (or what use to be called aspergers), and that has put a wrench in things between us as well. So many miscommunications is dizzying. The doctors have done so many tests on my sister and still haven't found what's causing her illness. She's due to see a few more specialists, and they have already ruled out tumors and such, and nothings been coming up in her scans. So there have been a whole host of tests and specialists, yet we're no closer to having any answers.

833,"   I don’t know how to describe this feeling, especially since I am younger. I do not consider myself to be transgender, but in the past and especially now I have been wanting to dress feminine on some days and masculine on the other. I will find myself having a strong desire to wear suits, button up shirts, and other clothing in the men’s section. Another day I will really want to wear a dress, jewelry, and a bunch of feminine clothing. I always wonder where I would and want to stand in a relationship. I don’t know what I want to be seen as completely. I’m not offended at all by she/her pronouns, I am proud and just fine with being a woman. Then again I don’t see myself wanting to be called he/him or a male in the future. I am fully aware that I am young, and I don’t need any labels yet but I keep running into problems.

   I don’t know what to buy clothing-wise or how to express this feeling to others. I don’t know what I am doing either. I don’t know how to act in order to be happiest.

   To clarify, I am a bisexual female. I may come out as pansexual soon. I’m willing to answer any questions that would possibly lead to knowing if there is a certain name for this or a way to figure  it out.

Me and my gf (both in college, for context) have been together for 10 months. She's my first girlfriend but she's had much more experience than me, however I am her longest lasting boyfriend. Anyway, we hit a bump in the road that for right now I'd rather keep private but essentially things were tough when she moved back to her home country during the summer. She came back and since then we had a major talk and agreed to keep moving forward and working on bettering ourselves.

However now, things are getting too strange. So one day she'll be the happiest person with me. We would spend hours with each other, being affectionate and whatnot. Typical normal nice couple things. Then the very next day she would come and ask for a ""break"" because I'm too much of a burden. She'll apologize, be sweet the next day, then suddenly very rude. Like, in mid conversation and in front of people too, then act like nothing's wrong, then go back and say ""I want my stuff from your house bc you always throw it at my face in an argument"" after she called ME to have company whilst she's stuck in traffic.

I don't post much here but I figured that reddit would have people here that might have gone through what I'm going through. Do I stay and give her the benefit of the doubt that she's just stressed or something? Is there an underlying problem here that I can't see?

835,"

Background info: 
My bf and i have been dating over 2 years. we met when we both moved to a new city for work at the same company(different departments). we got along quickly and had similiar interests and hobbies and started dating after 5 months

Now this was the first actual serious relationship for both of us and everything was great initially and properly didn't notice the red flags. we had fights in between because of his slutshaming  ( calling me a slut, whore etc and other more descriptive horrible things when there was a fight) and fat shaming( gained a few pounds than how i was in college), due to girl friend of his using derogatory terms for me and him not stopping her but he told me he realised his mistakes and will never treat me like that again 

we didn't have many other friends in this city and hang out with each other or at each others apartments mostly. so it was harder to just break up before.


NOW THE INCIDENT:

somehow things got better recently, probably because i just let things go and was busy with work. one day around 11 he calls me ( i was still in bed coz i slept at 4am due to some work) and asks me to get him a couple of books to give to his roommate and another girl. now not being a morning person and annoyed i told cant you even wish or say something than just demanding me to do something ( i admit i was rude). also told him i have a meeting at 11.30
so i have just time to wake up n rush to office and no time to get a book. he says im a bitch and selfish and i tell him i have other things to do and this becomes a fight.

we already waste 15 mins on this and i decided to join the meeting from home( work from home option). by then he got extremely pissed and was saying that i need to be taught a lesson and put in my place and he will slap me so hard for this( his own words) and that he coming to my house. told him i wont let him in to which he says he will tell my neighbors that i stole money from him and is hiding in my flat. had to let him
in coz he would create a ruckus outside. proceeds to throw a fullon tantrum by throwing things, pulling out the things i hung on the wall of my rooms and breaking them and almost hitting me. tore apart couple of books and threw it at me and around. since things had escalated quickly i was pretty much in shock.

now we had dinner together the night before and he paid at the restaurant. we do this often where one of us pays at the restaurant and we split and transfer our half to the other. He demands i transfer more than 3 times the amount coz he spent more money on my bday( didnt ask him to but he insisted though i tried to tell him ill pay) than i did on his and that i didn't get him an expensive gift.  And that we are done and breaking up. True that i didn't get him an expensive gift ( i did pay for other things on his bday just like he did for mine , just didn't have enough for gift too) coz i had asked him to please wait a month or two as i had a bit of money struggle last month due to a few exams i had to take. Told him i will definitely get him whatever he wants but just give me a little more time. I realize now that ishould have just somehow got him something then if i knew he was gonna hold it over me till now all the time. By now im in tears but super pissed too and tell him no.. i will only pay for the dinner. 

i was already in front of my laptop to attend the meeting. so he threatens to break the laptop and takes my phone away. When i try to grab it back he tries to twist my arms and hold me by the neck . ( he has twisted my arm hard and grabbed me by the neck and pushed me against the wall and bed twice before)so i just let go and dont do anything as he goes to the other room with my phone. He is very angry and showering me with abuses and i don't say anything, just work on my laptop. (i was legit scared that things might escalate if started shouting too and gets even more pissed and hits me.) I just sit on the chair in front if my laptop and asks to take what he wants and leave.( he was also taking back everything he gave me coz we are breaking up... things like a pillow, an extension cord, a water bottle,etc)

Now he gets even more pissed when i said that and  he starts threatening me that he will ruin my career by badmouthing me to everyone in my office and to my manager by telling him that i hate the management and the job and all that ( we work together but different departments and my bf already quit to leave to another company and is on the last week of his notice period,so he has nothing to lose here) Tells me he should beat me up for being such an ungrateful bitch.

Told him i would have to move things forward legally if he doesn't leave or hits me. He says his family( dad works in defence and has many legal contacts) would back him up no matter what and would ruin my life. My family is more conservative and will blame me for dating in the first place, so telling them is out of the question. Threatens me to not tell anyone or else he will ruin my career. 

After the entire thing he finally leaves. By then im in tears and completely broken down. i attend the meeting and go to office. He comes and asks me to grab lunch with him and i refuse and ask him to please stop contacting me( he keeps messaging me). and blocked him everywhere. He says im overreacting and being dramatic.  i told him what he did was really horrible and he says thats because i provoked him by not giving him the book when he asked and caused a fight. And that he did nothing wrong. I told him if thats what he thinks then there is nothing for us to talk about and we shouldn't contact each other after that.

 i really dont want things to get out of hand or ruin my career. My friends are also telling me  not to talk to him and cut him off. I am very sad and depressed at how things ended coz i really did love him. 

Obviously i never talked to him much after that but he keeps messaging me via mail or someother way and im just ignoring it. He says he is sorry and lets just talk about it or atleast break up properly. Should i talk to him or hear him out?",06Sep2019,1
836,"TLDR: I just found out that, several years ago, I cheated on someone with an ex while I was taking some meds that basically zombified me for half a year -- I'm sorry but I can't make that sentence any less complicated. I also don't remember much of anything inside that time frame, so I only know what people have told me and what I was able to sleuth out after I got de-zombified.

So, I'm someone who is sort of okay at staying friends with my exes, and I'm also someone with some kind of mood disorder that has been mis-diagnosed at least twice, and for which I've been given a lot of wrong medications. During one period of time shortly after I turned 18, I was prescribed some type of antipsychotic, and the pharmacy mistakenly switched it out a few months later with a drug intended to treat restless leg syndrome, which a) I was apparently allergic to, or something? and b) apparently has very clear instructions to not give to people on any type of mood stabilizer or antipsychotic drugs, for life-threatening reasons that definitely applied in my case.

 I didn't tell anyone I was going to start taking these meds, and I didn't tell anyone I was on them until well after I'd stopped. When on the antipsychotic, I was completely dissociated -- nothing felt real, nothing seemed to matter, I was definitely not driving this body. I was also extremely suggestible, still very depressed, and dangerously suicidal on the rare moments when the snow lifted in my brain. Long story short, I can't clearly remember details of my time on those meds, only that they didn't work and actually made things a whole lot worse.

For the sake of giving this a time period: I started the (technically correct, but REALLY not correct for me) medication in July of that year, and was a zombie all the way up until they swapped out my meds for the Extremely Wrong ones in November of that year, wherein I eventually got a fever of about 105º F according to the doctors, I ended up in the ER at least once... it was a mess.  I don't know why no one noticed that I was a zombie, I don't know why the doctors didn't notice I was a zombie, I don't know how I kept my job, and I REALLY don't know why the two people I have almost definitely wronged in this situation never noticed a difference in me pre-zombification, but that's neither here nor there at this point.

About a month(?) before I started taking those meds, I ended an extremely unhealthy relationship with someone I'll refer to as Ex-A, who asked if I would still be their booty call sometimes. I begrudgingly said yes, because I had zero self-esteem and even less good sense as a horny and depressed teenager, and because Ex-A had committed some violence against me the first time I tried to break up with them. (Note: several years, a ton of therapy on both of our parts, and some actual difficult conversations later, we're sort of on speaking terms for now.) Not a great move on my part, but shit happens.

Here's where it gets bad: a week or maybe only a few days(?) before I started taking those meds, I met another person at a small party, and we clicked, and they were a hot mess and I was also a hot mess and, as someone who was at the time a horny and depressed teenager, the horny won out over the depression and I asked them out the next day, and on our date this person (whom I'll refer to as Ex-B) was into me and came with me back to my place, we fooled around, and they said they'd like to do that more often.

I started the meds very shortly after that, and like a blackout, I remember some moments here and there, but suddenly I was sitting in the ER with some nasty charcoal burps. I had a very stern nurse or physician asking me the usual suicide watch questions, which is not great a sign to tell me what was going on, but because my fever was down and I said I didn't believe I was going to kill myself, and (side note) because the U.S. doesn't give a shit about keeping people with mental illness safe and alive, they released me. I got my phone back, and I checked my texts. I saw that Ex-B texted me that day, and when I read the timestamp on the message I found out it was January, just after New Year's. I called them to ask what was up, and they essentially had a meltdown (which, y'know, that's totally fair) then told me they were freaked out about me almost dying, and that they couldn't handle ""this kind of relationship stress"" anymore. Me not realizing I'd been in a relationship for the last five months, I did my best to meet up so I could end that, and they pretty much started by breaking up with me, which made it pretty clean. 

I didn't have much of any texts between me or Ex-A to go off of, so I always assumed they might have made a booty call once or twice, but no more than that -- in our later talks, when we were patching things up, they even told me they started dating someone a couple months after we broke up back then, so I figured that, while not the best, I was probably in the clear in terms of When Ex-A Stopped Making Booty Calls, and When Ex-B And I Started Actually Dating. Ex-B literally refuses to talk about the fact that we apparently dated, except one time as part of a retort when I was trying to be there for them when they felt like shit, where they said it didn't count that I cared about them because they'd had sex with me, which says a lot about their state of mind lately, but I'm not going to hold that against them since it's more worrying than insulting.

I talked with Ex-A this weekend, and I got to find out that my understanding of that situation was wrong, because they made it a regular thing to drop by my place during that entire period of time when I was zombified, which also means I definitely cheated on Ex-B. Hell, if Ex-A considered that as some kind of rebound-y break or whatever, I was technically cheating on two people at the same time with each other, and I Literally Do Not Remember Doing That, but I also feel like a relationship is something that you have to enter explicitly and willfully while in a lucid state of mind, just like pretty much any kind of contract -- and while I would have happily gotten into a relationship with Ex-B had I been lucid at the time, that's not the circumstances under which us having some fun one time turned into us dating, so I don't feel comfortable declaring myself free of consequences or some bullshit like that.

Now, I'm still responsible for the actions I take while drunk, or high -- but I feel like I was more me accidentally roofie-ing myself for five or so months while being instructed by a psychiatrist to keep doing it, and I'm really not sure where that falls, ethically speaking.

Also, I'm learning this now, and it's been the better part of a decade, so none of this information is fresh.

If you've read this far, I have some questions:

* How should I respond to this new information from Ex-A? Should I respond at all? I don't think it's their fault, and I have no idea if they were dating that other person exclusively or whatever, so it's not like it's the end of the world.
* What, if anything, should I tell Ex-B? Talking about the fact that we sort-of dated is something they are just completely against doing in the first place, so I'm not even sure how I'd bring that up.
* Is this cheating? I feel like it still kind of is, and maybe that makes me a two-timing bitch, which would be totally fair! But I've already asked the people I can irl about it, and they've said they can't really make that call one way or the other, so I'm burning one of my throwaway accounts to ask you.",06Sep2019,0

839,"I've always found it really tough making decisions. Every project from college to university I've dithered about what to do (it took me a year to pick my dissertation topic, not even kidding, and I wasn't happy with the end result.) So making big decisions about what I want to do in life is really difficult.

I graduated last summer and have just finished a summer job that wasn't for me. I did a TEFL qualification at the start of the year and I didn't enjoy teaching either. I want to carry on learning and expanding my knowledge, but that takes money, not makes it.

I know I have to go somewhere and do something, but I just don't know what I want. I don't know what work I would enjoy or find fulfilling.

I need something to help me start making those decisions and figuring out what I want to do, what I enjoy doing. I know that only I can decide in the end, but I could use any advice or structure on how to start, or your own experiences of figuring out what you want.

Thanks.",06Sep2019,2

We were together for 9 months, he still texts me almost daily though &amp; he said that he still has feelings for me a lot and he still loves me and misses me he just needed time and space. And that maybe in the future soon we could get back together. He also said he didn’t like how he always broke his promises he made to me and that he needed to focus on work, money, sleep and other things.

please someone just give me some advice I’m struggling right now and I want him to change his mind so bad, or just get him to want me again. I can’t heal this just all hurts so bad. I know he’s confused and I just wish he’d wake up and realize what he’s doing to us.  &amp; yes I get I’m young but I’m not THAT young he’s only 2 years older than me.

842," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ttthe company name I said then  ‘ohhhh/mmmm...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look at my hair funny in a wtf face if I had it styled or just untouched is that a bad sign?

843,"I'm really struggling with high school. I want to go to college really badly, but high school is just going terribly. I'm currently a junior. I take four classes online and two at my local brick-and-mortar high school. It was either that or fully online, or fully at the brick and mortar. I can't possibly do full time at the brick and mortar, because I struggle with a lot of tiredness and fatigue, and I just can't manage waking up that early, and ending the day so late. The only other schools nearby are 45 minutes away and pose the same issue. Right now, I'm really struggling with my four online courses. The at school courses are fine, but the online ones are going horrible. I keep getting behind because I can never work up the motivation or energy to do my online classes, then I mentally breakdown every weekend because I have tons of work to do and can never get a break. I think the online classes are horrible for me and my mental health, but it seems like they are my only option. I have severe depression and anxiety, which makes sitting at my computer for hours by myself, with no one to help me, or motivate me really hard. I don't want to drop out and get a GED. I have to get my high school diploma. So, I'm wondering: how can I make getting my diploma easier? Are there any programs that make it super easy to get your diploma. I don't need anything special, or an advanced classes or anything that looks phenomenal, I just need the title, high school diploma. I just want to finish out the stupid thing. Is there any program I could look into? Or things to do to make graduating easier? I really need help. I have a 504, but it seems to be doing nothing for me. In July of this year, my 16 year old twin sister died in an ATV crash, and so the grief of that adding on to my severe depression is making this school stuff unbearable? Any advice or help?

847,"So this is another story after popular demand I figured you ought to tell me about the experience I had about Pennywise, this happened after that, and the NoSleep residents told me I couldnt use Pennywise as he was STephen King's chareaceter and I figure,

Ok I shouldnt use Stephs character like that, he is a PRETTY CHILL DUDE. And its wriong to use Pennywise. Even if the story was true

So I didn't see pennywise after the last story and after I kicked him out, he wasnt playing his Room Rent so I was like, ""who to call up?"" I SAID of course!!! Nickelsmart, Pennywsies cousin, and I figured NICKELSMART wouldnt be biting off my limbs any time soon, because unlike Pennywise, Nickelsmart is a PRETTY CHILL DUDE. Nickelsmart has lots of weed so I told him he would have to go out the door if he wanted to use the weeds, but he said OK. He smokes a lot of marijuana, this silly stoner clown. he is a clown, much like his cousin, and his eyes are also Fred Flintstones I mean theyr Barney Rubble actually so he was a pretty chill guy and like his cousin, he was ALSO a clown, except Stephen King didnt invent him, hes MY character.

so he says, ""HEY LETS DO THIS!"" And he moves in and I'm like OK. Back in the circus he was the frito eater which basically means he would toss up a bag of Fritos and then eat them even though they wree in the air, and its like, what a fun skill. many a nitght NICKELSMART would entertain me with his Fritos tricks.

He could catch Fritos in his mouth like a pro, but not Doritos, he wasnt very good with those.

So now we get to the meat and potatoes of this story, which is that one night Nickelsmart was very stoned and he was talking about carl max, whoeveer that is, i think hes a Communist ior something, and then hes like ""Hey lets turn on the radio"" and I was like Ok but it was just static, very SCARY static that went

KRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSSSKK

So Im like I think the rasdio is broken and that was true I thought, because I bought it back in RadioShack in 1990, so we throw it out the window. And then he goes back to the pot. The radio hit some guy on the head, this guy happened to be Thomas bangalter. So Thomas bangalter becomes the TERMINSATOR and goes up the stairs. ""I will be back"" he says in the macho Australian voice of his, with big robot pecs.

No longer was he the nerdy musician nerdy robot famous for the album ""Random Access memories"" now his eyes glowed red with passionate love and he had nbig atomic mucles, right LOL? Anyway he knocks on the door, and Im watching TV and Nickelsmart is still very stoned. The knocking comes again. He gets up and hes wearing a tuxedo, not a CLOWN tuxedo but lie a tuxedo i dont know why thats just what he does when hes high you know? So he opens the door and he thinks maybe its his cousin PENNYWISE only its not because hes not in this story because hes Stephen Kings character, actually it was THOMAS BANGALTER THE TERMPOTATO! And he sais, 'Yes, do you want a dooby?"" and terminator says ""No but you threw a radio at me asshole, and it hurt my transmissions, now I no get game Of Throne anymore""

and Nickelsmart pissed his clown pants, he was wearing big baggy clown pants at the time. I get up, and I remember the copy of COLLEGE BUDDIES, the best comic ever, which Pennywise gave me last week. I throw it at the Terminator. He says ""HA HA foolish mortal!""

And then scary lightnings come from his hands and I feel like I ate too much at Golden Corral if youve evr known how much that feels. And Nickelsmart was just about to get knocked out, but what terminator forgets is, he is a magic clown. Terminator reaches in his pockets, he finds nothing but FRITOS. He reaches the other one, its just FRITIS. Nickelsmart is smiling. meanwhile, he trties to punch NickelSMRAt but Nickelsmart knows that terminator's whole arm just DININTEGRATES INTO FRITOS!!! And then he becomes Fritos

and with one final gleeful chuckle he collapsses onto the frlorr like the bad little robot which he is. ANd Nickelsmart had beaten him, and then he EATS ALL THE FRITOS! And we had a good laugh about this, what a silly fellow. Thomas bangalter was dead and could no more t=making them dope ass beats but he was TERMINATOR KILLER ROBOT so its OK. And I asked Nickelsmart,

""What is rthe best comics""

and he says

""Nicolas Comics, produced by Nicolas Sequeira, in apartment number one at the idyllic pasture of 1424 at the Columbine Streets in Denver, which happens to be in a state known as Colorado""

And I agree

And I thought the Nicolas Comics would defeat the Terminator at the door but they didnt but at least Nickelsmart saves my lives whioch is important because if I got punched by the terminator I wouldn't be very healthy. Anyway, Im not scared of Nicolas Comics anymore, those are DOPE, Now Im only scared of

ROBOTS

848,"Sounds crazy, stupid and cringey. I know. But hear me out. 

Around 3-4 years ago, I was really depressed, my mum had attempted suicide around a year before that because of my dad cheating and she was just generally abusive whilst my dad was emotionally abusive. I ended up watching a show out of boredom and there was a single character, who had, i dont know how, but he helped me so much during that rough time. 

Ever since, for the past 3/4 years, I’ve been crazy obsessed with him, he is all I have on my mind, all day, every day. I’ve started believing that he’s real, and I’m sure we’re soulmates. I’ve had dreams about him were we got married. My theory is that we were just born In different worlds by mistake and I reality we are meant to be and one day that mistake will be reversed and we will live together. 

Sometimes, I think to myself, I’m delusional, he’s not real, I’ll never see him in my life. And I’ll never get to be with him. And I get really upset. 

He’s taken over my life so much at this point; all my thoughts circle back to him. Even when I’m busy with something he’s always in the back fo my mind. Always. I’m sick of it. Part of me hates him for doing this to me.  

I’m not sure if this has anything to do with it but I thought I’ll say it just in case, but I’ve been diagnosed with ocd and I’ve tried to commit suicide. 

I’m just writing to ask if there’s anything, ANYTHING I could to to stop this. Its destroying me.

859,"I’m a senior (22F) majoring in psychology and minoring in chemistry. I’ve done pretty well in terms of my grades/gpa/MCAT scores and have intended on going to medical school. It’s my last semester and I’m incredibly depressed and completely unhappy. I’m rethinking medical school and wondering if I should look into a different field (one that would make me happier and less stressed out). I have one class left towards my minor (along with other major classes) and I’m considering dropping it. I would definitely value the minor, however it may not be needed if I’m switching my focus off of medical school. 

Bottom line is I’m really, really unhappy and I think it would be beneficial to focus on my mental health at this point. However, my boyfriend is extremely upset that I’m even considering dropping the course and is stressing that I need to man up and get over it. I’m really struggling with what to do, on one hand I feel like I’ve been suffering long enough with premed and I don’t think I want to go to med school at all, so what’s the point of continuing on with the course? I would want to make time to get help with my mental health and overall happiness. BUT on the other hand, I don’t want to be such a weak person that I just give up? Not sure if I should push through, be miserable and suck it up. 

Dropping the course (I would much rather transfer to a different class, but I don’t think that’s possible at this point and I have yet to hear back from my advisor) would put back my graduation a semester which would very much bother me, or at least would feel really embarrassing. I transferred from a private school and not all my credits transferred over, so I’m already 1 semester behind and should’ve graduated a semester ago. However, I could take the course I would be dropping now, next semester and still keep my minor, while graduating late. 

I’d really appreciate some feedback, sorry for the long ramble.",06Sep2019,1

Flash forward to this summer and she kept asking me but I just said I don’t know. Then I decided not to because I just didn’t enjoy the sport.

My whole life I feel I have felt like shit, not like all the time, when I’m out anywhere or with anyone else I’m happy.  I was always a total fucking loser, kinda. I went to a private  middle school so I did not know a lot of people, I still don’t.  I played sports, but was never good at them, and I tried to get good grades but I never did.  I never really had a love life either. My parents have just finally fixed their marriage after years, my dad has mental issues, borderline split personality disorder. He smoked weed for his whole life until 2 months ago when he finally quit.

I smoke a lot of weed, I smoked for the first time 1 year ago. It helped with my depression (wasn’t nearly as bad back then but still) and I have been smoking a lot since then, I’ve been caught before. But the last time I did, a couple days ago, my parents got on me. Just started the school year, and they took my phone which sucks not just because it’s my phone but because I need it. I go to school that I quite honestly don’t  wanna go to, but my parents want me to go to a private school. It is an hour to an hour an a half bus ride. I need my phone for things like checking my schedule, calling people, (mostly people I don’t get to see much). Am I supposed to do all this on a computer? It’s hard. They also took all my money. They said so I won’t buy more weed. But this is what really gets me sad.

They are convinced I got it from my best friend (who I only see once a month pretty much) we have been going to different schools for like a year, he is like my brother. I love him. They said I’ll never see him again. 

Idk what this was. Just a way to vent, it helped. But please give some advice. I think I will be seeing a therapist soon. My parents are gonna tell him to get me off weed, I will use him to help me with my depression.",06Sep2019,1

I can’t cut this person out of my life unfortunately. I can stop using them for support I guess, but I’m not sure what I’ll do then. While my friends and family haven’t been outright unsupportive, no one seems to care much either. Most people forget until I remind them that no I can’t do xxx because I have to do school stuff. Others I think don’t take it seriously because it’s online, despite it being a legit 4 year school with a traditional brick and mortar campus. Maybe I’m too old. If I was in my 20s this would all be more socially acceptable but I’m in my late 30s so it’s weird. Idk... I’m not gonna stop but between 50+ hour work weeks and full time online school, I’m so tired. I’m just stressed and tired and am worried about how I’m gonna carry on when the one person who supported me keeps cutting down my decision to go back to school. 

Whatever I guess. Thanks for letting me vent Reddit.",06Sep2019,1
878,"I’m a 14 year old boy (alt account because my family knows my main), and I seriously think I have 3 balls. I’m not joking. I have 2 normal balls and I have one smaller ball on the right side. I am certain it is not a tumour or anything, because it “feels” like a ball and hurts the same way like a ball if hit. I have no discomfort from it and it doesn’t affect me in any way, I just think it’s abnormal. I want to ask my family about it but I don’t want someone massaging my balls trying to find a third one. What should I do? Should I speak to my family or should I be ok?",06Sep2019,0
879," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ttthe company name I said then  ‘ohhhh/mmmm...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look at my hair funny in a wtf face if I had it styled or just untouched is that a bad sign?



Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",06Sep2019,0
880,"Im in my 20s now and im still trying to figure out a plan for moving out. Granted i help pay rent along eith groceries and any other expenses as well. I currently have a pretty decent paying job (although im gone for weeks at a time). Im starting to think i should just pick a place and go,instead of planning it out beforegand. Although if i move my parents may not be able to afford the place on their own. So im worried about screwing them over. What should i do?",06Sep2019,1
881,"Ok this could possibly be the wrong subreddit for this and idek if I should be on Reddit for this but I have no one else.   

I (F17) have fallen for a really close friend of mine, (F17). This all started around Christmas so it has almost been going on for a year. I only really realised I LIKED her around 4/5 months ago maybe, until then I thought I was straight. Turns out I am a heterosexual biromantic (romantically attracted to girls but not physically). 

For a while I had gotten bi vibes from her and so I decided to come out a couple weeks ago or so in attempt that she would be like oMg iM bi! (Not a movie, didn't happen) but she was still super supportive of me anyway. I'm really close to this person, we call multiple times a day for hours, sometimes super late at like 2am. She is always the first to initiate the calls and it's amazing, I adore everything about her, even her company just keeps me happy until she ends the calls. 

She is almost always the one to end the calls and afterwards I am left miserable, my mind occupied with self obstructive thoughts as I question myself things like ""why doesn't she like me?"" Or ""what can I do better next time to make her stay longer?"" and ik it's selfish and weird of me but I can't help it. It was these kind of thoughts that helped me realise I wasn't fully straight aha.

Whenever I'm not around her or talking to her I am left in a constant state of feeling empty. And as many friends as I talk to, I still can't seem to fill the empty void and this has been going on for months. This has only recently become a problem as I'm about to start a more serious year in school and I can barely focus on anything else but her. I've told myself many times I will try and get over her but it's so hard when I talk to her so often and no matter how hard I try I can't decline the classic ""can u call"" Snapchat around midnight.

 I've tried to talk to multiple guys as this used to occupy my mind however recently no one seems to compare to her. I genuinely don't know what to do. I was sure my feelings would've gone by now but it's been 9 months and I still feel the same way about her as I did months ago. 

I've never felt this way before and I'm not sure whether to tell her I like her or not. I know I want to as even if she was like ew no I could atleast get a little closure but I really don't want to mess up our friendship as she's the only thing keeping me happy atm. I know I'm lying to myself if I continue like this but I seriously don't know what I would do without them and I don't want to risk losing this bond. 



Summary: I (f17) have liked a straight girl, (f17) for 9 months. Have a feeling they are bi but not sure. Want to tell her I like her but I don't want to risk ruining our friendship as we are super close.

Any tips on getting over them and should I tell her or not? Or just what should I do someone please help ahah",06Sep2019,1
882,"I just moved to a new state and transferred my job. I’ve been waiting for the past month for work when I finally went to a job interview mid August for a customer service position. When I went there I didn’t feel very welcomed or good vibes. During the interview the supervisor who interviewed me didn’t seem very happy or enthusiastic. When she asked about hours and I tried to explain my availability she stopped me and said we could discuss it further if I was chosen, which I thought was strange. 

Fast forward to now I was chosen for the job and since I go to college 5 days a week I had a hard time contacting hr . Every time they would call I would be in class and when I called back they weren’t available. We finally got into contact on Wednesday to talk about pay I told her that I had other options and I would call her back Friday. What surprised me was that she said I was put down for open availability which wasn’t true. I even put in my application online the hours I could work. I told hr this and she sounded surprised that the supervisor didn’t have us discuss it into be interview. Hr told me that if I wanted to take the job I should see the supervisor to talk about scheduling. 

I decided to go with the job because I like the fact my pay would carry over for the most part. I went to see the supervisor and immediately she was like “your hard to get in contact with”then had me follow her to the back. She never asked my availability or what day I wanted to start. She put me on the schedule to start 8 hours tomorrow and every day she works. She tried to put me for 8am on Wednesday but I had to tell her I go to school during the week in which she didn’t seem happy about. She proceeded to ask what time I got out of class which was 11 and told me that I could come in at 12 then. I told her that wasn’t a good time which she protested why do I have something to do.  Since I don’t have a car and I wouldn’t want to say I can be there at a time so close and be late. This interaction didn’t really make me feel happy to work there. Once she got done putting me on the schedule I left to call hr and the lady wasn’t there. Also the store is always slow and full of older people I’m (20F) and would enjoy more working with my peers.

Tl;dr Should I continue accepting this job? I still haven’t went to hr to sign my papers yet or should I wait for another one to come up?",06Sep2019,1
