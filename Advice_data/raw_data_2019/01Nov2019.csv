0,"Sorry, i am not really sure if this is the right place to put this out there. I am not even sure what exactly i am trying to do but please hear me out. 
My first and only girlfriend became my wife a year ago. Yesterday she died in a car accident. Everything i looked forward to in my life is no more. The person i love more than anything else in this world is gone and i am not able to be sad. I am sitting in our home, thinking about her and try to feel what i am supposed to feel. But i cant. In fact i think i feel nothing at all. This isnt right. I know that. I should feel something, but no matter how hard i try, everything feels like i am watching a movie that i am not really invested in. Not sure if that makes any sense. 
I know I'm a horrible human for not grieving the one and only good in my life and here i am posting on reddit the day after she died. I should hate myself but i cant even do that.
I dont now what is going on. 
Can someone tell me what to do?",01Nov2019,51
1,"I’m being forced to lie to my mother for my whole childhood and maybe forever  I’m 13, and as embarressing as it is my mum is my best friend and I think i’m hers. When I was like 5 my parents divorced, unbelievably my mother’s parents sided with my Dad and together they claimed that my mum was crazy and tried to put her in a mental asylum. I had to live with my grandparents and Dad for 2 months and wasn’t aloud to see my mother. Afterwards they went to court and ever since, me and my older sisters have been with my Dad half the time and my Mum the other. Of course, my mum lost contact with her parents for what happened and they were always cruel and toxic.      All that would have been fine, but ever since my Dad has been taking me and my sisters to see our Grandparents behind my mum’s back and with us shouting at him. He says that “they’re family” and “they’re all just too stubborn”. My sister’s don’t seem to care as much as I do and they’re definitely not as close as i am to our mum.          This hasn’t really happened for a while but I’ve promised myself that when it does I’m going to refuse and threaten to tell my mother. I am just constantly overwhelmed with guilt and I’m terrified to see how this is going to end. What should I do??",01Nov2019,1
3,"Hello! 
I have been talking and interacting with people online, whether it be games or discord, for about two years with some people. I’ve gotten quite close to some and we were considering meeting at some point.

I know these people are who they say they are, but what I’m worried about is my parents. My mom is really protective and wary of the internet, and I’m afraid if I tell her I talk to people and have friends online she will over react or freak out. I think she knows that I can communicate online but she doesn’t know to what extent and she has never asked me about it.

How do I tell my parents about my online friends? How do I explain it to them?",01Nov2019,2
4,"I (m) recently lied to my girlfriend about something really minuscule and dumb and it made me realize that I don’t talk to her about day to day things like at all. I work at a grocer, and the other day a businessman asked if it was a job that I liked doing, we talked for 5 minutes and then he gave me his number and wanted to give me some contact information for a job opening he had in one of his businesses. I texted him the next day and we set a date to meet up in a Starbucks. When I left the house to meet him I told my girlfriend I just had to run out to the store for a few things, because I didn’t think it would take the 2 hours that it actually did take. We talked about the position a lot and had a great conversation. But when I got home I lied about running into someone I knew and just had a good chat. I also didn’t have anything from the store that I said I went to. 
Now, I don’t know why I didn’t tell her any of this information, why I lied, and I don’t know how to approach her to just tell her where I was truthfully. It’s boggling my mind. Advice?",01Nov2019,0
5,"Hello there, I think in this case I have to introduce myself first. I'm an university student which studying Archeology and 22 years old. I discovered that I'm not belong to university with bad experiences since 3 months. Thinking about quit university. Even I miss some exam dates already in university.

 Let me tell you more about my near educational past. I really wanted to go university for 4 years. I been accepted to some universities for 3 different years and I didn't go for university for my financial problems. I'm not coming from a wealthy family. And I had not any family support or motivation. This year I believed that I can do by myself by financially and it seems I'm kinda failed.

 I always wanted a military carrier since my childhood. Things got changed to worse in my country time by time. I did some mistakes and political situation of my country really messed up. If you want to know I'm from Turkey by the way. I can't join Army Collage because of my old age. I can't get used to university life and my financial situation going worse. Even I can't hang out with my dudes when I need.

 I'm thinking of joining Police Academy. For financially purposes and kind of militarish life. I started to do fitness on a gym for preparing to Police Academy selections. It's doing one selection per year. I'm giving 4 days of my week for fitness. And giving almost everyday for Academy writing exams.

 But still I'm confused and need your help. Am I doing something wrong? I'm feeling like I'm playing gambling about my future. I already lost my 4 efficient years of my life, that's making me more coward to take risk. How can I be more brave in that situation? I really need your help, your advices and your motivation.

 PS: Forgive my beginner English that I learnt by myself on internet if I made mistakes. And when I started to text my situation it felt like a therapy for me, I wrote so long for this, forgive me if I stole your time.",01Nov2019,1
6,I just got called stupid and other terms by my dad because I didn’t know how to screw on a fire detector. This always happens. I never know how to do all these household things and he think I’ll be unsuccessful in anything I do now. I’ve never done any of it so I have a hard time figuring it out. He thinks I’m stupid Becuase I can’t do things that are “common sense” on the spot. This isn’t just my dad btw it’s a couple of more family members as well but mostly him. How do I become more intelligent or how can I learn to do these things with just instructions etc. I feel really stupid and now really am worried for my future. Especially now that my dad has a potential life ending condition and he thinks I won’t do anything. It’s the worst feeling ever to disappoint my parents but I seriously don’t understand how everyone else understands these things first time. Any advice is appreciated.,01Nov2019,1

9,"Hi all, i think the stub of the problem is that i personally feel like i'm stuck in a rut at work.

I qualified over a year ago in my chosen profession. This qualification followed two years of moving round a company  to see what I found interesting/was good at. So i knew when I joined my current team, I was interested in that niche of work and needed to focus on it to improve my skill base. To be clear, the issues that I face now did not exist when I previously work there. 

When I'm assigned projects or tasks in my chosen area I enjoy it. It's tough, the hours are long but the work is interesting and I'm paid well to do the work. 

Over the past 6 months however, I've been assigned to projects outside my chosen area, where the work  is not something I find naturally interesting and I have no interest in developing my skills there as ultimately I don't want to add these areas of work to my portfolio of skills/I'm working on them for too short a period to learn anything from them. My more senior co-workers have been shielded from this and have been able to stay on their chosen fields. I can see the projects I want to get involved in go past me and its incredibly frustrating. I need the training those projects would provide and I'm just not getting it. Instead I'm working on something which  find mind numbing, and when you're working the hours I'm doing i.e. 12+ hours a day, you need to be interested. 

I've tried to raise my concerns with my supervisor, who has repeatedly thrown me onto other projects which arent related to my practice. He has basically brushed off my concerns, laughed at them at times and today called me petulant. The last point kind of stung a bit, especially after I got thrown another crap piece of work, which was again not something related to my field, but it was ancillary to the part of the larger project my colleagues were focusing on and enjoying. 

I had a realisation yesterday where I worked out that them offering me more money to do this job isnt going to solve the issue. I just don't enjoy my job anymore and I don't enjoy working with my boss. 

I know personally I can get a bit passive aggressive but at this point I feel like I'm being treated badly. I'm seeing my colleagues get the interesting work, leave earlier and have the job satisfaction I used to have. Its not a one off event but a series of events and I'm tired of dreading going into work. 

Where do I go from here? I'm talking to recruiters (I think 3 years at a company is a long enough period to have been there?) but beyond this I'm a bit lost. 

Sorry for the essay but would appreciate any advice at this point.",01Nov2019,1
11,"This could be a symptom of ADHD (However, this problem seems worse since starting new stim med) or another one of my issues. I have a lot of ideas. Ideas for businesses, career paths, improving my life, my future, etc. While it may be difficult to execute or accomplish a lot of these ideas and plans, I do want to pursue a majority of them one day. I guess I feel I would be meeting my full potential? Anyway, the problem is that my main focus right now should be on my education. I have to complete this one prerequisite to get into my program and it's hard not to get lost in my head with my ideas. I've tried telling myself many things like ""This (prereq) is the most important thing right now. It leads to x, y, z"" or ""Everything else can wait but this needs to be done now."" I've written lists trying to organize these ideas and how they'd potentially unfold, I've wrote myself many anti-procrastination letters. I've tried so many things but I'm having a difficult time just getting my brain to click and go, ""Okay, just this right now."" Maybe it's stupid. But I'm stressed over it and feel like the less I think about these things the more likely I will lose my initiative for these things.  


What can I do to fix this (albeit, seemingly stupid) problem?

12,"Hi, new to the sub, wanted to see if you guys thought this would be an okay idea. 

Background: I'm 19. Years ago, when I was 9-12 my family lived in New Hampshire, but my dad worked in New Jersey, so he only came home every other weekend. Every once in a while, he'd take me with him, and I vaguely remember him spending a lot of time with his female co-worker who was in the process of getting divorced. Like he'd go to her apartment, her house, or to dinner with her, not just hanging in the office. Obviously, he told me they were discussing work or whatever, and I didn't think much of it at the time, but later on, hindsight had me much more suspicious. Soon after this, my parents began the divorce process. They eventually worked things out and stuck together, but for years now, I've wondered if my dad cheated on my mom in the years he was away, and this woman seemed like the top candidate. Sure, it would be audacious to have your son meet your mistress, but I figured it's possible he just kept things ""business-oriented"" whenever I was around, which was rare. The situation just kinda stinks, and the timing of it all was suspect.

Question: This has been eating at me for years now, and I have to get to the bottom of it. I'd rather not ask my parents since they seem to be doing better now. The only thing I can think of is this: the woman's daughter, who I met once or twice, must've been around them more than I was since she lived in Jersey. Plus, she was a bit older, so she may have had a better understanding of the situation, and her mom was already separated from her dad, so she may have been more open with her if an affair was happening. I've been thinking about messaging her on some social platform, but I understand how weird of a thing it is to do, so I'm not sure whether/how I should go about asking if she has more information. What should I say? Is there a better way to do this?

TL;DR: Suspect my dad of cheating on my mom years ago. Don't want to ruin their relationship now. Should I ask daughter of potential mistress if she knows anything?

Thanks!",01Nov2019,2

work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‘mines 21st’ and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays eh (Sam was laughing about it a bit) then Sue said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted seriously like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’ and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? Juts before this they asked how old I am and I said I’m 29 and they both reacted nicely saying ‘awwwwww are yer?!’ Loudly, Meaning I look younger coz I do get told I do a lot. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest she looks like a drug addict. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.",01Nov2019,0
14,"I am in a difficult position and I don't know what to do. I could use some good advice.

My dad has a serious drinking problem, is mentally abusive to my family (especially my mom), physically abusive to our new puppy and my mom will do nothing about any of it - i've had so many conversations with her and she feels that he will change or that she needs him. She seeks his approval and allows him to boss her around literally **all day.** She is always stressed, rushing around trying to reach my dad's impossible demands and takes no time for herself. Because of this, she now has dangerously high-blood pressure. 

My dad is **extremely** stubborn and it is close to impossible to talk to him. 90% of his interactions with my family are either angry or passive aggressive. My oldest brother committed suicide almost 3 years ago and it has just caused him to become more stubborn. My little brother and I have tried talking to him in the past and he has just completely ignored us and continued his toxic habits. 

Now my dad is being physically abusive to our new puppy and both my little brother and I have had enough of it.

The whole situation is a mess and it doesn't help that my dad has 0 respect for me or my little brother. Anything we say he just rudely disregards and forgets the next day.

I've grown immensely the past few years and I'm beginning to accept that I cannot control my parents. However, I feel action must be taken in regards to his abusive behavior towards our puppy and my mom. 

The upside is my brother and I have worked long and hard on building an e-commerce business and we are very close to becoming self-sufficient so we can live in a better environment. I've been thinking of just taking the puppy with us... idk

16,"My mum is one of them people where she will always think you’re lying.

Unless there was something physically wrong like a broken leg or something, she wouldn’t believe me and she’s still like that now. We’re like best friends but she just has no sympathy not just for me but for many people. I feel like if I tell her she’s just going to push it away, or “leave it to see if you get better”.

We are a couple thats been married for 7 years now my wife is 27 and I'm 30 we have to kids 4 and 2 I work and prove for the family which is fine because I want my kids to grow up with her mom and not in a day care and she enjoys that too. We love each other very much however we have fee things in common. Sure I make her laugh all the time and the jokes and love for each other keep us always on our toes and keeps us entertained. Here is the problem, I'm like super addicted to music and music festivals that she is 100% not into edm mostly, we have been to a few festivals and she has made some effort into going with me and somewhat enjoying the time she has been there. But she has told me that she does not want to go to festivals anymore, instead she wants to do family things and take trips to places, I'm totally fine with this because I want this too. But she says she will not go to festivals with me no matter what and that I kind of over play the edm songs I like and artists I like. She wont budge about coming to festivals with me but I budge on taking family trips anywhere she wants to go. Is it unfair for me to feel like I should cage my feelings and likes in music and never ask again for her to come with me to festivals? even though that's what makes me incredibly happy and that's where I have fun as a couple I though that's where we can forget that we have kids and just have fun the both of us alone.

24,"So my high school band is doing a Universal Orlando trip April 15-19, 2020. And I asked my parents if I could go, the deadline to sign up is next week. Their answer was “we’ll think about it.” I had spinal fusion done summer of last year (2018), and that was also the year of the previous trip (The band does this every 2 years). So they’d paid the money for me to go on the previous trip and then about 3 weeks before, they decided I wasn’t going anymore, because I was having surgery in a few months and they didn’t want me getting injured on a roller coaster. Also, there ended up not being enough people going to actually play there, so it was just a fun trip. Also my grandparents were coming that date too, and I had the state algebra test. I was a little upset especially since we spent all that money. They did however give it to one of the directors for the use of giving it to someone less fortunate that wanted to go and couldn't originally afford it. However idk if anyone less fortunate actually got to go or not. I was bummed out about missing the trip.

Anyways so they’re doing the trip again next year and I asked my parents if I could go. They said they’d think about it. I can’t ride any of the fast rides (idk If Universal has slow rides, which I’d be able to ride), but I could do the water park (as long as I have a swim shirt on). But most of my clarinet friends (and I think the majority of the band) are going and I feel like it’d be a good experience. And they’re doing a sound (playing) thingy this time.

I feel like I’m being ungrateful. He isn’t that bad. He doesn’t hit me hard enough to leave bruises and leave any lasting physical pain. He doesn’t always throw stuff at me, but when he does it’s usually things that are soft (like pillows). Though, there are times he will throw glass items or mechanical items when he’s angry. 


He often insults me. When he does, he either doesn’t realize it or thinks that the insult is justified. I’m stupid. I’m useless. I’m lazy. I’m ungrateful. I can’t do anything right. I’m a horrible daughter.


He even undermines my mom’s work. My mom works six days a week and always comes back home tired. Even though my dad is unemployed and doesn’t even do any work around the house, he has the gall to call my mom lazy.


My dad has anger issues and probably some other issues. I want him to get him some help, but he thinks therapy just makes people “even more crazy.” I’m scared. He has threatened to kill himself multiple times. A year ago, he threatened to stab his eye out with a screwdriver because we were in an argument. I have no idea if he was actually gonna do these things, but I don’t want to find out. 


I don’t know what to do. Despite everything I said, I do still love my dad very much. A lot of the time, he is actually pretty kind and caring. There are reasons why I don’t want my mom to divorce him. 


-He has been unemployed for years. How is he going to have any money? 


-He has threatened to kill himself. I don’t want him to die.


-I love my dad. Even though he’s one of the worst people I know, he’s very close to me and I care about him.

31,"Sorry if this is not the right sub for this, I did not know where to post. I am just kind of freaking out.

My phone got stolen last week. The person probably turned it off or activated the airplane mode right after and I was not able to track it at first. The night it got stolen, I saw that the phone was located in a “not so safe” part of the city. It is pretty far from where I live and I have never been there. It sucked but I figured that the person will probably reset it or decompose it to sell the pieces. 

I turned on the “lost” function and programmed the stolen phone so that whenever the person tries to go online and activates the WiFi or data it would delete all of my infos in there.

These last day when I checked again the tracking I noticed that the location had moved. The stolen phone was now in places that I had been to like the shopping center for instance.

Yesterday, it was the train station that is the closest to my place. Today, it was in front of the restaurant I was with friends.

It is really really disturbing. 

I know that it probably does not track my phone in real time, the location only updates around once a day. Am I getting stalked ? Or is it possible that it might be a bug and that it just shows places I have been to?

The data on the phone has not been deleted so I am guessing that he did not connect it to the internet - but again in that case I don’t know why it would have been tracked in another part of the city in the first place. 
If he was able to unlock it, I have my schedule in there with all the places I am going.

34,"i’m on a different account so he won’t see this. a couple weeks ago a guy from reddit messaged me that he was going to kill himself, not sure why he messaged me, but he said he lost his family and friends and he was going to be homeless soon and he struggled with depression. i talked him out of it, but now i talk him out of it everyday. he says i’m the only reason why he’s still here. he really wants to stay at a shelter near where i live even though he’s pretty far. he keeps asking me if we can go on a date and i only said yes because i don’t want him to hurt himself. i think he’s a good guy but i only want to be friends. also i’m an 18 year old girl and he’s a 24 year old guy, we’re both adults but how can i trust him? i’m just worried i could be putting myself in danger. either way, if i ghost him, he’ll kill himself and if i don’t then he’ll try to meet me, what do i do?",01Nov2019,3
35,"Hi, I'm your average depressed 16 year old boy. So I just need some place to vent my feelings, so here goes nothing.

I've never been a popular guy. I'm a loner and I prefer being like that. I have 0 friends in school or anywhere else. I can't start a conversation and struggle to keep one going. My self-esteem is non-existent and I have no confidence whatsoever.

I have no luck with girls. I'm not the type of guy who wants a girlfriend for doing dirty things or for bragging about. I just want someone to spend time with and hang out with. I want to hear all there problems and offer assistance in anyway I can. I want to never feel like I'm enough and keep improving this way I feel like I'm enough. I want someones hand to hold, and someone to video call for hours on end.
A thing that I hate about myself is that I will fall for any pretty girl that gives me any bit of attention. 

If I see a girl staring at me in my peripheral vision, I immediately develop an obsessed interest in them. Just a week ago, I was standing against the wall in one of my classes, waiting to be dismissed. I thought I was familiar with everybody in my garde and classes, and I already knew there was no one that interested me. All of a sudden, I turn my head and I see this beautiful girl. This girl had everything (perfect hair, eyes, nose, smile, but chin, everything). She looked amazing. I took glimpses of her and in my peripheral vision I felt as if she was doing the same. I already knew that this girl was way above my league and probably has a boyfriend so I backed off (no emotional harm done). I soon forgot she existed. Them just a week ago, I was waiting to be dismissed again, and I see her in my peripheral vision smiling at me. She looks away, I peep down to check my watch, I look up, and she's looking at me again (I'm avoiding eye contact with her as I have no confidence whatsoever). When the bell rings, her and her friend walk out ahead of me. She turns around to talk to her friend behind her, and she nearly makes eye contact with me (I was staring at the back of her head like the creep I am, and I did not expect her to turn around), but I managed to make it look like I was staring ahead. I was amazed that I had gone to this school for 4 years and yet I had never seen nor paid attention to this girls existence (looking back at photos on our school's website, I see tons of photos of her that I've passed over before, but I payed no attention to her existence). I looked into the yearbook to find the girls name for ""research"". I manage to find her instagram account and... SHE HAS 2000 FOLLOWERS and only follows 1000 people. Also she has 5000 TIK TOK FOLLOWERS. She's also extremely active in school and is one of the best players on the varsity basketball team (she's also only 1"" shorter than me: I'm 5'8""). Also, she has a jeep (she can drive) which I can't because: 1.) I can't drive. 2.) My parents can't afford to buy me a car. I have 0 athletic ability, I am in no clubs as I am socially awkward, and I never made an instagram account because I don't want people to see my 0 followers. I felt really depressed at this point and realized that there was no way I was good enough. I somehow managed to convince myself there was still hope when I scrolled through her vsco and saw no photos of boys (I presume she had no boyfriend) and she doesn't have any photos of her with the popular kids at my school (I assume she's not friends with them). The next day when the bell rang, I ran out of the room hoping that she would be behind me, and hopefully she would let me into her world and just notice that I exist. All of a sudden this girl boosts ahead of me just to get stuck in the hallway traffic (I know all people don't think the same, but did she have the same intentions as me; to get my attention?). The next day I was walking out of the door at the same time as her, and I can see her glance at me as she talks to her friend behind me. The day after that, I stood behind her friend and stared at a couple of posters on the wall. Her friend is short, so I could see her looking at me (over her friend) in my peripheral vision. At this point I was thinking ""wow"", maybe there is hope. I had grown my confidence and today I decided that I was going to try to make eye contact with her. As usual I stand in my position and she stands about 3 feet away. To me, it looked like she was staring at me, so I decided to act. I didn't want to make it awkward so I looked to the left of her, and then as I turned to the right, I looked at her. I thought she was staring at me. She was just staring at something behind me (her friend I thing; or worse...a boy). There she was, chewing her gum with her mouth open, and staring at whatever was behind me (I only looked at her for about a second). I just wish she was looking at me or made eye contact with me. I realized at that moment that all the previous times where I thought she was looking at me, she was most likely looking at something else (my peripheral vision deceived me). That one moment ruined my whole day. The bell rang and I left the classroom without even checking her in my peripheral vision. 

I'm now at home typing this and I'm so depressed and stressed out. This girl is taking up my whole mental capacity, and I can't focus on schoolwork. The last time I felt like this about a girl was back in freshman year of high school (the girl from freshman year left in sophomore year, and I still sometimes think of her now as a senior). I wish so badly that I could read her mind just to know if she likes me. I wouldn't even be mad if she doesn't (it would end this mental torture). If she does like me then I can make the effort to show that I like her and maybe even approach her. From what I've seen, she doesn't get a lot of attention from guys, but I'm most likely mistaken as she literally looks like Demi Lovato (not exactly but she's on that attraction level). I just need some advice, tips, anything please. Am I over exaggerating? Could she be interested in a guy like me who's dirt in comparison to her? Is there any hope?",01Nov2019,0
36,"It's 2AM where I live and I should have been home since 11PM but two of the trains I could have catched have been cancelled so I had to take the last one that didn't drive all the way to my town.

37,Some stuff between my girlfriend and me have been going on... She doesn't see a future for us. I don't know if I should give up or fight for us. I've been working 3 jobs to make our future possible. It's a long distance relationship and she lives across the country. Family thinks I shouldn't give up. I feel exhausted just because we've been long distance for 5 years. She recently meet my family and came for her first time.( I've been there. 3 times) She says if I move it's like she's forced to be with me. I don't want her to be forced but I feel like she doesn't give me the opportunity to find out if this can work by us finally being close by. I understand i haven't always been responsible I'm just afraid of not being with her. I hate talking about my feelings to strangers and learning about people. It's boring they always get bored of me too I don't understand what to do. Do I give up and find someone else? Are people even single? I feel like people date to just have someone.,01Nov2019,1

42,"Hey there /r/Advice

I was wondering if anyone has a lot of knowledge of alternate means of watching local channels outside of like say, Spectrum. My Grandmother wants to switch since they keep raising the price on her, but I can never seem to find something that appeals to her. I tried Hulu, but her SmartTV didn't do the livestream thing. Couldn't find an option for it, and she had to keep using her remote to login which was a very tedious process.

Mainly she wants to watch her favorite local channels livestreamed on TV. Though I can't seem to find one for her to be able to settle on. If anyone can give me suggestions, that'd be great. That or previous/current experience with anything that falls in the category that I'm looking for. Thank you in advance!",01Nov2019,1
43,"My mom is a smoker, has been for since I before I was born. Last year mid October I made a bet with her, one with no punishment on me but it was about her. She had to stop smoking by November 1st giving her a year rounded to the nearest month. If she failed she owes me $200. She agreed. 

Fast forward to this October I told once it hits midnight after Halloween she has to stop. She agreed, now today she says she has until we wake up next morning and she could smoke after midnight. She also tried to stop from counting her cigarettes to make sure they don’t disappear. 

It’s less than 4 hours left and I’m thinking She’s gonna lose. I don’t want that $200 I want her to stop so I can see my mom make it out of her 60’s. I also think when she loses I’m not getting this money. I honestly don’t know what to do I can’t do anything I’m 15 so I can’t hold much over her. I know not to stress which is why I’m in my room not trying to argue (not that O even want to.) the main question I have is, how can I make sure she doesn’t fail? And side question if she fails how can I make her accountable and get her to pay up?",01Nov2019,1
44,"i don’t know why i feel so eager to just finish community college. i feel it’s partially from society and i kinda want to move into the next chapter of my life. i’m also a year behind in math bc i did my senior year of HS online. 
i’m in my 3rd semester but i honestly won’t finish my degree until fall or spring 2021 (probably fall 2022). 
but anyways, i’m going for an associates degree in physics (i need to take 4 math courses). and i’m in precalc 1 currently so it’ll take me awhile to fulfill my math which is ok bc either school i’m planning on going requires 4 math courses. 
butttttttt since i feel so pressured to finish CC soon, im second guessing my degree and thought about biology bc if i go with that degree i can graduate from CC earlier. 
the only downside and why that isn’t the smartest idea is bc my interests mostly fall under fields relating to aeronautical things or are space related. 
and biology wouldn’t rly set me in the field i’d initially plan on going into. 

ii don’t know what to do and i feel so bleh bc i wanna leave CC but i know it’ll take me at least 2 more years or so. i know CC is diverse and a lot of ppl don’t finish their 2 year degree in 2 years which is totally fine and normal. 
i don’t know why i’m stressing. 
i also don’t know where the hell im gonna transfer to and classes next semester all depend on where i’m planning to go and i can’t make that commitment or decision rn and i’m freaking out. my body is sore bc of how stressed i been in the past week and i didn’t do any classwork today bc i just need some downtime and i feel guilty i slacked today but ughdjdfjfjdj

what do i do and what advice do y’all have????? has anyone else took some time in CC, how and when did you decide where you were gonna transfer? how long did it take you to finish ur associates degree? 
should i keep working towards a degree in physics? or take the easy route and go with the biology (since i have most classes required already taken). 

 i’m a hardworker and always do more work than i need and i think is hilarious i’m going for a degree that’s math heavy when i wasn’t good with math in HS, things rly do come around. but i’m doing surprisingly decent so far.
AHH anyways lmk y’alls advice. sorry for typing so much. i wish i had a friend or family member to talk to about this but i don’t have anyone eeek 
thank u for taking the time to read this and possibly reply back if u do. i appreciate it so much.",01Nov2019,1

Post says it all, I am messy. I have a really, really hard time cleaning. My house was always a DISASTER growing up, and as an adult it’s been cleaner so I have always justified it. I’m 25 and have a 4 year old daughter. Her mom and I split for a lot of reasons about 2 years ago. But I’d be lying if I said my cleanliness wasn’t a huge factor. I used to not clean a lot let dishes stack up garbage get out of control. Now I’m better and surface cleaning, but the house gets messy, the kitchen gets really dirty the bathroom gets out of control. It almost snowballs then becomes a disaster and I have to spend hours cleaning. I’m really trying I am, but I didn’t even wash a wall until last year, and now with the little one living with me full time things get out of control kinda fast. I’m stressed, has anyone dealt with this? I don’t even know how to start getting on track with this. I just want to have one of those nice clean houses like normal people.

50,"Sorry if this isn’t the right sub for this. Basically I’m a 17 yr old female and this summer I happened to work somewhere with a 34 yr old man. It should be noted that it was only us and the boss (who was gone a lot) that working there so we had to be alone a lot.

Right off the bat he asked me questions about myself, my interests, my family. He always complimented my personality/looks. He eventually started making excuses to see me outside of work. (That sounds bad out loud I’ll explain). He worked at a College also and asked to give me a tour since I’m applying to colleges. Also, I play basketball and he managed the gym at the College so he told me to come week nights and he’d practice with me. I did these things naively thinking he was being nice/helping me look at colleges and practice basketball.My mom knew all about this and thought he was normal and nice. 

It started getting weird. He’d compare me to his girlfriend and take pictures of me on his phone and tell me to “do a spin.” He’d ask me to travel to other countries w/ him and call me things like “babygirl.” But I still had to work with him and thought he had good intentions. Then one night I went to play basketball with him and he closed the gym early so we were alone. This made me uncomfortable. He told me I’d be the perfect wife and he could see us getting married in 3 years when I’m older and more mature sexually. He asked me to promise to eat healthy/work out to keep my body nice for him. He was also moving soon so he told me to promise I’ll never forget him. At this point, I was extremely uncomfortable and rejected him. I told him I’m only 17 and he said that’s almost 18 and I’m very mature for my age. I had to work with him for a few more weeks til he moved but I didn’t let myself be alone with him anymore. He continued to stare at me, take pics of me, and make weird comments like how our kids would look. I didn’t tell anyone besides my mom and she didn’t do anything except tell me not to tell my dad.

I have a confusing and unpleasant social life, and I can't figure out what is wrong. Ever since I started growing into a teen, I've grown aware of how little friends I had, and how unpopular I was. I've gone to great lengths to dress better, brush my hair every day, take care of my skin, act more outgoing and help people actively. But throughout my school life, I've never felt respected or cared about by anybody.
I feel like I'm always the odd one who doesn't matter, always forgotten. I have very few friends, and girls in my class will exchange glances when I speak as if I'm weird and don't deserve to talk. I'm introverted and a bit awkward, but I try to just smile and be nice to make up for it. 
But everyday I just feel irrelevant, and some days I question whether I even exist. Every time I feel confident in my looks or personality, the feeling disappears during the day when I realize people aren't treating me any better.

During about the middle of our relationship he began to watch porn while I performed oral sex on him. He didn’t ask me how I felt about it but at the time I didn’t mind much. He then began to do it while we had sex. This on the other hand made me feel horrible and very turned off. We would literally be in the middle of sex and he would grab his phone and play his videos. Not to be graphic but I would be in doggy position and he literally had the phone positioned on my butt. This happened a few times before I spoke up about it. He apologize and said he wouldn’t do it again. Although when I give him oral he still watches it. And I once caught him watching it after we spoke. He’s always following these hot Instagram models on Instagram. Likes their photos. When we are in person together he looks at other women and even once made a comment under his breathe.

62,"Hi, I have a close friend who is in one of my classes. She is very devoted to school work and having high grades, but she’s been especially stretched this year.

She also drinks very little water, and usually eats very little food. She, while a top 3% GPA student, is very anxious, stressed, and overworked, and it’s already noticeably burning her out (yes it’s barely 2 months into the school year).

I was laid off about a month ago because it was a seasonal job, but have money saved and looking for another job, but not really stressing since I have plenty saved. So I looked at an apartment today I really liked, in a town nearby my parents house with job opportunities close. I would have it to myself, and it’s month to month so i wouldn’t feel stuck if I didn’t like it. Now I have the option to move about 3 hours away to live with my brother, we get along great, and I’m certain I would enjoy living with him, he really wanted me to move in. His house isn’t the nicest, the kitchen is tiny, and he is in the process of renovating. He also has friends over a lot, which I get along with all of them but might get annoying after a while. The job market in his area is good, I would be able to find something easily. I have a new boyfriend who lives about 5 hours from me now, but if I moved to my brothers we would be 3 hours from each other, he works a lot so I don’t know if we would be able to see each other more often being closer anyways. Both places would be the same in rent. I just feel conflicted about what to do especially since the apartment was so nice, but I may be happier living with my brother. I have never lived by myself before and might feel lonely. I don’t know if this is the correct sub but wanted to get opinions.

64,"I have a friend. They are very polite to me (and pretty much everyone for that matter) and we have never fought. At first they were very active in the friendship. They would ask if i wanted to do stuff and contact me first. But recently,  in the last month, they have been less active in the friendship and I now feel like it is an one-sided friendship. They are usually super apologetic about it even though I have mentioned nothing about it. 

I know that they are busy with their other social life. I understand that there must be balance but I feel like a nonpriority since they cant make any time for me. I am wondering if I should be upfront about how I feel about the direction of the friendship. I dont want to put effort into a friendship that is onesided if it wont change. However, I afraid that I am being too entitled in asking for more.",01Nov2019,2
65,"I got a pet rabbit this past September for my birthday.  They have always been my favorite animal and always wanted one for my own. I had the opportunity to get one for my birthday and of course i said yes...i was told they were like guinea pigs which i’ve had one before. And then i’ve only had a few hamsters and a fish. I have a bad habit of being impulsive and not thinking things through, i was just so excited to finally have a pet after many years of not having one. 

but i got him, and he requires more tlc than i can handle, on top of that, i don’t even have much space for him to run around and stuff like i thought. i’m 19 and still live with my dad in a rented townhouse. he doesn’t allow the rabbit in any part of the house besides my room and my room is small. he’s in his cage most of the time because i have work and school , then during the evening i let him out of his cage to run around, hold him and pet him for about two or three hours before i need to go to sleep. 

i know this is wrong, i feel so guilty and dumb for doing this to a poor innocent animal. i mean, he’s healthy. he’s very energetic, i give him all the fresh hay food and water he needs. i guess what really is getting to me is that he doesn’t have the adequate space for him to run around and get enough exercise. i want him to live a good, happy life and i feel like i don’t provide it well enough for him. so i wanted to surrender him to my animal shelter in hopes a family that does have space for him will adopt him and give him a better life than i can. i made a dumb, impulsive decision and i wish i could tell Mars im sorry and i love him. i just want some other people’s thoughts on this because i really do care about his wellbeing. 

also, i’ve already seen if some other people around me would be able to take him in but they all own cats and dogs and they don’t seem too comfortable or they simply do not want a pet.",01Nov2019,1
69,"I'm a 16-year-old girl and I have had real crushes on three people at this point. Two guys and a girl- asked all of them out, rejected every time. The first boy I had only really liked because I thought he liked me- he was the first guy I was ever really friends with.

In comes my current situation.

This kid, I'm gonna call him Alex, is in my class and since I met him beginning of the year, I've just thought he's really cool.  He made a snap chat group chat for the class and consistently sends related memes he makes. I love his sense of humor.

Today, being Halloween, we had a class party and most people dressed up. Alex and his friend decided to dress up together as what they called 'potassium overload.' Basically a banana costume with a cloak and hockey mask. It was hilarious in person. From now just keep in mind everyone in the class is pretty friendly with each other since we all have to work together every day.

We were playing two truths and a lie. One of my truths involved the girl I asked out. Went like this:

Alex: wait, did you say a girl you were impressing?

Me: yeah I like girls and guys, y'all really think I'm completely straight? (I have bright purple hair and shaved sides I mean that's kind of stereotypically not straight girl material)

He was genuinely surprised to hear that and reacted way more than anyone else in the room who had not previously known my sexuality. But I think I may be overreacting to this.

Then, as I'm packing up my backpack to leave class, he walks over to me and

Alex: Marry me right now

Me: lol what

Alex: girls in red jackets are very attractive to bananas like me (my costume was a ringleader)

Now may I say that although my class is constant group projects, I've never done one with Alex. There's no pre-existing thing to imply that this interaction was normal. So I would like to ask now if anyone can tell me the perspective of a teenage boy and if I should believe he might like me because I'm catching feelings and I don't want to if I'm reading it wrong.

Or anyone else, advice on a proper way to react to this situation? What if it happens again?",01Nov2019,1

She has refused money from me because she knows I don’t have much money, but I truly feel like her life could be completely changed with a few hundred dollars.

Just to give a little bit of info while keeping it short, I come from an ok family environment, not very great but it could be a lot worse.

I have an ok self image, not 100% comfortable with myself but when i think about it I wouldnt wanna be anyone else. So theres that. 
All in all, I really want to be a better person. Im an introvert, and things i really value are humor and being calm and not stressing the little things. I want to be able to be myself more naturally and comfortably, I want to not worry about what others think, I wanna be kind to people and give off a vibe that people enjoy being around, I want to have more humor in my life without forced jokes or laughs, and I wanna be able to let things go. 
More simply said, I wanna be better at being myself and include things important to me (listed above) in myself. Also, if you have anything about completely detaching from an ex, id appreciate it.

One reason I want to see her as I generally do believe she loves me and cares for me and I also want a relationship with her as I think any normal child would want to the reason I think she does care is that on a supervised contact with her I got a glance at her Facebook name and I thought let’s have a look I know it may be creepy but considering I haven’t seen her personal lifefor 7 years I was interested and it was full off pictures when I was younger with my  younger brother and sister 


However also on the Facebook page the boyfriend she had who physically abused me for about 3 years was on it too still and the latest post was in 2016 and I went in care around 2013 which massively worries me as I want nothing to do with him ever again and I’m also worried if I do make contact with her it will be in Manchester as she lives there which is ironically where the guy who abused me grew up and I’m not 100% sure he is there but it seems to much off a coincidence 

However credit to my mum she has attended every single contact for 7 years and even though she is unemployed and is very poor still puts in a effort to get me birthday and Christmas presents 

However also on her Facebook page they where multiple posts off how social workers work for bonuses not for children and also about how they have stolen her children which is ridiculous as to be fair I have been in the same placement with the same Forster careers for 7 years so my experience off social services has been very good 

I also know if I don’t make the effort to see her when I leave care I have a feeling I will regret it completely but if I did make a effort and the guy who abused me is with her I will effectively be on my own with the guy who abused my sister brother and me for a few years I’m so confused on what to do please help

86,"Hey everyone,

Background: I have this friemeny in college. She literally makes my life a living hell and has been absolutely horrible to me and my friends. The best way I can describe her is that she is Regina George from mean girls. I can't escape her because we are the same major and I'm president of a club while she is vice president. I do my best to keep things civil for my last year in college. We are both going into the medical field (great).

Issue: We are in this class (a level 400 class) together and we use these things called iclickers for attendance. When we are there, you click in and that counts for attendance. It is worth 10% of our grade. She has only shown up to class twice (both days for the exam). She has someone else click in for her. In the syllabus it states that having someone else click in for you is considered cheating and will be handled as such (meaning she will automatically fail the class).

I get having a friend click in for you one or twice a semester. Life happens. But everyday is a issue and I personally think it isn't fair. Part of me wants to inform the professor and the other part of me doesn't.

Why I don't want to tell: By telling, it will go on her academic record which can ruin her chances of getting into medical school. She will fail this class which means she will have to take a whole another year of college since we need this class to graduate. If she finds out it was me, she might go out of her way to make my life even wrose.

Why I want to tell: This isn't fair to the students who actually show and work hard in this class. It is 10% of a grade that she literally put no effort into which is the difference between an A and an B. Cheating is morally wrong and not a good value for a future doctor. I personally wouldn't want to be seen by a doctor who cheated their way to a degree  

Overall: I am pretty conflicted on what to do. I also don't know how I would bring this up to the professor. 

I am sorry for any mistakes. I am a sleep deprived college student who is typing this instead of studying.",01Nov2019,1

88,"So, for a little bit of backstory, I’m fresh into college. I’m not trying to flex or anything (as I didn’t work for the money myself) but I inherited a large sum of money so I’m able to pay off debt and I am currently living in a small 2 person house. Since I’m new to college, I have been trying to meet new friends because I moved far from my relatively small home town. I have met a few people, made a few friends, but a couple months ago I ended up making friends with this weird guy. He is what I imagine all the weebs and furries I hear about to look like irl. He is kinda greasy and has bad acne and is super odd. He is really bad at talking to people and never knows what to say, which makes things awkward fast. But I felt bad for him because I was super awkward most of my high school life, so I decided to make friends with him. After talking to him for 2 weeks I realized it he was super painful to be around and made me very uncomfortable. He was very edgy and kept making jokes like “haha fuck women they are whores amirite” and I started to talk to him less and less. He would still contact me all the same though, often having conversations with himself because I would ignore his texts. Three weeks ago I met a girl who I’ve been dating, it’s been going pretty well but the weird dude found out. He texts me all the time saying that my girlfriend is a bitch and is stopping me from hanging out and gaming with him. Obviously this upset me so I argued with him over text, eventually blocking him on discord and my phone because he was pissing me off. Two weeks ago he showed up at my house at about 10:00 pm. I let him in because I felt bad, it was cold and I don’t truly think he is a bad person. He acted like nothing had changed, and it was awkward but he left early in the morning at 1:50 am. After that he kept visiting at night or in the morning at random times, almost every night. I let him in two more times after the first time and let him stay the night the last time. I woke up for work the next day with a discord message from him. He said the discord chat reminded him my girlfriend is a bitch. I was so fucking confused and freaked out because I blocked him and I have a password on my phone. I soon realized I have the thumb print recognition enabled. I think he snuck into my room while I was asleep and unlocked my phone and unblocked himself. I confronted him about this and he claimed he didn’t do it, and that I’m a liar and unblocked him myself. I told him enough in enough and blocked him for good. I was done and was not letting him over again. But he keeps showing up, banging and yelling at my door. Sometimes he leaves messages on notebook paper telling me my girlfriend is a whore and that I need to let him in. I toss the notes and sometimes have to hide because he comes when I’m awake. Yesterday night he broke into my house, I don’t know how so don’t ask me. He left a note on my dinner table saying the usual shit and clogged my toilet using my washcloths. I don’t know what to do, and I genuinely think he isn’t a bad guy just maybe has something wrong with him. I want to get him help but honestly I’m scared of him a bit. I plan to get a new lock for my door today. Any advice on how I could get him to stop. I don’t want him arrested or anything but I’m thinking about confronting him one of these nights.",01Nov2019,1

96,"A little background, about 10 years ago, anytime I would have to do public speaking, I would have an anxiety attack. My heart would pound, my voice would get shaky, and I would talk so fast and run out of breathe each time. 

There has been highs and lows through out this 10 year span. Sometimes I would deliver a successful speech with no panic attack and I would think I’m “cured.” Other times would be very embarrassing where I am constantly having shortness of breath and can’t finish two sentences. 

It’s hard for me to believe it’s “in my head.” However, it’s effected my life so much and I have definitely lost so many great opportunities because of this, as this led to my social anxiety. 

I have tried therapy and my counselor at college. Both gave me the same answer “practice.” Easier said than done. 

I have come to the conclusion that it has to do with my breathing. I have started diaphragmatic breathing; however, I’m having trouble incorporating it into my speech. When I speak, I feel like I’m holding air in and not exhaling.

100,"Hello everyone who took the time to read this. For some background Im a 17 year old in between highschool and college, im currently waiting for winter quarter to start and thought that a paid internship would be nice in the meantime so i went to a local job center and got a data entry internship where upon entering into my first day i noticed many red flags which i will give to you in list form.

- unorganized tasks
- a large amount of equipment such as phones and computers not working.
- scolding me for not picking u the phone although there is no phone at my desk.
- though i didnt mind being busy they kept shovelling work onto me.
- a creepily homogenized work environment.
- and lastly one of the bosses cursing and screaming at someone over the phone for approximately three hours.

I was not informed on what my job was despite asking several times and although they kept telling me i was doing a ""good job"" i couldn't help but think of all the red flags that appeared in such a short amount of time but i have to meet with my counselor at the job center after i informed her that i dont want to continue being there, am i justified in leaving? 

TL;DR - There were too many red flags and i felt uncomfortable there so i left, am i justified for leaving?",01Nov2019,2

105,"Hey guys,

I make this honestly due to my own frustration and depression. First a summary. So I found a great 2005 Toyota Camry. Bought it and was about to drive it out of the lot to head home. Well a bus stops at its stop on my left and im trying to turn left. I look around as I pull a bit into the lane past the side walk to make sure I can get into the middle lane safely. I do not see anyone that I could not make it past by the time I get the middle lane. So I go full in and try to get the middle lane after checking and out of almost nowhere a White Ford Truck crashes into me T-boning me. Well I very much reel at the experience because I have never been in an accident ever and am a very safe and cautious driver. So I reverse back into the lot and just sit there cursing my existence because me and my wife had been saving up for a good reliable car after our last one screwed us over. The dealer helps me out and we do all the exchange of info etc. The car was totaled but ironically could still ""drive"". Just the whole driver side was smashed in while mr white ford drove away shortly after with only a dent in his front part which the dealer helped take care of. While im lementing everything since it was so much money to us and I just go and smash it. We look at the footage the dealer has and we see the truck come speeding up (looks way faster than the other vehicles) and smashes into me with barley any braking and no honking. So the rest of the day has been depression and total shut down of all motivation and confidence. I am compltely destroyed on the inside because this car was supposed to be mostly for my wife since she drives more and I could not even do this to support her right. I honestly hope even though I didnt have full coverage and had barley registered the vehicle that something good can come of this. But I just cant hope for anything anymore, besides this other really bad things happened this week and this honestly has been the worst week ever in my life. Honestly dont know what im expecting of this conversation, just felt the need to share. Luckily (I guess) all I got out of the experience was a big monetary loss and a sore and swollen neck along with a nice seat belt bruise. Still very shaken after the experience.",01Nov2019,1

A bit about me first, I’m 18M, Caucasian and from Europe. 

I have never had a paying job and only a couple hundred hours of the same volunteer position. 

I have been trying to get a job or atleast an interview since I was 16. Jobs are limited in my city right now even if you have a degree. 
I have had 1 group interview with around 150 people invited for 4 positions. Needless to say I didn’t get the job. 

On Monday I have a my first ever 1 on 2 interview at a semi local store. It’s a family owned Italian/European Specialty store. Only place in the city where you can get those products type of specialty. 

I have literally zero experience or idea of what to expect on Monday and I’m freaking out. 

There was a pre screen/interview conversation over the phone and the woman seemed slightly impressed with my answers. 
The position is pretty much the EXACT same thing I did volunteering. 

When asked which of their 3 Main Believes (?) of Respect, Loyalty or Honesty is most important I answered I believe all three to be important because you can’t have one without the other. 

Right after that I got invited for an interview, so I guess I did something right ? Or she like my answer ?
I also picked the first date and time for an interview that I was asked if it works. 


I’m just looking for advice on what they might ask or what it’s like when I get there. What can I expect ?

I really need this job even if it’s just shift based but atleast I can add it to my resume and have a bit of experience. 
I’m also getting my license and have a car that’s leaking that I need to pay for to fix, plus I need to pay University next year. And it would be nice to just be able to get out of the house with friends once in a while. And since there’s a girl I’ve been wanting to ask out for a while.........

So simply put I really need this job. 
So what can I do to land the job or increase my chances of landing it ?

I’m planning on being a few minutes, fresh clothes, showered, shaved and all the personal hygiene stuff. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated.",01Nov2019,0

111,"-- Content Warning. Mentions of past suicidal thoughts, eating disorder mention. Do not read this if you could be triggered by mentions of possible r*pe. I'm so sorry if this hurts anyone, it is not my intention. --

Please help me. I am so freaked out right now and I don't know what to do.

I am a 16 year old girl. I just found some notebooks that I drew and wrote in from when I was around eight years old and the content is highly disturbing. I was messed up. I don't know how it happened, and to be honest I don't remember much from that time. I am starting to get worried that someone may have done something to me when I was little. I remember always being a little messed up, I used to come up with perverted scenes to play out with my dolls and I was aware of sexual things since before starting kindergarten. I've always been somewhat suspicious that something may have happened, but I barely have memories of anything that happened before high school at this point. Probably because of dissociation but that's beyond the point.

I also found suicide and gory scenes in the notebook, and weird kink content (bondage, also forced and non consensual acts) that I didn't think I even knew about at the time. Also, I probably didn't even 'know' that it was suicide. I had written crude stories starring myself and in each one (that I read, I couldn't even finish going through the notebook) I killed myself at the end of the story. I've always been depressed and super self conscious and all sorts of garbage. I also had a handful of identity crises about my gender and sexuality starting from when I was 11. 

What should I do? I obviously still live in a house with my parents, should I destroy the notebook? I don't know how to hide it. Also, should I go to therapy or something? I almost committed suicide last year… I thought I was getting better but lately I've been feeling really down. I've been on multiple waiting lists for therapy that will accept my insurance for two years now. My parents keep calling and they still won't take me. I don't want them to worry and I didn't tell them how bad it is, so they aren't really doing much. I also ended up sort of getting an eating disorder recently and I've lost nearly 30 pounds. Honestly it's not that bad and I feel fine but I don't want anyone to know. God I'm so paranoid right now. I don't want then to find the notebook. I couldn't even finish looking through it… it is absolutely disgusting. I honestly can't believe it. I was eight. 

I really am not exaggerating when I say how awful it is. I don't want to go into detail but it is one of the most vile things I've ever looked through. I have a very high tolerance for this kind of stuff, honestly too high. But this crossed the line. And especially considering I was so young when I made it. 

I can't trust my family to not look through it, if they find it I don't know what I will do. How can I get rid of it without anyone finding out?

I'm so scared. Am I messed up? What should I do? Please leave me some advice, even if it is something small. I am so lost and honestly terrified right now.",01Nov2019,2

Recently, one of my friends got a job somewhere. He was excited, as it was his first job, so of course he's gonna talk about it. He kept sending messages in our chat about it and I made a joke about how ""we get it dude you have a job just shut up about it already"" which I know sounds rude, but it's nothing out of the ordinary of what my friends and I say to each other on a daily basis. I thought it would get a quick laugh or something and we would just kinda move on, but apparently not.

My friends spent the next day just asking me why I ""can't let people enjoy themselves"" or why ""I can't just let people be happy for themselves"" and I just didn't know what to do. I apologized and all that and decided to move on from it. A few days later, the same friend was making jokes about how he was the best player at a game we play, normal stuff. I then made a joke about how I was the best player, and apparently that was a dick move. My friends got really mad at me again  and it just got out of hand. It has gotten to the point where when I say anything or make any joke about something, I get told off about how I'm being a total dickhead. I've tried being the bigger man and apologizing, trying to talk to them about it and all that, but it just doesn't work. I basically just have to sit in the call and not make any jokes or anything because I'll get told off for it, but it just doesn't feel right.

118,"I [20F] have been working at my current job for a little over a year now, and while I do occasionally enjoy it, I’m at a crossroads. Being a full-time student, I have the option to go to school and either work on the weekends, or pursue the sport I love the most. Now, I am possibly facing an opportunity to get back full swing into said sport.

Thing is, it’s a family owned restaurant, and a very (10 servers total) tight knit group. My boyfriends mom is the manager, my boyfriend is apart of the kitchen staff, and the owner is a close family friend. Since working there I’ve built up quite the rapport with the owner, and the other staff as well. Unfortunately, I think we may be a bit understaffed right now, and management could use some work, but I miss my sport so bad.

So, assuming my meeting with my coach goes well (wish me luck), how would I appropriately approach quitting/giving my two week notice? I’d like to be able to work over breaks and occasional weekends if they need the help, but I don’t want to sound expectant of accommodations. How do I correctly go about this, so as to keep my relationship with the owner, the manager (this one ESPECIALLY) a positive one, and still make sure my needs are met?

127,"For reference, my sister is 16 and in high school while I’m 21 and graduated in 2016. I’ve never been to college. I’ve been enrolled, taken the placement tests, applied for financial aid - but never done classes or gotten beyond any of that.

In 2016 I was enrolled. I was geared up and ready to go, thinking of what I wanted to do and what classes I’d pick. Then in June, 10 days before I graduated, my great grandmother had a stroke. She lived, but within the month her husband had kicked me out of the house I lived in with them. I ended up not going through with college because between scrambling for a place to live, losing most of my great grandmother, and the stress of being newly graduated, I couldn’t handle it.

In 2017 I got weight loss surgery, so I couldn’t go that fall as I was recovering. I applied for spring 2018 and got farther than the year before. I took the placement tests, I even picked a few classes out. I was finally doing it. But I had no help - my family had never been to college so I had no clue what I was doing. I didn’t know how financial aid worked or anything about deadlines. By the time I got it done I had to pay for everything out of pocket until my financial aid came in - money I did not have. I had to “drop out” before classes even started. I once again felt defeated, because I was ready. I just wasn’t financially ready. I was sexually assaulted within a month of that, so I was horrendously depressed and didn’t bother thinking of college for a while.

Now, I’m ready mentally but I’m waiting to catch up financially, and hoping to save up for classes in 2020. I had my excess skin removed this fall so I currently have no savings (lol go me!) but I’m hoping that after income tax time I’ll be in the position to go. I’m trying to be patient with myself but my sister is making it very hard.

You see, my sister is a bitch. I mean that endearingly, as like she’s a teenager and doesn’t grasp how much she’s hurting me - but she is. And I’ve told her. I cry every time she makes a sly comment about me not going to college, yet she still does it. Tonight I was venting to my mom about my current lack of money as I’m in the process of switching car insurances, and she thought to slip in “you would be less broke if you actually got an education” and it’s like why? Why are you beating me when I’m clearly down? I also feel like she has no clue how the real world works, and that when I was her age I thought I’d transition right from high school to college, no thoughts of money or life involved. I don’t know if it’s just ignorance or if she’s truly being downright nasty to me.

So I don’t even know what to do. I want to go so bad, but even if I could tomorrow - I have no clue how. I don’t know anything beyond what I’ve done, and even that I have no clue how I did it. I don’t know how college works. I don’t know how you get grants, or in contact with your advisor, or what blackboard is - everything is new and confusing to me.

I currently am in my freshman year of college, I’m going for nursing. I thought it would be a good field to get into but this stuff just doesn’t interest me. All throughout my senior year of Hs, I debated on going into college for teaching (history teacher) or nursing. I picked nursing because the pay was better, but now I’m thinking about switching to teaching. I spoke to someone of my previous teachers and they all try to push me away from teaching, besides 1 of them. But no matter how much they tell me to try and stay away, I still have that desire deep inside to go into it. But I’m worried that I won’t be able to afford the family I want in the future? I love history, all aspects of it and I love school and I really want to be a highschool teacher. I’m just worried that this will set me up for a “bad” life in my future. I was hoping to get some advice from any teachers on what they think. My one teacher also told me, he would give me all of his stuff for teaching since he’s retiring in 2-3 years. Also the school I want to teach at (my former hs) doesn’t have a lot of funding so the pay would be some what low (I believe around 30-35k to start). Nearly all the history teachers at that school will be retiring within the next 5 years (besides 1), which would give me the opportunity to pick up classes I like such as world war 2, American history, government etc. so again any opinions or advice?

Please try to give me logical and emotional reasoning don’t just say “follow your dreams”, please if you do follow up on it as to why",01Nov2019,2

From what I read online it might be a light tear of tissues, in this case I should take ibuprofen and it should go away within days or weeks.

142,"Please allow me to preface this:  While it's not my intention to disparage or dishearten others that are avid astrologers, I personally don't believe in the veracity of Tarot readings, astrology, etc.

I've developed an addiction to watching/listening to Tarot Readings via YouTube, and am seeking advice to break this ASAP.

My Wife was deeply into astrology, and conducted Tarot Readings, reiki sessions, etc. regularly for the general public.  She passed in 2016, and it's been a really tough three years.  Over these last few years, I was not a patron for any of it - While I didn't believe in it, I viewed it fondly through my the lens of our relationship and preferred to keep it at a healthy, nostalgic distance.

I forced myself to date for the first time since her death a year ago this month, and it didn't end well.  Additionally, I could count the number of friends I know in this city on one hand, and spend most of my 33 yr old existence working, and coming home alone.  Somehow, I picked up a tarot reading on YouTube about four months ago, and since then I've spent numerous hours listening to them, across many channels/readers.

I feel like some combination of not just wanting dialog with a friend, but even deeper counsel with a trusted friend - as well as the overarching themes of 'this will be your best month yet,' or 'it's been tough but not for nothing' make it insidiously hard to stop.  I think they've become my emotional lodestar.  Although logically I could never believe their purported machinations, I (want) to believe because that might mean things can and/or will get better in life.

Does anyone have advise they could share on how to stop this?  In the long run, I know they've been emotionally taxing, and the habit itself exhausting.  Thanks!",01Nov2019,1

146,"Hey guys, I've been under intense stress lately and it's really because of my mother. I hate to say that because I do love her, she is my mother. Yet, I want to lay out my story for advice on what I should do, or if I'm just overexaggerating.

I'm the oldest (19) of all my siblings, one full (16), two half (13, 8).

Here's my story, I guess. There's plenty more, but here are some hi-lights?

When I was young, my mother divorced my father. I haven't had any contact with him since I was around the age of four. This was fine, I've heard the stories about him and my mother ran off with him around the age of twenty to move out of her parent'ss house, turns out he was abusive and didn't even claim my (16) sibling. When they were together she kept all his money for him and managed everything. They fought a lot around me and my sister who were often left to be yelled at and punished for practically existing. 

It was only a matter of months before she was married to my stepfather, who I know is a narcissist, or at least a liar with a big ego. Both of them have very different personalities outside of the house than inside. 

My stepfather was emotionally abusive, calling me names, yelling at me, wishing things onto me to my face. Calling me stupid, etc. This only progressed when I was getting towards middle school. I know this had some sort of effect on me as I was having self-harming thoughts beginning in the fourth grade. My mother would always take his side and punish me for trying to ruin her marriage. 

I was also an AIG student, but only in reading. This made her standards go very high and I was ridiculed whenever I brought less than a B home, yet my sisters were rewarded for C's and up. This caused me to oh so much stress.

We lived in a very strict household during those times and I did what any rebellious middle schooler would do, come home and sleep immediately after school let out of pure contempt for life. It was around this time when my dreams became stupid. My art, which I've always loved to draw was stupid and ugly and I needed to study more, my dream job was ridiculed ECT. (But they support all of my sister's lovey dreams.)  I was fat and needed to lose weight even when my doctor had told me I was at a good weight. This made me hate myself and to this day I still have those feelings.

She never let me spend the night with friends and always told me what my friends really thought about me, and how they weren't really my friend. 

I'm seventh grade, I was beginning to question my sexuality and had pulled my Mother to the side for it. I explained my feeling while she ignored me reading her book with the shirtless guy on the cover. Of course,, she told me that I was stupid, shut up, I just haven't found the right person yet. I should have seen it coming. That was one of the last times I went to her for anything private. Which she brings up, because ""I'm so secretive and don't tell her anything, I must not trust her.""

Around eighth grade she kicked him out of the house for, drugs, pawning our things for money and ""reasons"". I prefer not to say. I was happy and expected things to get better. Keep in mind I found the rest of the things she was doing to be normal at this time.

For the ~year,, he was gone, I was tormented with long periods of her not talking to me, leaving me out of things and out of the blue yelling at me for being the cause of her sadness. I told her that it was better for everyone that he wasn't here because he was toxic in general and she said I was the only one miserable and he never did anything to me. I explained to her, in tears, that he had caused me to hate myself and that he wasn't a good person and she wouldn't speak to me. 

At my last check-up, my mum always made sure she had to be in the room with me, even when I was 18. The doctor asked about theirhad filled out and said my answers were concerning. She asked me if I wanted to start speaking to a therapist. My eyes shot over to my mum, I felt like I needed too but I was ashamed. She began to laugh and said I was fineif anyone needed a therapist it was her because I didn't have any stress, blah blah blah. 

This was also the time parents were pressured into getting their kids learning permits for driving and my mother was first in line to sign me up because she knew I would pass. After I had passed the tests and gotten my permit, she never allowed me to drive always giving me excuses. I still can't drive because of that. She says it's fine because she can drive me anywhere I need to go. Yeah right.

It was quiet around the house, other than my half-siblings and my mother laughing and being a family, but I assumed I was going to try and pick up the pieces. That it was just going to take time. 

I begged her to let me get a job at this time and now I pay for the things I need myself, she has all the money I make go directly into her PERSONAL,  not joint bank account, and I don't even know how much I have in there as of now. She claims to be keeping up but when I ask she doesn't know. She also has every dollar I've gotten from family for Christmas/birthdays since I was born. Also, My Social security card, Birth certificate, all my papers. Which means I can't get a new one, I'm also limited by not being able to drive.

Before I knew it, he was back. I pulled my mum to the side and asked why he was back. Her response, she loved him. I'm sure it's not actually loving just not wanting to be alone but- 
I began to explain to her that the time he was around and even recently I had been having suicidal thoughts. 

Her reaction and I swear to god it was: ""I don't care. Without him, want to die.""  That has literally been etched in my brain ever since it happened. THIS WAS IN THE CAR, ALL THREE OF MY SISTERS IN THE BACK. I was at least whispering my part, but she said it, yelling at me. I look out the window, tears rolling down my face. That was one of the most hurtful things that I've ever been told. Maybe she just said it in a fit of anger, but you don't just tell someone you don't care, especially not your own child. 

After that communications between me and my immediate family ceased. But they didn't stop living it to the fullest, with me in bed almost all hours away from school they happily more time than ever together and I figured it was just to spite me. We had never been a board game or go out to the movie family but all of a sudden they were. My full sister always listened to me and felt bad, assuring me that I didn't do anything to deserve it, but I was just confused about why nobody else got treated the way I did. 

That was when my aunt, who lives three hours away, offered to let me move in with her while I went to college. She told my mother had always been the way she is and hopefully, with some time away, things would get better. I was a recent graduate at the time. I said I would love too, and was pretty excited. She didn't have any kids of her own but was the cool aunt as people say. I adore her and her wife. They're incredibly kind. They offered to let me see a therapist, teach me to drive, use their old car when I get good enough and I'd have my own room. I share it with my siblings currently. Tiny house. 

When I finally, after stalling and stressing for days. She flat out said no and cut off ties with her sister. Which upset my aunt, I felt terrible because she didn't do anything but help me out. She assured me that she still wanted to help me get into college and I thanked her. Then the problems begin. 

After I had mentioned it, my mother made it hell for everyone in the house. Not buying any food, supplies or anything. She wouldn't talk to anyone and if anyone asked it was my fault, so they came to me begging me to make it right and not go to college. (This was only in the house, outside she was the sweet, perfect Mom, with her perfect kids.) Everyone in the house was begging me just not to go and stay, making me very upset.

""Just go here for college!"" They'd say. But the nearest college to me that mum approved didn't have the program I needed or anything of the sort, and she ""couldn't drive that far every day!"" So, I don't know what she kept saying. 

I applied anyway, and halfway through I needed to put in my SSN. I didn't even know that was important until a month or two ago. I asked and she got pissed, ignoring me. It took weeks of me trying to get my card before she handed me a piece of paper with it written on it. And man, I took it.

Turned in my App. With my Aunt's help and finally turned it in! I was excited and nervous as I waited to see if I was accepted. Low and behold I was, I had already told my job that I'd be leaving at the end of November and they were sad to see me go but are planning on replacing me. Most people just quit so they were happy I gave them a few months. I send a picture of my acceptance to my close friend and family and they were all happy for me. 

Until I get an email that my residency Form is about to expire and I'd need to redo it before I could even sign up for classes. No big deal. I logged on and almost finished when it said I would need my parent's SSN to prove it. I could almost feel my soul leave my body. I decided that she had probably gotten over it by now and went to ask her when she got home. She said no, and that I didn't need it. I explained thoroughly why I did and her response was. ""You're moving you don't need it."" I was about to say something when she starts fussing about after 19 years of her caring for me I'm leaving her for her sister and that I never loved her etc. Things I heard before. 

So that leads me to now. I'm days away from having to register for classes and it feels like everything has been swept out from under me. The rules were I got to live with my aunt while I was going to college and I didn't have to pay rent, she'd support me since my mother wouldn't. Without that, I'm stuck in this house. 

Where I'm always made to be the aggressive one in any argument and told to shut up, I'm always wrong, etc. It might be selfish, but I want to leave, I want to get help and go to college. :/

Please please, give me some advice or just tell me what you think. I'm anger writing so, it might be hard to read. I'd be happy to clear things up. I have never confronted my mother as I cannot confront people, it causes me a lot of anxiety and my mother knows exactly what buttons to push to make me upset and hideaway.",01Nov2019,1

150,"My friend P. has been having a myriad of her own life troubles the last year or so, I've been there to support her as much as I can. We share a mutual friend whose house is a sort of haven for her and I, they throw parties every weekend with a group of 20 or so varied friends. P. uses these parties as opportunities to drink heavily, make out with multiple strangers, and just lose herself. 

I love her, our friends love her, yet I feel like I'm the only one who seems concerned she might be overdoing the behavior. She's getting over an abusive ex of 3 years, not receiving the love of the man she is interested in, had trouble with the law, etc. I can tell she is going through something tough on a daily basis. I'm just worried that she's unknowingly abusing herself during these parties.

I guess the advice Im asking for is; Should I try to be upfront about my concern for her in a lighthearted manner, or just be a little more conscientious during her moments?",01Nov2019,1
152,"I dont have any evidence it is still happening, but she was slapped across the face infront of someone else a while ago. I also have heard he has yelled at her to the point of her crying multiple times.

I grew up in a house where physical abuse was the norm and I warned her he was creepy and I saw red flags before they dated but she ignored me.

Well, since then shes told me that he has been angry to the point of shaking to keep himself from exploding on multiple females (a teacher and a girl who's a few years younger than him). Each time she says ""I thought he was gonna punch her she was so mad"". I thought it wasnt good and could be a sign of abuse down the line but I didnt say anything.

He also gets pissed when she talks about her ex (who was emotionally abusive) to the point where she begged me to not tell him that shes dated other people, and she blocked her ex out of fear hed notice they were friends on facebook.

He also gives her impossible to hide hickeys that are absolutley awful to look at. I feel like it's a possesion thing.

I found out today that he hit her and yelled at her. I begged her when they began dating to tell me if he did something bad but she didnt. I ended our friendship two days prior due to unrelated circumstances and I regret it since I cant talk her out of it but I only know that he hit her because a mutual friend who is a reliable source told me when I was talking to them about the friendship ending.


Im thinking about talking to her tomorrow since she wanted to talk to me about the whole friend breakup. I'm going to stand my ground because I still do not wish to be her friend but I want to warn her again ""I still see red flags with (boyfriend) and I wouldn't be surprised if he hit you. I grew up around this, you need to know that if he hits you it wont only be once and you need to leave."" I dont know what to do in this situation.",01Nov2019,1
153,"Oh lord sorry, this is a lot to explain. My story focuses around two girls. One of them is named Jackie, I've been very, very close with her for around four years. The other one is named May, whom me and Jackie got close too a couple months ago. But I was very, very, very close with her. She was my shoulder to cry on for so long, and I was hers. She meant the absolute world to me as a friend. Very soon after meeting, May fell in love with Jackie. And right after that, I fell in love with May. It was a hard couple months, but it was okay because I was still very grateful for the friendship all three of us had. But, heres what has happened recently: Throughout their friendship, Jackie sort of faked an eating disorder to get sympathy from May. This went on for a while, I realized it but I didn’t say anything because I honestly just thought I was making stuff up. Eventually, Jackie admitted it to me, and I told May because I thought she deserved to know. They had a fight, and Jackie basically didn’t admit to doing anything wrong. May of course got very upset, and they aren’t really friends anymore, to which I can understand. Since then, Jackie has said she’s done some things wrong, but never really made any effort to make amends, and has moved on. May has not taken it very well, she fells really used. She’s felt the effects, both mentally and physically. Its been so tough for her, and I’ve tried to help her. Here’s where the main issue is: May can’t take me very seriously. I’m still friends with El, not to the same degree but I still talk with her. May feels so betrayed that I’m still talking with the person that hurt her so badly. I get both points to an extent, I get that I shouldn’t let May control who I’m friends with… but I would be really hurt if I were her too. And after all of this, May's really went off the deep end. She posted a picture on social media with all three of us, but scribbled Jackie's face out. This hurt Jackie a lot, and she cried for a while. After that, she was convinced that May was harassing her and told me she couldn't hang out with me/she wouldn't feel comfortable hanging out with me because I was still friends with the person ""bullying her"". So, to sum it all up both of them are demanding that I choose, but they both mean the absolute world to me. They've both messed up, and I've told some lies too. But its all been forgivable things. Now, heres the part I'm struggling with the most. Jackie is being very fake and passive aggressive with me, and we haven't talked like normal in a long time, and it really, really hurts. But what hurts even more is May. Now, because I'm still talking to Jackie, she is pretending like we're just surface friends who chat every so often. She won't really open up to me about anything anymore, and it just really hurts. I know I shouldn't be entitled to trust, but it hurts so badly that someone so close could just push me away like that. Heres the final kicker. I really still believe that I love May. And its hurting so badly. I can no longer have a normal conversation with either of them, it feels artificial from them both, and I honestly don't know how to respond 90% of the time so I'm just very quiet. Please, any help or guidance would be so appreciated. I am so lost right now, and I feel like I have no one to turn to. Thank you with love.",01Nov2019,1

156,"Hi this post is not for me but for a friend I want to help. This started about a month ago at the Restaurant we work at. It is similar to a Chick Fil A or Panera with the fact that customers come to the counter and we bring the food out to them. He is a 25 year old college student who came up to order food just like any other customer. He came in every Sunday for about 3 weeks however neither I nor my friend found this unusual  because a lot of customers come in routinely. My friend and I are 15&amp; 16 years old and this is our first job. She takes his order most of the time because she does register. I didn’t note it at the time but he would come up a couple times every visit ordering small items like a small fry then a small milkshake. He casually mentioned how he had seen her last week too and asked her what days she worked. He seemed normal and as though he was just being friendly. So she told him what days she worked. Sure enough he is back the following Sunday yet this time he does something different. When she brought his food out to him he asked her for her phone number and Instagram. Before she always saw him a nice guy but now she realized the 25 year old was most likely hitting on her. She told him “I have to bring this food out” and left without telling him. The Sunday after this he is back. She is creeped out from him because he must’ve been able to tell she is a minor when he asked for her number. So she does her best to avoid him. She has to restock the cups and while she is doing so he walked up to her and dropped her a note. There was no conversation though. The note had his name, number, and Instagram. She DMed him later saying she is 15. He replied saying that she did not seem 15 but he was 25. Instead of stopping contact he continued saying he would like to hang out sometime outside of work. She did not reply to this message. We gather from his public insta that he is an exchange student from Spain attending the local college. Then things get a lot more creepy. A week later my friend got off the bus and was walking to her corner house. On the intersecting street a car drove slowly by and she could immedialty recognize him watching her with a grin. She was all by herself and he was wearing glasses and a cap. He drove away before seeing her go into her house. This happened the next day as well but instead of driving by the car was waiting. Right on time. He was wearing a hat and sunglasses once again. This means that 1) he must’ve known where she lived. She commonly rode her bike to the restaurant so we assume he followed her home one day after her shift. And 2) that he knew what time she got off the bus/out of school. This is as far as it has gotten but I need advice on what she should do. She is worried about getting her parents involved because they will turn to the police. He hasn’t done anything to be arrested and she thinks getting the police involved will provoke him to act on violence. My male friend is walking her to her house until I can start driving her home in a couple days. Do you think his behavior will worsen? Does anyone have experience that could offer advice for the situation? All advice is appreciated. Thank you.",01Nov2019,6

159,"(made this throwaway w the intention of posting to r/relationshipadvice, but now I’m positing here lol)


My(21F) mom(54) has serious mental health issues that trigger substance abuse. In the past few weeks, we’ve (my 3 sisters 31, 29, and 18 and myself) noticed her acting strange but it was nothing super concerning. In the past few days, however, it’s been particularly bad; she’s really acting out in the worst ways. Yesterday, she attempted to drive to work, while under the influence, and when my dad caught her, she parked her car in the middle of the road and tried to walk instead. She’s done a few other things as well, that’s just the biggest thing. 

My sisters and I all live together with my mom and dad, as well as my 2 young nephews but my dad works out of town for the better part of the week. We typically turn to my dad(55) for help(this isn’t the first time she’s acted out) but I found out recently that he’s a very big part of the issue. Meaning, he’s part of the reason she’s acting this way. I called him to come home on Wednesday for help but he honestly doesn’t have much of a plan because he was fully prepared to just let my mom return back to work tomorrow....which is completely out of the question considering she also acted out at work and just left. She’s a preschool teacher. 

I’m posting here because I’m unsure of how to go about getting her the help she desperately needs and I don’t know where else to go. Like I said before, a similar thing has happened before in the past (as well as some minor incidents here and there), but my dad took her to a rehab facility and she was doing great for a long time. Now, he doesn’t seem to know what to do and my sisters and I don’t know either. 

I’m so sorry if this is all over the place, I really don’t know how to accurately write out all the details but hopefully this is enough. I can answer any questions if something needs clearing up!",01Nov2019,1
160,"This is my third semester in college as a computer science major. I had chosen comp-sci originally because it just felt like the best option. I don't really have anything I am passionate about but I am pretty good with logic and math so I decided comp-sci would be a good choice. Mostly because I knew there was decent money in it, and I would probably be good at it. 

At first, it was kinda fun but the more time I spend doing really complicated coding projects the less I like it. I am really not enjoying the experience. If I could change my major to anything, I would probably pick zoology or marine biology, or something else with animals. It is easy to change my major at the college I am at, but it doesn't offer much in that field. It offers environmental science and biology which are similar but a lot less specific than my area of interest. Transferring is an option, but It would be very difficult and still not address the problem of my wasted classes. If I transfer or stay here and change major, either way, I'll have a bunch of wasted classes, so wasted time and money. All of this is on top of that fact that even if I did switch major, I might just end up hating that new one too. I would drop college all together but I don't really have any marketable skills yet, so I don't see a way of working my way into a good job in the future. 

I am supposed to sign up for the next semester's classes in two weeks. If I want to transfer, then a lot of college application deadlines for next year have already passed or will soon. I don't want to waste another semester, but I also don't really know what the best option is. Right now, my plan is just to stick with comp-sci and hope it works out, but I really don't know if that’s the best idea.

I am assuming I am not the only person who has had an issue like this. So, if you were in a similar situation what did you do and how did it work out? Any other advice anyone wants to give is also appreciated.

161,"So I have this friend— she’s great, and I love hanging out with her. We have classes together, and she practically lived in my house over the summer due to how much she came over. She has had a really rough year because of the passing of her father; it was sudden and it was a lot for her because her mom is very abusive emotionally. 

I love her to pieces, but sometimes I feel like she doesn’t care about my problems. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t expect her to drop everything when something goes wrong in my life, but I would really like her to at least understand where I’m coming from. 

For example, we had a misunderstanding about my my birthday. I didn’t invite many people because I just wanted some close friends and family there. Last minute she told me she couldn’t come and I was really really upset about it because I wanted her to come. Texted her a paragraph as one does when they are upset (it wasn’t a mean message though, I just told her I was irritated and upset that she would text me last minute).

When I saw her at school for the first time that week, I was no longer that upset. She was very passive aggressive about the message I sent her, and she said I could have just told her those things in person. I told her that I could think clearer when I wrote my thoughts down so I could say everything I needed to. She insisted that we talk about it then and there in the middle of class after I just explained why I didn’t just say it to her face. She kept repeating in a very flat tone about how she didn’t understand why I was so emotional. At this point I wasn’t even upset about her flaking out on my birthday, I was just frustrated and hurt that she was so dismissive.

There are other small things like this that have happened— most of the time its her low-key comparing our lives. I always feel like shit when I just happen to bring up my dad; like the fact he’s emotionally abusive and he was not around me most of my life. He lies to me about my mom and was even neglectful to me when I became sick and he didn’t take me to the doctor. She makes it seem like I should appreciate the fact I even have a dad and that I should  spend more time with him.

When I’m around her and she’s in a good mood she is one of the funniest people to be around, but when she’s not, it always makes me feel bad because I feel like I did something wrong. It’s like I’m walking on eggshells constantly. I feel like I’m just someone convenient too her because I give her all the support I can, whether it be emotionally or financially, and I feel like I’m not getting much in return. But I also don’t want to hurt her either because she doesn’t have that many friends to begin with— none that she’s close to anyway.

I don’t know what I should do. Should I tell her what I think? Or should I just let it be and distance myself?",01Nov2019,1

I don't think I really want to die because I want to enjoy life, and I want to be happy, but I'm starting to think that I might not get there. I also feel kinda detached from my feelings, like I don't cry or go into a deep depression, I just go along with life with the sadness just sorta trailing behind me.

My parents alway wanted me to go to medical school, but it never appealed to me. I saw my parents work HARD at a job all their life, and I just never wanted to work for someone - and I defintely didn't want to be in school forever.

School was always easy for me conceptually, I've just always struggled with time management. My parents have made me take several classes and I still suck. I'm literally failing out of college because I can't manage myself. I switched majors thinking that maybe I wasn't following my passion, and now I love it but alas I've fallen behind again.  Majoring in STEM. I know if I was doing something liberal arts I would excel easily (my strong suit), but I want a STEM degree for loads of reasons.

I've tried reading the book 7 habits of highly  effective people, but the book doesn't explain how to change, it only explains what I need to do. I've tried scheduling myself several times but I can't keep a schedule to save my life. I've tried drugs, Ive taken 3 tabs of acid but it didn't do anything for me. I did some shrooms and even though I had some interesting thoughts, I still find myself fucking up.

What the actual fuck is wrong with me? Why am I only a produtive soul after failing. Like if I fail something or someone I'll work hard for a couple days, after that I'm done. Or if I'm doing something for someone else, I work HARD. But if its for me, idgaf.

I was diagnosed with ADHD as a kid, but my parents are foreign so they didn't get me on meds. Is that my problem? I feel like there is no hope. I've been trying to turn my life to God but I'm scared that won't work too secretely.

Hey Reddit,

So long story short my dad has always been a short tempered person and my whole family knows this. It gets out of hand and let me put it this way, He doesnt have any friends like at all, he doesnt like any of his family members except his parents. He hates his brothers and other family members. Unfortunately my mother passed away a some years ago, and he doesnt like her side of the family so after her death he completely cut my sister and I off from all forms of communication with them. It has been 4 Years since.

Recently I have gotten back in contact with my moms side of the family and they said they were already trying to figure out a way to get me out of my house since I am now old enough and on to college. They said they would be willing to pay for whatever I needed. Rent, Car, School, etc. This is very generous and I am very thankful to have people like them in my life. I am seriously considering this offer.

A month or two ago my dad went off on me for whatever I did that upset him and I said i wasnt coming home. I stayed with his parents for a week and thats when i got back in contact with my moms side of the family. This is when we caught up and they told me what they have been trying to do and what they would be willing to do to get me out of the house.

My problem is I have no Idea how to leave. My Current plan is to leave everything he could take legally from me or track me with such as my car and phone. I already have a second phone that my moms side of the family gave me so I am good in that aspect. I am thinking of writing a note and just leaving because the last time I left a month ago he blew up and im glad his parents were at the house with me when I did because he was probably not going to let me leave.

I have already told my sister that I am considering leaving again and that I dont know when. I obviously feel bad for my dad but I really cant take the amount of stress and verbal abuse he gives to me ontop of me going to school and working. But the current plan is to leave things he can take from me and write a note to him telling him im leaving and having a friend pick me up from my house. I would be greatly appreciative to hear any feedback. Thank you.",01Nov2019,1

180,"This is my first time posting here so sorry if this is too trivial or the wrong kind of thing to post, but I was interested in getting at very least an outside perspective.

To be simple, I don't like living with my roommate, but I also don't like her as a person, and I'm unsure if I'm judging her too harshly  as a roommate because of my general dislike for her.  I'm going to try to be as unbias as possible, but I don't believe that is possible, so I'd like to ask anyone who reads this to keep that in mind.

My roommate and I are very different people in pretty much every single way, especially in our visions for the appartment (I wanted a clean and cozy place where she wants more of a place where she can drink and smoke weed with her friends and throw the occasional party). We also both have different flaws like all people have, but our flaws together tend to lean heavily into her favor.  I have a lot of trouble saying straight forward ""no"" while she seems very used to always getting what she wants, and she seems very oblivious to any signals of people being uncomfortable or unhappy.

I could go into lots of examples of her missing my clear signs of discomfort, me agreeing to things that turn out to be severely downplayed in reality, or her pushing really far into the ambiguity of our agreements, but I think I would rather just skip all the way to the last straw moment for me.  About a week ago I was starting to realize how much I've been putting up with her after she had a talk with me over something I did I found relatively minor compared to everything she does.  Suddenly, I hear her friend calling my name and I go out to see what it's about.  He starts telling me about some party plans that didn't go as planned and they needed to throw it at our place and they wanted to pay me a lot of money to leave the house in 2 days time.  At first I couldn't really really process that, but after some time I was able to get back to them at the time I was told to and I said ""no."" I was feeling proud of myself for finally being able to say something when she responded (significantly paraphrased) ""sorry you're uncomfortable but it's too late to back out.""

She did eventually address one of the big concerns (supposedly) but I'm still not over the fact that I had no say in the matter and that they wanted to kick me out.  She, on the other hand seems to think she did everything she needed to in order to solve the problem.  This leads into what is probably the biggest flaw on my side (and the most bias part of this post): I don't really talk to her.  A lot of that is just my fault, I have bad anxiety and feel wrong talking about that kind of stuff, but I also don't believe it will do anything worthwhile with her.  I don't think she comprehends a lot of this kind of stuff.  I've heard her complain a lot about people suddenly getting upset with her ""out of nowhere"" which makes me think she's unaware that it's possible she makes other people upset.  I also have seen during any disagreement or anything, she suddenly acts very mature and goes through all the motions of conflict solving, but to me this comes across as shallow, condescending, and devoid of any actual desire for improving herself.  The best thing I can imagine coming from talking to her is she does all the same things I don't like, but acts polite about it so she can retain the ""bigger person"" status.  (Sorry this last part got so judgemental about her, it will tone down now)

Sorry this post is so long, I tried to make it as short as possible while also giving ample context and points of view.  I guess I have a few questions.  Is it fair for me to be upset at my roommate about things she isn't aware that I don't like? Is she really a bad roommate or do I just have too high of standards? If we really are incompatible, do I just deal with it or do I try to find a way out?

Again sorry if this is wrong in some way, I hope my post is okay because I'm very stressed and unhappy here, and I really would like to hear what other people have to say.

Thank you all so much!

181,"TLDR in bottom so I don't bore you

Soo I have had alot of insecurities in my life, and almost all of them are related to looks. Coincidentally almost all of my biggest insecurities are things that my family in one way or another shamed me for. But I have one that has controlled my life alot more than any other. It's about my penis. 

A few years ago I made a similar post about the same issue (another account) and you had some great answers. I was 17 at the time and I had avoided sexual interactions as much as I possibly could, because I was so terrified of what they would think of the size of my penis ( size is 6.4 inches in lenght and 4.6 inches in girth. It's mainly the girth that is troubling me.). Anyways I took alot of the advice and for a long time I saw a big improvement. I decided to go for my dream girl and I got her! Nothing of the bad things I thought would happen actually happened. We have actually been together for a couple of years now! 

At the beginning I was feeling confident for the first time in my life. But that slowly died out. Even though I feel better now than I ever did before the anxiety and feelings of inadequacy never really leaves me, and its always related to my penis. Sometimes I see things from a different perspective, ""maybe my penis is perfectly fine, maybe I am enough"". Those feelings and thoughts proves just to be temporary though and the negative thoughts starts coming back. So when I do have these negative thoughts (which is about 70% percent of the time) the following behaviour and feelings occurs. Rumination (It becomes everything I can think about), Anxiety (mostly over sex, even with my own girlfriend), self measuring every day, videofilming myself naked from different angles everyday, and seeking some type of confirmation on the issue on blogs and forums. 

THIS. NEVER. STOPS. I AM SO TIRED OF THIS. No matter how many times I do these silly things like measure myself it never satisfies me. I do it agian and agian hoping to get some more information that will make understand the issue more clearly, but it never comes. I have thought about seing a therapist but I can't fucking imagine sharing this in person. I'm ashamed. Everything else in my life is going great, and I am happy with it all but this really fucks my quality of life up. Enough is enough, I want to take my Life back.

You guys helped me immensly last time (I truly am a different person in alot of other aspects) and I hope you can do it agian. I have decided to take your guys smartest advice and follow it. I will then report back to you in 3 months and tell you if it has helped somewhat or not. So tell me reddit, WHAT CAN I DO??

I don't mind the mari and my wife doesn't either. It's just that we dont think its appropriate around kids. She explained that to him and he freaked out. She decided to call the cops. We knew that nothing will happen to him since smoking weed really isnt a big deal anymore and cops are more lenient. Nothing happened like predicted and she just wanted to scare him a little. It was a he said she said kind of thing and the cops just told him ""if"" he is to stop doing it if there are kids around. Well he is doing it again, wife is working so I'm assuming that's why.

When my first trick or treaters came (3 kids, about age 10) I was still setting up and the candy was still in bags. I kind of overestimated how much candy is in the bags because I gave too much for the first 2 kids (one said ""full handfuls yes!"") and I realized I was giving too much. I should've just given the 3rd kid the same amount as the other 2 but I guess I had a mini panic that I would run out of candy so I only gave him half of what I gave them. And he was such a sweet kid and his thank you was louder than the other two's.

Now since then I haven't been able to stop thinking about how I may have hurt his feelings if he noticed he got less candy than his friends/brothers for whatever reason. I ended up having a lot of candy leftover too so I keep wishing I had just given the kid extra candy. I'm in tears as I write this.

This may sound really extreme to you guys that I'm tearing up over not giving a child more candy (even though it's not about the candy but that he might be upset the other two got more candy than him) but this is an issue I've had for as long as I remember, I feel really bad when I unintentionally potentially hurt people in even the smallest ways.

192,"I (18M) am a second-year undergraduate at a university in Michigan. I'm going to be graduating at the end of the next academic year (May 2021) with a BS in Biochemistry and Linguistics. But the problem is, I don't know what I want to do once I graduate.

For all of high school and part of college, I was your standard, cookie-cutter pre-med student. Sometime last year I realized I *really* need a regular amount of sleep (7+ hours) to function properly on a basic level, and I'd probably find medical school to be utter hell, so I switched to pre-dental. Last summer, though, I realized something deeper about my personality: I absolutely hate working around/with people. I must say I'm not a very compassionate or empathetic (or social/sociable) person, so a job like a doctor or dentist definitely wouldn't be right for me. (I don't know why I ever thought it would be.) I prefer working with numbers and data. I could certainly work in a collaborative environment with colleagues, but patients/customers/etc. are too much for me.

In terms of career *possibilities*, I don't mean to sound braggy or pretentious, but I think most/all avenues are open to me; I'm a very good student. My problem is just that none of the careers I've looked at look *appealing* to me.

My career requirements are, in order of priority (but all are important), 1. something with an average annual salary over $100k, 2. something that doesn't require extensively working with people like being a doctor/dentist would, 3. something in the natural sciences, and 4. something with high job security. An ideal career might involve both computers/programming and biochemistry. Ideally I wouldn't have to put in a ridiculous number of hours per week like a doctor.

I'm definitely open to grad school (and in fact lean towards it) or professional school, but I'm also open to starting a job right away after undergrad.

**The careers I'm considering right now** are 1. being a pharmacist (but it really doesn't seem appealing to me, especially because the career is experiencing a net decline and because I would have to interact with people a lot), and 2. being a researcher in biochemistry, computational chemistry, or biomedical science (which appeals to me a bit more, but honestly I would prefer a career with more stability than research has).  If I continue to procrastinate deciding on a career, #2 will probably be the default/backup option.

The only careers I've outright eliminated are ones requiring medical or dental school.

Am I just being too picky/arrogant and should I just resign myself to these options, or is there something out there for me?

I'm a woman, gonna turn 30 soon and I'm trying to figure out my life.

 I've always felt the need of being in a relationship to be happy. This is, when i face myself, what I do and apparently what I want. A romantic relationship. 

I changed country 3 years ago, broke up with my boyfriend, who was a local, few days ago. All around, everyone gets married, is pregnant, have jobs they like and all. I moved away 3 years ago, don't feel like I achieved anything (on the contrary I feel like I let myself slowly die), lost many many friends, have a job I don't like, don't have a career, and I've been depressed for a while. 

Apart from therapy, how do I help myself? How can I build something for myself, so that I don't feel that I need to be in a romantic relationship to exist and enjoy life?",01Nov2019,2
194,"Everyone is dying of old age, yes, both of my grandparents just passed away a year apart. The shitty part now is that my uncle (grandparent's eldest) just happened to die from some heart attack in his sleep. He was sort of my favorite uncle growing up.

The weird thing is, over the past couple of days, I couldn't really sleep. And I've been having heavy pressure feelings on my chest. It must be the meds I sometimes take and the supplements for my running but it's just very ominous to honestly say that I've had a bad feeling over the past month. My grandpa's eldest just died a month apart after he died of cancer. 

And have you ever read of great misfortune happening in families where a couple and even multiples would die? This shit seems to be happening. It didn't even start here. Almost 10+ years ago, one of our strongest family members (I'd say successful than most and we looked up to him) died of surprise: heart attack. I'm basically running out of uncles. What the f* even, in Halloween of all days??? 

Sorry if this seems like I'm venting. I'm on a trip and I really can't talk to anyone else right now. I'm trying my best to work hard so that I can visit everyone, and catch up before some shit happens but it's taking me some time. I don't know how to feel other than be angry at the moment.

What can I do as a son and family member to the ones who just lost a relative, an uncle? I don't think I can even talk to my mother (divorcee) and a brother lost, right now-- And I've been busy with school work trying to chip something for myself. Has anyone else experienced this?",01Nov2019,1
195,"First post...thank you for your help. Advice needed related to two way customer service ethics. Mind you, I feel like it’s my job to provide good service just as the business would.

Tonight, I called carnival cruises wanting to upgrade rooms for my family and sister-in-law. I was on the phone 90 minutes with nice customer service gal who kept giving me quotes but then we went to finalize and price jumped.

On the last price quote, she secured $143 upgrade per party to great rooms, but then when we went to finalize, price jumped to $400. She apologized and said it was a misquote and she had missed increased deposit fee. This whole process took 15 minutes and I texted my sister in law that we had secured upgrades for $143 each, she assured me we had a locked rate this time.

As I press the price discrepancy, the customer service gal pleads with me just to go back to our original rooms and rate, but we are 60 mins into the call and my intention all along is an upgrade (I was surprised by the seemingly low rates but thought I lucked out). I’m calm and collected and ask politely for her to escalate the issue as her system seemed genuinely confusing from what I heard over the phone. However, as she reaches out to escalation she mentions that she will have to personally pay the difference out of her paycheck and will likely get fired. She gets a number from escalation to call her manager but at this point that office is closed. She promised to call me back tomorrow AM, my wife will be taking the call as I’ll be at work.

Ok my new friends...I feel like if I push the issue she will likely get fired by my calling her out on a mistake...am I inconsiderate in doing so?",01Nov2019,1

It’s halloween night and I’m a freshman girl in college, so I should be going out. But I don’t want to. I don’t like feeling like I’m missing out on something I don’t even want to do in the first place. I don’t like lying to people to avoid judgement and the typical “YOURE NOT GOING OUT???!?” response. Alcohol scares me because of childhood trauma and current trauma due to my father being an alcoholic, so I hate being near the stuff. I am also a really serious student and see college as my way to accomplish my career dreams, so I feel like my time is best spent doing that. I relax and do what I want, but I think it is outside of my friends and family’s definitions of having a good time. I’m perfectly content to sit in my dorm, do homework, eat subway, and watch Shane Dawson videos. At the same time, I feel sad and like people see me as a hermit or not fun, because I’m not out getting turnt on the biggest party night of the year.

197,"14M and a very quirky person at that.

Ever since I was young I had problems. I had speech development problems and rarely talked until age 7. I lacked social skills until 8th grade and still have some issues sometimes. I was very quiet at school and didn't really like attention, I wanted to just go through school then play video games where I wanted to be, instead of the boring reality. 

In middle school being the quiet kid sucked. Few were friends with me and people made fun of me for it, and I had anger issues so it was basically baiting me into trouble. My classmates caused a lot of trouble for me and I was sexually assaulted, accused of sexual acts (some illegal), and I was suicidal. I had one friend, and he drifted away from me towards others. I almost jumped off the (super steep) hill in my neighborhood that led to the street, and would definitely kill me. But here I am, I saved myself and graduated middle school and now am a freshman in high school, and a decent student at that.

But I have... quirky interests. I am a massive anime lover and play a ton of video games, so much that I spend basically all of my money on games and PC parts on top of all the drinks and food I buy with my friends. I'm somewhat of a beginning artist but I like to draw lewd things and H-manga panels. 

I'm in the engineering program at school but I'm unsure if I am fit for a computer science profession as an adult, considering the vast amount of knowledge I need to know and my less-than-proficient mathematic skills for it. 

I'm unsure of what to do. I could be a game streamer/YouTuber, but very few people have gotten the chance to have success with it. I can be an artist but I'd have to brush up on my skills heavily and give up many things to learn and get better at it to even have a chance for that profession. I've played the piano for a long time and it could be something I do but I'm unsure if I can make enough of a living for myself, or more if I have kids. I don't know what to do in computer science since it has its own branches of hardware, software, and what to do in each of those branches. 

My mental health has improved but I get bored easily and like to redline everything, which can kill my grades. I'm 160 lb at 14 and have a fatass stomach, but never make an effort to exercise. My school didn't give me a PE class for the entire school year. 

I'm a bit ambitious to ask this on reddit but I'm unsure where to go in 4 years.",01Nov2019,2

200,"Lately I've been feeling really shitty about myself, it just seems like I never can make everyone happy and I am always feeling like I'm the bad person.

Background on the story is I'm a 25 year old woman, child of divorce and all my siblings are technically half (and much younger, still in highschool). My dad and step mom are nice people but I was mostly raised by my mom and step dad, they paid for everything and I spent the majority of my time with them. My mom and step dad also recently got divorced and I haven't talked to my step dad in about a year, the family is all very disconnected. It seems silly to have a divorce affect me this much at this age, but it's all very sad.

My mom will tell me I have lost my relationship with my family because I don't call or visit enough. Honestly, I don't like going over to the house because it makes me feel sad, but I always come over when she invites me. It just doesn't feel like my home anymore, not like it's a place where I can just drop in. Plus I am always busy with work it seems, and trying to also balance time with friends, my boyfriend, and alone time. I just wish she would invite me over instead of expecting I just show up. It's sad for me and I wish she would make more of an effort to reunite the family instead of putting that on me, I feel like she's projecting a lot onto me.

My dad's side is also frustrating because every time I come over and visit I feel like I'm being criticized for being selfish and not calling or visiting enough. I do family dinners there way more than I even do at my moms! But also, like I said before, I am at a different place in life than my siblings and I have a lot going on where it's hard for me to stay as connected.

Some people seem to be very close with their family and have no issues like this....I don't know why it's so hard for me. I think growing up I always felt like my own little island, really torn between my two families. When I was old enough to go to college I moved to a different state and did very well with the distance and independence. Now that I moved back to the same city as my family it feels like I'm always letting people down. I also just feel sad because even though I have so many people in my family, it just feels like I'm the outsider and every situation and nobody really understands my perspective on everything.",01Nov2019,3

After a job that I treasured fired multiple people in one swipe I walked out with them. Ever since then I'm a wreck at jobs.

206,"Background:
So for the past year my best friend’s dad has been building up this e-commerce company which is essentially a warehouse that ships out other website’s items. I even worked a week there the week before Christmas last year for some extra cash before I went back the school and my friend’s dad said that he liked my work ethic. But over the summer my family moved a few states away from my friend and I’m now doing online college since I can’t afford out of state tuition. 

Lately I’ve been feeling like I’m stuck in life since I’m at a complete crossroads. Where I am now I’m working a part time job that I hate and I’m starting to regret the major that I’ve chosen to study (and regretting not just taking a loan out and returning to campus) but my parents are pushing me to get a degree and are against the idea of me working for my friend’s dad. 

This brings me to my current situation. My friend told me that his dad’s company has just signed a contract with Shopify and they are going to open a few warehouses. He wants me to get in now because he claims that in at least two years I could move up to a managerial position and be making six figures. He even offered for me to move in with him rent free which is very generous. Our other friend is already working there and told me that it’d be a big mistake to not drop everything and go work for them now rather than later. 

This sounds like a great opportunity but I’m worried because I’d feel a lot safer having a college degree as a backup in case something were to happen to this company. 

Can someone help me outline the pros and cons of quitting school to work full time there? I’d appreciate any advice!",01Nov2019,1

Since I was a senior in high school, I've had a terrible relationship with my uncle. We unfortunately live in the same house along with other family members who I'm happy to be around and are supportive and love me.

My uncle and I literally do not talk to each other, or interactive in any way really unless I HAVE TO say something like ""Can you move your car?"". He says little things under his breath or will say things out loud knowing I can hear it, but not actually to my face, such as ""You useless fuck, you didn't put the dressing away."" Just absolutely ridiculous insults over small things like that. I ignore it and pretend I didn't hear anything, I don't fill the fire and respond in a harmful matter even though I could certainly think about it.

210,"Using a throwaway bc dont want people seeing this on my main

From the end of May last year, my life has gotten progressively worse. My girlfriend of almost 3 years left me, my grandpa died, had another sorta non official relationship where the girl was kind of an asshole the whole time, my friends are slowly moving on with their lives thus are generally available less often and throughout the whole thing my grades in my classes dropped to the lowest they have been in my life. 

Since about April of this year, I have noticed my happiness has been very non existent. A lot of the things I used to do for fun such as playing my video games or watching movies no longer make me actually content. They are like ""fun"" but they dont make me happy as they once did. I also moved out for the first time this year as I transferred to a different university further away and now no longer have my family with me as I live alone.

Since April it feels like everything in life is just pointless and I am just here experiencing torment until I eventually die. I have always thought I had anxiety and my mom once suggested I had it too but it came off as kind of jokingly despite me actually agreeing with her in my mind. I feel like I have been incredibly depressed since April and am quite worried for my mental health. 

The problem is that I don't know how to ask my parents if I can see a therapist without making it seem like something is wrong with me and them looking at me like I have issues. My mom is very supportive of things and in reality she would probably be super helpful and willing to get me to a therapist. My biggest issue is my dad. I don't know what he thinks but based on the way he interacts with my siblings and I, all he cares about is if we are doing well in school, what we are doing to set ourselves up for success in the future, etc.

I don't mind that because it shows he cares but it makes me think that he doesn't care about other aspects of life one would experience. He doesn't show any interest in anything I care about, he doesn't respond half the time unless I say something that pertains to him or is related to school or whatever. I feel he would be the type of parent to tell me to suck it up because school is the most important thing. For those of you wondering, I have contemplated suicide so I am worried for what I may do when I am not thinking as rationally as I am now.

Any advice would be great.

222,"My girlfriend comes home from work everyday stressed out and angry over a coworker, to the point where it's carried over and shes stressed out and angry at me too.

I don't want to butt into her situation as it's not in my place to do so, however I have suggested some things. I'm just looking for more alternative ways of helping her deal with this situation.

For reference, the job is at a consulting company and the new hire (a classmate of ours) is just not getting the work. She has to constantly help him (along with other people that help him) and constantly messes up projects that she has to clean up (and consequently lose time to work on her own projects).

228,"So this is long and I'm frankly unsure what all I should add but I'll keep names out of it.

So I was originally hired to be a property manager for a storage unit facility I'm my hometown. I worked for a management company for an absente owner. A few months into the job the owner decided to sell the property after he upgraded it and added more units. And the company liked my work and asked me to move to another state and manage another site for them. I was warned going in that this site was not managed well before I got there. It was bought by a new owner a year ago (when I first got there) and my company took over and didn't hire new employees, kept the old ones and they tried to run it the old way not the new way. Also I need to add that the owner that bought this site over paid and was ripped off with cooked books. 


Sorry for the rambling. Basically before I took over, the whole year the new owner had it before I got there the bottom line was 10k in the hole each month. Within 3 months of me being there I had the site down to 7k in the hole monthly, an improvement but not what they expected. The new owner and my management company did not know how bad this site was before I got there and dug in and looked under everything and audited all paperwork and everything. Honestly I just don't think the site will make enough to cover what the owner paid for it.

I lived on site in the manager apartment for $500/mo and again I'm sorry about the rambling, I'm just stressing out. When I got the offer to move down there my wife had 3 jobs part time and was making good money and enjoying life and she gave that all up willingly and came with me for move obviously.


Now fast forward to 8 months later (present time) the management company is finished with this site in the next month or so and has informed the owner because he can't afford to pay his bills. And my company has offered to send me to another location that doesn't have an on-site apartment, it's a brand new site built that I'd start fresh with, the owner of this one has over a dozen other sites managed by our company and I won't get a raise to go there, same pay. They will pay for my U-Haul rental and that's all the help I get from the company for moving (same as the first move).

My original house is leased out and I can't move back home for another year and a couple months. If I don't take this new site, I will be terminated when my company is finished here and I have no contact info for the owner to ask if I could work for him and stay where I'm at but I honestly don't know if I'd want to stay here long term, I feel like I'd just be delaying the inevitable.

The management company is very small, my regional manager is also my district manager and is the CFO, that small of a company. Very short staffed at the corporate level. And I just don't know how to get info from her when she's that busy and has literally no time to give me any details about the new site.

And on the other hand, if we don't take the move, and move back home we'd be in the hole almost 3k from the first move down here and moving back and we'd have to move in with one of our parents.

Where we'd be moving to the rent is around 800-1200/mo and my wife and I both have terrible credit so all deposits will most likely be double or triple.

I really like the people in this management company and would like to move up and help the company grow. But this side step (the first move to the crap property) that was given to me has made me look pretty bad on paper to owners of my management company (not who I directly answer to) and I truly feel like my boss did not sabotage me by sending me here but I do feel like they handed me a gun and I shot myself in the foot. I'm 28 and this is the first job I've that I really was happy to invest myself in and now it doesn't look good going forward.

I honestly just don't see a right answer here on what is best. And if you've read this far, I truly thank you from the bottom of my heart. If you have any questions I'll do my best to answer them.

238,"I recently had to have two open surgeries done on my knee, one in the front and another in the back. The second was okay, but the first was one of the most painful and mentally exhausting experiences of my life. I was in and out of emergency rooms for two weeks, learned that my disease had progressed and that most of my bone tissue was destroyed and became so anemic that I ended up having to stay in a hospital for three days at some point. The entire time I was fighting to feel human, and the only thing keeping me going was the thought that I'd be going back to see my family soon. I thought for the first month or so after that this feeling I had was just because I was still recovering, and that not understanding my actions anymore was also just from the lingering pain. But I'm in college now, it's been months after the surgery. I'm trying to make a life for myself. But I'm realizing that I'm not the same person that I was before the surgery, and it's almost like my new self is just this shadow following me. Like I don't understand why it's there or why It's feeling this way about certain things and why these words are coming out of my mouth, ect. I feel like one of Frodo's team in that last scene during LOTR, where they're all just sitting in the bar after everything they've been through. And they're all just kind of thinking ""What now?""

240,"I (21F) was raised Catholic my whole life and since I was young my mom has enrolled me in Catholic school, and Catholic youth group. As I grow up and became exposed to the outside world more, my views began changing as they naturally do when you’re out, and I really questioned my faith. 
I felt like being in my youth group didn’t bring me more joy and I didn’t really believe in what I was teaching so I told the group organizer that I wanted to leave. 
She told me to rethink and question the reasons I want to leave, and to give it another chance. She asked why I didn’t believe in some of our teachings and I told her I felt like it was outdated and doesn’t make sense to me, and she said not to listen to what other people are saying and to do research on our faith because a lot people are incorrectly informed. She believes it’s in my best interest to stay in the youth group as it has become her anchor and she believes it will do to the same for me.

I haven’t done my full research completely but I do still feel like in the day I’m living today, believing in what the Catholic church teaches regardless of their reasoning is not going to be compatible with what I believe.

Open-mindedness is definitely one of my top values  and I feel like the Catholic church does not highly value that at the top of their priorities/teaching. I’m wondering if I’m not being open minded enough or if I’m compromising my values.

3 years ago I took my mum's advice to enrol in a Bachelor of Linguistics and major in Japanese when I wasn't sure what to do with my life. I love the Japanese classes in my course but they only make up 5/24 classes in the entire course, I hate the Linguistics classes and only scrape by on grades. 

I stuck with this for 3 years, then I decided I needed time off after doing back to back degrees for 6 years. During my time off I decided I wanted to be a teacher and looked into how to become one from this point.

244,"So I'll try to keep this as short a possible. I (M20) just turned 20 and this strange thought came to my mind. I thought about being somewhere completely different than my current situation. I thought of all the things I could've done better and where I would be now. I know this sounds stupid and it's a pretty self-destructive way of thinking, but it just clicked, it just came to mind like a snap.

And this bubble felt like bursting today on my way home (very drunk so this doesnt't make it much better if not at all). I'm currently studying social work. My dream was to change something in the world to make everything better. Seeing all the stuff happening world-wide, I came to the conclusion that I alone cannot change a single thing except maybe a single life. I would be okay with that, but I know that I could do that much more if only I would think more rational and wouldn't go out of my so that I don't disrupt anyone else with their plans. So right now I'm at a crucial point in my life where I have to decide if I keep going or change my perspective and my way of life. The questions is, do I stay inside the system  that I built myself or do I take step out to look 'outside the box' and reinvent myself. The latter would be much more interesting, but because I'm pretty scared of what's lying ahead, I can't really make a decisions that's going affect my entire life without asking someone what they would do in my situation.

252,"Hi all - not sure if this is the right place to post but I figured I'd give it a go. Sorry if it's a little vague, but I did it on purpose just in case family members are here.  

I have an older sibling (early 30s) who was sexually abused by an extended family member when we were younger (less than 13). The specific family member hasn't been in our life for over 10 years, although their immediate relatives have been. My sibling told my parents and me about the abuse over six years ago, which made me rethink some odd memories of my childhood that never seemed to add up. Long story short, I think I may have been abused as well but simply repressed the majority of the memories. As a result, I decided to see a therapist a little over three years ago, who helped me come to terms with my memories.   

My concern is my sibling. I've expressed on numerous occasions how helpful therapy was for me to my sibling, although I haven't specifically said why I went. Afterwards, they've mentioned wanting to see a therapist countless times throughout the years, and I even found one that they could go to and sent the contact information, but they still haven't gone. It's been years and my sibling just seems stuck in a rut - they've gone off to university and graduated, but currently work with one of our parents and also live at home with them with no signs of that changing. The sibling has expressed that multiple times to my parents and myself that they are unhappy with their work and home situation, but has said they don't have the confidence in themselves to make a change. Except for the abuse and demanding but loving and supportive parents, we had an amazing childhood and were never deprived of anything or overly spoiled either.  

I genuinely believe that seeing a therapist will help my sibling, and have even thought of gifting a Talkspace or Better Help subscription if seeing a therapist in our small town is what is keeping them from seeking help. I really don't know if I'm being judgemental or overbearing, but I've always been more of a take-charge person and it really hurts to see my sibling in such a poor mindset so I want to do anything I can to help, even if that means doing nothing.  

Any help is appreciated.

260,"I would like to have your opinions about something that happenend a few minutes ago. 
First, let's set some context : I am a foreign au pair living in Scotland. I am a nature lover, which means I could observe flowers and animals for hours without getting bored. I spend most of my time indoors, so I enjoy little things like the moss on a wall or the frozen grass in the morning.
On my way back home this morning, I spotted a robin in a bush in front of the neighbours' house. The bush is like  4 meters away from their living room window, and most of its branches are spreading on the pavement. I was just standing there, without moving, staring at the cute little bird in the bush. It was raining and the bird was hiding in the bush, so I waited for a few minutes to see if I could take a picture of it. My phone was still in my pocket. I noticed that the lights were on in the neighbours' house, and I glanced at their door, hoping they would not come out and frighten the bird. 
After not more than 5 minutes, a woman opened a window from the upper floor of this house and asked me if something was wrong. I answered that I was looking at the bird. She said ""OK"" and she added that she was afraid something was wrong. I reassured her, she closed the window, and I left.
I keep wondering if I did something wrong. Maybe she was just politely asking me to leave (which I did right away after that), or maybe she was genuinely worried?
I am not used to the anglo-saxon design of the residential streets. There are no fences, no gates, no blinds on windows. Is the small patch of grass in front of the house part of the property? Is it more like a neutral buffer zone between the pavement and the house?

264,"To start off. Me and my uncle are close. I was raised by my grandparents and we kinda grew up together, there's a 12 year difference between us. Im in my early 20s now and he's in his mid 30s.  
He's always been my bestest friend, an amazing brother. And when my grandfather died he stepped in and became a father to me. I love him more than anybody else on this Earth.
His girlfriend and mother of his child too was once a second mother to me. And I was almost as close to her as I am to him. 
A couple months ago my uncle called me crying. He explained how he found out his girlfriend had been DMing other men, receiving nudes, talking about relationships and leaving of him. He was broken. He asked to stay in my apartment and I agreed.
We talked about him leaving her. And I was happy that he was chosing his own happiness for once cause he's sacrificed so much of himself, his hobbies, activities and interests to give more to her and the stress and resulting depression had been really hard on him. 
But after about 5 days he told me he was getting back with her. And I was furious. But even more I was so sad that he yet again sacrificed himself for her. I felt like he was giving up an opportunity for a new start at happiness. And I've been struggling to keep those feelings shut away. Because Everytime it comes up it strains how me and him interact and more than anything I don't wanna lose him in my life. Because he's such a big part of it.
This isn't the first time she had done something like this to him either. But the first time I was ~13 years old and they hid it from me and didn't tell me until I was 18. 
How can me and him get through this? How can I get through this?

268,"I work for a police station in Baton rouge country in an area that had rumors of corrupt cops and I can confirm for this station at least that it's true. I don't know how many of them there are but there's definitely bad ones, the kind that do a traffic stop and plant illegal contraband on the vehicle leading to the suspect's arrest. Somebody in the station went through a tragic murder in their life but I suspect they were in on it or knows something because it went unsolved with nothing but circumstancial evidence relating to them.
Obviously I don't know for sure but it seems fishy.
I spoke to a friend after I started to notice something wrong with the department and he told me to get evidence of the crimes and take it to my superiors but I suspect someone on top is partially responsible for our station's corruption because it's been going on under the radar for so long and I feel if I go speak to someone high up that's corrupt they could possibly ruin life for my family and end my career. The reason I came to Reddit for advice is because I'm in fear, going to the wrong person with this information can end me. They know me, my house, my girlfriend and everything about my family.

269,"Okay, let me give you some background.

We have been dating for over a year. During the first few months of our relationship, we had a lot of unprotected sex which resulted in the consumption of a lot of contraceptives (we have since learnt the negatives of it and haven't consumed one in 6 months). But I feel like it has resulted in a lot of hormone imbalance.

That's one. But we also got into an accident, which resulted in a scar on her left leg and now she's insecure about her leg and can't wear shorts without being conscious about it.

Over the last 6 months, I have been dealing with multiple symptoms of depression from her:

1. She doesn't sleep well
2. Keeps getting frustrated at the smallest things and always sad / angry.
3. Doesn't eat well.
4. Always blaming me for the smallest thing

There are a lot of insecurities and I want to help in any way I can, but in the process, 
Last night, I couldn't sleep because she woke me up and we had a long conversation and again she's very negative today.

270,"My boyfriend and i recently went to eat dinner with his family for his 18th birthday and we had a pretty good time. I havent gotten the chance to really talk to his family before, even though i knew them, so i was excited and chatted with them. 

Here comes the tricky part of the evening: We all light heartedly teased each other, making harmless jokes but I could see my boyfriend silencing himself. I tried to include him in the conversation, gave him kisses on his cheek and put my arm around him to prevent him from feeling disconnected. 

Later we went home and had a small, unrelated argument and brought up that I was always trying to dominate him while being around other people and I would be rude and inconsiderate and the things that I do and say would hurt him greatly. I was shocked to hear this, the evening had been great and I thought it had gone by successfully and happily. And other events or gatherings haven't stood out to me either for any of those accusations. I did not feel like I did anything that he pointed out even the opposite at times but he says that I can't decide that. 

Now every time I see him I think about what he has said and I get sad and I dont know how to handle this situation. I dont know if I really act the way he told me, if he is exaggerating my behaviour or if he is jealous of me being extroverted and getting along with most of people quite quickly.

I have been trying my best for the last two years to get into my prefered course of medicine, and honestly it looks really possible, i got a 90th percentile ucat score and was predicted a really high atar that would be more than enough to get in.


however in the english exam, my phone went off due to my sugar levels going low, i use an app that monitors my sugar levels and when they go past a certain point, it rings an alarm that overrides mute and do not disturb. i got my phone confiscated however the supervisor allowed me to continue due to knowing what it was.

They then said they need to inspect my phone, a few days have passed but i received a call this morning and they asked for my pin, and if i didn't give it, it would have been a breach of rules and a fail. i gave it and my school person who is in control of things says they found pictures of study notes which they deemed unauthorized material in the exam room even though the pictures were over 2 weeks old.

I have been let know that i will most likely not recieve an english score and that means not ATAR (meaning no score for my academic acheivment) and hence i cant get into medicine, or any other course i wanted.

just want someone to give me some sort of plan, my friends are too busy with exams, i dont live with my parents and we dont get along, i just dont have anyone to talk to and i really thought i was finally go somewhere. i really dont know what to do from nowFailed my last exam due to phone in pocket and no longer can get into university.",01Nov2019,3

273,"This is a really long story.

I (22F) have been friends on and off with another girl (23F) since I was in the second grade. But a part of me thinks it's wrong to call her a ""friend"" since in truth I don't really like her. Like at all.

When we first became friends, I was just so happy that someone wanted to be friends with me after the last three years of being considered the weirdest girl in school that I honestly didn't care much about her personality. She was disabled, so no one wanted to be friends with her either, and she lived across the street from me. I was always the ""quiet"" one in the friendship. I let her pick all the activities, who we hung out with, etc. I definitely considered her my best friend at the time, but in retrospect I was also lacking in options. As time went on, our friendship became more and more tiring. I found she wasn't all that supportive of my efforts to make other friends and I was still being bullied near constantly. She was very controlling and I found myself resenting her more by the day. I never told her that I was so miserable I had considered suicide. In Grade 6 I had enough and asked my Mom to change my school and I lied to my friend, telling her that I had no choice in the matter.

I still kept in contact with her over the phone, but a year later I moved for real and met my actual best friend and really learned how magical and equal friendship could be. Once that happened, I actually became quite determined to fix my relationship with my first friend, turning our relationship into one that was equal, where we both understood each other. Whereas before, I would always let her be in charge, I tried to insert some more of my own personality into our conversations. But she completely disrespected my opinions and always made things about her. So I told her I never wanted to talk again and completely dropped her. 

But after continuous bugging, I tried again to repair our relationship and it didn't work. Eventually (sometime during high school) I went to her house and explained that I felt disrespected all the time, and she promised to change. But she didn't, so I dropped her again.

She tries to contact me about once a year. By phone, facebook, etc. I somehow always fell for it and would try to become friends again. She's really good at making me feel guilty about the fact that I abandon our friendship over petty things and that ""wouldn't it be good to go back to the good old days"" which sure, were good for her, but miserable for me. Once I went to college, I blocked her on everything I could think of and resolved to never talk to her again, and that worked for about four years.

About a month ago, I got a call from an unknown number. I answered, like an idiot, hoping it was a job interview. It was her. And instead of hanging up I (like an idiot) actually talked to her and let her convince me to become friends with her again. I was just so sick of being the bad guy who's constantly ending things. I figured if the price for not being an asshole was just having to talk to some girl I can barely tolerate once every couple of weeks, then whatever, I can deal. And she seemed to be really successful, becoming a teacher, so I figured maybe she matured and would be more tolerable now.

The real problem is that she drives me up the mother fucking wall. I won't rant about every little thing she does that pisses me off, but holy hell. If she died, I wouldn't be sad. And that's the thing, I feel like an asshole for pretending to be friends with her when I literally could not give two shits about her or her life, but on the other I don't know how to get rid of her. I'd have no problem just telling her I don't wanna be friends anymore, but that didn't work the last 8 times, and I know that in one year or two years I'm gonna get another call and end up in this situation all over again. When I told someone else this, he said I should try sticking it out for a little longer so I could get to re-know her as an adult and that the only reason I'm so annoyed is because of left over trauma, but at this point I really just want to go to her house and strangle her. Which isn't really fair to her since all I ever do is lie to her face and tell her we're still friends.

284,"First I'm gonna keep this relatively vague because he uses Reddit as well and I don't want any chance of him stumbling across this.

My mom and her boyfriend have been together off and on for a long time. I want to say almost sixteen years. He came right after my dad and mom broke up.

After being together for about 6 years they broke up and we didn't see him often but before that we had a great relationship. He treated me like his daughter and I really loved him.

So he came back into the picture about 2 years ago and we gained a joking relationship. I felt awkward treating a grown man as my very bestest friend now that I'm 17 but we were still pretty close. I never felt uncomfortable about him and we often made fun of each other.

That is until last year. I got a boyfriend and he seemed weirded out by this. I wrote it off as a father figure upset that his little girl was dating the boys. But he gave me advice and I really respected him.

But that is until. Recently. We were talking about me and my boyfriend's upcoming anniversary and I hinted that I was thinking about having sex for the first time I'm 19 BTW.

He didn't jump to. 'no you can't I forbid.' but he tolde that I wasn't ready and needed more experience before doing something with the person I love. That it was better to not loose your virginity to someone you want to be with seeing love you blind you to pleasure and you'll think it's good and really isn't.

Needless to say. Sitting in the living room during early morning when we were the only two awake I felt uncomfortable. But I mean he didn't outright say anything personally weird and I'll admit I get really uncomfortable fast. Two people laughing down the hall from me can make me uncomfortable.

But it was weird. He proceeded to joke with the fact that my boyfriend couldn't handle such a beautiful woman because he's still a little boy. (My boyfriend is twenty one) that I needed a real man and I deserved a real man. He was a real man. He proceeded to ask me if. He needed me to show me how much of a real man he was. I felt uncomfortable and kept trying to change the subject to TV shows I liked. Most cartoons like Steven universe because I didn't like how he kept referring to me as a woman. A beautiful, attractive, vivacious woman. I just wanted him to look at me like a kid. The way he did before I told him I was thinking about loosing my virginity.

But he wouldn't let me. He told me that I was still a child at heart and he loved that about me. It was one of my best qualities and I needed to find a man who excepts this. (my boyfriend doesn't at times)

But then finished the conversation off by saying. ""Dont tell your mom about this though. You know she doesn't fully like the idea of you having a boyfriend to begin with."" and I just nodded and told him I was going to bed.

Then later that morning. He opened my door looked in on me and I pretended to be sleep before he left.

I’m scared he got hurt cuz he’s also involved in a lot of dangerous activity if you catch my drift. I’m worried he is hurt.

It's hard to find anyone to spend time with. My girlfriend was the one filling this hole for me, now I have nobody.

The good news is, i just managed to land a job that will double my income, but it's going to be challenging to grow to be the kind of person who can perform well in it. I'll have a lot of pressure to learn - quickly, and it's going to be tough.

I know this because he came to me for advice on how to deal with it all, as I myself have been through a similar scenario in the past. This was great as it meant he obviously trusted me enough and I’m obviously a role model in some sense (I’m about 5 years older).

I’m having a hard time deciding on wether or not to give him a small amount of weed, as I know all he likely needs right now is to clear his head and focus on getting himself better. He’s messaged asking, and I know he knows I have some, as he’s seen it recently. 

I can’t lie and say i don’t have any, as I feel that would break his trust in me. 

I’m not sure if saying no is the best either as I sorta feel like, well who am I to tell people how to live their life and he’s got plenty of other people to tell him weed is bad for him etc.

I want to somehow say yes, but with a bit of meaning behind it a somehow suggest to rethink his habits and to maybe focus more on getting his head straight, but with avoiding sounding like his parent. That’s obviously why he came to me for help in the first place, as he felt safer talking to me about his habits and wouldn’t attack him for it.

Don’t get me wrong, I’ve given him plenty of advice on focusing on getting himself sorted. I don’t want to see him go down the wrong path either. I once had a friend who left the friend group after everyone started given him lectures for doing drugs and rather than listening, he found new friends who he could do said drugs with..

298,"Hi. Need help. On my free time I scan the internet and share memes. Funny memes and Dark-ish memes. The darkish memes often are anti-vaxx memes (RIP Timmy, etc.). 

My parents are 50, we are friends on Facebook. We are very close but sometimes my memes lead to an argument because they can’t understand. The most recent one (today) was a meme about the big bird from Sesame street and it had a caption “we ride at dawn bitches”. They saw it and they asked why I was sharing things with foul language etc. telling me to think before posting, what will people say etc. I do tell them it’s just a meme and people my age (20’s) find it funny. They say that their (dad and moms) friends might see it and question why this and that. I try to explain to them what memes are but basically they did not listen. 

We ended up agreeing on one thing. To agree to disagree. I do know that the conversation will happen again in the future since I have no plans on stopping on sharing memes. Do you guys have advice on how I can explain this to them?",01Nov2019,1

301,"Hey, this one's a little heavy. I considered using a throwaway, but I'm not ashamed of the things that happened to me. General warning for mentions of verbal/emotional abuse.

My parents got together when my mom was in her 30s and my dad was in his 50s. 20 years ago, my mom got pregnant, which she wanted really desperately. She comes from a big happy family and wanted the same. They didn't get married, but they bought a small house together. When my mom was six months pregnant, my dad started some really extreme renovations on the house, which would've been fine, had my mom not been pregnant. They ended up tearing the whole place down and moving a new house onto the land. My mom didn't want any of this displacement, but she went along with it. Then I was born. They finished the house while I was in my infancy. 

Recently, my mom told me that this was when things started to get rough. She didn't want to tell me because she wanted me to have a good relationship with my dad. I think this was because her dad was a really excellent person and she wanted a role model like that for me. She was crying one night a few weeks ago and I asked her why. She told me I might not want to know. I told her, whatever it was, I wanted to know because it was making her upset and I love her. She told me a few stories about the way he used to act with us. He'd lock me in a room and yell at my mom for what felt like hours, threatening to bash her head in, stuff like that. When I'd cry as a newborn, he'd put his hand over my mouth to make me stop. He didn't beat my mother, but his behaviour counts as verbal and emotional abuse, I think.

I had nightmares about this stuff for years. I was a scared little kid, always flinching at loud noises, crying easily. I had panic attacks for years. I got diagnosed with general anxiety, social anxiety, panic disorder, and avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder. I almost got diagnosed with depression but I didn't score high enough. I thought it was all in my head. I didn't know those nightmares were memories. I still don't since I stopped having them. It's really difficult to put into words. I still feel really uncomfortable when she goes to talk on the phone in another room. I thought it was sensory overload from my anxiety, but it was only her voice that caused it. It think I know why now.

When I was two, she decided she'd had enough. She packed up all our documents and some clothes, called her brother, and got in the car. The brakes failed while we were on the way to his apartment. It wasn't a bad crash, but it added to our trauma I think. My uncle told him we could live in his guest room, since we were there all the time before my mom decided to *leave* leave. He's a really great person and helped raise me. She looked for a new house.

My dad really screwed her over and didn't give her back what she put into the house, so she got a loan from her dad (again, great man) and lived with my brother until she could manage the down payment on our new house. From here, she started her own business out of our garage so that she could raise me at home and bring money home. She was a beyond fantastic mother to me. I saw my dad on Sundays and Mondays usually. She told me it gave me a lot of anxiety but she really wanted me to have a dad, and he was seeking therapy for his anger issues. She sought therapy for her PTSD from their relationship.

I had a normal childhood for awhile. We moved to a new part of the state when I was six, moved back when I was seven, then moved to the new part of the state again when I was eight. When I was ten, she was dating another man, who turned physically abusive. She called the police after the first incident and got a restraining order immediately. We moved again and life was good from then on. She got screwed over a lot less with the house this time and we fixed up a cheap old drug house and made just about the cutest home out of it you could imagine. The place had no floors, holes in the ceiling, needed renovation in every room. She did it, though. She turned the holes in the ceiling into skylights. That always stuck with me. The broken parts of the house became where the light entered in.

Everything was okay after that. She's dating a really nice guy now who loves her and treats her as she deserves to be treated. Throughout all this, she was still the best mother I could've ever had. There's not a single person in the world that I look up to more than her. She's brave, tough, kind, caring, and persevering. She supported my ambitions, got me scholarships so that I could do the things I wanted, like extracurriculars we couldn't afford. My dad put in some effort to be a father. He paid for half my braces. Saw me a day and a half each week. He never paid child support and threatened to sue my mom for custody when she asked. He took us off his health insurance, too.

When I got into university, my mom was really excited for me, but my dad told me not to go because it was ""a waste of money."" My mom's boyfriend gave us a loan and is helping pay for me to study. My dad could afford to pay part of my tuition easily, but refuses on principle.

Overall, I feel like my mom did the work of two parents and my dad did more harm than good. Part of me wants to hate him for the way he treated us, like how I hated her abusive boyfriend when I was ten. But he was just so much easier to hate. My dad doesn't know that I know about the abuse. I could go on having a relationship with him if I wanted to. Part of me thinks I should confront him (in a public place) about what he did to us, so that he can see that I've suffered and am suffering from his actions. Part of me wants to forget this all ever happened. A big part of me wants to change my last name (to my mom's, uncle's, and grandfather's) to reflect the people who I feel are my real family. They're such great people and if I go on to write books (my dream job) I want their names on my work, not his. They made me who I am today and I feel like they deserve that. But if I do that I'll have to confront him. I don't think I change it without him finding out. My mom thinks that if I change my last name, he'll take me out of his will. I could use that money for a lot of things. I could pay off our house so that she can live out the rest of my life in peace. I could buy other houses and rent them out for a stable source of income. I could put a down payment on my place now and pay a mortgage instead of rent. I could pay off my student loans and not have to worry about postgrad tuition. 

Part of me wants to change my name and cut him out of my life. Part of me wants to forgive him and use the money for my and my mother's good. What do I do?",01Nov2019,3
303,"I was invited to a Halloween party and I was really excited for it and overall had a great time, when I arrived there was only a few people their and I started cracking jokes and managed to make a few people laugh which was a good start (I'm a socially awkward guy and it's rare I make someone laugh). However the further we got into the party the more quiet I got, I became clingy to someone I already knew prior to the party and always joined the conversations he was in. 

When I was in a conversation or wishing to start one I just didn't know what to say, my mind was just blank. I didn't know what to say so I just went on my phone when I was alone, I didn't join in mu ch cause I was really self conscious and didn't have the confidence to do so. 

What can I do to stop being like this? I want to be that guy who isn't he life of the party and can crack jokes at any given time and make people laugh, that's all I want is to make people smile and it sucks and makes me sad and pisses me off when I can't do that.",01Nov2019,1

306,"I have had the worst week I’ve experienced in a long time. 

I got abused at work, severely, a week ago. I feel really cut up about it, I keep replaying it in my head. I keep crying about it. My employer really let me down. 

I have tonsillitis again for the fourth time in less than two months. I’m so fucking sick. More doctors visits. More antibiotics. More time off work. More fatigue. More pain. More malaise. I tried to quit my physically demanding job for the time being so I could leave and not put myself through this any more until I get my tonsils removed in a few weeks. I’ve been pressured to stay and work more. 

A pre-existing fling of mine was in town for a week or two. We spent a fair amount of time together, we really opened up to each other and had a generally good time. He was keen to hang out with me and organised a lot of our time together. He always tells me he misses me, wants to hear from me more often etc. Then he left town and didn’t tell me until after the fact. I felt worthless. I’ve never sent an angry text message in my life, but in that moment I did. I just had a meltdown. I cried and cried. I don’t understand why men want to sleep with me, seem keen on me, but can’t respect me enough to treat me like a human. No simple fucking conversations can be had. They just stick their dick in and fuck off. They just want to fuck. I don’t expect or even want a relationship with this person but I feel like it undermined the friendship I thought we had. 

After sending those messages I felt really bad. I sent more clearing it up, saying sorry for being harsh. He called me and told me the sequence of events before he left. There was a bit of a misunderstanding and he was really nice, said he felt for me and everything I am going through. But he didn’t use the word sorry. How about “sorry for ignoring your messages... Sorry for not giving your the courtesy of telling you I’m going home... Sorry I didn’t get the chance to see you before I go.” I’m really sensitive to people who don’t have the word “sorry” in their vocabulary. It’s something I noticed in my narcissistic ex. 

After we hung up I sent a message saying it’s been nice spending more time together, hope to hear from you soon. Nothing. Silence. From the person who has until asked to hear from me more, to see me more. Why does it always go this way? The moment I soften even a little, the moment I feel closer to someone, they fucking run. I feel worthless. 

I had a therapy appointment two days ago. I walked there in the sun whilst sick as my car was getting repaired. They said they had an acute case and rescheduled for Friday. I show up at the agreed time. They say no, you were scheduled for yesterday. They then say that my appointment is indeed today but not for another 45 minutes, do I mind coming back?

I just flipped the fuck out. I told the lady at the desk it was fucking ridiculous and that they are hopeless, that they don’t care how distressed you are, they just pass you around like a fucking football. I make an effort to walk down in 40 degree heat with tonsillitis and they can’t keep the schedule they made. I walked out and left. 

She called me. Twice. I said leave me the fuck alone.  Don’t fucking call me again. I’m going home. I’m not coming back. I was crying. I was so distressed. I swore at her a lot. It’s weird. It’s like the anger wasn’t coming from me. It was like I was watching somebody else say all this. 

I hate how this mental health professionals talk in that fake, condescending, high pitched voice. I hate how they talk to you like you’re an idiot. They ring you back when you yell at them because they just think you’re crazy and your anger and boundaries don’t count. No word from the therapist. They don’t know I want to die. 

I’m losing it. What do I do? Where do I go? Help is a lie. Every time I try I get it shoved back in my face.",01Nov2019,1
307,"Before I start this I do have one person I am most suspicious of this being and it's my ex stepfather. Hes a former inmate and drug addict who's pretty much obsessed with my mom and is a major creep with charges of stalking and spying on women which is all you need to know about him.

My sister lives in my sunroom. There are windows on every wall that touches the outside in there. To solve this we put curtains up but you can see through them at night when the lights are on. Tomorrow I'm gonna help her put quilts over them so dont worry about this.

The reason I'm bringing it up however - we use to hear this sound. We thought it was just wind against the glass. But one night I was hanging out in her room and I put my head up against a window. When I released it, it was that sound exactly. We couldnt replicate it no matter how hard we tried. So it's highly likely someone had been peering into her window and weve been unknowingly hearing it all this time.

She also hears tapping at times - whatever, we have a tree, maybe shit is falling down at night. But there is one instance I will never ever ever ever forget ever as long as I'm alive. It was about 12 am. I was sitting on sis's bed, my back to the window. This bent the curtain in a way that you could see my ass there if you were trying. Right fucking behind me, three taps. Loud as day. Immediately I shot up and went into the garage to go to the backyard. We shone a light, didnt see anything. But we did hear, distinctly, and loud as day, mumbling in the distance. Sounded like it was coming from someone either insanely drunk or fucked up on drugs.

Fast all the way forward to today - and this is where shit is starting to scare me. I stumble upon a bunch of my old videos. And theres this from 3 months ago. Basically I got bored at night and started recording myself. It's just something I do when I'm bored. Suddenly my cat, who's an outside cat, hops up on my window. So I open the window to let her in. I make a joke about the stalker, and the video didnt catch it but I hear a fucking whisper outside. And my cat turns around right after.

Heres the video:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/14kdtFt5VvgmK6mIDrIoKO9a779DObTE5/view?usp=drivesdk

I dismissed this initially because i must of just been hearing something right? But when I stumbled upon it today I notice something else.

This white object:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/14cwf3G21cLGMWkEkvam370llgt9bR1zW/view?usp=drivesdk

This is not in the first part of the video. Indicating somehow the lighting changed after I cloaee the window, and this thing became visible. Better yet, this object is not in that part of my yard at all nor ever has it been or anything like it. I know the backyard the most because I am the one who has to do all yardwork. It looks like a blanket or something but then theres something else on it? It's really strange. You can clearly see especially in the video that it is not a reflection. If you have any ideas please tell me.

Me and a dude came across a dude and girl. They seemed crazy from what I remembered and i don’t know why but I grabbed the girl and slit her throat twice and I can still see me doing it and the blood and how Easy it looked. I can’t remember what happened to the dude tho and that’s when I woke up 10 minutes before my alarm did. 

Oh and all my life I couldn’t physically hit anyone in my dreams and now I can. Is that weird cause when I asked other people if they can hit in their dreams they say they can’t either.

She said that her supplier was on strike then I complained and asked her that if she knew this, why didn’t she let me and other customers know so that we could get our refund earlier due to the delay. I wouldn’t have known about the delay if i didn’t email her twice.

On the 22nd she said that she will issue a refund. It is now the 1st of november and she has told me after many emails from me, that it takes her 2 hours to get to the branch to issue a refund to myself and that she is going to do it on a day that she is not busy...

Surely that is wholly unprofessional? My bank have said that I need to ask her again for a refund and if she still refused to prioritise it then i can start a process of the bank being able to get my money back.

What should i do ?

Do i wait for her to issue it to me, or take it up with the bank ? it’s been over 5 weeks now dealing with this.

ThrowRa

So I’ve been dating my boyfriend for almost 3 years now and we live together. We definitely have our ups and down but have had a really good relationship up until recently. We had a rough patch a few months ago that triggered some serious trust issues for me. He started being slightly more distant so I started going through his phone all the time(I know I feel like shit about it) because I just had a feeling that there had to be something. Sure enough I found some shit alright. He had girls with dicks and transgender porn on his phone. I thought “weird”, so I dug deeper. I found out he had accounts on multiple gay dating apps and transgender dating apps. One of them had a bio that said “...who likes to take dick and eat ass..” I was instantly heartbroken and frankly, disgusted he would ever consider making a dating app let alone make multiple. I obviously confronted him about it and he had a complete mental breakdown trying to tell me all these different reasons why. He was “just curious”....He only “likes that stuff “”sometimes”” .... He “was just researching”(yes he actually said that) 
He swears up and down he’s completely straight. I personally don’t believe him and it’s been months since this happened and I still can’t get over it. I think about I everyday and feel like he’s hiding something from me. I wonder since he had an app where it said he likes to “take it in the ass and suck dick” that could mean he’s done that before, right? I don’t know what to think and I don’t wanna lose my relationship. Please share your thoughts/opinions.
Edit: Forgot to add, we’ve been dating for 3 years. I got chlamydia a few months ago. Obviously he did too. We got treated and somehow he convinced me he didn’t cheat.",01Nov2019,2

335,"I don’t know what to do, so I have this best friend and we actually met on reddit in late May and we’ve still been talking ever since, he was suicidal and I stopped him from committing, and he’s doing a lot better now. We’re both guys and  sophomores in high school but live halfway across the country from each other, he lives in Florida and I live in Texas. His mom even invited me to come visit them during the Christmas break and all expenses paid so I’m going to meet him and his parents but I’m having trouble because he’s very spoiled, like a lot even tho his parents are divorced and he went through depression but I’ve been through way more than him.

Like, I was raised by my grandparents all my life because my mom is addicted to weed and she had me at 17 and had my half sister at 19, my dad has never been in my life and has ghosted me, he never even sent one letter when he was in prison, he got out like 3 years ago but still he should still be there for me. My sisters dad does everything for her and always gives her money and takes her places even tho he’s a truck driver and doesn’t make a lot of money and my dad is a supervisor and makes a lot of money. I never considered my grandpa a father figure because I always knew he was my grandpa and that’s the only way I saw him, and he died from leukemia 3 and a half years ago. So I’ve never had a father figure.


 Anyways, my friend is always complaining, he’s never really had to work for anything, I’m pretty well off but I’m still gonna get a job and I’ve been applying but he’s never really had to pay for anything. He’s always saying he’s depressed and all of that and I don’t blame him after the hell he went through throughout his life, but still, I went through a lot more than him, rich dad and his dad hangs out with him a lot and his mom. But all he does is complain. I really want to tell him the honest truth, that he’s a spoiled white bitchy brat who always complains and has no regards for others who have it worse and that’s he’s never had to work for anything and that I’m jealous of his whole fucking life (by the way I’m black so I kinda thought that was important to add and y’all know the stereotypes, black dads leave their kids). I’ve always set aside my problems for his and all we talk about are his problems. Like the entire conversation is about him. I love him like a brother and I would never cut contact with him but it’s hard sometimes to come up with ideas to help him and I don’t think my problems are worse than his it’s just hard sometimes.

 Should I tell him the honest truth or just keep it to myself?",01Nov2019,1

Now to the problem, my dad used to tell me that i won't  achieve anything and i won't be able to do this and that but that's in the past. I grew up to be quite a likeable person and grew confident about myself but i guess there is still some fracture of selfhate left. Ever since me and my ex fell out of love, life seems to be passing by so quickly and my drive to achieve something became smaller and smaller. Imo i need someone worth to live for to actually get the best out of my life. Has anyone felt the same and has overcome this somehow?

346,"So I wrote like 30 detailed versions of this post but the more I go into details the more confusing I sound so here’s my best short version:

I am 23, moved to a new city two years ago and meet a lot of people and there is a lot of fun going on around me and despite seeking genuine solid connections for years I can’t build them. If I go out to a party chances are I’ll run into a few people I’ve partied with before. But these are just Party Chums. I haven’t found more than one or two people that I actually spend time with. Last night I was at a party and talked to a lot of people but I still ended up going home alone at the end of the night. It was still early and I knew there was shit going on all around me but I didn’t know anyone and didn’t know where to go so I just went to bed 

I might have to move back home this following summer cause it’s really expensive here and I’m so incredibly anxious about it cause I haven’t been able to make those little things happen. I don’t know how to get over this anxiety. I’m going to seek out as I possibly can but I feel like time is running out and I keep failing. 

I woke up in the middle of the night a few hours ago and immediately started thinking of being in that crowd of people by myself looking around at everyone hitting on each other and running around with their friends and wondering what the fuck I was doing. I can’t stop thinking about it and I can’t go back to sleep and I have work soon

351,"And I’m all growed up now...I think. I’m a 35 y/o childless female (just so you know, I guess)

I’m about to impart on a new beginning in 6 months.  In the past year I have lost my best money making job due to a fire and I have gotten divorced. I own a rental house (my mother’s childhood home) that I inherited when she passed 2 years ago. 5 bedrooms, 2 full bathrooms. Two of the bedrooms and one of the bathrooms is in the basement where there is also a fridge and wet bar (It could basically be another apartment down there). The house has no mortgage so I own this free and clear (except taxes that are about $2500/year so..basically nothing). 
When I inherited the house 2 years ago it had a renter who had been there since 2008 and my mom passed in 2017. He was a great renter and paid his rent on time every month ($900) and anytime something broke he would fix it and just take out of rent (he’d send pics of receipts of things that broke that he would fix).  About 2 months after my mom passed, he called and said he needed to move out (I should also say he was never on a lease with my mom). He moves out and I go in and do a bunch of updates to it. I spend about $6000 in renovations (that I’m still paying for btw) and I find a new renter. I get her into a 2 year lease at $1000/month. Everything is peachy. 
Then I get divorced last winter. Then 6 months ago my job burnt down. I just finally decided that maybe when this lady’s lease is up in 6 months, I should just move in there. At this point, I’m not saving any money and her rent is a wash. I am making half of what I used to make at my new job (it’s a small town I currently live in and not too many options to make money). I am literally living month to month to pay my bills. My rent is $1000 and that is what she pays me. I am usually waiting by the phone waiting for her rent money to hit my account. She never pays on time and I have it in her lease that she has until the 5th before she gets a late fee and she waits until the 5th to direct deposit every month. And there I am, anxiously waiting for her money to come through so I can pay my rent. It’s a sick cycle and I’m done. I think it’s the best thing for me to move back to where I don’t have rent to pay and back to a city that is in a metro area with way more job opportunities. Right?! Lol
But my job was really why I was here. I have pretty much been a waitress and bartender since I graduated high school. I never finished college and have been stuck with the restaurant life for the good easy cash every night. For example, why would I go get a job where I’m working 40 hours a week making $10/hr. After taxes I’m making like maybe 300/week. When I’m working at a decent restaurant, I can EASILY make $150 in a 5-close shift (we closed at 10).
Serving and bar tending has always been the best pay for the least amount of time being at work. Also the most pay for someone without a college degree. My ex worked for a body shop and made $22/hr and worked full time. I ALWAYS made more money than him and I worked 20 hours a week. 
Here’s the question...why change careers? The main downfalls of serving to me are nights and weekends and benefits. When your a server or bartender you make your money on the night and weekend shift and it always seems almost everyone you know does all their activities on the weekends. You also probably won’t have health insurance or vacation time when you are a server. Those are the 2 negatives for me. 
But I don’t know if it’s my age, but I am trying to decide if I need to continue serving or find something else to do.  
If I do change careers, what are good “real” jobs for ex bartenders? 
Sorry so long.",01Nov2019,5
352,"I have extremely terrible intimacy and rejection issues. I was looking forward to this person coming over, both of our dates went well so I thought it would be fun. 

Every time I am about to see them though, I get fearful I will say something stupid or talk about my past and scare them away. Last time I saw them, I started talking about my family and had to stop, my face turned red when I realized I was telling this person intimate details of my life.

Anyway it comes time and they said they are leaving soon and instead of saying great see you then I just unconsciously sent maybe another time. I keep telling myself I’ll be alone forever, and to just accept it. I ended up drinking all night, I usually smoke pot but I’m worried I’ll be randomly drug tested by my workplace.

353,"I've worked part time as a general construction worker for an agency since July. I've done it for a couple months.

I wanted to get literally any other job but the timing, rent and various expenses got in the way.

The problem is that I don't know whether I should be okay knowing I haven't broken even on the certificate. A spotter only makes about $0.50 - $1 more an hour so at most it would take 120-60 hours of work and there's no guarantee I get a spotter job immediately either.",01Nov2019,1

365,"Hi, so a couple weeks ago, I (17F), was trying to find a ride home after school. I live relatively far from my school and the weather was bad so walking was not my ideal option. While I was sitting in our atrium, one of the most loved substitute teachers at the school came up to me and asked why I was at school so late (but it was only 4pm) I explained that I was trying to find a ride but I shouldn't be there for too long. He then asked where I lived and offered me a ride home.

I responded ""I don't think you're allowed to do that"" and he awkwardly looked down and said ""Yeah, probably not. In case something happened."" but then he went right back to regular conversation and left.

He used to substitute in my classes very often, twice a day. After the incident, he subbed for my class once the week of the incident. I haven't had him since. The teacher who always has him sub for his class always talks about how ""Mr. XYZ usually subs but for whatever reason someone else will be there"".

I don't know if I'm the reason why he stopped substituting for my class since it was very awkward and totally shifted my view of him. He knows that if he does substitute for his class, my desk will be right next to the teacher's desk. I don't know if I should say anything or just push it aside since it seems like he won't substitute for my teachers anymore.

I had a similar issue during my sophomore year and the administration pushed it aside due to a lack of evidence. I really don't know if it's worth the extra stress and struggle to let them know what happened just for them to sweep it under the rug.

I'd talk to the school's social worker, but I feel like they have to report it. It might be my best option. 

The incident indicates that he might do the same thing to another student. And maybe next time they won't decline like me. The biggest issue is that I really don't know what his intentions were.

I'd love to hear all perspectives on this. Thanks.",01Nov2019,4

369,"There’s a few things that have been on my mind a lot lately. Firstly, some background info, I am mentally ill and have chronic illnesses as well. I am diagnosed with OCD, C-PTSD, Bulimia, Chronic anxiety, and depression. I also live with almost on the once a weekly migraines and live at least the majority of my life with a headache at the least. I am on medical insurance, and see a psychiatrist, therapist, and neurologist for all of these things. I also struggle with Menorrhagia, and am almost always on my period. I have an appointment coming up with an OBGYN, but my periods cause me pretty much constant pain and discomfort due to cramping. I am anemic and have an iron deficiency, which I do take iron almost every day now because of it. Because of all of these things, I take upwards to ten pills a day. 

My PTSD has lead to me developing mild agoraphobia, and I am terrified to leave my house alone. I am scared of most strangers and live with horrible paranoia. At my worst (usually unmediated) I even hallucinate. I work a full time job that I do enjoy, and get paid well. I love my co workers and my boss, and already have promotions set up for in the future. But I still find myself panicking and dreading leaving the house and being at work for long periods of time. Being away from everyone and away from home makes me easily break down. As much as I love my job and love where it’s heading, I literally am always at a constant 6-7 on the anxiety scale at work, and at a 9 panicking trying to convince myself to go in in the first place. Not to mention, my migraines are brought on mostly by stress, and these headache feel like someone is hammering an ice pick into my brain. My face and mouth go numb, and at worst I lose sight in my eye and vomit. Once they happen, it takes sleeping and my meds to get them to go away, and sometimes even THAT doesn’t work. 

Being this way I know is something I can’t help. I won’t go into all of the details surrounding trauma that led to my PTSD and anxiety, but it’s deeply rooted and even after years of therapy I am still struggling. I can’t help my health and the things that happened to me, but I know I can control how I am now and how to cope with these things. As of right now, I’m on meds and seeing my doctors regularly. I have a very supportive partner who loves me and really helps me too. 

Yet, I still feel guilty for even thinking about possibly going on disability. I nearly applied once but panicked and stopped halfway through the app. I didn’t tell anyone cause I felt like I was being weak. I was also raised that being on disability means you’re just choosing to be lazy. I don’t believe this and I don’t think that’s true, but I have that fear that maybe I’m not sick enough. Maybe I don’t deserve it. 

I have wanted this job I have for so long and am going to train to become a dog groomer, which is a job I really think I will enjoy. I have been aiming for it for a while, but my mental and physical health often put me out of work, or make work extremely stressful for me. But I also know I like doing the work I do from home (I am an artist part time who works off of commission). I know disability would help me and take a load of off my mental health and stress, but I feel like the guilt is holding me back. 

I’ve always always wanted to go to college. I graduated high school in 2015 and didn’t feel emotionally mature enough to go to college. My mental health was at it’s worst and I was barely passing through high school. I wanted my college experience to be better than that so I focused on seeing doctors. Then work became priority and helping my family, life happened and I’ve been putting it off. But college is something I want so badly and don’t know where to start and I’m kinda on my own on figuring out what to do. Probably just community for basics and maybe something more for my degree. 

I don’t know. My world and brain has been like a storm cloud for so long now and I’m so at a loss of what to do. Any advice or maybe someone who’s been somewhere similar would really help. Thank you in advance. I know this was long winded.",01Nov2019,1
371,"Tl;dr My friend is stressing me out, how do I tell her without hurting her feeling? I also kinda went on a rant sorry.

I recently reconnected with a old friend at the start of this semester. At first it was great but slowly things just have been bothering me. 

1. *She tells me she doesn't like me hanging out with her friends*
We're in a club together and she usually has to leave early because she has a 6 o'clock curfew (we're adults in college btw). At first I would go with her, y'know because she's my friend blah blah. But it kinda sucks when you only get spend 30 minutes somewhere you're having a good time at, so I would stay behind and go home when I felt. She of course never hesitates to make me feel guilty. She even said to me on more than one occasion ""I don't like when you hang around my friends when I'm not there."" Huh? Mind you we met all of these people at the same time.

2. *She makes me feel guilty for being alive.*
She gets a crush on a guy as soon as she meets them. A few of those guys she happened to have a crush on were interested in me. Let me emphasize 'interested' because y'know that doesn't mean that will go anywhere. But now when she tells me she likes and guy (every other day), she makes sure she ends with ""but y'know he probably likes you, since every guy does."" What? I would always end up reassuring her, but lately I haven't really been saying anything to that. 

Going off of that, I was talking to this guy at club. First day of meeting him, we were just having casual convo. I thought he was pretty cool and chill so we exchange ig. Turns out she met him a few days before me and has a crush on him🙄. She asks for his ig and starts dming him. Then she starts asking what him and I are talking about (all of this is the same day, different time). I don't really care at this point and tell her look ""if you actually like this guy and aren't comfortable with me talking to him, then I won't"" (at that point we've only dmed 'hey' to each other). He had stopped responding to her after a few days and for weeks she would complain about it, while also talking about the ten other guys she talks to and likes. 
I end up running into him at lunch and eat with him, again another chill convo. So I decide to do my friend a favor and tell this dude she's interested in him. He looks back at me confused saying ""how she never even talks to me that much, whenever I see her she doesn't talk."" Long story short he tells me he was interested in me and thats why he got my ig. I try to shut that down immediately and tell him we should just keep this friendly. I feel like a few of you know where this is going. Over a course of a few weeks I keep running into him and at first it was me trying to convince him that my friend is a beautiful girl that he should be interested in. But that got old so I stopped and just got to know him a little better.  Ughh it makes me so guilty to say but I am interested in him now. I know it breaks girl code but I am interested. She doesn't know yet and I'm dreading to tell her even though she's on to the next dude. 

3. *She skips class to hang out with a bunch of guys*
This one is honestly none of my business but it just really bothers me that she puts that over school. Her parents are strict and don't let her out the house by herself unless she has class (again yes we are adults). I understand why she does it a bit but I can't fully wrap my head around it. I really don't want her to fail or end up getting dropped from a class. Whenever I tell her that she  should try focusing on school a bit more she tells me school is not even that important. 

Thanks for reading this, I know it sounds really childish. I haven't had friends in like 3 years because I did cyber school, so I'm not really sure how to address this with her without being harsh. It's really stressing me out and I already have class to do that. anyway I kinda went on a rant but my question is how do I address any of this to her? She kinda sensitive and I don't wanna lose her as a friend. She a great girl and is super caring. Sorry for any errors.",01Nov2019,1
372,"(So to clarify real swift, I know this might not be the best place to ask such question but I lowkey do not know where to ask certain questions on Reddit, since I only know so much about these ""certain"" subs and whatnot, but I need to ask this or I am going to go fucking insane lmao)

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, so it is around 7:30 here in good old Canada, and I pretty much woke up at 8 PM on the 31st and now and pretty much going on no sleep for a while, I got bored and decided to watch the Madagascar movie on Netflix, now I should clarify that I have (least to my knowledge) no programs other than chrome, but those videos that were on my tabs would have no real reason to say anything even relevant to that.

&amp;#x200B;

Now around the scene where the lion was about cut the line or some shit, I hear a voice say, and I quote, ""Donate brain cells"", now in my sleepy daze I thought the person in the movie said that I was about to chuckle but when I reminded to hear it, it was gone, well more like not there. Now the voice was definitely a child, not under 13 at most, not the greatest microphone, it was maybe something you could pick up for a good 20-30 dollars, since it sounded like the microphone was specifically turned on that very moment, unless my PC is fucking haunted and this is the voice of some fucking poltergeist that took over my PC, at most I am shook. Now I do not really download random shit from the internet as I know very well about viruses and shit, but today I did download like 4 mods for GTA 5, they were from a pretty well-known mod website, and now I am either going fucking insane or there is some type of trojan or some shit. October is over and the spooks are still a thing I guess, well give me yalls opinions, I am running a Windows Security Scan thing, should I also download avast? I have not used that program since 99.9% of the time, I am safe on the internet and I do not click nor download anything that looks sketchy af, so tell me, did I somehow make my brain hears it as if it came from my speakers or could I have thought of it and just kinda said it out loud in my brain causing myself to hear it except nothing was actually heard? Yeah, let's just say this shit got me fucked up lmao. So what could be happening?",01Nov2019,1
373,"I am in college and had a class with a girl my age. She laughed the hardest at stuff I say, smiles a lot at me and to stuff I say. She said hi when she saw me ask what's up. We had to do peer reviews and she came to my table sat next to me at my table. She sat between me and a woman Im friends with, talked to her she said something, smiled at me and looked deep into my eyes and didn't stop smiling and it felt awkward, if I didn't break the eye contact she probably would've continued. She was making forced eye contact and scratching her head while resting her head on her hand. One day I sat down waiting for class and sat with a woman I give a lot of attention to in class and she came in for class walked over and started waiting very close to me, hovering over standing in my personal space, she walked right in front of me and started getting close to me and I could smell her but she had her back to me. This was the closest she's been to me. There was a whole room not a lot of other people. When I talked about another girl that likes me that I don't like and asking for advice from a woman I talk to in college to not lead her on. She joined the conversation said that the other girl will continue pushing and I have to ignore all together and tell her I'm not interested. This was the biggest response I got from her and longest convrsation. She started this stuff after I asked for advice, . I told her someone said my hair looks like the clown from it and she said that's not nice. I saw her in the hall one day we stopped seeing each other in class. She saw me and stopped and asked me how my classes were this semester and she had the biggest smile on her face. I ask her stuff and it's like she has a hard time with conversation but has the biggest smile on her face talking to me. I said my advisor would kick me out bc he knows I smoke pot and she says ""awww"" I do get an awkward forced vibe from her. I asked her how her classes were and it went over her head. I crossed paths walking on a small walkway and she didn't look me in the eye was looking down and said hey very softly, unassertively. Most recently we had to go to a lecture in the biggest lecture hall on my campus. I was sitting in a spot in the front and in the middle and she came in saw me and she came in and sat 2 empty seats away from me.",01Nov2019,0
374,"So, I was talking to this guy on a dating app, and we kind of hit it off, so we started to message each other normally. 

Everything was going smoothly and we even talked about meeting, but he stood me up 3 times because of his job. Now I don't know what to think...I'm kind of waiting for him to talk about meeting up, but it's just not coming. 

I asked him if he really wanted to meet me and he said yes, and he keeps texting me...so I thought he was interested, but now I'm not so sure.

I'm afraid to ask again; I don't want to sound  desperate. It's just that he seems so sweet and funny, I'm tired of guys talking to me only to have sex,and I thought he was different (I know, cliche).

383,"I used to attend music classes at a business run by a friend of my mother. The atmosphere was very positive, but there were serious issues with the classes and his behaviour. There has been no progress in team classes of theory for the past 7 years (not an overstatement), in some cases he hadn't payed the teachers and many students started having private lessons instead of continuing with his business, ran for the local elections and wanted the students to play for free for his pre-election party, used the final show to advertise for his candidacy and more. I've tried talking to him, both about the classes and a personal problem with my teacher, namely that he was offended when I asked for regular lessons (we were in a relationship, big mistake, didn't make it in separating emotional and work issues). Said teacher had spoken ill of both students and teachers at that business and hadn't been involved for over a year.

Now, there was another issue that I think wasn't resolved properly. We were told the pricing includes three instruments and my mother asked the teacher if it was ok not to pay him, to which he replied in surprise because he hadn't been clocking any hours with me since we were together. This led to my mother reacting angrily and refusing to pay for that last 7-8 months. I'm not ok with this, but either way plenty of the students were disgruntled for plenty of reasons and I decided to write a bad review mentioning the stale classes and overpricing and leaving out anything concerning the teachers. I payed special attention to not make it personal and my classmates all agreed to what I had written.

Next morning I woke up to an angry message from the teacher, plenty of swearing at me and (to my confusion) plenty of swearing at my mother, calling her evil and saying that she is trying to manipulate me in order to ruin our relationship. He texted her something along the lines of ""you'll drown in your own shit evil witch, good riddance/die bitch"" and the gem ""mother, mum, some words you'll never hear because your daughter hates you"". I tried being civil and to focus whatever was going on on what I had actually written and away from conspiracy theories, but he kept offending and threatening. At some point he said that he has the right to say whatever he wants because I told him something bad (really, that was my bad) more than three years ago, to which I cracked, sent him a message about plenty of the things that have offended me over the course of our relationship, wished him well and told him that we'll talk when I pass by to take my stuff.

Now the owner of the business has spoken with my mother and has been civil, so I suspect that it was the teacher who made it into something huge (I mean, it's a bad review on facebook, come on). I stopped replying to the teacher and he started texting (again to call me evil this time), calling, he called my godfather, started trying to contact my friends and today I realised that he tried to get into my facebook account. I'm at a loss and this behaviour has started to seriously worry me, it seems to be getting out of hand. It's the first time I'm seriously standing up to him and backing it up, but I find myself thinking of whether I should reply to him. I'm also not sure how much this has to worry me, could I be overreacting? One text was ""I'm coming over"" and then another one ""I'm not, don't worry"". He hasn't been physically abusive, apart from once, but this is still creeping me out. I'm just glad that my friends are here for me and have been very supportive.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Left a bad review on a music school I attended, teacher/partner of 3+ years flipped, sent offensive and threatening messages to me and my mother and ever since I stopped replying he started calling relatives and friends, sending me creepy texts and tried to log in to my facebook account. Honestly, I just don't know what to do and how to react to this.",01Nov2019,1

work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‘mines 21st’ and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays eh (Sam was laughing about it a bit) then Sue said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted seriously like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’ and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here?

385,"My son (18) is in his first term at college and it's not going well. He is crazy smart, but has never had much drive to do anything other than show up for class. Getting poor grades has never bothered him. He took a ton of advanced courses in high school so he managed to graduate with an 3.9 GPA and a full tuition scholarship to a state school. I could go on about how I feel that the 

Fast forward a few months and he's getting along well with his roommates and growing as a person, but his grades suck and he's not going to be eligible to keep the scholarship next term. He's about to declare a major and that concerns me. He has changed his mind a few times already and I feel like he's going to choose a major that sounds interesting, but isn't attainable for him. Hell, he almost didn't graduate high school because he never met with his counselor and didn't plan his courses and almost didn't take and easy required class. So on the one hand it's a step in the right direction that he met with his advisor, but I'm beginning to lose faith in him and all I can think of are the tuition bills that I now have to cover. 

He's coming home in a couple of weeks for Thanksgiving and I want to have a conversation with him about what his plans are. I hope to be able to give him a list of alternatives to college. I think he could struggle through and eek out a degree in 5 or 6 years, but there has to be a better option for him. I just can't think of what that would be. I want to help him find the thing that sparks his interest and drives him because he's not there yet. My theory is that he can always go back to school when he's ready because he doesn't seem ready now.

I've considered pushing the military - which I did when I was his age - but I'm on the fence and I don't think he would want to do that. There's the Peace Corps, which I only know of and I honestly have no idea what they really do or if that is truly an option. 

What else is there for a directionless 18 year old guy to do? I'm not going to push him to drop out of school, but I do want him to be aware of his options. Too many young adults waste a lot of time and money in school and I don't want him to feel like he's heading down that path.",01Nov2019,1

I also hate ""you need more experience"". Oh because I did not cry enough ? I hate Ping Pong and I don't enjoy it. Honestly, I just hate sports, I don't enjoy it at all.

And I hate people who are good at it. Particularly the ones who are like ""never tried it before, don't know why it was so easy"".

Most of the time, I don't consider myself human, because if I consider myself human, it means that I am inferior as a human being because I cannot do what most humans can do, I cannot understand what most humans understand, I cannot feel what most humans feel.

Today, though, there’s snow on the ground. My immediate concern is leaving my dog when I go to work tonight. I don’t want her to freeze! But you’re not supposed to leave space heaters unattended, even though mine is new and reasonably good quality... the two solutions I can think of are 

1.) leave space heater running anyway on a flat wooden surface away from flammable shit 

Or

2.) leave her coat on her and a hot water bottle on her favorite chair (and hope she doesn’t chew up said hot water bottle) 

It’s obviously not as cold inside as it is outside so I’m not worried about her actually getting frost bite or anything...but it’s still cold! I feel so bad leaving her! 

Larger problem, of course, is the rental company. I live in a building that I know to be owned by some out of state slum lords, so I assumed they were just waiting as long as they could to turn on the heat. Now I’m slightly more inclined to believe now that there actually is a mechanical problem they’re trying to fix (with the weather like this they’re getting so many calls, it can’t possibly be worth it to them just to save a few bucks on heating costs...right...?) I plan on arguing down my next rent check based on the hundreds of bucks in my electrical bill it’s costing to run this space heater. Any general tips on dealing with POS landlord is welcome of course.

He got a girlfriend a little over a year ago, and I've only seen her a handful of times and the only time I've ever spoken to her, it was a quick exchange of words in a group conversation. Over the past couple of weeks she sent me a message saying 'hi' and saying she really liked my photography. I said thanks and that was that.

The other day she sent a 'hey' to my two Instagram pages, and we had some small talk, and she complimented my photography again, and said 'you know, if you ever need a model, I'm here' (she used the emoji with the smug smile and closed eyes). I should note, I am not a professional photographer, nor do I offer any kind of services. I just like photography and sharing it every now and then. 

Regardless, she said she wanted to go to the beach these days and if I was okay with it she could pick me up and we could go together... I said okay sure, because I am bored as heck this week.

Here's the thing. I immediately checked their profile, and her boyfriend's profile says he's single, but they still like each others photos and she is constantly tagging him in posts. She on the other hand, still has older photos of her with him posted, but aside from that, there are no signs they're still together. I should note, she has a little kid, and as I found out when I checked her profile, she is in early pregnancy stages. 

This whole thing is weird. There's no reason for her to like me since I'm not attractive and I have hardly ever met her, secondly if she just wants me to take some photos of her why would she have used those blushy emojis, and why did she beat around the bush so much. Secondly, I would not want to get beat up by her boyfriend because he's pretty big (assuming she wants to cheat on him potentially) and I'm not up for that.

I should also note that I asked her how he was, and she said 'fine' with that same weird emoji. And this morning she said she might wanna go out tomorrow.

This person has been with me through both of my parents deaths, middle school depression, break ups, and achievements such as graduating high school, and college. We’ve talked almost everyday for 12 years. We are both of the same sexual orientation. (Both females) and we always talk about what we want in a partner and we basically list each other. 
I told her I liked her when I was 14 and she denied me because she was dating someone and didn’t feel that way then.  And we over came that, and we’re still best friends. 
Now I should mention that we’ve never met. She lives up north (like right on the edge of the US and Canada) and I’m in Florida. We do have plans to meet next year when she’s in vacation. 
Also I’ve Skyped her many times so I know she’s real so this is 100% not catfish.

420,"Hello everyone,

I am 22 years old. A lot of unfortunate things have been happening in my life. My family is kinda broken and my mom and I don't see eye to eye because she isn't in her right mind (delusional).
Me and my ex fiance broke up about a month and a half ago. She often too advantage of everything I would do for her. I did everything for her to make her happy and the day we were going to put 1000 down on the wedding venue she told me im not in love with you. So we tried to make the relationship work a little longer. Till eventually a month or so later she broke up with me saying it would be better to be friends because that how she already sees me. 
This has been very difficult for me. She doesn't seem hurt at all. She still takes me for granted even as a friend. She only calls me or texts me when its convenient for her or she has nothing better to do. I have finally told her that I can't talk to her because she obviously doesn't care enough about a friendship with me to talk to me. Then stupid me told her it was just temporary. She said im glad it's just temporary because I want to be friends with you. 
Someone told me ""the best way to get over someone is to get under someone else"" I am not that kind of person and I don't believe in that.
ANYWAY, I need a good hobby. Nothing too expensive but something to distract me to get over this and feel accomplished. I play video games but I consider that more of a distraction than a hobby.

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a bar job  myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise especially for only getting a bar job. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

425,"I (27/f) recently found out that I'm about 8 weeks pregnant. I work for a relatively small company with less then 10 employees and one of them being another, and the only other, woman in the office besides one of the business owners. Let's call her Tracy. Tracy is roughly in her mid thirties to early forties and about three months ago shared with me some of her past experiences with her pregnancies. She has had a few miscarriages and two stillbirths and understandably she gets emotional when speaking about those experiences but not emotional in a way that you would expect. She never cries, she just seems really angry. I started to notice this behavior before I actually knew where it stemmed from, particularly when I had shared with her earlier this year that my younger sister announced she was pregnant. She asked ""your younger sister is pregnant?"" I said, ""yes, and our youngest sister just had her first baby a few months ago"" to which she replied ""sluts"". As I said, I was unaware of her experiences at that time so I immediately told her to watch her mouth. After finding out her experiences I was far more empathetic as to why she responded the way she did, still not ok, but I was more willing to forgive.

So my question is, knowing that this is clearly a sensitive topic for Tracy, what would be the best way to tell her without making it seem like i'm throwing it in her face? I contemplated NOT telling her but i'm going to start showing eventually so it seems like telling her may be the best option.

432,"First of all, This is a bit of A long and sad one so I’ll try to summarise for those of you in a bit of a rush below! 


So I was informed by my mother the other day that our cat may have been found dead at the side of the road in a pool of blood, (evidently been hit) knowing mom couldn’t handle the sight of our little friend in such a state, I requested the image was sent to me, lo and behold; that was my little buddy lying there.

Or so I thought... still believe I should be thinking so technically.

So I was calm, yknow? I had to be with everyone else inches from crumbling to pieces, about half hour later I head to the road, it’s less than a minute away just outside the library, I go inside and have a chat with some people inside, and they claimed he’d been found and taken by their apparent ‘owner’.. and as shocked as I was, I felt a sense of rather selfish relief, even though I still see my cat in that photo.

Apparently the bloke who took off with the body broke down on the way back saying he had another cat and that he’d have to break the news to his children, which is of course an upsetting tale, but not the one I was expecting to hear by any means.

I have no info on the person that took the cat, yet to hear of the cats microchip scanning after an apparent visit to the vet.... so it would seem as though it’s not my little feline companion.


Few other details; the cat is out a lot, brings dead mice to The door like a little badass. He’s effectively my cat, as that was the lie we told our grandmother so she would accept his existence in the family, eventually he just grew on me and we’ve been closer than most, considering his anti-social behaviours. Wouldn’t put it past the little scoundrel to have more than one group of humans to scavenge food from, and I haven’t seen him since hearing of his “death”, there just isn’t enough information to determine an outcome and it’s driving me a little insane.
Any thoughts or theories are beyond welcome, I ask for nothing more than speculation.
I have the image of him found, and a few images I’ve taken from over the years. If anyone would like to see them both and make their own assumptions I would be happy to oblige.


Tl:dr - my cat is essentially shrödinger’s and there’s fuck all I can do but sit and wait for him to arrive alive or evidence of it being him who was hit by a car to instead, quite the conundrum.

Last night I saw Ween with some friends and was having a great time until about halfway through their set, my vision began to get a little blurry like I wasn't get enough blood to my head. I figured it would go away after a few seconds but it just got worse until I was pretty much completely blind. I could see some movement, just very shadowy almost like someone turned the lights off. I grabbed my friend until he realized something was wrong and he caught me when I lost control of my body and starting falling over. I was very disoriented and couldn't make sense of anything, I just kept stumbling over and it felt like I was constantly spinning. I gained a little more awareness when they got me to the bar and got me some water, so maybe I was just dehydrated but I can't find much that matches these symptoms and I didn't feel dehydrated prior to the episode. My friends got me out of the crowd and sat down and I began to feel much better. Right now I'm a college student living across the country from my family and I want to tell my parents to get their opinion but do you think I should wait for this to happen again before seeing a doctor or something? I've read that temporary blindness is pretty serious usually. I wasn't drinking at all but I took 2 hits of a little weed and I'm worried what happened might be written off because of that. I just don't really know what my next step is and I'm worried it might happen again. Interestingly enough, I got a weird sense of clarity afterwards where my vision felt very crisp and I felt very aware of what was happening around me and in touch with my emotions. Anyway, sorry for the brick of text I'm just a little spooked.",01Nov2019,1
434," I  (F,16) usually only hang out with two girls in my class, but sometimes,  the other girls join us, which isn't a problem for me, but they seem to  have a problem with me. It's nothing new for me, but a few days ago, they litrally walked away from me when I approched them and started gossiping again.

Why is it, that  they avoid me and what do they gossip about while they're at it?(maybe you know why other people show this behavior in your social circle)

About  me:I am pretty quiet when they're around, because I don't wanna make it  worse by saying something weird,am socially awkward and am a good  student.Do any of these qualify as a reason? Cause these are the only  ones I could come up with, cause I generally try to be friendly and helpful and am trying my best not to be very 'hateable'.

435,"So backstory, I am a 46 year old female. Me and my (2 years older) brother grew up in a very abusive household. Despite this, me and my brother were very close. Shortly after my brother had got a full time job at 16, he got into a very heated argument with our parents, chastising them for what they've put us through. He declared he never wanted to see or hear from them again, and left, understandably.

Unfortunately, that was the last time I heard from him. I tried finding him to no avail. He had apparently also left his job and found a new one according to his former employer.

32 years later, I find him on Facebook, I knew it was him. I was so excited to contact him.

When I tried contacting him, I was told to **** off and that he wants no contact with his ****** family.

I am still heartbroken. He was my closest friend growing up. I tried so hard these past few years to find him. I understand that he hates his parents, but we both loved each other growing up. :(",01Nov2019,67

444,"I had a falling out w this girl in high school. I’ll call her C. That was 3 years ago. We’ve tried to make amends but it would never last long. She’ll always follow me on social media again out of nowhere then block me for whatever reason. When I asked her why she even follows me again she never gives a direct answer. 

A year ago, I moved away from home &amp; I found out she lives here (college town)as well about a month or two after I’d moved. I was open to being cordial bc I was sick of the drama. We’re adults now. We always end up having mutual friends. She has told so many ppl that I bullied her. I’m tired of having to go back and tell everyone the story over and over, my friends know the truth. 

I have a job that one of our mutual friends also has. I’ll call her M. C has tried  to apply there 3 times since she found out I worked there. I would just consider it me being paranoid if she hadn’t done the same thing in our hometown at another job I had. I vented to M about the situation, and she informed our manager not to hire us together. 

About 2 weeks ago I clock into work, and my manager has C’s app in her hand and asks me the backstory. I said word for word, “I won’t put anyone out of a job but I wouldn’t want to work with her.” And she just ripped up the app bc she could see it would get messy. 

Well, M tells C about the incident &amp; even throws in a few lies. C gets upset and tweets abt me. I like the tweet bc I know it’s about me &amp; she instantly messages me. I told the truth. She blames a coworker (I’ll call her R) that is friends w M for telling her. I feel extremely hurt bc I’m close w R. I believed C bc she knew details someone that was there had to tell her. R and I talk about and it turns out R has never even spoken to C!! So it was M that told her. I blocked C because she was simply stirring up drama, and asked M why she would do that. She never answered. So I blocked her too. 

I apologized to R bc I was pissed at her and had immediately blocked her when I thought she’d betrayed my trust. We talked it out and everything was good. R and M worked together a few nights ago &amp; another coworker I’m close to overhear them talking about me. R is saying the exact opposite of what she told me to my face. I feel like I can’t trust her either anymore so I block her. She messages me asking why and I basically say bc there’s too much drama w all of us. I’ve never dealt w this much in my life. 

Am i being too trigger happy with the block button? I see it as a self preservation thing, like if I can’t trust you then you don’t deserve personal parts of me. Lemme know what you think and thanks for any and all advice :-)",01Nov2019,1

447,"
 When I graduated high school I went to my local cities college and decided to go into fine arts. It was a 3 year program, I did well and earned the diploma. In my final year I specialized in print making, specifically silk screen printing. I was thinking about applying to an art university and just continue school into the following year after graduation but decided making some money to live off is more important.

After I graduated I soon got a job screen printing for a local business. They were growing really fast when I joined and had a multi million dollar corporation offer them a contract. My bosses liked me and made me team Lead and offered me a raise. The issue is that the work was basically just glorified automated factory work. ""Team lead"" actually meant ""supervise everyone and every part of the process while you also work in production on the machines and push out 1000 products a day""  it was just insanity. I called a meeting and told them we needed more staff if we continue to get so much work, along with a list of other things I wont get into (safety hazards, unwarranted shift changes etc). They didnt listen at all so I quit three months after that meeting. 
I feel really broken and beat down after almost two years working at that place. It's like I saw the world through rose tinted glasses before that. It's like working 50 hours a week, busting my ass every single day with physical labour, hurt my soul a little. I love working, but sometimes it can be too much when you work in a manufacturing setting with a booming business.
Before I got that job, I was really keen on going to an art university .. but after seeing what a business can do and how much money my bosses made, I almost dont want to go to university at all and just start a business. It bums me out though, my dad really wanted me to go to university but I even see him becoming disillusioned by it the more we talk about it.
I still want to try and go to this university, but I also dont want to waste my time and money when I could be starting a business. I think uni would make me happy, but I'm scared of the risk of spending so much money in tuition. I feel like I'm at a weird crossroads where I'm totally unsure of what path to take.

I know for a fact they were the only ones eating and they’d often throw things in front of them. But rarely does it hit me, and if it did they’d usually say sorry. 

But now this time I didn’t know if they did throw it but it’s a good chance they did. I felt something hit the back of m head so I turned around trying to find if they threw something. But I didn’t see if it hit the floor or if it bounced off. I immediately asked if they threw something at me. 

They both denied it but one at a time they avoided my eye contact, I used my giant iPad as a mirror to look at them after that, they kept glancing back up at me as I glared at them from behind to see if they’d do it again. 

They didn’t and when I came out of the class, I ran my hands through my hair and I found fucking crumbs. 

I don’t know if I should confront them immediately next week or should I confront them if they do it again to make sure. I’m actually pissed off and I’ve never seen this disrespect before, yeah sure people talk behind my back but I’ve never had anybody fucking throw shit at me. 

I’m a senior and I’m pissed off, I don’t know these girls, and I try my best to be nice.

467,"I'm 22. I graduated from university over three months ago now. I have a first class masters degree in a highly respected subject at a very good institution. The only trouble is, I'm interested in essentially none of the related jobs. I'm not going to pretend that I've done nearly as much research as I should have, but in every single major type of job I've looked at that's available I lack the skills *and* I lack interest.

But the problem goes deeper than that. It's not just that each individual job doesn't appeal to me. It's that I have a fundamental dislike of and fear of working. I just don't feel like I could handle a traditional 9-5, especially one that involves dealing with tons of people. I'm one of the most awkward people you could ever meet. While you'd expect me to be sharp and bright based on my academics, I'm actually incredibly ""slow"" in most scenarios, especially when dealing with other people. I'm super neurotic and I zone out constantly. I doubt I could even handle an ""unskilled"" job, let alone a graduate job. And then there's the philosophical/political side of me which makes me want to vomit at the thought of working for virtually any large company. As for continuing with academics, I'm just not interested enough, or knowledgeable enough. And if I got a PhD, I'd still be in the same position I am now, most likely, unless I could hack it as an academic (doubt it).

Most people just get a job because they have to. That pressure would probably be good for me. But my parents would basically never kick me out, even though they themselves are still paying off a mortgage and are quite poor. Obviously I should be motivated to move out and become financially independent for their sake, but...I'm just not. That probably makes me a bad person, but it's true. I have no self-esteem. I have essentially no friends, so I talk very little each day. I guess that my social problems are probably constantly worsening due to this.

I'm not even doing much in the way of hobbies. Most people in my position would at least be playing a bunch of video games, reading a bunch of books, writing things, spending a lot of time in the gym, spending a lot of time walking, or whatever. Maybe they'd be honing a talent. I play guitar, but I'm fairly bad now since I played far less at uni. I sing, but my technique is garbage and it probably damages my voice every time. My ability is certainly not marketable. Otherwise, for the most part, I just sit at my computer refreshing pages and listening to music. And it's not like I'm not enjoying any aspects of my life. It's just that I know this isn't a way for anyone to live, by any reasonable metric.

473,"A few years ago I was in a fatal car accident. After the wreck, my leg has been super messed up. It took 6 months for it not only to function normally again but to look normal aswell.

Soon I realized my leg wasn't healing as it used too. Often cuts and bruises would take much longer to heal, unlike the other leg. Within a year, after walking for a bit, I would notice it hurting, then swelling.

Now it's been about three years after the accident and I can't stand for more than 30 minutes without having pain.

A few months ago I noticed a huge lump sticking out of that leg. It looked as if I had a golf ball coming out of my leg and hidden under my skin. Soon after this, I was taken to an urgent care office. Where I asked to take x-rays of where I hit my leg in the accident and where the lump is.

They only took x-rays of the lump, which extremely annoyed me.

The lump is a bone spur and larger than I originally thought. This spur is unusual in the terms of where its located. Usually these spurs are located at a joint, however, this isn't, it's just growing out of my leg, and it's painful.

If anything hits it, I limp for days, sometimes it acks, sitting certain ways I limp, walking for too long I limp, etc. this is driving me insane.

I'm scared, I can't get a job, I can't be as active as I used to be. Sometimes I do things I shouldn't, like hiking with my dad, because I love doing it. But it hurts so bad, and my leg swells during it. I'm miserable like this...

Not to mention, I can't depend on my parents forever, I'm already 20, and I am broke. I hate feeling like a freeloader and I feel bad for them in that aspect.

I can get surgery to remove it. However, that means it would most likely grow back within two-three years and I'd be going through this all over again... looking anything up information on it, it just leads me to spurs in joints. Usually ankle joints.

I don't know what to do, I'm terrified if it's this bad now, what would it be like in a year. Would I even be able to walk without intense leg pain?

What my dad's and I's theory is. I broke the leg in the accident, and since it wasn't looked at properly, it was left untreated and that's why the spur formed. We also believe I have shin splints form the incident. Right now, I'm blaming everything with what's wrong with my leg on the spur and possible shin splints. Because other than that, we don't know what's wrong and we don't know what to do.

Please help me, direct me in the right direction. Also, please, if you know of ways I can manage it before I can take medical action please do. Because I'm going to Israel next month and that's going to be hell with my leg how it is. Jerusalem alone is extremely steep, slippery, and we will be doing a lot of walking there.

I don't have a lot of history, but I know he had a problem with alcohol in the past, not sure what else. He had been sober for years. His kids are preschool-1st grade age, and I suspect starting his family probably had something to do with the lifestyle change.

He doesn't have steady income, and suffers from depression (probably related, not feeling like a successful man/father), and recently we found out his wife decided to separate because he had gone back to drinking and was getting worse and worse.

Since then, his wife and kids have moved out. I've seen him a few times picking up/dropping off kids and he seemed more depressed than in the past (not surprisingly). Now I've learned that he's using meth along with a lot of alcohol, which means he probably isn't getting any contact with his kids.

It seems like a very rapid decline, and I'm worried it's going to end tragically.

I'm not the type of person that takes on charity cases, I just feel the need to try to do what I can to trigger some kind of turn around for him, if that's at all possible.

I'm stuck in a weird situation. I have been renting a car for the better part of this year (it's a tldr story). I was rear-ended a few months ago, and I made a huge mistake when I didn't call the cops on site. The person who rear ended me gave me their phone # and I took pics of their license plate and proof of id. Later, when I checked the id, it was not even a dl. I got the car fixed by a local mechanic, and this lady ghosted me, never paying me for the repair work.

My car dealer won't accept the car since he says that it's not a proper repair job. The only way he says he'll accept is if I pay $5500 to fix it. The car is worth about $8000

I am planning to buy this car but he's pricing it significantly more than the kbb value ($1000-1500 more). My coworker has been insisting that all I need to do, is drop the car off and never bother about it. The dealer can't hold me accountable since it's a monthly agreement. He also said that I should leave the person (who hit me)'s info with the dealer and let him figure it out.

Any help I get over here will be really appreciated. Is my coworker correct? I don't plan to own this car too long, if I buy it, since I plan to move.

Anyways this year we’ve decided that we’re going to transform the house and my dad will have to get on board. My question is how? I’m after suggestions on things we can do to make the house feel festive. 

In terms of the house itself the space is rather condensed. Narrow hallway with only a living room and kitchen downstairs then small landing upstairs and everyone’s bedrooms and obviously the bathroom. She had this idea when we lived in a more spacious house. 

So how can we turn it into a Christmas wonderland without spending loads. We obviously have our Christmas tree and the usual decorations we put up but it’s usually all just in the living and nowhere else screams Christmas. 

Oh also we have two cats so no decorations that could be harmful for them

I went to his place to pregame with his roommates and had three mixed drinks. My antidepressants make me somewhat of a lightweight so I was feeling pretty good. We walked to the party and once I got there I made another mixed drink that I was sipping on. 

My roommate showed up to the party and after that everything went blank. From about 11pm to 6:30 am I have absolutely no recollection of what I did. I left my phone at the party and my roommate had to bring it home for me. I woke up this morning completely naked in the guys bed and immediately started freaking out. He said we had sex and then I started crying. I had my period (which he knew) and I had a tampon in which I had to fish out of my body because he totally disregarded that it was in me and had sex with me anyway. Apparently we showered together, had sex, and then I guess fell asleep until I came to. 

He kept reiterating that he didn’t know how drunk I was (he only started drinking recently and doesn’t have much experience with alcohol) and that I consented.

The break up was difficult. She moved to Montreal. I was afraid of long-distance, we tried to be friends, but I found it hard to see her with other people when I couldn\`t be with her and she was so far away. It sounds stupid now, because it is ....

493,"Prefacing this by saying I don’t know a ton about cars so my terminology may be wrong at points.  If something seems off, feel free to ask clarifying questions because it’s very possible I repeated something incorrectly.

A little over a month ago, I took my car in to have a recall fixed.  [Heres an article about the recall](https://www.autonews.com/article/20181025/OEM11/181029814/ford-recalls-almost-1-3-million-ford-focus-vehicles-in-the-u-s).  When I drove the car away, I noticed that the fuel gauge was still erratic (one of the symptoms of the recall). I called the dealership to let them know, and they said to keep driving, and it would fix itself after a few refills.  I refilled my tank twice, and the issue didn’t fix itself.  The third time I went to refill it, it stopped accepting gas after about 3 gallons, even though it was only a quarter of the way full.  Each subsequent time it was able to take less and less gas no matter how much gas was in the car.  Right now it is able to accept about 3/4 of a gallon before it shuts off the gas nozzle as if it’s full.  I’ve tried different nozzle positions, filling speeds, etc and nothing works.  A low fueling speed somewhat helps, but I still can’t even get 2 gallons of gas in at a time.  I can manage to get a full tank if I keep trying, but I don’t like to do this because it feels bad for the car.  Unfortunately, I drive my car for work and use at least a tank of gas a week so I don’t really have much of a choice.

I’ve taken my car in to the dealership twice.  The first time I took it in, they said they couldn’t find anything wrong with it.  They also did not understand what I meant when I said that I couldn’t put gas in the car.  I needed my car the next day for work so I took it home that day.  Two weeks ago the check engine light came on my car.  I took it in thinking that it was related to the gas tank, but it turns out it was a bad transmission that Ford is replacing under warranty.  They checked the gas tank again and said they couldn’t find any problems.  Here’s all the technical stuff I was told as best as I can remember:

&gt;The technician checked the place where the overflow gas goes and cleaned it out.  It was empty but he still cleaned it.  He also checked the purge valve to see if there was a leak and there was not one.  It is working as it is supposed to.

They said they would call me by November 8 and stay in touch with me.  What is suspicious to me is that the courtesy van driver told me that I’m not the first person this has happened to.  He told me there were at least three or four other people who had the same exact issue where they couldn’t put gas in the car after fixing the recall.  I’m not really sure what to do at this point. I can’t really sell a car you can’t put gas in, and I’m hoping to move somewhere I won’t need a car within the next year so I would rather not have to get a new one.",01Nov2019,1

Background: My wife and I have been married for about five years. We agreed that we would split living costs, but that we would both handle things like our preexisting debt and car payments individually. She's been able to pay off her debt (student loans and some credit card debt) due to a higher paying job and no car payment.

She doesn't have any children of her own and her siblings also received the same amount that she did. She left me an envelope this morning with a check in it that would nearly wipe out my debt. Part of me obviously wants to accept her generosity, but the other part of me feels like it's too much to accept. I know it's not going to break her financially, and for me it's a life-changing amount of money. I don't know what to do.

We are both very business savvy and dive into ways of making money every once in a while. Right now, we are doing vending machines. 

As I’m getting better I realize I don’t want to be friends with this kid. I don’t want to be close to him. But at the same time I want to maintain the vending machine business relationship. A part of me wants to tell him I don’t like him as much and that we are strictly business now but at the same time I don’t want to burn a valuable bridge.

For context, I'm a Freshman and my dad is a teacher at the school I'm at. 

Whenever I go home, I always worry about my dad arriving home and him saying ""Hey u/CarelessSailor, I was at school and I heard you... etc. etc."" and it really stresses me out. I have to worry and keep up with my classes so much just so I don't get scolded or reminded for having a missing assignment I forgot about earlier. It makes me immensely stressed to the point that I don't wanna be at home sometimes.

 On top of that, I play vidya at home when I could be doing work.

I guess my question is how do I transition friend groups ish and get closer with the other people I’m friends with when I don’t end up going out with them for the reasons I mentioned above? Do I just show up at her dorm and hang out or something? I already feel clingy everytime I have to say “haha let me know if you end up going tho!!” and hang out w her the next day after they went.",01Nov2019,1
500,"My husband works in a small office (3-5 people at any given time) and they have a locked private bathroom. There is a key that hangs on the outside of the bathroom that people usually take in when they unlock the bathroom to let everyone know “someone is in here”. There is also a spare key that, for some reason, my husbands boss keeps on her and she uses that to unlock the bathroom instead. She has walked in on my husband at least 7-8 times  while he was using the restroom. My husband is getting really frustrated and has told her she needs to stop and use the regular key like everyone else but she doesn’t. She is in charge of everyone’s reviews that affect raises, promotions, etc. and she’s not going anywhere anytime soon so we don’t know how he should proceed that wouldn’t cause him to lose out on opportunities but still get this borderline sexual harassment to stop. Any thoughts or possible solutions? Anyone been in a similar situation?",01Nov2019,1

I have the most badass hair ever. I try to never lie &amp; I will not be humble where it isn't due, for it would be a lie to appear more, well, humble. My hair is thick &amp; amazing, I have never met anyone with hair like mine. Now, my father, whose word I do not trust because nearly everything that goes out of his mouth is a lie, is bald. He lost his hair in his thirties, supposedly. He says that this is genetic and that I should cut my hair short before it's too late &amp; that his hair started falling off during my age. Though he wanted me to cut my hair forever &amp; will say anything to get me to do that. He says this is a genetic mistake, buut, he never had long hair to begin with, &amp; there's no way it took him twelve years to lose his hair.

*I mean, it's kind of funny, I get this amazing hair for nearly half my life &amp; I'm bald the rest of it. &lt;- if that's true, ofc.*

This is the first time I let my hair grow as much as it did, and it's the first time I had long hair during the passing between summer &amp; Autumn. I started growing at the end of the previous Winter. I've been losing my hair for about a month now.

The amount of hair I lose is not too great but I wouldn't call it little either. It's nothing visible on my person, but in a week I'd say it would gather up into a handful. 

*I've been told I shouldn't wash my hair every day, I used to do it 4-6 times or so, now I try to do it every two, maybe three days. Though I often slip up with that. I'm someone who sees hygiene as something very important.* 

# Question

Is this normal? I mean Mammals drop fur when climate changes. 

If it's not normal, how can I prevent it? I am someone who doesn't believe in genetic destiny, there's always a way. Though I'm hoping it's some sort of shampoo &amp; not biological modification, lol (That was humor which is probably not suitable for this subreddit, but whatevs).",01Nov2019,1

504,"I'm 18 and I'm taking violin lessons since I was 10 years old. To follow violins lesson, I have to register for music school at the beggining of the year and then I have to follow music theory lessons and I have to play in an orchestra, so it takes a lot of time and in addition I also have to take a lot of time to practice. 

Last year was a hard year at school, so I didn't register for music school to focus on high-school. And I think that it worked, I had better grades and I was able to get my final exam.

This year though, i decided to register again for music call, and follow every lesson again, since I entered college I thought that I would have a lot of time for music and that I would be able to pass the music exam. It seems like I was wrong, I don't have a lot more time than before. So I feel like I can't focus on anything and that I will fail my year in college and music school. Because of the atmosphere of the music school, I'm almost fearing every lesson I take there and I can't motivate myself to study music. I also don't really like to play the violin anymore (especially the songs I have to play for music school). I feel like I'm only following lessons because it became an habit and because I want to pass the exam (btw, this exam is totally useless for me, since I don't want it to become my job). 

So I think that I should stop again and for good this time, but something is holding me back from totally stopping music school, and I don't really know what. Is it right to stop even if I started the year? Is it a good idea to stop?

I told him that I was just a student and my schedule wasn't very flexible, but he didn't seem to care. At first, he was very polite, had good grammar, and seemed like a good guy. Almost immediately after I accepted the job he asked for my help with buying a wheelchair. Long story short, he send me a ton of cash so I could give it to the sellers and have the wheelchair delivered to me. But his buying process has been extremely complicated. He had me transfer $1000 to someone, I'm assuming the seller, and then he had me take out the rest in cash and wants me to deposit it at a bitcoin atm. I ask him lots of questions and he gives 1 or 2 word, vague answers. He calls and texts me constantly about money and he's starting to make me extremely uncomfortable.

Hi, the title sounds a little ridiculous but I need help. My mother, who is a widow, constantly talks to people online. Anyone who messages her, she’ll talk to. These people, usually men, claim to be rich or powerful in some way and always promise her money yet they’re always the ones asking for money. Thankfully, she hasn’t sent any money.  I know she’s probably lonely, but I don’t think she should just be giving everyone the benefit of the doubt. 

Today, she’s convinced that an FBI agent will be showing up in a private jet to bring her money. I’ve tried to tell her how ridiculous this sounds but she keeps telling me “You’ll see when he gets here.” 

Recently, she’d stopped talking to a man who had been leading her on for over a year and never showing up when he claimed he would. I felt relieved when she stopped talking to him, but I found out that she has multiple other people that she’s talking to. There’s obviously a pattern, these people don’t show up. Even if they did, I highly doubt they’d be who they say they are. 

Anyways, I just need some advice on how to get her to see that she’s talking to scammers.",01Nov2019,1

I'm taking my last college course in this area to graduate in December. And I'm in therapy finallyyyy in this area. I'm also confused because he flip flops. Every other day he tells me no one wants me and to leave, careless that I have no where to go or my circumstances. Then, he will tell me to stay and save money. Then I'll ask why he told me to leave when he told me to stay and he said he was in a bad mood and mad. Then when hes mad I'll ask why he is telling me to leave when before  you said to stay, and he said he just said that to avoid conflict. SO WHICH ONE IS IT?????? 

I've been through fucking hell this past year homeless and couch surfing, and a few months ago he took me in as my boyfriend to take that stress away from me, to allow me to be financially helped til I got my disability approved for PTSD. So he pays for this house and everything. He knows my past but seems to intentionally trigger me now, it is so intentional and my bullshit detector goes off it's so clear to me.

Starting week one he started telling me to leave. After that, my sense of safety was ruined. This was no longer my ""home"" he said was ours. He told me to leave every week and that no one wants me blahblah and this is why my family doesnt want me. He makes fun of me for applying for disability and says I fake it cause I can stick up for myself like a big girl but then makes fun of me for being crazy and not able to work? He threw my clothes outside, knowing the one thing I wanted for the past 3 years was a closet since I live out of a suitcase. He threw them in the shrubs. 

When I got approved for disability 2 days ago he said leave. First thing in the morning that's what i hear. I cant hear those fucking words anymore and try to swallow my pride and hang onto December getting out of here. Idk what's real or not. I had in writing a few days ago that I am allowed to stay til December. Then this morning he was in a rage. And it all backfired on me? I ended up getting dragged off a bed by my legs, told to get on the street and he threatened my puppy who was shaking. I tried to hide in a corner holding her so tight and trying to stay calm for her, and he broke the door down. I picked her up to run to the neighbors for help and he blocked the door and said PUT THE LEASH ON demanding. Then he threw it at us.  At this point, I knew he was intentionally trying to trigger me and intimidate me, which is sickening. 

I'm trying so hard to better myself. For years I blamed myself for relationship issues. I'm first to admit my wrongdoings. But I started logging these rages and a trend in being provoked. The only common denominator is when he doesnt have weed to smoke and isnt high yet whether it's the morning or right after work. 

I wanna move so bad and thought of contacting welfare people. But I have a puppy who is my world and am afraid she cant come with me wherever i go. I need to finish school and therapy here. I will loose all of that if I have to leave now, and dont even know where I'd go yet",01Nov2019,0
516,"I discovered a celebrity stalker with mental illness on my FB feed and I'm starting to get really concerned.

I'm posting this in all seriousness. I know this person isn't trolling and from my own personal experience believe he's an unmedicated schizophrenic. I'm needing serious advice whether or not I should try and notify someone or not. I'm not just worried for the potential harm of the celebrity but also the man himself. I do not want to see anyone get hurt and I'm hoping he can get stabilized on meds eventually. Of course I'll be keeping personal information out of this completely and the few screenshots I'm going to link will be treated the same.

TL;DR: celerity stalker with mental illness has traveled recently to where they live in hopes of finding them. I need suggestions of whether I should try to do something or not.


Background: 

I had a friend request from this guy about 6 months ago. It was just a friend of a friend so I do not know this man personally. Just his friend connection and that he lives in my home state 30 minutes from my town in Arizona. No big deal.
A short time later I started seeing some posts that were kind of weird to me. It was a video link to a Taylor Swift video and very briefly detailed his love for her. 
Cool, just an avid fan right? Still I didn't think much and then they started escalating so I started to dive deeper.

I've watched this go on for maybe 3 months now and it wasn't really a big concern at first until it progressed to this point. The man has recently traveled from Arizona to Nashville in hopes of finding her. He is residing at a homeless shelter and from his posts I can tell he's just roaming the streets daily in search of her. 

I can summarize some of the things I've read as best I can to keep it short but that's doubtful I can. And as stated above I'm providing a few screenshots for just a few good examples. 

His Facebook profile is completely littered with posts involving Taylor. He also claims to be running for president and even has a vice president appointed as well that is a Facebook friend. Many of the posts are really out there and talks a lot about past lives, twin flames, parallel universe, CERN, government conspiracies and of course Taylor and how they are destined to be together yet again in this current life. Most all have this general subject matter and I do realize this is typical of a person suffering of schizophrenia.(not an expert, worked in the field)

I delved a bit deeper last night after I read a comment section of one of his latest posts. His post was about how he hasn't found her, is lost without her and doesn't know how to proceed etc. This is when I read a comment conversation between his ""vice president"" and himself. It was very odd and left me a bit unsettled. The VP encouraged him through a bunch of mystical new age advise on spiritual planes, aliens, planet X and on and on.

Seems from the posts he might be upping his game in a sort of final rally to accomplish his goal.
This was in addition to another post from a few days ago that read: 
""when do you play your final hand, when do you lay out all of your cards?""
This is what started my real concern.
It already concerned me enough but after realizing he traveled where he thought she would be frightened me.

After the comment I read by his vp I creeped his wall as well. It's all open publicly so I saw a lot. It was like a complete train wreck and I couldn't stop scrolling. Pictures, crazy sounding thoughts, videos and more. He is also an extreme fanatic and has actually fought with the guy I'm following about who should get Taylor as their soul mate. He has many posts supporting his friend and his presidential campaign, even with video blogs shot in a public library bathroom stall while he smokes joints and basically talks conspiracies involving the government, CERN, DNA modification and also Taylor Swift.

Apparently she stole a song he wrote and she owes him millions. He's made many memes about this often calling her a bitch and a thief, how he will get a grand jury to proceed over this and get his rightful millions. The guy is REAL creepy. He has pictures he had taken of women in public at parks and libraries. He posts them and comments how hot they were and how he would obliterate them sexually etc etc. The shots are creepy because they are really close and you can tell they've been taken low key.

Anyways he's not the point or even necessarily an issue as he lives in New York. Just wanted to add this additional information. I had to stop reading and watching his blogs because I literally felt heavy after a while and couldn't shake the feeling for an hour afterwards.

I think that's probably enough information to give a big picture in addition to my screenshots of providing.

Should I do something or not? It may seem obvious to you but I'm just on the fence and that's why I'm here. Not sure if it can be proven if he's a danger to himself or others. I can speculate but he doesn't indicate harm to himself. He's only just recently mentioned something about how will he continue because he hasn't found her but nothing else. And also he's never posted anything that would imply him trying to hurt her, or any other type of post that would indicate he is a threat to others. Yeah it's out there but if he's not a real threat to anyone what can really be done? The only things that are available as evidence are his obsession and apparent unmanaged schizophrenia, and of course him traveling to Nashville in search of her. No threats, no outbursts of anger or aggressive posts.

If I should try and get involved who would I contact? Nashville police? Taylor's management agency?

My honest personal opinion is that even if he's no threat to Taylor he's potentially dangerous to himself at minimum. 


So I was just trying to upload pictures to my imgur account and couldn't remember my password. I hit my password attempt limit for an hour so I'll have to wait to give screenshots but I'll detail descriptions of the anyways. 

One is of him standing in front of some Taylor Swift education center or something like that, with the caption of ""I've found her, although she's just on the wall""

Second one is of just a post involving his love, I'll summarize. Homeless in Nashville hoping to reconnect with my true love. Hoping to reconnect before the end of the world which will be Oct 31st and if not will be next year. An event involving planet x doing a fly by and due to activities at CERN a black hole will form. That he was hoping to be with her when it happen so hopefully it happens next year so he had more time.

The third is just another post describing his eternal love, but more importantly, describing his current mental state.

The fourth is of one of his vice president commenting. This one is probably the only vanilla comment the man has made. I don't want to post his aggressive and nasty comments here. Besides, he's not my focus.",01Nov2019,1

520,"This is pretty straightforward, I have to decide when to leave to go visit family and I can either leave tonight or tomorrow. There’s a bunch of factors that make it a not-so-obvious choice. It doesn’t *really* matter if I leave today or tomorrow, so my indecisive ass can’t make a decision.

I live in Ohio. My husband is currently in Michigan and he is stopping home (Ohio) tomorrow and then also driving to Wisconsin. So I could wait to leave until tomorrow to drive with him to save money on gas. But then we would only have 1 car for the whole week we are there, which is usually difficult because my parents and his parents live an hour away from each other. 

This has caused problems between us and between our families many times in the past so we usually try to have 2 cars if possible. And this time we have the added issue of bringing our dog (who is not allowed at his parents’ house), and my obligations to help my side of the family with various projects. However money is really tight right now, so saving $ on gas is still enticing. 

Other Factors:
- I get done with work at 5:30pm today (4 hours from now)
- the trip is a 6 hour drive to Wisconsin.
- I’m not sure which would be faster / easier to get through Chicago; Friday night or Saturday morning
- I wanted to have a list of chores done before I leave, I’m no where near finished with this, and I don’t think I would be by tomorrow either 
- my sister wanted me to get there as soon as possible to help with her new puppy that she’s struggling with
- the purpose of the trip is to paint my parents’ entire house (as in all the rooms and hallways) and to power wash the outside of the house and the driveway, and to try to do some fun stuff with my husband while he has off from school
- I tend to underestimate how long tasks will take me 
- I have off work until 11/11, which coincides with when my husband has off school. We didn’t pick a forsure date we’d stay in Wisconsin until but we were going to try to have at least a day or two at home in Ohio before we got back to reality 
- my dog has car anxiety and I’m supposed to give him 1 anxiety pill the night before and 1 pill right before we go... and I didn’t give him one last night. (It’s not the end of the world if I don’t give him the first dose, but it’s preferred.)
- I haven’t packed yet but that’s not a huge deal, it wouldn’t take that long to pack
- I intended to make lemon bars before leaving, and I got lemons to be able to do this, and if I don’t make them before leaving then I would either have to waste the lemons or make it at my sister’s house, which I anticipate being difficult with the new puppy situation 

So when should I leave?",01Nov2019,1
521,"We’ve been friends since 6th grade and we’re now seniors living hundreds of miles away from each other.
I’m not sure what’s triggering her sadness but she’s miserable and posting often on her spam account about hating her life, wanting to die and how worthless she is. This has been happening for maybe 3 months from my perspective.
I want to help her with my whole heart, but she’s pushing me away. I ask what’s wrong and she doesn’t respond. I snapchat her a small rant or something happy in my life and she sends a picture of her forehead back. We barely have conversations anymore unless it’s her talking about the possible of her crush liking her back. Once again, I want to help but when I don’t know what’s going on in her life and she shows hardly any interest in my life, it drains/hurts me knowing I’m trying to put effort into a friendship that’s seemingly falling apart and she’s showing no interest in.

Recently it has been everyday and I’ve been struggling with things in my own life and I feel like it’s impacting my mental health and making it worse. I was picking flowers for my brothers grave and had to temporarily leave, I apologised for not being able to stay on chat and she told me multiple times that she didn’t care and she seriously doesn’t give a shit and it left me feeling hurt as I was already crying. I have been ostracised many time by the friendship group for not having the ability to help her because all I really can give is emotional support. She constantly tells me I don’t understand but I’ve literally sat down everyday for 6 years listening to her problems and whilst I may not understand personally I hate being critiqued for not knowing exactly. She says cruel things and I listen everyday for atleast 1-2 hours and has the audacity to say that I’m not listening to her, when in all honesty in that time she shun’s all I say and retaliates by being cruel to me. Last night I had enough because she told me how much of an incompetent friend I was and how I’m never there for her, and went on to write a story on Instagram about it and tell friends in the what’s app group chat that she hates being ignored by someone she thought cared when I literally apologise for leaving 5 minutes. I did snap last night for the first time in 6 years, I said “I may not fucking understand, but I’m going through things too” and I was as at the time I was literally in tears over issues that have arised (serious ones) . Throughout the years I’ve felt like a completely shitty friend and it really is starting to make me feel depressed and honestly suicidal. For a year she was starving herself and I reported it because I didn’t want her to be able to harm herself like that and to this day when she found out she said if I starve myself it’ll be your fault- which she did, and I was blamed for. I didn’t have friends for a large portion of my life and when I finally did she made them exclude me from group activities and always talks about events that did happen with them. It makes me feel sad because surely if you actually did regard me as your friend you’d invite me too, not make sure I’m excluded and come to me every night.

I have a vehicle leased under my name that was being shared by both of us. She paid the majority of the lease price because I hardly ever used the vehicle alone. Her credit didn't allow her to get a vehicle under her name therefore we thought this to be a nice way to allow her to make it to work without expensive ride services. Now that I have a vehicle and no constraints I thought it might be time to do a tour across the U.S.A. and maybe eventually into Canada.
I have a remote job that doesn't pay that well, but could earn more if I put more time into it. 
I need advice about what kind of opportunities I could pursue while on the move. I have a Bachelor's degree in Liberal Arts with a minor in Spanish. The majority of my work experience is in the service industry. I also would like to hear thoughts on how to get out of a house lease without breaking my bank and how to start my pursuit of happiness.

527,"Just needed some advice. Ended up getting this girl pregnant and she decided to keep. I told her that I’ll be there for the kid, but don’t expect any type of relationship or anything like that. I’m strictly only here for the kid. I told her that I didn’t want to do the whole gender reveal spill, but she want to. Would it be wrong for me not to go ?",01Nov2019,1
528,My friend messaged me saying she is feeling suicidal she has just been fired and has a week too find a job.

529,"so there is this girl that i really love,  we used to study together in middle school but now she goes to a different high school, she is a very kind and open minded person and i really fell in love with her, although we haven't seen each-other for 2 years we still talk a lot on Instagram. 

this year was really rough for her, she had like 4 break ups. and her ""friends"" are really manipulative (i know that because i know a lot of them) they introduced her to smoking and doing drugs and drinking and a lot of other bad stuff, she knows that what she is doing is wrong and she told me that she was scared about ruining her life and she needs help...

i am a very very shy person and i couldn't ask her to meetup and talk about it (i am very socially awkward), she posts a LOT of stories on Instagram but for the past week she hasn't posted anything, i started to get worried so i sent her a couple of messages that she has seen but not responded to, i sent her even more today and same thing happened. i am really worried that something bad had happened to her 

what should i do ?",01Nov2019,1
530,"So I recently accepted a job out of college. I interned right after, and now my internship is through. I got offered a job straight out of internship. I took the offer because it’s a good job. My first day in Monday but last night they invited me in to meet people and shadow. Guess what I did. Nothing. I literally didn’t learn. I wasn’t taught. I did nothing. And even the more hands on stuff, they didn’t teach me. And I heard they DON’T teach. Multiple people told me its all on you but I don’t know what I’m doing because I’m not taught. I’m so worried and idk what to do because it’s good pay, but is it worth my mental health?? My family is also going to flip on me. I’m not one to give up easily so this is why it’s very difficult for me because I’m getting BAD vibes and my feelings never fail me. Please someone help",01Nov2019,1

532,"Hi, I dont post on reddit very often but like. I'm kinda at a loss.

Last night me and my friends and roommate were playing with her lizards. She has three and having a great time. She ended up going to bed before me with a quick ""make sure they are all in there when you go to bed"" 

Maybe I was tired or maybe my memory which isnt great is lying to me. But I remember checking to make sure all three were in the tank before closing and locking it. 

This morning I woke up to her telling me she found one of them dead. Our cats had ate it. And the other one was missing. Only one remained in the tank. 

I feel so horribly sick to my stomach and I know it's my fault for not being more careful. I should have checked more but I didn't and nothing I say or any excuse I use will make either of us feel better. I feel like a horrible friend and I know nothing will help.

But is there any advice as to how I can make it up to her?  Or at least a way to properly apologize?",01Nov2019,1

 So I'm wondering what could be wrong ? Could it be a medical condition ?   maybe he feels anxious ? or does he just hate me ?",01Nov2019,1

Is what I’m asking for is too much? I thought it was reasonable but he thinks its steep. I gave him the option of £100 a month or £130 and I will still buy all his packed lunch. He has quite expensive items in the lunch like bounty bars, pot noodles, expensive crisps and so on. He chose the £100 but was unimpressed. Am I being reasonable or is it too much?",01Nov2019,3

I liked her and I hate it when someone just disappears out of my life. There was no conclusion. It just suddenly ended and I don’t know why.

538,"My niece is 10 and my son will be 3 in December. My niece has a very difficult personality, she gets angry and lashes out very easily. She is also going through puberty so those emotions are heightened, and I get it. My husband, son &amp; I are living with my parents while I finish my bachelors degree (unrelated...but explains why husband always witnesses this). My mom is a housewife so she stays home and watches all her grandkids. My husband works his full 40 hours in 3 days, so he is home half the time during the weekdays. So, today all the grandkids are home from school which means they are all at my moms house. My 10 year old niece is not the nicest to her younger cousins. She yells at them to get out of the room, slams the door at them, yells at them to be quiet/shut up. This infuriates my husband and he does not feel comfortable scolding a child that is not his, so he usually just takes our son and vents to me. This always happens when this specific niece stays home and my husband is home. I have not brought it up to my sister because my sister knows that my niece is this way. My niece bullies her younger cousins and is mean to them and they (sister/grandma/anyone) do get onto her. My husband wants me to talk to my sister, but this is not something that she doesn’t know about. I know I do need to say something, but how can I bring this issue up and make it important if this is already something she knows and has tried to resolve?",01Nov2019,1

540,"Hello there, We've recently decided to take an IQ test with my friend from college who is also my house-mate. And he scored about a 15 points higher than me. 

That might look a little too stupid to be a reason to envy him but there's a problem with my fragile ego of a 5 years old kid. I've grown in classes and with friends whom always less bright than me. So it wasn't a surprise for anyone else to see me in the best university in the country I am living in. And then I started to live in a dormitory with my now house-mate and we've been getting along very well for 2 years and I always knew that he was the smart one (Even though I didn't know for sure I was like 95% sure about that). And we decided to get an apartment flat together and we are still getting along pretty well. Then we decided to take an IQ test together 2 weeks ago which resulted in him getting a sheer 150. As I said I already knew he was smarter than me but seeing the rigid results hurt my ego and feelings. I was disappointed after being the smartest one in my environment for 18 years. 

That reflects to my behaviour in a way that hurts him and our relationship. And even though I don't want to act like that I can't help myself with hating the fact that he is more intelligent than me and like he is guilty because of this. Any advice would be appreciated 

TL;DR: I kinda started to hate my house-mate just because I learned that he is smarter than me",01Nov2019,1

542,"About a month ago my mom invited my siblings over for a dinner and then bombarded us with taking all our childhood stuff, knowing we all love in small apartments with no extra storage space.  i was furious and told my boyfriend i’m just going to trash it all. every box and not give anything a second glance, just right into the trash. he refused to let me do this. 

he told me his family did this to him except they just threw it out and then told him. he was empathetic at first. he brought 10 boxes into our room and they’ve been sitting there around the perimeter. i tell him in my VERY SELDOM days off i’m going to get rid of them and he always tells me not to worry about them until the end of the semester when school is out. 

our room has slowly started to get more and more cluttered with the things we use daily. i had a snow day from school and texted him i was going to clean and he responded and told me not to and enjoy my day off. on my other days off he likes to make plans to hike or work out or do other various things that require us to wake up early and takes the whole day. 

well i listened and didn’t clean. i cleaned our bathroom and that’s about it. 

today while i’m at rehearsals he texted me a series of mildly angry texts saying he’s so grossed out by the way our room has gotten, saying i’m being lazy about the whole boxes situation, the things i leave next to my side of the bed on the window pane at night, basically everything. he then told me i have more stuff than he does and my closet is bigger, but in my closet are hidden boxes and some of his stuff.

early in our lease i told him i wanted a dresser and he said no because he likes how open the room is. so with no dresser i have clothes still in boxes along with the stuff from my parents house. on my side of the bathroom sits my make up organizer, my toothbrush, and the extension cord for his toothbrush. on his side he has the hand soap that i tried to put on my side and his toothbrush. because of this he told me that i’m invading his half of the bathroom? 

sorry for how long this has gotten, in just very confused. what do i do to make him happy about this? i’m thinking either rent a nearby storage space or just throw all my stuff away. he’s the type of person who literally throws everything away. he wants no personal belongings when he moves and that’s why i have more stuff.

what should i do!?!? 

TLDR:  boyfriend told me to keep all my stuff and then a month later is sending me angry messages that i’m lazy and need to deal with all my stuff",01Nov2019,2

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.

545,"I love the sheer rush and feeling of being able to just weasel out of most situations with the right eye contact and story. I have never been caught in a lie, and it feels amazing. its exhausting keeping up with them though and I don't wanna do it anymore but I can't stop. I lie about alot almost everything from something simple to ""hey this random event happened"" even tho it didnt, all the way to making a new Snapchat to try and get rid of a pesky pet in my apartment. Don't get me wrong I'm honest to people that deserve it, and I need to be like my mother and girlfriend, but everyone else is fair game to me, like my friends managers coworkers and strangers. 

How can I stop cause it's getting to the point I'm starting to believe my own lies, and they're starting to come out without realizing what I'm doing, then I feel like I have to commit to the lie and finish it off. I also can't afford professional help. Anything would be amazing if it can really help.",01Nov2019,1

547,I'm in college and recently got a bad grade for my midterm. I'd have to score at least an 90 on each test or quiz to pass and I don't think it's possible. I ended up texting my dad about it and almost a second later my mom callede fuming about how I'm wasting her money. I understand that I'd be throwing away money by withdrawing if I don't then it will cripple my GPA. The course I'm in was never something I was great at in highschool and it's draining me now that I'm in college. I just need a C to pass but the only math I require next semester just needs me to have a D to take it. I'm scared to tell them that I want to withdraw from the class and maybe take it over the summer but I know my parents wouldn't take it well. They don't believe me when I tell them that I'm struggling and call me lazy and tell me I never take things seriously. Im so tired of crying and I've gone to nearly every tutoring session that they've offered and still haven't made any progress. I don't want my parents to be disappointed in me and I want them to understand that I'm not perfect but I know they won't. My dad is more understanding but my mom is definitely the opposite. I want to talk to them without any screaming or tears but that's how it always ends up whenever I try. I don't know how to talk to them anymore without this being brought up. Should I just stick through the class and retake it later or should I just talk with my parents and withdraw from it. Please leave any advice that you think would help.,01Nov2019,1

this has manifested, unsurprisingly, in a fixation on older men (daddy issues in the most classic sense). i have had sex with two older gentleman, one 37m and one 44m, along with talking to others within the same age range. it always feels so amazing, mostly because i imagine i am just relishing the feeling of love and validation from an older male.

the advice portion comes from me just wanting to come here and ask for some opinions, as my friends think that it’s really bad for my mental health and that i’m being groomed/taken advantage of. i, on some level might think that could be true but in a way they’re using me for my age and i’m using them for their age too. i don’t know. do i need to go to therapy? any advice on how to deal with this kind of stuff would be appreciated :(

So he came out of the blue and when I asked her about him she said it wasn’t my business. And then I look through his profile and it’s kinda obvious this guy is a catfish. Won’t face time her or Skype or anything. Only sends pictures that are shit quality. 

Well two weeks ago before this guy she was messaging me and basically said that she couldn’t wait to stay with me for the week she was coming down and that a lot has been on her mind and she knows spending time with me will ease her demons and mental health. And before that she was like flirting with me kinda and I tagged her in lovey dovey memes and shit. 

(It’s also of note that I do have a crush on her.) 

And then as soon as she started tagging this guy in stuff and changed her relationship status she is completely ignoring me. I can’t get a response and I confirmed she’s only ignoring me. 


She does this to me and has done this to me every time she’s gotten a new boyfriend from 8th grade until now (9 years). No one else gets the same treatment.

Also I'm sure she'd reject me, she's super hot, has loads of friends and could date almost any girl and before she came out she was in a few relationships with boys (to experiment) . And I'm the complete opposite I think I'm below average looking, I'm very insecure and have suffered from an eating disorder in the past. And my personality is kind of weird I think and I don't have that many friends. 

Idk what advice I even want. Just some life advice in general I think.",01Nov2019,0
568,"Ok so I’m 19 and only dated this girl (18) for about 6 months but things moved pretty quickly and we ended up living together. We met working at McDonald’s where she was my boss and both kept working there through our relationship. We split up about three months back and it was for the best bc things were extremely toxic, she kicked me out with no notice (after I paid rent) needless to say I wasn’t happy so after I got my shit I cut her off which made her pretty pissed so she brought it to work. So now that you have the background, the real problem is she was harassing me and spreading rumours to the point where I had to quit. After I quit things only got worse bc I could no longer defend myself, and now a lot of people who I had an alright relationship with don’t like me, what do I do here",01Nov2019,1
569,"I have been best friends with him for years now. I have experienced a lot of support, love and trust among countless other positive things in the friendship we have shared. We talk everyday and meet up regularly. We've sent eachother a bunch of letters about how much we love one another.
We like to cuddle. He started kissing me, I liked it. I told myself ""It doesn't have to be sexual, I just love him a lot."" He started making out with me. He started touching me. We started a sexual relationship. I liked it. I loved him so much and the lines between friendship and something more became so blurry that I ended up with a lot of questions and confusing feelings. It was only when I started to think that he might possibly feel something romantic for me too that the following happened.

I fell in love with him.

I felt and feel incredibly guilty. I was the first person he talked to about his homosexuality. I am not a man. I had assured him for the longest time that I was not in love with him and that I loved him like I've never loved anyone before, but that I wasn't going to fall in love with him, because he was very clear about not being attracted to women. It felt like I had betrayed him.

So I told him after I was sure and couldn't and didn't want to hide it anymore. It did not feel right. I asked him about how he thought it would affect our relationship. He said he didn't want anything to change and he was afraid I never wanted to see him again. I was relieved and our usual banter continued. I visited him last weekend and sure enough. NOTHING had changed. I figured he wouldn't want to do anything sexual because he knew how I felt, but he started touching me and kissing me and telling me how much he loved me. He kept checking if I felt okay and if I was still into it or not. He kept asking me why I would want to do it with him. I kept asking him, but he never really answered.

He goes on grinder dates every once in a while. He talks about his crushes and his feelings for other men with me. He was very insistent about not being romantically into women.

I've asked people around me about what they think I should do and what their opinions are about this whole situation. They haven't helped much, so now I'm asking you reddit.
Please help.",01Nov2019,1
570,"Hey guys! I really need advice on this problem I’ve been dealing with for a while.

You see, I’m an avid role player, I’ve been roleplaying for 3 years now, and I’ve been having roleplaying partners here and there over the years.

But this one girl has to be one of the best role players I’ve ever written with in a while. She’s great at character development, she’s good at plot, she’s stellar at dialogue, and she’s good at suggesting new things.

We’ve been roleplaying with the crossover fandom of Voltron and Inuyasha for a few months now, and things have been going great so far.

She really likes this character I made named Lacey Granite, saying that she has levels to her and that she relates to her in some degree.

I like Lacey too, but over the time I’ve been developing her, I’ve started to not like her and I’ve begun to see why she’s a flawed character. I sort of have been writing and rewriting her for a while but I honestly don’t want anything to do with her anymore.

She’s a misrepresentation of who she was meant to be, and I feel sort of sick of talking about her. I feel horrible for making such a character, and I have wanted to get rid of her for a long time.

So I’ve sort of indirectly suggested getting rid of her multiple times to my partner and my partner would usually get emotionally unstable and start blaming herself for a decision I made.

She says she wants to keep Lacey there, but if the original content creator doesn’t want her anymore, what’s the point of keeping her there?

I really feel like starting over with Lacey’s characterization by making a totally different character and doing things better, but every time I even consider going that direction, my partner gets extremely upset and begins to think the worst.

She pretty much traps me into keeping Lacey as a character, even though I don’t want to and I want to redo her. But the problem is, my partner sees it as HER fault for messing Lacey up, when she didn’t do anything of the sort.

In fact, my decision to remove Lacey is my own, and has nothing to do with how she’s been writing. But she believes it’s her fault and makes me feel horrible for even suggesting that I want to get rid of this character.

What do I do? I don’t want to hurt her feelings but at the same time, I just feel really uncomfortable with Lacey in the story, as she’s a horribly written character and she doesn’t belong in the realm we’ve created.",01Nov2019,1

In my situation right now i feel like the black sheep in my family the one that dissapoints i feel like the laughing stock of my family and the fact that my parents have been seperated since my birth. I don’t even know who i am since i always act differently around different people i’ve put on fake smiles i’ve been cutting myself. He could’t spare 20 php (less than 1 usd) so i can buy some water since i was out of money. he’s made a mindset for himself as him being a king and im just a servant and that’s how i think of my self someone who can’t do anything by himself the useless one but i’ve only gotten the courage to ask anyone about what to do i’ve just been dealing with it myself.

575,"Hello everyone! 
For a little background, my entire life has consisted of only going to school and coming back home with the occasional shopping trip but I was always assisted by my mother. 

As you can probably tell by the title, I am not allowed to do anything within the outside world
.
As you can probably imagine, this has left me with literally no social skills and have basically no life experiences which normal teenagers have, I’ve never been to a party, I’ve only just been allowed to hang out with my friends by myself (I still have to check in every hour and have to be back before 5) I don’t know how to swim or how to ride a bike, I was diagnosed with anxiety, I get overwhelmed by the simplest things, I’ve never rode a bus nor do I know how to properly get my ticket from a bus driver.

I have tried to talk to my dad about this (my mother has no option and basically shadows my dad not having her own opinion) but I am only met with being shouted at and laughed at for even suggesting more freedom. 

I have thought about just getting up and leaving but I’m scared that my dad would lose it and scream at me and maybe even forcibly drag me back in the house.

I just want to have my own space and be left alone to do my own thing.",01Nov2019,1
576,"Hi, I (13, F) am in 8th grade. I have two highschool options: the public school that’s in part of the my school district or the private, all-girls school my mom went to.

I took the test for the private school and got an alumni scholarship. They have a very good robotics program and athletic department. However, I am not thrilled about the idea of going to a catholic school. It is also very far away from where I live (45 mins). If I do not go, I’m afraid my mom would be very disappointed in me because she is a die-hard alumni.

I have already made so many good friends this year and it’s only November. I know I will miss them so much if I leave. But I also want to start over socially. I have adhd and have a VERY bad reputation. People see me as the weird, overly hyper person that has no friends, and I can be the butt of a lot of dares.

579,"A close friend of mine is prone to making up crazy stories and treating them completely as fact.  Some are more believable than others.  Some maybe have pieces of truth. But there are just so many weird things that it’s hard to take him seriously about anything. Here are a few off the top of my head:

-In high school and early college he claimed to be a werewolf. 

-He’d claim he’d wake up in the field behind his house covered in blood.

-This teenage girl was a vampire and broke into his room through the middle of the night and had sex with him

-He has to protect his girlfriend from the vampire girl because she wanted him for herself

-An old man regular to his work called him a gay slur for finally shaving his head after having a very receding hairline since high school

-After successfully throwing a grad party for his little brother, his mother and grandmother literally danced on his aunt (who had committed suicide earlier that year)’s grave because they did it without her and didn’t need her

-Numerous therapists have told him he’s hopeless and can’t be helped (his family doesn’t believe in psychology so pretty sure he’s never actually been)

-He lasted 30min when he lost his virginity and didn’t know that was a long time until his girlfriend told him

-An FBI agent came into the hardware store he worked at to perform a background check on someone. She was nice but very government

-Recently he broke up with an abusive girlfriend and apparently random neighbors he’s barely ever talked to are coming up to him and telling him how they never liked her and she seemed like a chauvinist",01Nov2019,1

I hadn’t been saving for very long so it wasn’t too much for savings and now I’m saving as much as I can from check to check. My girlfriend hasn’t paid a single bill because I told her it was okay and she didn’t have to, she buys groceries and gets us food often because she feels bad that she can’t pay bills so she makes up for it in those ways which I do appreciate. This month pretty much my whole paycheck and what I have left in my savings will go towards all my bills (which fall on the 1st) because my HR shorted me some hours on the previous schedule. 

My issue is that my ex left me because I was going through tough times with money/depression/etc. and even though my current girlfriend would never leave me and is always very open and willing not to mention happy to help me, I just feel terrible for asking because of how I was trained to feel in my past relationship. If I asked her if she’d pay half of rent this month to help me out I know she’d say yes and wouldn’t have a problem with it because she currently only pays for her car and has tons saved up in the bank.

584,"Okay, so this is clearly a throwaway since I don't want this traced back to me. I'm going to be as open as I can, since I really need advice on what I should do.

I'm not an only child, I have an older sister. When she was young, my parents obviously went to get get her vaccinated like they did for my brother. Almost immediately she got a very severe reaction, she had a fit, was paralysed down half of her body and my parents freaked out. 

They took her to hospital, the doctors weren't sure what happened, but they all eventually realised my sister was already immune and the vaccine didn't do any good. The doctors didn't want to admit that the vaccine did something bad, so my parents didn't let my sister get the second shot. It's not like she needed it anyway.

So, when I was born, my parents were very skeptical. I got the first shot, nothing happened, but I haven't gotten the second one. I am now a teenager. They wanted to leave it to a time where I could decide for myself.

I was just told all of this today. My parents don't know if I'm also immune, so there are a few options on the table (that I know of, not sure if there's more).

1.) Get the second jab now. The likelihood of me getting sick from it if I am immune is very small, but I have a deathly fear of injections, last few times I had them I fainted and freaked out (by that I mean crying, almost having a panic attack, i general, not a good experience to put it lightly)

2.) Don't get the jab. I don't plan on having children, so that part of the risks doesn't bother me, but I can go blind and get  meningitis. I don't know how big the probability of that is, I'm trying to research all outcomes now and will continue to do so over the next few days.

3.) Get a blood test and go from there. I might be immune, meaning there's no need for the second jab, but I also might not be. My parents said they're happy to pay for the test.

My parents aren't bad people, they're smart enough to know how bad things can be, but (at the time choices were first made) scared for my well being so I can't really blame them, they didn't know if I was going to get hurt. Please don't insult them in responses.

I am genuinely concerned for my own health, I don't know much about MMR and it does scare me now. My sister will be at home in a week, I'll definitely be talking with her before I make any definitive choices, she's always helped me out with stuff in the past and I find it easiest to talk to her above everyone else.

If you can, please shed some more light on the subject, if there's any information I should know, I really want to get all the facts before I choose what to do next.",01Nov2019,1

She would get the drink I wanted but then quickly go round the corner whilst someone else was serving me. I planned on asking her out but wanted to catch her on her own so I didn't embarrass her. Eventually I left it a bit too long and one day she wasn't there everyone else who worked there looked really angry at me. So I done something a bit childish the next day. I wrote a note that was kind of long but it wasn't a love letter lol but it did have my number on it. She didn't text me so I went in the next day but she just stayed in the back. When she did come out she looked at me and away really quickly. I thought I may of made her uncomfortable and was left embarrassed. I left it a week and got someone else to go in there to make sure she was ok with me going back in.

595,"# 0. Preface, Because This Turned Into a Book

Important: I am 19 (almost 20) and male. Most of this happened online, however it's serious and has bled into real life. I am already seeking psychiatric help.

This is something that's been going on for almost a year now (maybe more), and I don't really talk about it besides to the people who know. I think getting it off my chest and getting others' opinions about it will really help me to just let this whole situation go. I'll try to keep it somewhat brief, and there will be a TL;DR at the end, but it does require some background explanation to sort of explain why things are happening the way they are, and why I'm having a hard time letting go of it. If someone has a better place for me to post this, feel free to let me know. I just tend to work through things better when I hear what other people think about it.

Anyone who recognizes the situation will know it's me anyway, but throwaway for protection, names are changed, etc.  
**Small disclaimer: I'm doing my best to make both sides of the story clear, but as you'll read my perspective may be slightly skewed. I'll try to keep my opinion out of it as much as possible.**

I'm not sure where to put this, so I'm going to slap it at the top here: I am not a mentally or emotionally sound person. I am seeking treatment for it currently, but throughout when all this was happening, I had and still have what I presume to be undiagnosed paranoid schizophrenia. I experience mild hallucinations and severe paranoia, especially about social situations, that harshly impairs my judgement. This is not an excuse but rather an explanation for why I behaved the way that I did, and why I'm currently thinking the way that I am. I also have severe anger issues that I'm currently working to tone down, though I have a history of going off quickly and without notice over things that are relatively small.

# I. The Really Long Backstory That's Kind of Necessary

I used to be a very toxic person. I kind of had a shitty childhood and created a lot of defense mechanisms that worked at the time, but don't apply in the real world and mostly just hurt me and the people around me. I was manipulative, aggressive, distrusting, and I was in denial about all of it. After the fact I could usually tell what I had done was wrong, but I never bothered to think about it while I was doing it, and in some cases barely even realized at all. I just thought that was how people communicated and didn't care if it hurt people, because it was supposed to.

Through all of this, though, I did make a few friends who were willing to put up with it because they insisted that I was a good person behind that and they wanted to help me through it. I'm very grateful for them. Through one of them, I met someone new, who I almost immediately clicked with. Let's call her Jane. Jane was only a year younger than me, two at most. We became very close friends, and I looked past her flaws as she did mine. We had a project we worked together on and were both excited about almost constantly for a couple of months. This held our friendship together.

I'm not sure if it was bipolar disorder or something else, but Jane had very severe mood swings. When she was happy, it was like nothing could be wrong in the world. When she got upset, she was depressive to the point of mentioning suicide, even over things that were relatively small. Part of this behavior I know now was attention-seeking, but unfortunately I'm also aware that the mood swings weren't faked. I had my fair share of times going off on her and those around me for similarly small things, so again, I looked past them. Red flags were everywhere - she would constantly complain about others to me, which I should have realized she would do the same about me to others. She was the 'leader' of our project, and would use that against others involved to make all the decisions on her own. She would keep tabs on people who had cut contact with her and continue to talk shit about them, skewing every situation so that she was the sole victim. But she had never wronged me, so I still regarded her as my best friend.

There is one situation I remember clearly, and **I'd rather not have people comment on this part as it's not part of the overall arc, but is necessary to the full story.** At one point, a mutual friend of ours (let's call her Lucy) needed a break from my toxic attitude after a particularly nasty blowup on my part, and at this point in time I don't blame her. At the time, though, I had a twisted view of what was going on. I thought that she hated me and that the things she was saying and doing were slights and taunts at me, when in reality she was just going about her business. I constantly watched what she was doing, saying, and posting, and talked shit about her to my friends, some of which were mutual friends with her and obviously told her what was going on. I eventually learned that during this time my obsessive behavior actually scared her, which I've since apologized about and we made up. However, I should point out that Lucy was, and still is, underage. She was 16 and I was 19. It wasn't a particularly awful age distance, but she and a couple of her friends were somewhat creeped out that I, legally an adult, was essentially stalking an underage girl. I did not know her age at the time, but now looking back on it even I'm really uncomfortable with my own behavior.

I don't remember entirely what happened to end it. There was a 'he said, she said' sort of situation and suddenly all of Jane's resources were turned on me. I was kicked from the project and immediately lied about and slandered to everyone around her. A lot of our mutual friends believed her, and my already small social circle was cut in half. It was hard, but with the help of some of my friends (including Lucy) I did recover from it. However, looking back on it, I do think that I put myself in the part of the victim here when it's likely it was somewhat my fault. From what I was told by friends of hers that would still talk to me, my toxic behavior had caused her to associate me with her abusive ex and she could no longer stomach being around me. That was one of the signs I needed to change.

I thought that things were over for a couple of months, I was completely ignoring Jane and thought that she was doing the same. I was wrong. After I had an argument with another friend (Callie) who had been stealing from a closer friend (Kevin), Callie decided that she believed Jane's side of the story in which I was a horrid and abusive monster with no redeeming qualities. Unfortunately, Callie was quite popular, influenced a *lot* of people. I later learned this was Jane pushing Callie into it, essentially using her influence to further slander my name. I could ignore all of this, if it weren't for the fact that I learned (with concrete evidence) that Callie had called her local police on me over the situation with Lucy. Now, Callie does not know my full name or where I live. Neither does anyone else involved for that matter. I doubt it would have gone far. But that crossed the line from this being simple internet harassment to something real.

# II. The Part Mostly Without Jane

Recently, I have been happy in my new social circle, with new projects, and both new and old friends. There have been times where paranoia has given me trust issues, but for the most part it's doing okay and I'm genuinely working on my problems. I am absolutely a better person than I used to be, and I'm proud of myself for changing this much already.

It's been a few months, but Jane has been trying to antagonize me again. I'm mostly able to ignore her, but my friends aren't doing that. Lucy, Mark, and Alex are my three closest friends at the moment. Not all at once, but independently over the course of a couple weeks, each of them decided that they were going to befriend Jane again to keep an eye on her in case she tries anything else drastic. 

This is where I'm starting to worry. The three of them know both sides of the story, and in the end they chose to stick by me rather than Jane. But I'm afraid that for some reason or another, they're going to end up on her side instead and decide to leave me. I'm afraid that if I bring it up, I'll end up pushing them away - but if I don't, I'm only going to get more paranoid about the situation.

Should I try to talk to them about it, or should I just trust them and try not to think about it?

**TL;DR: My friends are keeping an eye on my shitty ex-friend to make sure she doesn't do anything sketchy, but I'm afraid she's going to manipulate them into being her friend instead of mine. What do?**",01Nov2019,3

Ok this is going to seem petty and dumb, but I have a “friend” who is incredibly annoying, hold on keep reading. Let me explain things she does. -constantly does things people have asked her to stop for over a YEAR -doesn’t seem to understand why people get mad at her (we get mad at her for the annoying things she does) -maybe she has a tick because she keeps moaning but she does it purposely -she also says weird and outlandish things as well -she also has many problems with her body she gets tired easily and she has some sort of eating disorder and she said she’s anorexic but i’m not sure she is so maybe those are the symptoms but i’m not sure Ok that’s really not a lot (it seems dumb), but after a whole year of constantly asking her to stop, I’m convinced that she has something wrong with her. It’s almost like she can’t mentally comprehend the idea that we get mad at her because she won’t stop the stuff she does. She doesn’t have aggression, but its almost like her mental capacity is super low.

602,"Just spent 10 days of a vacation binge-watching shows, which when you think of it - is something that I do an insane lot of on other days too. Every day after sitting at a desk for 9 hrs straight, I come back mentally beat and binge-watch shows till I fall asleep. And it's not really because I have nothing better to do - I choose it day after day. I have been realising how the effects of this habit is seeping out on every sphere of my life and still can't seem to stop. There would be days of being 'productive' only to go back to it. I have become grossly overweight, lost interest in going out or talking to friends because there's always something better on the screen. My personal growth has stopped, despite having a few great hobbies that I should be investing more time in - I'm just glued to a screen all the time. Maybe somewhere immersing myself into these fictional worlds just feels easier than focusing on my own. I have a lot of goals &amp; ambition for myself but the joy I get in watching and then reading about it is hard to get away from.

I broke up with my ex about 2 weeks ago. Took a break due to arguing. We moved in together way too soon and I’ve been going through a weird half depression  because I can’t find a job. I think I’ve found one and a backup too. I’m sure I contributed to arguments. 

We agreed to see other people. I informed him I was talking to other people. He seems and expressed to be fine with it, continues to communicate with me in the same manner texting me all day. But I still feel like I’m cheating. He wants to give us one more try and I’m down with that- just don’t know when. He told me I brighten his world more than anyone ever has. I can say the same. 

A new guy wants to take me on a date. This is literally what I PLANNED- to see other people, but it was not supposed to go this fast. Im not sure if I just wanted some sort of attention. I can hold the date off for at least another week. He’s really great. Like super established in his goals and educated and so many things. I love my ex to pieces, but that’s exactly what I’ve always been afraid he doesn’t have. Drive and maturity. I just think he isn’t in an adult mindset yet, though he’s older, but I really believe it takes men longer to grow. In the same way, what I love of him is his innocent nature. His way of making me feel so comfortable and at ease and my best friend all at once. Ive never felt so comfortable with a man. 

I just don’t know if I’m run down, or we aren’t meant for eachother. The thought of him being sad because I left him is a feeling I almost can’t handle. He has no friends, just his mom. 

I’m doing all of this stressing but he’s fine. I made him promise to let me know if he felt upset. Not because I haven’t communicated this could be the end of us or that I’m seeing other people. I’ve let him know I’m extremely confused and don’t know what I want. I just want to know how I feel.",01Nov2019,1

607,I recently had an argument with my mom about a few things which as of late hasn’t been uncommon. I do not know of this is because of her menopause or what. During this recent argument she asked me to be honest and it got to a pretty deep level. So I pretty much told her that a lot of the issues we have is because her marital problems. That she expects me to be the man of the family because you father is lacking in certain areas. That every time she has a fight with him I’m expected to pick up the pieces. And that when she is angry with him she is angry with me at the same time. She then started to tear up and proceed to tell me about how some people have it better and some people have it worse so I guess I was just another person who had a shit childhood. Then she tells me about how she has sacrificed a lot for me. At this point I tell her no one has an issue with those things it’s the other things that are the problem like expecting me to pick up the slack because of my father. Before it got to this point I pointed out that when she gets angry with my dad that she always takes it out on me she agreed and said from here on out she will never say an unpleasant thing because she doesn’t want to offend anyone.

610,"So essentially I'm stuck between going to a Professional Development Convention for my school job and going to my lesson teaching job that happen on the same day. 

Pros for going:
~ I show my interest in expanding my knowledge as a teacher to my new school.
~ I get paid an extra day's worth of pay for going to a half-day convention. (This is more than the day of lessons I'd be missing if I were to go.)
~ I don't have to pay for anything except maybe gas if I'm driving and food for the day.
~ I'd get more time to get to know the teachers and administrators I will be spending time with.

Cons for going:
~ I'd have to let my lessons boss know that I'd have to go and it's not early enough notice by what she expects/needs to adjust the schedule.
~ I could have trouble with rescheduling and losing students on the day I'd go since it's my longest day teaching lessons.
~ I may form a work conflict with my lessons boss by doing this, and if I were to explain to them the situation I'd say I have to go since it's paid for already even though it's optional for me (so I'm pretty much lying).
~ There isn't much for me at the convention that seems to pertain to what I teach (from what I've seen on the schedule so far).

There's a small chance I could get back in time to teach some of my lessons but it's hard to equate since the drive to the convention center is two hours not including possible traffic. And the PD Convention isn't required for me but shows initiative anyway. I'm paid for and can go, but it's my choice. What would you do?",01Nov2019,1

While this is true I think I look pretty Latino, with people typically asking me if I'm Latino, however, others tell me I look white, so I don't really know for sure. Additionally, although my mother is only half-Latino she looks 100% Latino. People usually ask me if I'm Latino and I usually say I'm half, even though that isn't true because they assume my mother is full Latino. I feel kind of shitty about this because I'm not truly half-latino, but it's well known among my friends that I'm half latino. Additionally, I'm in a lower income area so it kind of helps me fit in more. However, I am now in my senior year and just applied to colleges. For all of them I put Latino down as my ethnicity although I am technically more white than I am Latino. However, in hindsight I feel kind of shitty about it because I am technically not half Latino, so I guess I have two questions.

1. Is it shitty of me to tell people I am half Latino when technically I am only a quarter?

626,"I will list every event in my life that was mildly confusing gender wise. When I was about 8 I did think it’d be cool to be a girl just to see what it’s like. I’d had a “girlfriend” in grade school, at least that’s what we called them. I was very interested in acquiring the attention of females my whole life, I was always interested in activities that were more masculine. I did play with barbies for a little while but that was to freak my sisters out because I would cut them up and make them look like monsters. The next biggest event would probably be around the age of 11 or 12 I wondered what it would be like if I tried on some of my moms clothes. I was embarrassed but it didn’t really matter because I was the only one who knew. That happened about 3 times. And once, I put bags of water in a wetsuit I owned and pretended they were boobs. I did also try on my moms swimsuits twice. There was one time were I went and tried on my moms makeup, but my dad burst in, and that led to me going to the psychiatrist. (I was seeing him because my parents thought I needed add medication and because I allegedly had aspergers, which later was proven inaccurate) I was definitely horrified by the whole ordeal and anyone who wanted to talk to me about it I would just ignore or tell them I didn’t want to talk about it. I was really really embarrassed about it. It still haunts me to this day. 

I think I started watching porn a little after. My progression was normal in the beginning. First it was models, then nude teens, then lesbians, braces and blowjobs for a while, then BDSM , sexual slavery, bimbos, then sissy and adjacent type captions, then transgender and sissy porn. It’s been that for a long time. 

Anyways fast forward a few years I was fine. Then I got super into punk music and all that long story short I found out about against me and that their singer was transgender. I listened to the album over and over again, and eventually had convinced myself I was transgender. Started wearing panties under my clothes in secret. I don’t recall how long I’d been watching the sissy hypno porn but I do think I was watching it around that time. Mind you I had never question my gender identity before then. I’d also never been attracted to men, or penis or balls or anything. I was very much attracted to women. But anyways I told a friend and her mom about it and they both understood I was going through something. They were pretty close to me at the time and knew me very well. Her mom and her both didn’t think I was transgender, not that they disapproved only that they thought maybe I was watching too much porn or maybe that I was a little confused (a lot of the lgbtq stuff was going on at the time it was always talked about and a big thing) not long after I found myself agreeing with them and I tried to forget the whole thing because I was embarrassed. There was a short time when I thought I liked boys and girls, but I never really was super attracted to guys, unless they had very feminine qualities. Anyways, eventually that faded too and I found myself just attracted to women. 

Although I was still mainly watching sissy porn. I had quite a few girlfriends during this time, and I had a pretty normal time. The only kind of weird thing, was I did have one girlfriend “treat me like a girl” I didn’t want to be called a girl or dress like one or any of that, it was just my was of getting her to be more affectionate I guess (she would call me babe and In a small way the gender roles were a little reversed)I was afraid to kiss them because my father was very religious and made it seem like it would be wrong. It wouldn’t be until I 16 that I had a real first kiss, but it wasn’t with someone I liked. 

Anyways, I was pretty overly masculine by the time I left high school and joined the military. I had some fun and some rough times but that was everyone. I did move far from my family and  had sex with a gal (was disappointed but she was kind of gross and I barely knew her)eventually initiated a sexual encounter with a crossdresser (professional who pretended to be TS to get guys who liked that) I blew him (he identifies as a man) and I did enjoy the encounter but afterwards wanted to kill myself. It was way too much. Well I kept seeing different trans women not fully enjoying it but experiencing it nonetheless. I ended up hooking up with a few guys (and a few women as well), in various positions, for the most part I didn’t enjoy it. I dated a man for a while (9 months and we had a puppy together) after than I’ve just been in bisexual limbo I guess. 

I find very very few men attractive now, but vaginas aren’t appealing as much as they used to be (I prefer cock) and I started thinking about maybe dressing up and actually facilitating the “sissy” type fantasy. When I started looking at info on reddit about it, I found a group for people who are recovering from sissy Hypnos and transgender pornography (but it turned out quite a few were just spewing nofap rhetoric) and posted there. Well then a couple people messaged me about what I had said saying I’m just transgender and if I transition it will all make sense. I don’t know what to do anymore. I like who I am, I’m the guy I always wanted to be, but I will say I don’t really feel happy all the time and my sexuality is making me very uncomfortable. Could something that started out as a fetish really be my entire identity in the end? 
PS: I’m not judging anyone else, I’m only judging myself I guess. Please don’t take offense to what I posted.

Now, he made a giant banner, 3 meters long, with his name on it, that took him a good 4 hours to design and put together.

There's apparently a girl in grade 4, who come around with a group of people and starts ripping up the banner, my brother gets pissed and calls her a bitch.

He got in trouble and has been taken down to the office for around 1-2 hours a day, and lectured every time he goes down.

i just got into my boss. the whole situation is like this, i try to be as possibly objective as i can - like in the august he had me to promise him that i won't leave untill end of the december. i had no cash, so had to agree because couldnt leave right away.

And a week ago i told him i'll be leaving at the end of November he kinda hardly agreed to that then my bank who give me offer is pressuring me to start working at 25th November so i told my current boss that my last day will be November 22 (Firday) and he got very mad, saying like i don't hold my words like we agreed to November 30 , now u jumping to 22 he told me to talk to the bank and extend to 30th he told me if you leave at 22, i will have no comment for this

He was like ""I've already told the whole team, that you leave on november 30"" , you should have came to me before i told the team",01Nov2019,1
632,"Whew... this is going to be a long  post. I grew up in CT and am visiting here to see my daughter, sell my  mom's house, and see friends and family. My mom left the state but my  sister, cousins, and aunt and uncle are here as well as some childhood  friends.

I am stuck between  staying in CT and going to WA state where I've lived for the past three  years. I've been in a relationship for three years but we've been taking  a break and trying to figure out if we want the same things. It's a  very mature relationship, it's the best relationship I've been in, and  she is the kindest person I know.

I made a pros and cons list to try and figure out what to do but I'm stuck.

**Go back to WA**

\+ The outdoors/nature/hiking/camping

\+ Have an easy job working at a college (part-time)

\+ Friends/co-workers

\+ Moderate weather (good summers, not-so-cold winters)

\+ Current college trajectory will let me transfer to UW with great psych program

\+ Live with GF, don't pay rent right now as we take care of her great grandfather

\+ People are kind, albeit passive-aggressive

\- PC/identity politics culture is annoying

\-  Everything is spread out and I do not own a car or want to. You  basically need a car here or you'll pay a lot in Ubers/take lengthy bus  trips

\- Have to pay for daughter's plane tickets/trips but I don't make much as a full-time student

\- Cost of living is horrendous and supposed to get worse over the next few years

**Stay in CT**

\+ Lots of historical spots, museums, galleries, old buildings, opera houses, theaters.. you can feel history in the air

\+ Closer to my daughter

\+ Got a full-time job working at a hospital. It would allow me to intern with the behavioral unit (studying clinical psych)

\+ Have an apartment and rooming with a friend. Costs money though.

\+ Old friends close by. Hard to make new friends here though.

\+ Great schools like UConn, Yale, Harvard, etc. Yale is my dream school but not sure if I would get in.

\+ Don't need a car. Everything is much closer compared to WA. My job is close by.

\+ Housing is much more affordable.

\- Couldn't make my relationship work by staying here.

\- People are aggressive and reserved. People in WA (in my experience) are kinder, warmer.

\- Would be leaving friends behind in WA.

\- My daughter's mother is very difficult to work with

\-  Weather. Whacky weather sometimes with hot summers and cold winters. I  don't have a lot of body fat and the cold air cuts right through me. I  love the snow though.

I have a  poor relationship with my daughter's mother and though I've been here  for almost two weeks, I've only been allowed to see her on two days.  Mind you, when we went to court we agreed on an order that visitation  could be whenever both parties agreed. Big mistake on my part. Though  I've tried to be in my daughter's life and have tried to pay for her to  visit me in WA for a couple of years, the mother always has an excuse  for why I can't see her. I'm going to court again soon to modify the  order because of its ambiguity and will be fighting for the maximum  amount of visitation the court will allow.

I've  been poor my whole life and buying a car at this point seems like an  expense I don't need or want. I use Instacart and Amazon Prime to order  stuff I need and my full-time job is a 15-20 minute walk from the house.  I would much rather save for a down payment on a small house and a  decent piece of property. What is surprising is that a little ranch  house in WA would cost me 3-4x more than one in CT, and in WA you  typically get less land... a little ironic given WA's land mass.

My  girlfriend and I have argued often about me not wanting to get married,  occasionally thinking we should have an open door policy (always  discussed beforehand and not very often), and other things. I have trust  issues after the way my daughter's mother has treated me. I'm working  toward a PhD and I feel like at that point I will finally have doors  open after having been poor my entire life. If I were to get married and  it didn't work, and my assets and retirement were to be taken in some  proportion, I don't know what I would do. Marriage is a big deal and  perhaps I'm just freaking out about the commitment. She is a wonderful  person and if I didn't have these feelings I would love to marry her.",01Nov2019,1
633,"So, basically I have known this girl since freshman year of highschool, so going on about 6 years now. I’ve also had feelings for this girl all throughout highschool, I just never really said anything. Anyways, we ended up going to the same college and we recently kind of reconnected and started hanging out. We literally text for hours every day and tell each other everything about what’s going on in our lives. About 3 weeks ago, I decided that I would let her know how I feel, and so I texted her a long paragraph that basically told her how I felt and asked her if she felt the same way. She told me that she’s at a weird stage in her life and isn’t really looking to be with anyone, but she values our friendship and doesn’t want anything to jeopardize that. So, obviously I accepted her answer and tried to get over my feelings for her. But, recently she started coming over to my place and we would watch movies together. During these movies she would would cuddle up with me while I would massage her back, or have my arm around her and grabbing her shoulder. And she would keep getting closer and closer to me. BASICALLY, I need help from the girls on here to help me understand what is going on in her head. Is she having mixed feelings? Is she just playing games? I would make a move and just try to kiss her, but being that we are super good friends I don’t wanna risk it.",01Nov2019,1
634,"Okay I know that this sounds unhealthy. We spend a lot of time together, so when he goes to work I find myself super depressed and it’s difficult to get out of bed. I am not like this when he is around. He could literally be asleep, and I’d be making food, cleaning the apartment, etc. I just get so lonely and sad when he’s not here.

I had one other friend but she started dealing drugs and turned against me so we no longer speak.  I have tried initiating friendships, but I feel like a lot of the people I talk to are so different than me. Wanting to go out for drinks, parties etc. I’m 21 for reference. I have gone to one party and I didn’t enjoy myself.

I don’t know what I’m asking advice for- I guess how to be less lonely and to become more self-reliant for happiness. Why am I lonely? I don’t know I think I have abandonment issues from my bio dad and my mom being a wishy-washy alcoholic. 

I don’t mean to blame anyone, but I do think that since most of my childhood relationships were unhealthy I really don’t know HOW to trust people again.

635,"I've been wracking my brain trying to figure out how to ask this question without pages and pages of backstory....so here goes. 

I'm in my mid 40s. I was physically abused for most of my childhood. I have terribly low self-esteem. I suffered for depression for a long time. I thought everyone hated me, so I started being someone else. I just acted different, I made up a new back story to my life, I acted different, liked different things, and my life turned around. I even ended up getting married! 

The problem is, I think the real me is still under there somewhere. I have a substance abuse problem and my wife doesn't understand why. I eventually came clean and admitted that I'm not a real person, I'm a figment of my own imagination. The problem is, I've been pretending to be someone else for so long, I don't know who the real me is anymore. My wife was pretty understanding, but said I really needed to talk to a professional therapist. 

Which is where I am now, I try to be ""myself"". I go to my appointments saying I'm going to be honest and be me,  but I just end up answering his questions how fake me would, or just saying what I think he wants to hear. I've tried explaining his to my therapist, but his only answer is to just be me and be honest. Which I try to, but it just takes a few minutes for the fake me to be answering questions again, because I don't know who I really am. I feel like I'm just spinning my wheels.

641,"i'm going to try my best to condense this story, but I'll call my friend ""Carol"" and her shitty fiancee ""Marty."" They had been \*talking\* for years, probably since 2015, with Marty always leading her on, stringing her along, coming up with reasons why he couldn't commit to a relationship with her but he never wanted her to ""leave him."" 

They finally were ""officially"" together in 2018, after a string of interesting coincidences. Marty's house, that he has lived in rent-free on account of his grandmother, goes up for sale and he wants a new place to live. So, he decides to propose to Carol after she says she doesn't want to move in with a man unless they were engaged. Hmm, interesting timing. But me and Carol's other friends just sort of bit our tongue and tried to be happy for her. Literally within the span of a couple days, Marty went from ""not being ready to be in a relationship yet"" to \*proposing\* marriage and moving in with her.

&amp;#x200B;

Now it's 2019, and I'm at my wits end with this man. I moved closer to where Marty and Carol live so I see them a lot more often than I used to and I am appalled at the behavior I witness from him towards her. Every time I am over at her house, if Marty is not there, Carol is literally on the phone with him (he's on speaker phone) and she just won't hang up. He stays on the phone with her until he gets home. There's other little things that were leading up to the main event last night. He would get onto her, in front of me, for spending ""their"" money even though this loser is leeching off of her by making her pay most of the bills and mortgage of the home that is LEGALLY HERS. He complains and sends her mountains of texts if she hangs out with me and doesn't text him within a minute's time. He does this with all of her friends. He insists she come home when he's home from work. I basically feel like since i moved up here, I haven't had much of a chance alone with her. Neither does anyone else.

&amp;#x200B;

Last night on Halloween, he went off to get a haircut and I came over to see Carol. Before he left, he said to Carol, in front of me, she was ""not supposed to leave the house"" until he got back. I told him basically to fuck off and we were going to go get dinner. Marty then actually called and cancelled his haircut in front of us cause he said it was ""unfair"" for us to hang out without him. He kept repeating over and over, ""Carol, don't leave. Just be patient. You're being so unfair"" And Carol just nodded and said ""Yeah, he's right. I don't want to leave him out. Wait on him.""  

&amp;#x200B;

I'll admit i was kinda freaked out for the first time around Marty, like I felt in danger, but I didn't want to leave Carol alone. So I ordered pizza and had it delivered to the house. I just pretended to go along with everything. I stayed as late as I could and went home shaking. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm to the point where I realize Carol sees nothing wrong with his behavior and just accepts it. She doesn't have any other relationship experience to build off of or see that this is unhealthy. She's deeply in love with him and what's worse...I'm supposed to be one of her bridesmaids. I don't know if I can stand this any longer or if I can stand up there with him when they exchange vows.

Last year I went to my native country for half a year, and I learned so much about my own culture and language, I fell back in love with my country, I fell *so* absolutely in love, in fact

that I had this absolutely *great* idea.

I thought ""How I would love to speak Polish better! I would be treated more like an adult by my two family members that *keep laughing at my grammatical mistakes*! I don't want to do my A-levels"" I thought ""I want to complete POLISH SCHOOL!""

And with me being EXTREMELY positive and hopeful **\*cough\*** *delusional* **\*cough\*** all the time, I thought, ""*why not??""*

Now I am in the process of learning for the end of school Polish test ""Matura"" I have six months to learn what my peers have been learning their entire lives! *ahahaha how fun,* ***isn't it?***

Since we met, we’ve hung out about 6 times. We usually hangout 4-6 hours each time. Basically, the first “date” we had went really well, we were both extremely flirty towards each other in very obvious ways.

We’ve done little things like cuddling, hugging, holding hands. She says she likes hanging out with me, she usually tries to pay for me (I don’t let her usually but she sometimes gets upset), she’s initiated most of the dates, she constantly compliments me.

The only thing that I’m confused about is that she almost never texts me. I’ve tried having conversations with her over texting, but she typically responds with very short, bland answers. The only time she really texts me is to plan the next time to hangout. The first couple of dates she was pretty talkative in person but even after that she seems to have gotten quieter.

Most of my previous relationships I was friends with the girl for months before we started dating. And we’d text almost constantly. But this time everything seems to be different and moving really fast and I’m not sure if this is more of a fling or what’s going on.",01Nov2019,2

648,"To give some background: While I was in college, I barely made any friends because my ex-boyfriend at the time was very very controlling and wouldn't let me hang out with other people. I didn't have college roommates and didn't join any clubs, due to the controlling ex, so when I graduated, my only friends were his friends. Granted, we became a nice group of 4-5 friends, would hang out and chat often. Even with my ex acting and treating me the way he did, I thought I could handle it because I truly cared for the friend group dynamic we had and was afraid it would disappear if we broke up. 

Well, after the break-up earlier this year, to my surprise everything seemed fine. My friend group and I were still hanging out, though less often because of our full-time jobs, and chatting. It's like nothing had changed, and I was over the moon.  After a long time, I had finally made some genuine friends.

But during this past month, I've noticed that the group chat has slowly become less and less active, I'm trying more to keep conversations going and keeping up with everyone. It's might be silly, but you know that sinking feeling when you think you're friends have left you behind or started another group chat without you? That's how I'm feeling right now and I haven't felt more lonely in my entire life. 

I have a wonderful boyfriend now. He's absolutely amazing, we chat and see each other every day, I'm staying at his place over the weekends. I've never been happier with another person before, but this sense of loneliness is still clinging onto me. I do have some work friends, chatting and getting lunch with them does fill the void a little bit. But after work, when I'm home alone, it's so hard to keep the feeling of loneliness from weighing me down.

But main problem is she’s got a boyfriend, and I’m definitely not the type to be with someone who is cheating to be with me. I’ve had that happen and it basically destroyed any sense of confidence and feelings of worth in me.

650,"Firstly, please pardon my poor English, i am a 18years old from Romania and i needed to get the followings off my chest. 

It all started 3 years ago when i wanted to become a doctor without knowing what i would supposedly get myself into. I changed my mind last year in the last year of Highschool and i chose to pursue another path in Health Care. My options were Physiotherapy and Pharmacy(which i chose in the end). 

However, my mom was constantly pressuring me to take the exam for Med School even tho i didnt truly wanted it. She thought i was scared that i will fail, or that i lack confidence in myself (i might sometimes, but not in this case).

Now i am in the first year of Pharmacy school. Yes, i am a boy in pharmacy. I chose this mainly becouse i like chemistry way more than anatomy. Even now, that i go to this university my mom keeps telling me subtly that I somehow should have applied to medschool in the first place becouse it is better to try than live with regrets and she is certain that i wouldve become a great doctor and stuff.

To mention is that my mom told me that she wanted me to become a doctor mainly becouse of the money, social state and social bonds created with other doctors and important people in our society. I didnt agree with her that anyone should ever pursue medicine guided by these ideas

I respect every doctor that does their job guided by passion and love for humans but i dont find myself generous enough to DEDICATE my whole life for pacients (that might not be the case for every doctor but that is me)

She also called PharmSchool being girl-stuff and a man shouldnt become a pharmacist becouse it isnt “manly” and i would become just a seller and nothing else. So far i dont regret choosing pharmacy but i feel like everytime she reminds me of this event she is adding a drop of regret down my heart. 

I love my mom and i am sure she loves me but i really needed to get this off my chest and i dint think she truly “forced” me to become a doctor but i feel like i failed her or disappointed her when i chose Pharmacy and the only reason i would go to Med School is to make her proud.",01Nov2019,1

653,"I know this guy from high school and we are very, very close friends. I'm in love with him and i believe he does so, but the problem is that we are both in the closet. However, i know he likes me because we do some things (look to one another directly to the eyes, play with our hands, flirt ""playing"" around and stuff like that), so i'm also sure that he loves me, but i'm not confident enough to tell him, and he isn't confident too.

However, my ""weird situation"" with him isn't the point of this. The case is that he has a lot of health problems to deal with. He has diabetes and sometimes he fades out if he doesn't take his insulin treatment (he could even die) and he also has kidney problems. So he is always under treatment and stuff.

Recently he's been more active and doing very well, but he had a relapse and his kidney got worst. He knows how to deal emotionally with his health issues, but he still has this feeling of insecurity and fear because of his health.

He also has acne, and he is very pale and lanky. Being honest, he is really handsome. Has a nice facial structure, amazing hair and he's been getting athletic and a bit muscular. But i know that deep down he stills struggles with his acne and lanky body.
His acne sometimes gets bad and his whole faces ends up filled with enormous red dots. And he struggles gaining muscle, which makes him feel weak.

So i want to help him increase his self esteem and help him throughout his recovery, no matter if we end up as a couple or as friends, i really care for him. He might act a bit of a prick sometimes, but he is the most lovely, kind, friendly, funny and amazing person i know. So yeah, i need some advice because idk how to support him.

Edit: i forgot to add something. He is also very emotional, but he hides it because he thinks that is effeminate. 

Also, his parents have confronted him asking if he was gay because hasn't had a girlfriend. They doubt because he is really handsome to the point some strangers (females) have kissed him out of nowhere just because of games (truth or dare amid friends or maybe interest, idk).

So having this in mind, how can i help him get in tune with his emotional side?",01Nov2019,1

At first, I ignored the comments and didn’t think of it since I had about 4-5 friends around me and they just told me to ignore at and that they were asses. I never thought much about it, it put me in a bad mood for a few hours but whatever. Later, though, when I was alone with just 1 friend and the locker room was pretty empty aside from 2-3 other girls and them, they decided to start talking about me and my friend loudly on purpose with rude comments and the white girl called me “Chinese girl” and my friend “mama bear” while they snickered like idiots. While we passed them the Muslim girl told her to “say it louder” and she replied with “no i already said it enough” and laughed.  I rolled my eyes, gave her a “really” look and she just looked at me with a big smile and chewed on her lollipop. Her friend was scared. My friend and I left to class and I got really mad. I hated how they could just say racist things and get away with it. I wanted to physically harm them. I was in a bad mood and some of my friends asked who they were and wanted to harm them, too. (which they’d probably do) The thing is, I know I won’t hurt them. The only time I’d ever purposely try to hurt someone was if they decided to push me, etc, but I know they won’t since she was too scared to say what she was saying louder earlier. I want her to stop. I’ve asked her to stop in the past and she thinks she’s doing nothing wrong. I can’t tell the teachers either because those girls are seen as the goody two shoes to the teachers. What do I do?",01Nov2019,1

The very first post I came across was posted by a high school mate who I used to be best friends with until we fell out- she was manipulative, self centred, and had no regard for my or anyone else’s feelings. Her life long dream was to be an athlete, her schedule was full of different sports, ranging from kick boxing (she was a national kickboxing champion) to sports I’d never even heard of. The first picture out of a dozen was a surgical scar on her back, the second of her in hospital. She was in a car accident and broke her ribs and spine, paralysing her from the waist down. As I read her story I began to cry, and I can’t stop. I fully know that her attitude and behaviour has not changed since we were friends, she’s still as selfish and nasty as before, but I cannot stop myself from crying- for her life crumbling in front of her, her pain, and the way she picked herself back up. She came to terms with it and is now aspiring to be a para-athlete, but every time I think about anything I begin to cry, and I don’t know why. What do I do? I’ve never cried this much for someone before, and I’m genuinely torn up inside.",01Nov2019,1

665,"Hey all. I'm not typically good at this kind of thing, admitting that I'm lost and confused and in need of help. I'm just at the end of my wits though. I'm not too sure where to begin, so I'll just start a couple of years ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

About 2 and a half years ago, I was in community college. I was 19 years old, and stretched thin. Went in wanting a music degree, got a scholarship, realized music was not secure at all. See, I come from a very poor family. Single mother, who kicked me out 2 weeks before I was due to start college. Also stole a lot of money from me. God, this is all coming out so unorganized. It didn't exactly feel organized at the time though. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I'm scrambling between majors. I aimed for comp sci. I lost my job at the college, management changed and a couple of departments arranged some not-quite-nepotism. My life plummeted. Suddenly, I took out student loans so as to not get sucked back into life with an exploitative parent. I started smoking a lot of pot. I made terrible decisions. 

&amp;#x200B;

There was a light at the end of the tunnel though: my SO. I met him shortly after being fired. We pretty much instantly fell in love. He moved in with me within 6 months, then he got a job offer out of town. We moved together. It's been great, but I still feel stunted. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've held jobs here sporadically since then, but have ended up quitting or getting fired. Going from a nice office job back to waiting tables kind of messes with you. I've quit substances other than some drinks at night. For a while, I made amazing money as a freelance writer. That fizzled out too though, now I'm lucky to clear a few hundred a month. It feels like there are no opportunities for me here, in this small town. Jobs are either manual labor affairs that destroy your body, or minimum wage working alongside people who are where I used to be: constantly high.  

&amp;#x200B;

I worry about what I'd do without him. I feel weaker and more discouraged every passing day. I haven't been able to make any friends here. People my age that stay behind in towns like this are either Jesus freaks or speed freaks. I've gotten close to several of his friends though. I'd like to be doing more, bring in more, feel less shitty. In this environment, I just don't have it in me anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to go back to school, but there's only a two year college here. Not that the money or resources are there for it though. I just feel like I'm taking up space. Is this life?",01Nov2019,1

669,"Well, here goes nothing. Sorry for the awful sentence structuring and so on.

A little background: I'm currently 'under education' but about to go on to uni. My family lives in a faily large house compared to our country (not American) in the capital. My dad has a long university degree in economics and used to work for quite important companies back in the day. My mom also had a fairly good job. All that changed after the crisis in 2008 though as my dad apparently had been doing some shady work for the companies and was pretty much discarded when the crisis hit. My mom was also let go of.

My family hasn't had a stable source of income since '08 and it's affecting all of us:

My dad spends all his day in our basement doing god knows what and my mom has gotten an ok position working for the state. My brother, who was born too late to remember when we had money to spend, has taken up smoking (which he is WAY too young to do) and has developed into an extremely isolated person. I suppose I have too, although less so. His grades have become awful as of late. All my family can talk about at dinner is how everything is going to shit. We've burnt through the last of our savings. My dad and brother are talking about suicide worringly often but refuse any sort of help. I find myself being 'persuaded' by their worldview.

I suppose it could all be boiled down to:

What do I do when everyone around me is utterly depressed and going down a slope of not even caring enough to make an effort to change things. When things are beginning to be so stale that I also begin adapting their mindset? Is there an escape?",01Nov2019,2

I don’t know what to do I don’t have someone that I trust enough to help me make the right decision.

My father who's always worked his off for years receives this, and i receive dishonor, lost honor and lost every chance to put back the puzzle pieces for my family, yet i torn it apart.. and now it's gone

now my sister won't forgive me, my mother hates me forever, my brother isn't my brother anymore, and my dad.. he just can't handle what he wants to feel about it.

Please guys just please atleast advise me something no matter what it fucking us, can i put it all back together? if not then what to do? work and leave the house and just leave my family pieces and forget them? what to do?",01Nov2019,1

675," 

I'm not sure if my behavior is okay, so I'll write few things I do.

1. I  can be really mean to someone. It's like I have two personalities. One  is extremely helpful, I would like to help everyone, be kind to everyone  etc. But sometimes it's like something switches in my. During that  ""episode"" I don't care for anyone and if someone angers me I insult him,  sometimes I say things like ""kill yourself."" When I see someone  suffering it's not doing anything with me. But when I have the ""caring  episode"" it makes me almost cry. These ""episodes"" can change within  minutes.
2. I  imagine people dying. I often imagine people getting shot or getting  killed somehow else. Sometimes I'm the killer, sometimes it's somebody  else. Sometimes it's just random people, sometimes people I dislike.  Maybe I should add that I also fantasy about my death.
3. I  imagine myself being a dictator of the entire world. I imagine that I  set an order, everyone is obeying me and I have unlimited power. When I  fantasy about this I feel like only my opinions are the right ones and  people should follow them.

I  don't think I would really hurt someone. I'm actually afraid of people  since I have social anxiety. As I said, I have thoughts about my death,  sometimes it's just car hitting me, sometimes it's a suicide. I'd like  to hear your opinions on this and if it's not okay what could I do about that.",01Nov2019,2

682,"I smoke weed. I'm 18. I've been off of it for a month, went cold turkey with no problem, but for a little while my use turned daily and it was purely because I have too much free time. But that's one of the reasons I took a break. 

But the reason I smoke weed at all is because it reminds me of a better time in my life. My life does kinda suck, and I'm trying to deal with it and work on making it better, but that's going to take time and money, money I'm still saving. 

Another reason I stopped is because my mental health doctor found out and started wanting to drug tests me. She seems to think I'm doing all sorts of stuff on the side, which isn't the case at all. I still haven't gone for the drug tests, because I just think it's bs and a waste of time. 

But I found another source of weed from someone at work, and I could be getting some tonight. I do have anxiety (of which weed doesn't have any effect on), and all this shit people tell me about being addicted and how it ruined their lives scares the fuck out of me. I don't consider myself to be addicted, or chasing highs, and I'm working on self-control as it is. But I guess anxiety mixes in and tells me that they're right, that I'm making a huge mistake by smoking pot. I really just wanted to see what others think though. 

Even my therapist told me weed is ok as long as I don't let it interfere with my responsibilities.",01Nov2019,1

Any time that I ask someone(doctor, therapist, friends, SO), everyone seems to have the same reaction, ""what do you want to do?"", ""why not start your own business?"", etc, etc. I just can't reconcile the time sink vs the value gained. I have a high paying job in a field that isn't going away(devops/sysadmin/whatever), but the idea of getting out of bed in the morning to sink 9 hours into it is just unbearable. It's not the specific job either, I've worked in offices, remote, multiple industries in tech, multiple industries in entertainment, worked in hospitality, construction, all mindless boring tasks with no value gained.

688,"so, im 18 years old and am taking gr 13 in highschool right now and im there for a whole year to get a few extra credits. Im mainly doing this to make my mom happy and i am going to go through with it and finish this year. Now, my dilemma is about what to do next year. I personally HATE school and the canadian school system and believe it is failing me and truly think that college/uni is torture and a waste of time for my situation(not dissing anyone who thinks otherwise). I want to be my own boss and make something of myself. However, my dad currently pays my mother child support which is about 1000$ every month! Me and my mother made a deal that if i continue with school, whether it be college or uni, she will give me all the monthly payments for the child support(12 grand a year) as long as i am in school. I am basically getting paid to go to school. However, keep in mind that if there is any break in my school the child support money stops, so taking a 1 year break is not a option. Its either go and get the money or dont go and dont get it. The money is very tempting! I keep telling my mom that if i didnt go to college/uni and focussed 100% of my efforts on my dreams, which is something in the business area(online business, general business, real estate, etc), that i will be miles ahead of all the kids coming out of university who are struggling to even get jobs and that the money i could potentially make would make missing out on the child support money worth it. Both my mother and grandparents have such an old way of thinking and they think that the only way you can be successful is to go to uni/college and get a job. I dont think they realize that it IS possible to be successful without a degree and whatever i try and tell about success stories they say ""well thats the exception of people who got lucky"" when in fact, its just they put in the hard work to get to where they are. The idea of working for someone for the rest of my life and slaving away for a company also sounds like torture since i want to live my life on my own terms and have many streams of income to live financially free and spend time travelling and doing stuff i like to do. They dont understand the concept of making money online either which is the avenue i would like to start on my business endeavours(dropshipping, amazon FBA). then, eventually transition to social media marketing and then use that capital to invest in real estate and make passive income. now, i personally find that those 4 years that people are off at uni are CRUCIAL to my success since after uni life really starts to catch up and most peoples dreams die since they are too occupied with a job and then a family etc. I am going to get good enough marks this year so going to uni is still an option if i wanted to in the future but i am wondering if i should take the time off and forgive the child support money and work on my dreams or go to uni/college and take the money and see what happens after and risk life catching up to me. If i did go to uni i would try and get into a BBA(bachelor of business administration) program. This is a HUGE decision for me and i know it will disappoint my mom if i didnt go but i know that if i put my mind to it i WILL be successful and make more money than her and my grandparents combined, however, i really dont want to disappoint them and have them not believe in me. Btw, my grandparents and parents are mean or strict they just really want me to follow the same pathway as everyone else which i find super cliche and ""normal"". I dont wanna be normal since most of the people that didnt follow everyone else ended up successful.

694,"Ok, so below I'll provide a short summary of my problem:  
I should preface this by saying I'm an 18-year-old highschooler in my senior year who typically never dates, not that I'm unattractive or anything of that sort, I just tend chose to avoid that whole mess. However, a few months ago I started seeing this cute Korean chick who was even more inexperienced than me, in fact, she'd never even been on a date in her life. I saw this as a good thing for obvious reasons (we were in the same boat) and so began our ""relationship."" This is where the strict Asian stereotype became reality lol, not only did I have to meet her mom and dad on our first date but also every one of her 4 siblings. Her mom seemed to really like me while her dad just kind of lurked in the background and watched resentfully, so I figured I'm batting .500 which isn't too bad. Fast forward to after our first few dates and she starts to act weirder than usual... fast forward another week with little contact and she randomly texts me saying that her parents are in the middle of a nasty fight about me, this made me extremely uneasy and I just flat out told her that if I was the cause of arguments then I have no interest in seeing her. She didn't like that one bit and said that they just needed to talk it out because her dad couldn't keep her from dating forever (keep in mind this girl is 18, too). So eventually her dad concedes enough for us to go on another date (which goes fine), only for her to text me the next day saying that once again they're viciously arguing about us. This time I just told her to keep me updated, to which she didn't reply. Fast forward to two weeks of not hearing from this girl and I start doing some snooping (kill me, I know), I find her TikTok (oh god even worse) and uncover information I wish I hadn't. The first thing I see is her bio which exclaims, ""let's go lesbians!"" This is followed up by multiple videos all supporting the fact that she was, in fact, lesbian. One of which was blatantly about me, with the caption saying something along the lines of ""when a guy thinks you like him..."" ""but then you realized something..."" followed up by the punchline of: ""I'm gay."" Confusing because this girl seemed head-over-heels for me before her parents began arguing about us.

So here are the million-dollar questions: 

Does someone just become gay/lesbian in one day?

Could her parents' fighting have contributed to this seemingly sudden decision?

And lastly, wtf do I do here? Should I just leave it or say something?

Idk where to post this, if there is a more relevant subreddit please tell me, I'm new to reddit.

Ok, so I'll get straight to the point. My friend on discord right now has serous trust issues (I think its her parent's fault), and she thinks that making an account or profile on anything can allow someone to hack her account and ""find her"". I asked her to make a a xbox live account so we could play mine craft bedrock edition together she said she doesn't want to because of that reason. I tried explaining how that's impossible because the levels of security ensures that info isn't leaked but she won't listen.

And everything eventually happened **with the exception** of more sexual attraction to other individuals.

And there's where the problem lays. I've hit a point where I feel successful about every aspect of my life **but** that one.

Fast forward to a few days ago when I was chatting with a good friend of mine (let's call him Dave) about how amazing I think she is and then the aforementioned fucker (let's call him G) just jumps in on the convo and this is how it went:  
Dave: Yeah, man, go for her.  
Me: Oh boy, my heart's jumping out of my chest just by talking about her.  
G: So, you're in love huh?  
Me: That's an understatement

G: Can I see a picture of her?

Me: yeah, sure. \*shows him a picture of her\*

Btw, at this point in time, I and Dave thought that G was gay.

G: Damn, she's hot.

(Even though she's not quite what people would normally consider being hot)

Me: What? Are you out of your mind? How can you talk about her like that? Especially knowing how I feel about her.

G: Sorry dude, let's call her cute as fuck then, cool?

Me: Uh...no. Don't you dare talk about her and if I see you around her I'll fuck you up. (I said this jokingly...ish and he ain't no player either, so I wasn't worried)

&amp;#x200B;

THEN, just today I was in a school event. I look towards where she was sitting because I wanted to go talk to her and I see G trying to talk to her, the girl he didn't know existed until I showed him that photo. Thankfully, she didn't seem to be too much into it and just being her normal happy self. He got up to leave shortly after  and I went after him to confront him, this is how it went:

Me: Oi, what the fuck?

G: what's going on, man?

Me: I swear to God! If I EVER see you talking to her again I swear you'll have to drink your food through a straw, I'm fucking serious. (I said that pretty confidently, I am at least a foot taller than him and a lot stronger, after all)

a) My sister's healing process has sort of stagnated since she told me and mom about this and I thought confronting him might help move things along (sister has approved this strategy but does not want to be involved herself)

b) he has never been made to face any sort of consequences for what he did or even face the fact that he did it.

They were going to wait until thanksgiving to reveal they were pregnant to the rest of the family, but due to the seriousness of her health, they called my mom to inform her of what is going on and to pray for them. The first thing out of my mom's mouth was ""You're pregnant out of wedlock?!!"" after my brother pointed out how rude that was to focus on that when her health is in danger, she retracted that. It was an immediate reaction and once she realized how serious the situation was, she calmed down. She has been SO upset and angry at the fact that they are pregnant out of wedlock. She says she's happy, and I believe her, she's constantly asking about the fiancees health and praying for them, and visiting at the hospital. However all I have been hearing from her is how angry she is that she's pregnant out of wedlock because she's a pastor, how ""it happened the first time and I forgave him, he promised it wouldn't happen again"" etc. I have not actually seen joy, from her. I feel like the visiting the hospital etc is out of duty. Nothing about having another grandchild, or happy they are pregnant. Its just anger but she says she's happy. She's talked to them about getting married ASAP because of this and how disappointed she is. 

I understand she is upset, but its happened. Patty is pregnant. They are 30, not teenagers. They are planning to get married within the next 1 year. There is nothing she can do now, so I'm so confused at her behavior. Its pissing me off how am I more excited for a niece/nephew than she is for a grandchild? I've been telling her this. 

Am I in the wrong to be this annoyed? Is she in the wrong? or are we both just handling this in different ways? She's 60 so I know there is a generational thing going on. I know its not exactly my place but i'm really close with my brother, and I'm around my mom a lot so I'm getting very irritated.",01Nov2019,6
736,"Hello everyone, I am currently purchasing my first house with a large amount of help from my girlfriend. Now, while I have some idea about the basic first-time homeowners tasks (such as repainting, repairs, and getting the billing set-up) I am in need of advice for more mundane things. So, to the members of this subreddit, I would like to ask for advice on making the house as welcoming and comfortable as possible for my girlfriend and me before we move in fully. Stuff that we can do ourselves with a contractor to improve our quality of living on a frugal budget. So, what advice can everyone give me?",01Nov2019,0
737,"So I’ll try to summarize this 

I was trying to make friends with this girl dan (not real name) who liked making fun of her ex Lopez ( not real name again) not real making fun but more like “ewww lopezzz” and shit like that so pure coincidence I was seated next to him and he is like super funny like be in a happy mood all day funny, but dan started saying things to me like “ I bet you wanna suck Logan’s dick” to me in private and when I’m right next him! So in retaliation I started throwing pencils at him when he entered the room not at his face but at him chest in shit. That stopped the taunting but made him mad at me so like a few months later I was laughing at one of his jokes ( I had moved at this point but I was placed near him) and he asked e and this was out of his personality “ do you have any real friends?” I went silent and stoped  talking to him in general unless I was selling candy to him or dan was taunting us again. Soon dan and Lopez got back together but it ended quickly bu now I’m seated near him and it was only me and him ( our desk mates weren’t here today) and he helped me on a test and we played chess and joked

I have always kinda of liked him and... idk! I just needed to vent I just need tips on how to know if he likes me or not. Lol I will update if anyone wants I just needed to get this out.",01Nov2019,2
738,"I work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked away to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.

740,"I just moved to a new city about half a year ago, got a job after a month and a half and started making friends with coworkers. I was really happy that I was making connections!
One of my coworkers “Barb” has had a long term boyfriend, for about 8-9 years, they met in high school.
There are a couple of things that she does that is not appropriate, but the three top things that have happened are:
 - Making out with a friend at a club when we all went out together. (Not a coworker, one of my friends who I invited and didn’t know she was in a relationship)
 - And secondly, she flirts with guys and then tells everyone they are harassing her. In particular she told us all that one of our coworkers(nickname “Nick”) was harassing her, to the point where she got everyone to ostracize him. We all went out again with “Nick” and he got a text that he got fired. When that happened “Barb” was stroking his back and hanging on his arm and saying ‘I’m so sorry that’s so crappy wow I’m so sorry that stinks.’ When he got up and left to talk on the phone to someone she followed him, then came back early and said ‘wow I hate him but also how sad but I fucking hate him.’
She’s said the same thing(harassment from guys) about multiple other co workers as well, at least 3 off the top of my head. I believed her about the first one, but after I saw her make out with that other dude and that other behavior with “Nick” I’ve been taking it all with a grain of salt. 
 - Finally, the gossiping. Any time someone has told her something in secrecy she tells everyone else. Like saying one older coworker (40yo female) thinks 20yo male coworkers are cute. It feels like she pretends to be friends with people to get their secrets and tell everyone about them which is yuck. 

Now since I have realized “Barb” is not someone I like, I’ve been trying to distance myself from her. But she is pretty central in the group at work, and plans a lot of the events at work. Lately she has just been omitting me from the invitations, and I get the feeling she’s been saying bad stuff about me, although I don’t know what she’d be saying saying I didn’t tell her anything about myself in confidence.
I’m just upset that I’m trying to have a chill work space without that level of gossiping (this week she gathered everyone for her latest exploit of meeting up with an employee from another part of the company, while I put my headphones on so I didn’t have to be a part of it), and also have a friend group in this new city I live in. Is there a way to maintain friendships with the people I like without hanging out with her but also not causing weird drama?? I feel very frustrated about it often!!! 

(Also: I’m not going to be telling other people at work that I saw her cheat on her boyfriend that’s not what I’m about. I’m also not going to be talking to her boyfriend about that. Not my space not my place. It’s shitty because he seems nice but that’s beyond my scope and ability to maintain professional boundaries.) 

TLDR; co-worker at center of social circle causing drama at work (and cheated on her bf) and I don’t want to hang with her but want to hang with other coworkers, what do?

744,"I was called into my boss's office today and kind of told off because rumor went around that my boyfriend's Halloween costume idea was racist and someone overheard me talking about it and got offended. 

My boyfriend and I were invited to a Halloween party where the theme was ""Booze &amp; Boos"". This wasn't a work party but some people from work were attending. My boyfriend doesn't work at the same place as me but in the break room a few of us were talking about what ideas we had for a Booze themed dressup. I said I'm going as a White Claw, and had made a really crude paper mache claw hand. When asked what my boyfriend might go as, I said, ""I guess his favorite booze is Tequila."" The idea obviously being that he'd have a sombrero and poncho and look like a Mexican. Not because he wants to dress up as a Mexican but because he would look like a Tequila bottle, like the one where the bottle cap is a small sombrero. 

Anyway, he ran out of time and didn't manage to get any of his custome pieces and went as something else. In the morning, I get called in by boss who says someone overheard me in the break room and is really upset because she's half Mexican. She didn't attend the party, she just overheard this conversation, probably without the full context. Regardless, she emailed the boss calling me, and my bf, racists. She was in tears about it. 

I'm really annoyed that I'm getting yelled at over a custome idea that didn't happen, involving someone who doesn't even work here. I honestly didn't see the idea as racist because it wasn't intended to be at all, and the bottom line is, it didn't even end up happening, and even if it did, the girl who got upset was never going to this party anyway. 

I think this has all been blown out of proportion, but now my whole office thinks I'm a racist asshole. I've been getting nothing but cold shoulders. Is this really my fault? Is my reputation and relationship with my boss and coworkers ruined forever?",01Nov2019,7
746,"My best friend invited me to a party at her friends place. We're in college, and she's a lesbian and I'm a straight guy. She got pretty intoxicated, but apart from her being more forgetful you couldn't really tell, I guess I thought she was less drunk then she was, but her actions said otherwise and I should have immediately put a stop to things, but I was worried to make her sad or mad, because I didn't do anything it only made everything worse. She is usually very bubbly, upbeat and enthusiastic, but when she's drunk it's even more so, so she's very affectionate. She ended up giving me lots of hugs throughout the night, to which I happily would hug her back. Later in the night, while giving me a tight hug, she asked me to give her a kiss, to which I thought 'eh, it's a party, sure' so I gave her a little peck on the cheek, no harm in that, but she moved her face in to give me a kiss on the lips. I went back to the 'eh, it's a party thought' and maybe since she's my best friend and she's this affectionate right now, she's trying to be nice, but I was also thinking that I should probably stop it there because it's still too much and I know it's not what she'd want. As I tried pulling away after I gave her a little kiss on the lips, she was still holding me tightly going to try to makeout with me, I stopped her for a sec, telling her 'it isn't what she wants', 'you wouldn't do this if you were sober', 'I don't want you to regret anything' etc. but she kept instisting that it was fine, that she isn't that drunk, etc. and we ended up making out. I know I should have done more, I should have physically removed myself from the situation, I should have done something, figured someway out, but I was totally blanking at the time and just went with it. Basically choose the worst possible option at the time and I feel horrible about it now. I made sure it wouldn't go any further than making out, but it was still well past the line. I really didn't know what to do because I was too scared to hurt her feelings, make her sad or mad, and as a result now after the fact she's very sad and mad at me. I was a complete idiot and I don't know what to do now, she's means the world to me and I really am terrified about losing her.

749,"Hey guys,

Idk how it started but I never really felt sad about anything (e.g. when a pet died). We sadly had to put our dog down last summer because he ate rat poison and I didn't really felt anything nor really bothered after some days anymore.

Of course I cried when he was being put down, but idk.

I don't really know how to tell, but the idea of death of a loved one doesn't seem so ""harsh"" for me as it should and I feel really creeped out by that.

I think that I don't have an anti person disorder or something like that, it's just that my parents never really showed me how to love or care. They always fought when I was young and when I got 18 y/o they had a divorce.

I spent a lot of time in front of a pc. I had friends and went to parties and still work out, but I never had a gf or a really deep connection with someone. I have good friends with whom I do a lot on weekends etc., but I feel like I have a different look at the world (not trying to sound edgy).

With 15 or 16 years I got a very bad ekzem on both my hands and it made me really shy, because I avoided interactions, because I didn't want to show someone my hands. They basically had huge wounds and I lost a lot of skin. It was mostly caused by stress and allergics.

My mother tried to be a good and so did my father, but they also had a lot of fights or a bad mood. It wasn't always easy being home and having to care about a 3 year old younger sister while my parents fought and threw things around.

This whole situation left me really broken and since then I don't really can show emotions. I think it might be some sort of defend mechanism of my brain so I don't become suicidal or really depressed.

Idk what to do. My life rn is quite good and I don't think I need a therapeut or something like that. I just think that I need to work on my self.",01Nov2019,1

757,"So I've been having a terrible past year. Have my apartment burglarized. Ended up homeless with kids because of it. Been hotel staying since last October. All my money goes to food, gas, and motel prices. Was saving money each month to possibly purchase an RV. My vehicle transmission went out and I was left without a vehicle. I spent my savings of $2600 which I saved for the RV to purchase a fuel efficient older Honda. Found the guy on OfferUp he owns a mechanic shop. He claimed it was fine and even had a fresh smog certificate from last month. 2 days after purchasing it The car broke down. I couldn't register it because the only remaining money I had for registration went towards a tow truck and a mechanic to fix an electrical issue. 

After getting the electrical issue repaired I noticed the check engine light was on. Apparently there was a leak in one of the hoses and a knock sensor error. I went back to the shop that sold it to me. They quoted me a ridiculous price. I found someone on Craigslist who was way cheaper. I went with them literally to have a drunk driver with no insurance literally destroy it while it was parked. 


The front of the car looks terrible but I purchase new lights for it and managed to salvage it. 

It's been 2 months now I finally have some breathing money. I went to registered only to be told it needs to pass the previous smog certificate is now more than three months old. 

I went to smog it and it failed the visual inspection because someone installed an extender to the end of the catalytic converter. I was extremely disappointed and I looked at the previous place that smog did and it just so happened to be the smog shop right next door to his mechanic shop. 

What should my next course of action be?

Should I go to the smog shop and explain to them everything? should I go to the mechanic shop that sold me the vehicle and explain to them everything and see what he offers? Or do I contact some smog association and get him investigated and pay someone to remove the extender and pray for the best?

I'm in California. Should I trying to register in a different state? I know California supposedly has the hardest smog requirements",01Nov2019,2

I didn’t want to go but I was forced to by parents and the authorities even though I’m over 18. I spent about a week there and in that time period I feel like they did something to my hand. I noticed my grip isn’t as strong, hands are a little bit limp when I spread my arms out, and those two muscles I don’t know what they’re called but they’re located in the wrist and they kinda pop out when you make a fist or grip on something. I noticed they were uneven with my hand. I don’t remember them being like that. Now only one pops out each hand instead of both muscles while looking uneven. Before forced into the hospital I had to get a blood draw similar to why I went into this hospital. Noticed some pain/discomfort around the area and I noticed my foot slowly go down by the end of the day after blood draw at home.

766,"Apologies in advance, this is going to be a beefy post. Also posting from a throwaway.

tl:dr School admin is giving special treatment to a girl violating the support animal agreement because her sister works there as a hall director. I want justice!

===========

People/dogs involved in this post:

Chonker- my dog

RB- Rule breaker, girl who won't leash her dog

Pipsqueak- RB's dog

Sam- my friend with a service dog

Goober- friend's service dog

===========

I'm a college student in Virginia with an ESA dog living with me on campus. He is allowed to stay with me through an accommodation with my school's accessibility office. I love my pup, having him with me has been beneficial for my mental and physical health.

At the beginning of every year support animal handlers need to sign an agreement form. In which it states that animals must be on leash in public areas at all times. ESA's are also not granted the same public access that service animals have. To break these rules means the animal gets removed from campus.

Since my school is very open with ESA's, there are a ton of animals on campus, especially dogs. While pretty much everyone is good about following the agreement, I've been having issues with one person in particular.

The first and issue is Pipsqueak being off leash. I've run into RB numerous times with her dog off leash. This is a huge problem because every time I see them, Pipsqueak will run right up to my dog. Chonker is always on leash, but he has at least 90lbs more chunk than Pipsqueak, so that in itself is an issue. If Chonker even accidentally stepped on Pipsqueak with one paw, that could mean a broken bone. Chonker is very friendly and well trained, but still has puppy brain so he gets way too excited when he sees her. Besides the fact that not leashing your dog violates the agreement, it's just a hassle. When I'm trying to get somewhere, and we see see them Pipsqueak will completely ignore RB and follow us. Pipsqueak is cute, but RB obviously has no control over her.

Coming from the point of view of a dog lover, it baffles me how RB can't see the dangers off leash having such a high energy, untrained, tiny dog off leash. We're right near a busy road and there are cars going through campus all the time. If I was her, I'd be terrified that Pipsqueak would run off and get hit by a car that didn't see her.

Another problem is RB bringing Pipsqueak into buildings she's not allowed to be in. To preface, there are problems around campus with students touching/distracting support animals. So, a group of support animal handlers and I got together to have meetings with our accessibility office, in an attempt to think of ways to educate students on support animal etiquette. Sam was apart of that group, and brought Goober to the meeting since she has a medical condition that requires Goober to tag along everywhere. None of the other group members brought their dogs because they are ESAs. Except for RB of course lol.

She didn't inform anyone before hand that Pipsqueak was coming with her. They were also about 20 minutes late, so we assumed she wasn't coming. When they walked in, Pipsqueak ran in on a retractable leash that wasn't shortened. Sam obviously wasn't prepared for this at all. Goober was just laying down so she wasn't holding the leash. Pipsqueak made a beeline for Goober and started growling at him. Goober has been professionally trained and 100% just a good boy, but he is still a dog and this took him by surprise as well. All he did was jump up because Pipsqueak charged at him.

I wish that was the end of that incident, but this is next part is where RB shows what a nuthole she is. RB left immediately after this and went straight to a cop car on duty. She claimed she was attacked by Goober, and filed a police report to get Goober kicked off campus. Wild stuff, right? Overall, nothing actually happened, no one was hurt. I figured it was a one time lapse of judgement, and texted her after asking how she was doing. I felt like trying to smooth things over would be a good idea so that we could all get back to focusing on more important issues regarding our dogs and other students. However, RB just completely WENT OFF, claiming that Goober jumped up on his back legs and pushed her down (she described it as if he had hands lol). She said she wouldn't stop pursuing this until Goober was off campus for good. All I could think while reading her rant was ""uhm you do realize I was in the same room and saw everything right?"".

Well, nothing came of her attempt to get Goober removed. Things quieted down, and I didn't see her or Pipsqueak on campus for a long time. Then, while taking Chonker for a night pee, I see Pipsqueak running around off leash. They didn't notice us at first so I tried to back away slowly, but Chonker's collar jingling gave us away. So, I'm standing there trying to keep Chonker calm, I didn't want to walk away because Pipsqueak would just keep following us. Meanwhile RB is taking her sweet time walking over to collect her dog, even though I'm telling her to get over here right now and take her.

I made sure to check the time, and reported the incident so admin could look at security footage. This alone should have been grounds to remove Pipsqueak from campus. Not only was she off leash, but RB had no control over her. I didn't report this maliciously, just because I don't like RB. I even feel like I was a bit too lenient. In the beginning, I didn't want Pipsqueak to be removed since I understand how it would feel if Chonker was forced to live at home.  However, RB just keeps violating the agreement with this sense of entitlement.

I'm told that RB will begin the process of having Pipsqueak removed, so I thought all was well. Nope. Turns out RB's sister is a hall director for one of the residence halls. RB's sister put in a word for her with the President, and RB didn't have any consequences.

So basically, this went from being a ""RB/Pipsqueak"" problem to a ""Fuck this college, rules mean nothing"" problem. I have no doubts that if Pipsqueak looked like Chonker, she'd be kicked out ASAP.

I had a meeting with the Dean of students to talk about how this whole situation is unjust. All I got from her was, ""There were other factors that I'm not at liberty to discuss, it is what it is"". Literally that's all she kept saying every time I said anything. After this interaction, I've completely lost faith in my school to protect me and uphold the rules of an agreement.

I really do not understand how they don't see this as an issue. If one student is allowed to not follow the agreement, then what is the point of having the rules in the first place? The Dean even had the nerve to tell me that they would treat me the same way if I was in their situation. I told her without missing a beat that I would never be in the same situation because I always leash Chonker, and I don't take him into buildings he's not allowed in.

So basically, I'm looking for some feedback on the situation or suggestions on what steps I should take next to hold my school and RB accountable for their actions. I have to live on campus until I graduate, so this is something I can't really look past. Especially if RB continues being a huge nuthole. Also, I think support animals are an awesome thing, and I don't want it to be ruined for future students. Being able to have my chunky chonker with me has changed my life for the better, and I know others can reap great benefits from it as well. I want to make sure the school doesn't repeat the way they handled this situation, even after I graduate.",01Nov2019,2
767,"Here's the deal. I have mental issues and in my early 20s was very steeped in drug culture. Last year I tried to make a real effort to get my shit together. I moved into an apartment, didn't drink for over a year, I found a job and started going to school. I even made a new friend. Despite all of this progress, I still feel like a child wearing a dirty diaper. Every day I get out of bed and feel like absolute shit, my jaw is always clenching and I suffer from tension headaches of unknown origin nearly every second of the day.

To combat all of the stress I started drinking again. This worked for a little while, for a few months I was flying high and felt better about myself. My coworkers noticed an improvement in my performance and moral. However, the positive effects of the alcohol have worn off and today is my last day of drinking for a year. It's starting to affect my judgement, my sense of cleanliness. I can't organize anything or stick to a list of chores. I just roll out of bed and do whatever needs doing that day.  


To be successful I need to be organized and stick to being organized. I just can't seem to decide on a system. I'll get notebooks, planners, write things down, but I just end up with endless lists on scraps of paper that never get completely accomplished because I'm just too emotionally wiped out.

On top of this, negativity both at school and my workplace was sending me into a dark place, so I decided to quit my job without a new one lined up in order to escape this problem. I can't quit school, but I can replace my job.  


What I need is your best life organizational rules. I need a life overhaul and it needs to be something uncomplicated that I can actually stick to. How do I organize myself and my life so that I can be an efficient person without sacrificing my sense of fun? How can I stick to a time table for my projects and life events when having one in the first place seems to ruin the spontaneity of life?",01Nov2019,1
768,"Hello, I'm almost 28 years old and my mom has Parkinson's. A little backstory, my mom abused me growing up, more so when I was a young adult. She also relied on me for money, never had any of her own, and all around made me into a financially unstable adult. I was very fortunate to find a job 4 years ago that covered all of my expenses and more, but I had so much debt from when I lived with my mom that I never was able to save that money. She has no savings, living check to check from disability and a small pension from her job.        
      
3 years ago, Mom fell and broke her hip, then she broke it again a month later in rehab and has not walked since. I managed to find her a nice personal care home that only costs $2,400/month. Unfortunately, she only makes $2,100 from her monthly checks so I have to pick up the extra. She used to make less, too, so I used to have to pay more. Her medications are also ~$200/month, she has to have a specialist trim her nails and that's a $30 copay every 3 months.                 
                   
I recently lost my job; I'm now making $20,000 less a year and I am not college educated (although I'm trying to work on it) and jobs that pay over $45,000 without a degree are difficult to come by in my area. I cannot afford to live myself at this point, I definitely cannot afford to pay for my mom to live.          
       
I do not have family that can help me pay for her, she cannot get on government assistance because she sold a house 4 years ago and doesn't have a paper trail of what she did with the money (hint: she spent it all on stupid shit) and the govt wants 5 years of financial info to even consider.             
          
She is a huge burden and stress on my life, I feel suffocated and like I can never do anything with my life until she is dead. I cannot get married, I can't have kids, I (assume) can't go back to college (who knows how I'll pay for it since I lost my job....), my debt is piling up again from trying to keep us both afloat for years.           
            
Every time I see her, she tries to take more and more. She asks for $80 for a haircut and color and I go years without a trim. She asks for desserts after I take her to lunch once a week, even though I had to scrape up money for lunch itself. Christmas is going to be extra hard because it's also her birthday and I have nothing. I tell her no, my boyfriend also tells her no and that's she's being ridiculous by asking all the time, but she never lets up and it makes me feel even more suffocated.           
         
I'm worried I will be going into an early grave at the rate of stress I have. I have suicidal thoughts. I have thoughts of killing her. It's not healthy. I don't know what to do. If I leave her, she can't afford the care she needs. Do I just cut contact anyway, and hope the caregiver contacts my deadbeat family for money or to move her to their house? 
                     
             
Does that make a shitty daughter? I want to sell my house and move away and change my number and delete Facebook so no one can contact me. My boyfriend believes the guilt will kill me but I can't imagine it being worse than this overwhelming burden following me around and choking me. I feel mostly guilty that I would force the caregiver to kick her out or something. I don't know what to do. Do I just stick it out? Can I leave her?",01Nov2019,2

771,"I’m a graphic designer - I went for school for it, got a Bachelor’s degree in it, and had a little trouble finding a full time job for it where I live because, frankly, it’s a small town. (Good) opportunities that pop up are pretty rare. 

For the past four years I’ve worked on a yearly contract basis with a couple of local festivals, which have really expanded my portfolio and it’s gotten my name out there locally. It’s not full time work, but I’ve always worked in retail alongside it. Back in June, I saw an ad for a local shop “with benefits” that needed someone to do sales, marketing, design, etc. and I immediately applied - I got in, but I was a little disappointed to find out there was no health insurance or dental or anything like that, which were things that I was looking for but I was desperate to be making more money that what minimum wage retail jobs were giving me. The job benefits are 5 days PTO after working there for a year, then it extends to 8 days PTO after 5 years. Lunches are 30 minutes, unpaid. No sick days, no raises ever. There’s a retirement plan and we get a couple of paid holidays. Weekends are busy so I get two days off during the week. The atmosphere is a bit laid back and I don’t work on commission. I only have a few coworkers I work with and they’re all very nice, but for the most part they’re in relation to my boss or his family. My boss seems pretty impressed with my work and since I’ve been working remotely for the festivals, I have the entire Adobe Creative Suite, which is a large step up from the programs they had been using.  I know my boss would be extremely upset with me for leaving because of a different job and it would very likely burn this bridge.

I got a little concerned when a coworker who has been working there for the past 15 years was telling me she hasn’t had health insurance after all this time because she hasn’t been able to pay for it and doesn’t qualify for Medicaid. I thought that I would stick to this job for a while because it is a good, well paying job but maybe it’s not a forever thing. I’m also not too enthusiastic about what we sell.

Weeks ago a family friend contacted me saying a government job opened up in the tourism department and that I would be perfect for it. I shrugged it off at first, saying I wasn’t looking for another job right away because I literally just started this job. My mom caught wind of it and told me I should look the job up because it has great benefits. It’s a government job so it’s all paid government holidays, you immediately accrue vacation time each pay period, you get great health insurance, dental, gym membership, 4 percent raises each year, retirement, paid one hour lunches, 10 paid sick days per year, I’d get paid a couple bucks more than I get paid now, weekends off, and the job sounds perfect for me. 

So what’s the problem? I went in for an interview last week and it went great. The job seemed absolutely perfect. They then let me know that I’d have to take random civil service tests and if I didn’t make it in the top three test scores every time, I’d lose my job. As someone who pays for rent (by myself) each month along with car payments, phone payments, electric, internet, and other various bills, it’s a dicey decision for me to make. I’m told the tests are easy, but it’s not on a pass basis - you’re competing against other people to just keep your job. You could take these tests years from now or a couple months from now. 

What should I do? Stay with the job I know will remain stable, or go for this job with better pay and more benefits and face the possibility I could lose my job every time I take a civil service test? I tried to ask the HR department hypothetically how long after a failed civil service test you can continue working at the job so you get a chance to find other employment, but the only answer I got is “it depends on the job.”

Today I got another bill for 30k just to keep me alive.

I don't know what to do. Almost all my family members have taken a second Job to help me pay off my debt. I feel like a piece of shit. I am ruining my friends and families lives because they are trying to help me. There is no foreseeable future end of my illness and hospital bills so I can just as well end it right now.

I have drank half a bottle of vodka tonight.

I own a gun so I am seriously contemplating ending it right now. It would be best for my family and friends. They will be sad for a few weeks but I do not want to push them into debt just to be able to keep me alive some more weeks.

778,"So, this just happened while I was at work. To give you some background information... I work for a large tech company, where we have a very inclusive and supportive community around the office. I started working here about 3 months ago when I moved across the country for this position. I didn't know a soul in this new city so I've been friendly with all of my new coworkers - hoping to make friends/ meet new people. Everyone I've met/ worked with this far has been exceptionally helpful and friendly to me. Up until today, Ive had no indicators that would make me believe I upset / offened/rubbed anyone the wrong way. Ive been replaying the past three months trying to figure out what I could have done/said to possibly result in todays events. So.. this afternoon I had a meeting with my manager where I left my work computer at my desk. I returned to my desk after the meeting and found a post-it note someone had left saying CUNT in all caps. I find this word to be extremely offensive and inappropriate. I dont understand why someone would feel the need to leave me this note. I've done everything in my power to be friendly and mimic the type of community that this company is so proud of having. Anway, I asked two of my coworkers ( who I'm friends with) if they left it on my desk as a joke. They told me that neither of them left it nor would they ever joke around like that. They told me I should report it to my manager/HR - which I did. My manager said that it's good to have this type of incident on file incase it happens again, but they aren't sure they would figure out who left the note. This doesn't make me feel to great because of the uncertainty around who actually did it and now that I'm working in a hostile work environment. I feel that one of my coworkers now targeting me. It makes me uncomfortable knowing someone I work closely with has such an issue with me that they feel the need to leave such a nasty note, yet remain friendly to my face. This feels so childish but idk what else to do. Ive been trying to think of a good way to figure out who wrote the note without drawing too much attention to the situation (comparing handwriting). If you guys have any advice on how to go about this / handle this situation I would really appreciate any recommendations. I've never been in a situation like this, so any feedback would be greatly appreciated!

.

.
Well I feel kinda stuck in a crappy situation and I’m not sure what the way out could be. 

I don’t have a job yet besides the petsitting thing I started awhile ago, but it’s been extremely quiet lately and I realize I need a more reliable source of income. 

(Aunt) and (Uncle) have been very generous and aren’t asking for rent or anything yet except for taking me off the phone plan, (Aunt) even bought me a really nice new jacket recently I didn’t ask for but I know they’re getting annoyed and they have a right to, trust me I feel really really bad and like a loser because of not having a job yet. I really truly don’t want to end up like the stereotype of the 30 year old who lives in the basement and never sees the sunlight. But I just feel stuck. 

One big obstacle is that I don’t drive, I try to learn but even then it will probably take years before I’m ready to handle a vehicle on my own, I feel like one of those idiots who shouldn’t be driving when it comes to road rules and even trying to stay going straight so as helpful as it would be I don’t think it’s realistic for me that driving can be part of this solution. It’s hard and terrifying for me and I don’t understand how most people learn when they’re 16 and do just fine and why that hasn’t been like that for me. 😞

So here’s the thing:
I figured because of the driving issue my best bet was to find something in (my tiny-ass rural town with like 5 buildings or something) so considering almost all the businesses are restaurants I went ahead and got my Foodsafe and Serving It Right certifications. I thought I’d struck gold when I found a local restaurant hiring so I perfected my resume and sent a killer cover letter and they even complimented me on the cover letter but they ended up hiring someone else... which would be fine if my options weren’t so limited. I decided to hand out a bunch more resumes all over (same place,) but of course no one is hiring anyway and I’m not sure I’ll be getting called back any time soon. So I went to the WorkBC place in (nearby town, slightly bigger but even then considered by some a ""village,"" 20 minute drive from my tiny-ass town) and explained to the lady my situation because maybe they could help me but they can’t really do anything for me that I wasn’t doing myself. She explained that the job market was horrible right now due to a bunch of loggers getting laid off and taking all the other jobs. She pointed out a few minor tweaks I could make to my resume, showed me a few job opportunities in (nearby town) but that was pretty much it. I decided to go around (nearby town) handing out resumes as I did remember there’s likely one person I could likely carpool with if I chipped in for gas. Otherwise we are back to the transportation issue. One of the few places that we’re hiring had ""need a full drivers license"" as one of the criteria for hiring. 

*sigh*

I feel as if I would have more luck if I moved to a place with more opportunities (and access to public transportation) than tiny little (nearby town), but in order to move out I need the money to do so in the first place. Which is earned by getting a job. But my problem is trying to find a job in the first place. Therein lies my dilemma. 

I know I sound negative but I’m determined, really. I will not stay in this situation, I can’t. It’s not fair to (aunt) and (uncle) it’s not fair to me. It’s not fair to the dog because I’m buying her food and vet visits and such right now and she’s my biggest inspiration to find something before the money for that runs out which I will not allow to happen because it can’t.

I just don’t know how. I can only hand out so many resumes before I go crazy, or realize that maybe there’s something else I need to do. I’m tired of smiling, handing out a piece of paper and waiting for phone calls that don’t come. But I’m not sure what else to do.",01Nov2019,1

When I had got time to call him he mentioned he was getting married in two weeks and wanted me to talk him out of it because his girlfriend (who I knew nothing about) had found an engagement ring that was meant for me and was so excited to get married. He did get married and all I ever wanted was for him to be happy in life and what I wanted to do in life he was not ok with. I like adventure and love opportunities to learn and better myself and my surroundings. Over the last 11 years we both have kids he is still married and I'm recently single. We occasionally talk and meet when I come home for vacations and all we do is cry and hold each wishing things were different. I recently moved back home to pursue a new job and because he has begged me all summer to move back because he was going to file for a divorce. I ran into his wife at a Halloween party who knew who I was but  we never met. Obviously she felt some type of way because she attacked me from behind by pulling my hair but I never got the chance to see her or defend myself because she was gone just that quick and people pulled her away and were holding me down. Our relationship growing up was one of a kind my parents call him son-in-law and his parents call me daughter-in-law when we see each other. His parents have voiced to me more than once that the kids he has for her are not his kids and they can not stand to be around her. She causes drama, fights and bad vibes everywhere she goes. This entire situation has caused me so much stress my hair is falling out. I'm not the type of person to let things bother me and I let just about everything just go.

She has tried to burn down his house, busted windows out of his vehicles and broke his arm. He says he doesnt want to leave her because of the kids.

There’s going to be another opening soon, and I’ve been getting a lot of encouragement to go for it. I’m pretty sure I would have a good chance of getting it.

All my coworkers would know that I failed, and I couldn’t just go back to my former position like nothing happened. I really enjoy working at the library, and I know it would be difficult to find another job where I feel comfortable.
