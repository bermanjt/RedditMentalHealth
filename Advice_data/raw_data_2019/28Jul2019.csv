1,Backstory my parents are divorced. This is the first vacation I’ve been on in forever (2011) as my parents just didn’t have the money. I’m on a trip with all of my cousins and uncles and stuff and my mom and girlfriend. My dad is at his house he owns by himself over 600 miles away. He is 57 and I am worried sick about him for some reason. My dad and I were never close but over the last few years we’ve bonded over cars. He is working on the roof of his house and I’m afraid of him falling off and no one being around to help him. I’ve felt kind of almost homesick all day since we got here. How can I calm down? I have this ridiculous anxiety when he doesn’t answer something may have happened to him but I don’t want this to ruin our family trap.,28Jul2019,1

Everyone I’m close to in my life seems to be doing amazing things with their careers and bettering themselves always looking for a new challenge, but I don’t feel any of this. I feel lazy and like I should have ambitions for myself but I don’t

6,"So my boyfriend and I just broke up. Literally 3 days ago. Well technically we’re on a break (his decision) but I’m preparing myself for the worst. It was very mature and respectful and were on great terms, but we’ve agreed not to talk for a while. 

His best friend messaged me today completely out of the blue. Obviously this strikes me as strange as we never ever talk outside of spending time with my ex (his best friend). 

He asked me how I was, we had some general chit chat about his new move with his gf, work etc. Eventually I said ‘I guess you’ve been talking to ‘X’’ and he said ‘no not lately, why?!’. He then proceeded to tell me he wanted a recipe from me. 

This is way too much of a coincidence to be true right? I gave him the recipe and when he asked how things were going for me again I said things were ok and that maybe he should reach out to his friend. I didn’t want to say that everything was great when it isn’t and I also didn’t want to be the one to tell him in case the request was genuine. 

My question is why reach out if he knew? What purpose does that serve? If his concern was me why not just say he heard and he’s sorry? And if my ex had something to do with it why not reach out himself? We ended on really good terms. I’m confused! 

TL;DR my very recent ex’s best friend reached out to me today claiming to know nothing about the break up and I think my ex had something to do with it. I just don’t know why?",28Jul2019,0

Years ago my best friend's mom \[F40s\] recruited me \[M20s\] to help with some housework. We were both lonely and clearly enjoyed each other's company. She (Kim) was a few months removed from an intensely abusive relationship and had left my friend's (Matt's) dad nearly a decade before. I had only ever had a couple of insignificant flings in HS/CC owing to extreme approach anxiety. We started hanging out a lot. 

Our friendship quickly progressed into a weird sort of pseudo-relationship where we'd hang out all the time, be emotionally intimate, flirt constantly, and acknowledge none of it. It was kinda hilarious. Matt's girlfriend made fun of us constantly, people mistook us for a proper couple in public despite the clear age difference, and we'd just kinda mutually pretend it didn't happen and carry on. Matt expressed mild discomfort a couple times but was otherwise insanely tolerant of our friendship. Maybe he saw me as an upgrade from her abusive ex? That's the only way I could rationalize it.

Kim didn't. I started having feelings, and she started pulling away. She started making offhand comments about my age. We'd still hang out almost constantly, but she became distant and we'd spend a lot of time arguing about random shit. I noticed she started getting protective of her phone and she joked a couple times about me snooping on her, which was weird because I've never done that kind of shit. The rest is pretty predictable - we had a sorta boring falling out and she ended up back with her ex. I avoided her entirely for about six months before I went to visit Matt one day and she came out of her room to give me a hug before going to bed. From then on she basically reverted back to friend's mom status.

*FFWD SEVERAL YEARS TO NOW*

Kim's been single for a couple years now. We started texting as friends again around Christmas. Since mid-June we've been hanging out a lot. Matt's (new) girlfriend is making fun, people are mistaking, and I'm confused as fuck. I don't *think* she wants more, but I might actually be on the spectrum. She at least knows that I used to have feelings for her. She casually brought up that she's open to dating younger guys while talking to myself and a gay friend recently, but I can't tell if she's dropping hints or flexing. I'm at a point where I'm as open to a normal friendship as I am a relationship, but I can't have a repeat of what happened years ago. The thing is, I can hardly form proper relationships with girls my own age. I have no fucking idea how to resolve this ambiguity.",28Jul2019,1

This is a little embarrassing but it's really effing me up. I am educated, so I wouldn't like to be classified as a threat or a subhuman. I am sorry for invading. I am sorry for being who I am.

13,"Recently an old friend of mine for years got in contact with me. Seemingly to apologize for being a bad friend in the past, admitting their wrongs, and offering to try and rectify things. Me being a forgiving person went along with it. They offered to take me on a trip to a music festival. So, I agreed. We went, had a great time even tho I came down with some mysterious sickness for almost the entire trip, and got to spend some time together the way things use to be. We get home I send out all the pictures I took, then suddenly, for no apparent reason, my texts are being ignored, I get blocked on social media, and I'm just left here thinking about how I do not understand what I did wrong.

 Normally if someone ghosts me like this I just move on. Like a, ""fuck it, I was ok before I met you, I'll be ok after your gone."" Type deal. But with this person it's different. I wasnt ok before I met them, they helped me in many different ways, and when we dont get to see each other I miss them dearly. It breaks my heart. I care for this person so much and I thought they cared for me as well. The words and the actions all pointed in that direction.  I've never had anyone try so hard to be my friend. Now this, I dont know why, I'm not sure what I should do or how I should handle this, and I could really use some advice.

17,"This whole situation goes way back but I’m just gonna summarize it best I can. I’m a very gullible person when it comes to relationships and this past relationship was the best I had but it ended in the worst way when I moved and we couldn’t work out long distance. I done everything I could to move on even being a complete fuckboy and fucking other girls to see if it would just distract me but it hasn’t and for some reason im still in love with her but here’s the confusing part. All the past relationships I’ve been in they all have affected me and whenever I think about that person I want to text them or call them and I want them to be with me and idc what we did either and it was mostly dicking them down bc that’s what they wanted and after wards I feel like shit bc then I just feel like I’m there fuck buddy and I know that these ppl I dated don’t miss me about who I am but what I do to please them and it messes with my head bc I’m totally in love with this girl I’ve been with forever we still talk on a daily basis but here’s the weird catch, she’s been doing the same thing as I’ve done and her exes only text her if they want sex. We called for 5 hours last night and we discussed about how we both need to not be afraid to say no to these things when we feel vulnerable and it’s hard for us to change because of how easily we can be tricked by someone and give them what they want over and over again with the same mindset that they miss us even tho they don’t. So for the past couple of days I’ve been thinking if I should really be with this current girl bc I’m afraid we both break our hearts but yet we still love each other like a love movie. It’s gotten to the point where I just want to end my entire existence because I can’t deal with girls or my exes texting me they miss me and that they’re sorry for using me but then 20 minutes later asking me to dick them down and I do it bc they tricked me, it’s sickening bc this current girl I’m talking too has the same problems and yet we still do everything together and try to pretend nothing happened

18,"I’m 28 for and for honesty sake for this post and trying not to sound like a dick, I’m considered quite attractive by a lot of women and men I know which isn’t great for the old ego but that’s not what this is about.

I work in an environment where I meet a lot of new people and these new people keep coming back and friendly relationships develop. Several of these people Flirt a lot with me and asks me for my snap, insta etc and send me messages on these platforms even pictures of their ‘cute’ outfits or fake nudes of random  non ‘sexual body parts as examples.

In person one always comes up to me and chats for awhile about everything and anything. Another time a young lady rested her breasts on my arm while I was carrying an Item and could not easily move. That was past my line and I told her so.

But how do I avoid temptation if it were to progress to that as some of the people are very pretty, when does flirting go too far? I like talking to people and getting to know them but, feelings can get complicated quite easily and I’m looking to avoid that for both parties.

I’m naturally flirty with everyone in a fun way and my partner knows what I’m like so I’m hiding nothing from her, she’s set up to open my phone with her face whichI leave lying around everywhere and she’s free to use it w/e, I tell her 99% of my talkings to other people. I’m just trying to stay honest.

I don’t believe people are never going to be attracted to another person after they found the ‘one’ I just think it’s more the staying with the person despite everything/everyone else is what’s important.

19,"I have worked at my (shitty retail) job for nearly 7 years. I’ve worked almost every position, worked my way up to supervisor, and then have since stepped back into an associate role (due to stress/my mental health). I mainly work doing merchandising at this point. Our last merchandising manager, we’ll call them S, has taken a slightly more elevated role as a brand manager. We’ve since gotten a new merchandising manager, we’ll call them M.

S has worked in the store for about two years now and was very concerned about being “liked” and making friends when they started. I befriended them for a while, but have realized they’re the kind of person that will pretend to be interested in whatever it is you like, so you will like them. I’ve distanced my personal life from S during the past few months. I worked closely with a few of my friends, and S would hate when we worked together, even though we’d still complete our work in a timely manner. My friend has recently moved, S has been making a LOT of comments about how I won’t last now that my friend is gone and S can’t wait for me to leave. 

S has apparently said some stuff about me to M before I worked with M (just this last week), because M asked another associate “why does S hate OP so much??”

S has also done an observation on my performance at work, and told me “I was so excited to do your observation, because I’d be able to write down alll the stuff you don’t do or don’t do correctly”, even though my observation went well (because I know how to do my job, even though I complain about it a lot).

I have never felt so disrespected in the workplace before and I am hearing all these things S has been saying about me to obviously other managers as well as other associates. I’ve never done anything to them that I could imagine making them feel this way about me. I do want to move on from this job, but I still show up, and I still do my job quickly and efficiently even if my attitude isn’t 100%.

Short of calling HR about this behavior, what else can I do? I’ve told my store manager about it, and they’ve apparently had a conversation with S about this, but I have yet to hear anything from anybody about the results of this conversation. I feel that I have been the main target here, but I know S has made several comments that have made other associates uncomfortable as well.",28Jul2019,1
20,"Didn't really know how to title this, but here's the situation:

When I was 11-13ish, my family had a guy living with us on and off while he was in college. By all outward aspects, he seemed like a great guy: involved in his church and missions that sort of thing. I've known him since I was 7 and my family kinda took him under their wings. When he started living with us, he made a game out of trying to kiss me while I was asleep. I obviously woke up horrified with his lips on mine and pushed him off immediately. I slept in a room with three younger siblings and that didn't stop him. It's silly but my 11 year-old self was heartbroken that my first kiss was stolen. My door didn't have a lock on it, so I tried to push a chair under the handle but had to stop doing that when my parents couldn't open the door in the morning to wake us up and I got in trouble for it. I tried telling him to stop doing that, but I was scared and my defense mechanism is humor, so I always said it with a nervous smile, which he took as an invitation to do it more. I also caught him looking at my butt and he would make comments about my body. While we were eating at the dinner table he would try to touch my thighs. Nothing very serious, but it was still an invasion of my privacy and I was always scared he would do worse. I would always complain about him staying with us, but I never told my parents because I didn't know how they would react. 

That I was almost a decade ago and I haven't seen him since then, but I still think about that experience often. The situation could have been a lot worse, he could have r\*ped me or something, but I was still scared living in my own home and felt like I had no control over the situation.  I was also scared for my sister and that he was doing the same thing to her. ANYWAYS **as for the advice I am looking for**: This guy, who I thought I would never see again, is married now with kids and is going to be visiting my family (who I don't live with, but I will still be expected to come see them when they come). I'm scared of seeing him again and I'm also scared for my sister who still lives at home. Should I warn my sister to lock her door when he's there but not say why? Should I just tell my parents so they know the situation? I know my parents would feel terrible about putting me in that situation, so I don't want to do that. At the very least I don't want to visit home when they're there, but my family will think it's weird if I don't come. Am I just overreacting to this whole situation? I tend to downplay the traumatizing things that have happened to me, so I don't know if this is an example of that, or if I need to just get over it. 

TLDR; A family friend used to live with my family when I was 11 and he (25ish) made a game of trying to kiss me in my sleep. He is going to be visiting my family soon and I don't want to be there when he visits but I'm not sure what excuse to make with my family. 

**Sorry that this is such a long post**\--I've never really told this to anyone before and I would love some advice on this situation. If anything doesn't make sense, I will try to clarify in the comments, just let me know. THANK YOU for your advice or for just reading this long post :)",28Jul2019,1

22,"So, the title says it all. My boyfriend still works with a girl whom he’s had a fling with in the past. The last time they slept together was December of 2018. 

My boyfriend and I have a weird story. We dated 4 years ago, and I was in a shitty place. I was coming out of an abusive relationship when I met him. He’s absolutely perfect, and everything I could ever want in a guy. 
Well, I was a dumbass, and young at the time (I’m now 24... still young, but definitely seasoned from the past trauma) and I broke his heart four years ago. I moved out of state to get away from my abusive ex, and lost all contact with my boyfriend. 

Well, a year and a half ago, I reached out to my boyfriend (the one I dated four years ago). We’ve been talking since then, texting, etc. I came to visit him twice in that time. I was so glad to have my second chance. 

In March of this year, I decided to move back to my hometown/the state which my boyfriend resides. We knew we were going to be together once I moved back. 

It’s been 4 months since I moved back, and since we started dating again. He is the love of my life, and I’m so glad I get to have a second chance. 

The only thing that bothers me, is that he works with this girl whom he had a fling with. She was “in love” with him at some point, and the last time they slept together was in December. In my mind, that doesn’t seem like that long ago. She makes it a point to text him and tell him about her life, show him things she’s come across that he might be interested in, etc. 

Now, I’ve worked the service industry before. I know how people are relationship wise. People get very close... but, I know that if I was in this situation, my boyfriend would NOT like it. He’s even stated that. 

How do i cope with the fact that they see each other every day, and he still considers her a friend? 

The jealous girl part of me is like “fuck that bitch” because I don’t trust her intentions, but I’m trying to be civil and just go with it.

She asked if my parents had left the money for me to buy the food with and again I replied no (I was using the money that I had earned from my job I had been working at for the past 2 1/2 years and from busking I did in my free time). 

(Before this gets any further I want to say that neither of my parents neglect me or my siblings and they spend as much time with us as they can, that just ends up being very little). 

At this point, she began to get very confused and asked if I had been doing this for long. 
I had as my parents both work very long hours for reasonable pay. I had been taking care of my two younger siblings after we were home from school (different schools). 

I had grown accustom to this as I was typically in charge around the house any time my parents were working (often) or out with friends or each other taking a break from their work life (not so often) and would provide meals with what was already in the house or with what I had bought. 

I normally had very little time to go out with friends and only recently have I been able to now my brother is becoming old enough that my parents consider him responsible enough for both him and my sister. I haven’t thought much of it and have grown used to it, but now I feel that it has developed an introverted personality in me and that when I do have the responsibility of my siblings off me I spend my time in my room quite isolated.

31,"Hi, I have a major booger problem that I can't seem to find a fix for.

&amp;#x200B;

Every single morning I wake up with a snotty nose, but it's not just hard boogers or wet boogers, it's like a mixture of wet and hard(80% wet 20% hard maybe).

&amp;#x200B;

Every single morning my nose feels blocked as hell, and I have to go to the bathroom and grab a tissue, fold it into a small piece and stick it up my nose, with the booger ""grabbing"" onto it and pulling it out like this, and sometimes it can take a while depending on how far in it is. Although a problem I have when I do this a lot is that I end up sneezing(probably because I'm pushing up against something sensitive inside my nose) and my nose starts running. So I have two options - either feel like my nose is really blocked all day or stick a tissue up there and hope I don't start sneezing when I pull it out.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried blowing snot rockets but it's no use, all that comes out when I try to do that are little bits of liquid, not the actual booger itself and it would be way easier if it was just a hard booger or something I could pick out easily with my finger. I don't know why this occurs every single morning, it seems to only happen in my own house. When I stay elsewhere it's not nearly as bad I've noticed. I have two known allergies(cat hair and house dustmites) but I don't own a cat for that reason(although the neighbor has one) and my room isn't that dusty so I have no idea what it could be.

&amp;#x200B;

My room is situated right in front of a trashy and loud street and there definitely is some dust in my room(resting upon cabinets and so forth) but probably just as much as in anyone else's.

Lived in this room for around a year now. Any suggestions to help in dealing with this booger problem will be appreciated.",28Jul2019,1
32,"As I type this, I feel sick to my stomach. I feel a tremendous amount of guilt even asking for advice.

I am a 29F, and I am American. I married the love of my life 2 years ago. He is Algerian. When I converted, I had converted on my own free will and my own terms. He did not ask me nor did he expect me to convert to Islam. His family is also very loving and accepting.

I started to cover my hair about a year and a half ago. I did this to try it out, and when I saw how happy it made my husband, I chose to start to wear it. See, being interracial and intercultural, we have worked hard to combine our beliefs, customs, and so on to create our own blend. I do not want him to lose his culture, and he does not want me to lose mine (I'm American but from Polish and Irish heritage). So far the only thing I am very sad about is not being able to have a Christmas tree. But now I am realizing more and more that I may not want to wear my hijab.

I am afraid to take it off for many reasons. First, I know that it is 100% my choice. But there is a stigma. There is a stigma about what Islam is, and by taking it off I fear that it will be an un-stated belief that I am against them. I am not. I just think it is up to the woman to decide if she wants to wear it - not anyone else. I am afraid of how my family will react. My mother is a bit Islamophobic and has a habit of gossiping and bending the truth. She's caused tension within the family because of my husband, but despite this she has worked hard to accept him and has admitted that she adores him.

My biggest fear is my husband. I did this for him. I put on hijab for him. To my husband, not just for his belief but in his culture, when a woman chooses to wear hijab it is seen as honoring herself and her husband. My husband feels so secure because I wear hijab. It brings him comfort, happiness and pride. I have been happy to wear it for him.

Now, my emotions have surprised me and have bubbled up. I think maybe I moved too quickly to cover. I miss feeling the breeze in my hair, and I've even been brought to tears over it. It's something so simple - feeling the heat of the sun on my strands, feeling the breeze flow through my hair and on my neck, even the annoying strands that blow in my face - I miss them. I am so afraid to tell my husband because he's told me how proud he is of me when he introduces me to his family and his friends.

I don't know what to do or go about it. I've already had an initial conversation with him. In Islam, if you choose to cover, you are doing it to honor God. It is a cultural issue (that I disagree with) to mandate a woman to veil herself without her consent. I admitted to my husband that I believe in God, but that I do not necessarily believe in veiling myself. I admitted to him that I cover only for him. I do not think he understood how deeply I felt about it - or that I was telling him I wanted to take it off. He was very supportive of me, and he told me that he appreciated that I was willing to wear a hijab because it means so much to him. When he said that, I couldn't move forward anymore with telling him I wanted to take it off. I felt so guilty.",28Jul2019,0
33,"I moved to a new city knowing nobody last month - I haven't really been happy, and I havent really been living. Ive been living on ""auto pilot"" where I just go through the motions. I just dont have motivation. I dont have motivation to check out a park/local destination etc near me, because Im sure it'd be lovely and I'm sure I'd get bored after a bit. This isn't depression, or atleast not where I have been, because I've been depressed and I couldnt even function. Skipping finals, not showering, no hygeine. I'm functioning, performing at my job. I'm just not happy. 

I'm single and not actively looking for a relationship, I have no hobbies, and no friends from moving here. I see the weekends and think ""oh great, how am I going to spend 2 days on the internet to kill time watching/listening/doing things I barely enjoy"". My sisters the opposite. Constant day vacations with her boyfriend, constantly out and about. I am the exact opposite. I am the most vanilla, boring person. The question though that I dont know is - would she do this if she was alone? If I knew someone here and I hit it off, theres no way in hell I'd say ""yeah I prefer to be inside alone and more or less isolated"" - the only way is if I was just tired from socializing and going out.

In a way, I see the move to the new city as a way to reinvent myself as I have a clean slate here. I know nobody, no ties, no responsibilities besides work. Flipping that view to be more pessimistic and/or realistic, I have nothing going for me besides my new job, which I am very satisfied with. Which is pretty fucking depressing.

I want to be better. I want to enjoy life. I haven't found my calling, and I dont know how to do that. I wont find my calling online, thats for sure.",28Jul2019,1

36,"This story is a bit more complicated. About a year ago my co worker / friend ( we will call her Sandra) was not promoted but was put in management training for one of the 8 stores my boss’s run. No position was open at the time and when one became available and didn’t get it she felt very defeated. She decided as an eff you to my boss’s that she would refuse any Rutgers management training. 

However when all this was happening and she was starting to get agitated about it before finishing her training (at the time I was in college and thought the managers job was not worth it) I sided with her. I expressed how they did her wrong and how she should have gotten that job. We complained together and I told her the job wasn’t even all that anyways. At the time I truly believed it. During this time I was pissed at the company for health insurance reasons so my anger that her and I along with many others shared was reasonable. 

Well this week she went on vacation and the day after she left my boss called me to offer me a management position at another store of there’s. I have since dropped my college courses and decide I would love to manage one of the stores. Anyhow everyone knows I got promoted except her because she’s been gone. She comes back tomorrow and I feel like it’s going to come across really bad. I truly care for her and I don’t think my words swayed her choice earlier in the year. But I know she will be mad. How do I tell her ? Do I just not say anything till I absolutely have to ?",28Jul2019,1

Well the show went well got good reviews and well of course there was a cast party at a lake house a couple hours outside of town and we started flirting (we were both a little tipsy of course wed just done a show) and we ended up having sex we hung out a few times since through a mutual friend but i had ap tests and finals and have spent the whole summer in utah for a ballet intensive 

I just got back and she just texted me telling me she was throwing a party at her place i said sure and now im wondering if she has a ulterior motive

38,"I’ve known this girl for a while and we talk often. I went to her house after sneaking out a couple of times and we talked there. One night my friend and I both snuck out and got really high. We went to girls house and chilled in her porch area on couches. He met his girlfriend there. Neither of these girls have ever smoked and didn’t want to (were pretty young). So it was just him and I hitting his pen. I was obliterated and I don’t remember much that happened but at one point my friend and his girlfriend are cuddling and the girl I like are sitting next to each other. Then she says she’s cold and I’m high so immediately without thinking I put my arm around her. We started cuddling and then we were just watching videos on my phone bc I was too high to talk. We were both laughing way to hard and she was acting high for whatever reason. My friend and I left at about 4 AM. When I got home my mom was awake and not happy as you can imagine. This was last Thursday (9 days ago). I got grounded for an unspecified amount of time. I went to work the following Monday and happened to run into her as she was walking her dog so we talked for about 15 minutes about what happened (how I got in trouble all that) we hugged and I walked to work. We kept talking on Snapchat throughout the week and last Wednesday we went to a local park and just talked. We went to the same school (she still goes there I don’t anymore) but she’s 2 years younger then me so we were talking about funny stuff that has happened and stuff that’s changed. Another hug at the end and I walked home. We made plans for Tuesday to go back to the same park but I want to change that to an actual date. How would I tell her this?

It might sound really overdramatized, but I have this huge insecurity with my group of friends I go to school with. My whole life I’ve never been the “pretty” girl or the girl that guys openly talk about. Although I’ve always secretly wanted it for some self validation, it’s never happened. I think because of this I just overhauled my personality to apeal to guys by being more of a guy type friend who they can talk about which girls they think is hot and who they wanna fuck.    Mind you, all my friends are super beautiful blondes, when compared to me who is like average kinda chubby. I’m just really tired of hearing guys tell me “It’s ok, she’s like a guy, she won’t care”.  It’s become one of the biggest insecurities I have at the moment and it makes me feel way more unattractive that I already do. I’ve convinced myself that my unappealing personality is the reason guys won’t come near me romantically. I know it’s bad to change who you are but I’m super in my head on how people compare me to my girl friends or how they view me individually. I really need advice on confidence and what to do :( sorry if there’s a lot of grammatical errors, I wrote this really fast on my train commute.",28Jul2019,8
48,"I have been with my SO for 8 years. We had some issues at the end of the year and I reached out to another man, we texted for a month and only that month but I flirted at the very end. My SO basically feels I slept with this man. I never sent pics or anything like that either. Recently he said that has been bothering him and he can’t forget it. I’ve offered to go to therapy and talk it out. He doesn’t want to. Right now he says he completely done. He said it’s easier to find someone who hasn’t hurt him the way u have. I understand that, I do and I have taken complete blame and I just listen to every word he says.
He said he doesn’t know what the future holds for us so he won’t say that we won’t get back together. I made a huge mistake and now not only am I hurting, so our kids. I was very selfish. In our 8 years, that has been the only tiem I’ve ever stepped out on our relationship. 

Is it crazy that I don’t plan on moving on? I know in my heart he’s the one i want. I don’t want another relationship with anyone else. I don’t want to reach out again to another male friend, either.

51,"Some background: So far in high school ive had 1 girlfriend for 2 months and attempted 2 times unsuccessfully with other girls. Im a 17 year old boy going into senior year.

Ive recently noticed that for most of my high school expereince ive been accepted by girls but not to a point of friendship or a relationship. Most seem to enjoy my presence when I talk to them in class and sometimes outside it but I cant seem to bring it to another level. I want to become friends with some girls without developing a relationship but occasionally there are a couple that i would like to take out. I cant seem to achieve either of these. Ive been relatively shy all my life, resulting in me having only a few girls phone numbers, mostly from projects. 

How do I suddenly go from talking to them only in class to talking to them as friends and hanging out with them without making it creepy or intrusive? Whenever I manage to build up the courage to go into a bit deeper conversation I feel like they get bored of me or I annoy them. I dont want to suddenly do a 180 and ask them if they want to hang out without me having built a meaningful relationship but im lost on how to do it otherwise.

Any advice would be appreciated! If your a girl at this age, please give your perspective on things as well!!

54,"I have called my company three times to solve a billing issue that has been ongoing since March of this year, and all three times, they have told me things were fine. 

So, basically, I tried to set up autopay in the app. I had confirmed it was going to pay, and I tried to relax. It didn't show autopay was set up, so I tried to pay the bill. It gave me an error and wouldn't let me pay the amount due because I'd be overpaying? But then, when it was actually due, it didn't fucking pay and the bill was a day late. I asked why autopay didn't work, and they were like ""?????"" (sigh... It's your app, how do you not know how it works?). So, the guy on the phone sets it up for me and guarantees three times that this wouldn't affect my score. 

It did. 

So, I call back a few weeks later, when I realize my score has dropped a good 25+ points and said I was late. I got the same guy, who again said it wouldn't affect my score. Except, I was literally fucking looking at my score that had been affected by it. It said it was affected by it. And the guy was again just like ""it's fine."" No, it's not. It is most certainly not. So, I again ask them to confirm that autopay is on, and I check my app (which crashes if I try to set it up myself, for some reason... hence the having to call them in the first place). They say it's all set up to pay the full amount that's due every month, automatically, on the first of the month. 

Nope. Paid only the minimum amount. 

The third time, after realizing that autopay was just not going to work, I watched meticulously to ensure I paid my bill on time (because they can't do it on their end, obvs), it wouldn't let me pay through the app. It gave me an error report saying I couldn't pay. I had over $1000 in my checking account associated with my card, so there is absolutely no reason it should not have paid. So, I had to pay through the phone. 

Now, all these calls must be on some kind of record, right? There is some way to prove that I have been making these attempts? Three times, it's been bungled to fuck because of stupid shit like them just not letting me pay my goddamn bill. I'm trying to give y'all MONEY, what the fuck???

My score, as a result of this fuckery, has gone down 100 points. And I don't know what to do. I am trying to move out and eventually buy some property, but my score is actually lower now than when I got the card, despite me making every attempt to get my bills in on time. 

The way my app is, it's like it's got autopay switched on, since it won't let me double-pay. But also, when the bill comes due, it doesn't actually autopay. Even though it says it's on (sometimes--sometimes it doesn't). The only way I know it gets paid is on the phone, but the whole point of having an online bank is the ease of fucking use. And it's not *easy* if I get lost in the endless robot cycle or if I'm on the phone forever.  

I don't know what kind of dumbassery is happening here, but I can't keep murdering my score like this because I can't trust the card company/app not to fuck everything to shit. How do I pay my bills on time if they legit won't let me??? I'm a full-time college student with a job and a volunteer position. I do not know where I'm going to find the time to sit on the phone for an hour and a half every other week just to make sure my payments go through correctly. 

My mom said ""write to the credit bureaus"" but I really doubt they'd actually care about this situation. I just honestly don't know what to do. I'm trying really hard to get my score up by next Spring, since I'm going to be moving. If I don't have a solid score, though, I can't rent. And I'm not sure how to leave this bank, since my score is bad enough that I think I'd struggle to be approved anywhere else. I feel really stuck.",28Jul2019,1

69,"I'm sorry if this is rushed or has been asked before but I'm panicking over this and I need help 

A boy I've known for about a year now texted me earlier and said he loved me. I'd known for a while now - he made it really obvious. I politely rejected him, as I wasn't interested (I also knew this boy had done some questionable things in the past and wasn't the nicest person), he then starts to tell me that he's thinking about me.
At this point I really don't know what to say, I just wish he'd leave me alone. 
Then he starts going on about his past and how his friends abandoned him and he became a 'lone wolf' and I really wish I didn't have to deal with this edgy boy, but I try to comfort him nonetheless.
Then he asks me again, and apologise and say I'm not interested. This seems to anger him, because apparently he didn't know I wasn't interested, he thought I just wasn't ready yet (even though I made it clear that I didn't want to date him).

He calls me a stupid bitch, and tells me that I make him feel worthless (I can confidently say I have never insulted this boy at all) and he tells me he's going to kill himself before the end of the summer. I'm worried because throughout the entire conversation he had been dropping hints that he was going to hurt himself or other people, I'd been trying to comfort him. I really hope that he's just being edgy and dark because I rejected him, but I'm still worried. I hate him because of how much of an ass he's being but I can't just leave him like that.

70,"Hey everyone!

I signed a group lease with 5 other girls in May. In June, I found out I was pregnant and now I'm needing to get out of the lease as I need my own place for when I have a newborn. I've been touring tons of people to take over my room and my share in the lease, but with each new person my roommates have a rule that they need to meet up with them before they sign. They've met up with a couple girls and didn't feel they were a fit. Now, I have a girl that is dying to take over my room and is ready to move in ASAP. I really, really need the money and am basically paying for an empty room at this point since I've already moved out. The girls are saying they don't want her to sign until they've met her, but at this point I'm getting fed up. I can't keep waiting until they meet someone to their liking.

I can't keep paying for this empty room and eventually feel like just backing out of the lease, forcing them to pay my share of the house as I cannot afford to keep waiting for them to find someone to their standards that can fill my spot. This would then force them to find someone to take over my room instead of forcing me to continue to pay and wait for them to find someone they like? Would this be a complete douche move on my part? Backing out and forcing them to pay?

71,"Okay so there is this guy that I really like, and I recently developed this crush on him. (Let's call him Joe) It is unclear if he likes me but my friends tell me that he does. I was talking to him on snap and then I remembered that my friend (Jill) had told me that she liked him a few months ago. So, I texted Jill and asked her if she liked him. She told me that she still liked him, and I told her that I liked him but that she doesn't have to worry because she liked him first. Then Jill continued to tell me that Joe was flirting with her and that they were going to kiss and go on a date. So now I'm still texting with him because he is a good friend but Joe is starting to do some of the things that he said to Jill to me and now I think he may actually like me. So I need to know if I should keep talking to him but make sure it stays as friends or just stop talking to him so that nothing happens.",28Jul2019,2
73,"I'm am currently dating an amazing guy, and we both agree that him and I have a future together. The issue is that for the past few weeks he's been gaming with his friends and we havent really talked. I'm okay with the fact that hes gaming and hanging out with friends, I've just been having a really bad last few weeks and everytime I try to talk to him about how I feel he gets kinda irritated because I do it to much. The thing is, I don't talk to ANYBODY else about how I feel - I think that it makes me seem like I want attention or something - so I only talk with him about that stuff. I try not to do it a lot, but I usually type a lot to him. Not on purpose, I just type a lot naturally. I will do just about anything for him, and have already done a lot so it kinda hurts that he struggles to read my long messages. I know that long messages are annoying but...I really have done a lot for him and...I don't know.

Sometimes it just feels like I'm the only one putting effort into the relationship bc of how easily I get attached to things. I had a very bad childhood that has left me with some mental scars and I've spent so many years covering up so that nobody else could see them. To most people I'm just ""the funny one"". However, I've told him everything and...it's just really hard to tell if he cares sometimes. I don't know if it's because we haven't been talking lately so he can't really reassure me but...yeah. So I'm turning to the random people reddit in search of some sort of advice. I'll probably delete this post after a lil because I don't normally talk about this kinda stuff and I don't want it to become a regular for me.",28Jul2019,2

75,"I have a HP notebook 15.6 with i5, a 1TB SSD and 8 gb ram, 64 bit. There is an issue with the screen that needs repaired, but I am not sure how much it will run. It may just need a replacement screen or maybe something more advanced. It also have been having some battery issues, so I may have to replace the external battery soon. 

I paid $459 for this laptop almost 3 years ago. It have been used almost daily mostly watching videos and doing school work. 

So now I do not know if I should replace this laptop or just repair it? It is going to dip into my savings to buy a new laptop of a similar quality. A few things I would want in my new laptop are a SSD, HD or better screen, and 15.6 screen or larger. Some things that do not matter as much are battery life and weight. 

I need a decent machine that will be able to effortlessly handle HD streaming, online classes, and light game play (The sims 4).

A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

88,"Hello everyone,
Recently me and my friends graduated from high school and when we've been hanging out over the break, we got into this discussion about our futures. I've asked myself this question many times before but it really is a deep topic. I will be attending a 4-year university this fall received a grant(not enough to cover tuition, about 1/2), and plan on either:
A: do AROTC for the scholarship and commit 6 years after I finish my studies. I was thinking about 
B: Work to pay tuition costs as much as possible and loan the difference(parents are not planning on paying for my college fees)
C: Be a bit more flexible with college, maybe get into being an entrepeneur because I've always wanted to own a successful business within the stem field

Of course, although it seems very shallow of me, would like to make a large sum of money in the future and have always dreamt of starting and growing a multimillionaire business before I hit 30. Yet the meaning of life comes into question. I have come from a poor-middle class background. Parents make about 70-90k a year, enough for a decent living in orange county,CA. However seeing my parents drowned by financial pressures really gave me the desire to make alot of money in thr future. I think I'm just confused on what it really means to be happy because everyone tells me money does not bring happiness which I agree with to an extent but at some times I believe otherwise. 

If you read the entire text I really thank you for your patience. I know this entire thing is just typical teenager dilemma and I've talked about unnecessary things, but my family has been putting alot of indirect pressure on me(they say they just want me to be happy, but I know they want me to make a lot of money for them).

91,"I (21F) live with my parents and my (13M) brother. They’ve always been a bit messy and my mom especially has always been a hoarder. As the years go by it only seems to get worse. My dad will often leave mugs of half drank coffee on the table and they will sit there until they are moldy. My mom would constantly have receipts everywhere and keeps bringing in her newest thrift finds. Dishes hardly get done. They get left on the dining room table with food scraps still on them. Garbage never makes it to the garbage. This past year the fridge got so full it became unusable and was making the whole house smell. Even though my mom kept saying she was going to clean it out I got to a point where I had to accept the only way to get it done was to do it myself. My boyfriend and I ended up throwing all of it away. We took out 5 contractor bags that day. The worst of it is the certainly kitchen. It has an odor that I can’t find the source of. Dirty dishes are everywhere. I try to clean but I find myself scrubbing dishes for hours at a time only to have them get used and put back on the table to collect mold before I’m back home from work the next day.
 Now that it’s summertime, I’m finding maggots. I’ve found them in years past here and there. This year it seems like whenever I look, I find them. I spilled a mug with maggots in it on myself. Just today I picked up a dish towel and there were maggots and fly eggs underneath. 
I plan on moving out soon, and once I’m gone I know nothing will ever get cleaned. I’ve cried, I’ve offered to help I’ve begged, I’ve threatened to call CPS, I’ve asked “why do we live like this” and I try so very hard to clean. How can I keep up? Is there anyway I can get through to them? Please give any and all advice. I can’t do this anymore. It’s making me severely depressed.

95,"Hi guys,

I'm a young teen and I recently got an interview for McDonalds, which made me really excited because I've been trying to get a job for ages. So last week I booked my interview time online and I thought I booked it for today, but yesterday as I was preparing for the interview, I found that I actually booked it for next week. I was annoyed because I was really looking forward to the interview so yesterday I called the manager of the store, introduced myself politely and politely asked him whether there were any interview slots available for today and he kindly explained that he couldn't change the time. I thanked him, said bye and hung up.

So now I'm not sure if by calling him, I ruined my chances of getting the job. I also cancelled and rebooked the interview online because I wanted to see if today was still available.

This kind of stems from my impatience and inability to wait. So now I have to problems. Not only do I have to wait another week, I also may have reduced my chances of getting the job.

Should I worry about not getting the job because I called? How should I wait out for next week, I really wanted to do it today. 

P.S. Does anyone have any tips on how to pass the interview?

Thanks!",28Jul2019,1

She claims they dont live together but, he does see him every day because of the child.     I just found this out, after a month of texting each other for hours upon hours.  She tells me she loves me and wants to move to Texas with me.  She shares so much with me.   But, something inside of me just feels wrong about this.   Somethings not right.

I said I could send it through Western Union so you can just go pick it up at the grocery store.    The next thing she tells me really just kicked me in the nutz.

100,"This is likely to be a very long post as I have to back up several years to explain the whole situation. I’ve never typed out these thoughts before, so I’ll try my best to explain as best as I can. 

I [19M] am currently in a relationship and have been for around 3 years. my girlfriend [20F] and i are in a distance relationship for much of the time. it’s never been a huge problem, we’ve always made it work by visiting each other when possible and solid communication. therefore, i feel awful about some of the thoughts and feelings i’ve been having lately. i want to be honest, but i don’t know how to share some of these things. for some time, i’ve felt that our relationship has been lacking something. i feel uncomfortable talking about future plans and believe that there are some differences between how we think about certain topics. as much as i dislike admitting it, i find myself lacking the desire to try as much as i used to. which, i know, is not a good sign. i have so much respect for her and i feel wrong thinking this way, but i also feel like i shouldn’t continue keeping it to myself. 

now, information on my ex. before i was with my current girlfriend, my ex and I dated for around three years. we were what you would consider the “token middle/high school awkward and highly affectionate couple that the whole school knows.” i feel like everywhere has one. we were completely engulfed in one another. we both had ongoing family problems/traumas that we used each other to cope with. we were young and often expressed our feelings in sappy/juvenile ways, but that doesn’t change the result. ultimately, we were there for each other when it was critical for both of us. it came to an end when she moved schools and experienced a wave of new people and a run in with drugs/alcohol that caused us to fall apart. when we ended things, neither of us viewed it as a particularly definite type of thing. it felt kind of like a “well, this is where the relationship is going now, i guess,” type of thing to both of us. regardless, we both began to move on after some time and lost contact with each other. a year later, i met my current girlfriend and we became involved. at this point, i truly believed that i had moved on. 

around a year ago, my ex [20F] contacted me and wanted to meet. i obliged and we met for a coffee. my girlfriend was 100% knowing that i went to meet with her and was okay with it, so all parties involved were accepting. when i met with her, it was.. not bad at all. we both felt surprisingly comfortable after around 20 minutes of awkwardness and things picked up in a really nice way. we ended up spending four hours talking and catching up, purely as friends. it was nice to reminisce and follow up on old references and memories. we cleared the air about what happened with our breakup and we were both enjoying each others company. near the end, something slipped out of my mouth that i didn’t even know i had been thinking. i asked her, “do you think we would’ve stayed together had we not moved schools?” the words just seemed to pour out naturally and i didn’t know they were even in me. she responded with a yes and that was that. we said goodbye to each other and left on good terms. 

from that exchange, a few weeks passed by. we had a bit of contact in that time, all non-offensive stuff like responding to each other’s stories on social media and whatnot. then, she asked if we could meet again. since everything worked out well last time, i was good with it. she asked to meet on a particular bench in a certain park we used to always sit at in our time together. once i was there, she confessed to still have feelings for me. she said that she knew i was in a relationship and didn’t expect me to do anything, which i really appreciated. she just needed to get it off her chest. we talked for a while and it ended in me thanking her for telling me and i understood but i would have to cut off communication since i’m in a relationship and i did not feel the same. we hugged and i left. we haven’t seen each other since. 

this event has not left my mind since it happened. to varying degrees it is always there. i feel that i’ve gone through so many stages about what i think about it. from thinking it was a poor decision to go to really appreciating it. for so long i’ve denied that maybe somewhere inside of me i feel the same way. for the past few months at night as i go to sleep i think of what would’ve happened if i went back and said i felt the same. and the part that hurts me the most is i know how unfair it is of me to think that. i’m in a relationship, a really good one that i should be so thankful for, but the thoughts won’t leave my head. it makes me wonder if they’re even what i really feel or if they’re just toxically floating up there. it’s not fair to anyone. at this point, i know i can’t come back into my ex’s life after denying her and waiting so long. she’s probably moved on truly at this point anyway. and it’s not fair to my girlfriend because she doesn’t know these things but i don’t know *how* to even begin to tell her, or if i really truly feel them myself. i don’t even know if i’m the same person i was a year ago. so many things feel like they’re running at once and i feel like i need input from someone. i’m planning to talk to a friend about this as well but am also afraid of being looked down upon for not being more upfront to everyone in the first place. 

if anyone has any sort of guidance, i would truly appreciate it. 

TL;DR - i’ve been having feelings for my ex for around a year while i’m in a relationship with someone else and don’t know what steps i should take to be fair to everyone involved",28Jul2019,2

102,"   I've re-written this post nine times trying to figure out how to ask for help but I keep screwing it up. I think the best thing would be to focus on the most important thing right now, my job. I'm trying to work as a bartender and just started at a place an hour from my home. The first night was... Interesting. I was called a 'stupid motherfucker' four times for not knowing how to do something I had never done before and the woman training me doesn't know how to train. I don't know if I should continue work there or not. I only have enough money as well to make it there and back twice before I lose any way of getting there since it's so far away. I don't have a pay schedule or even a work schedule and I don't get any tips until after my first month working there. There's a bar down the road from my house I can walk to that I can ask about employment, and the home depot about a mile away wants to hire me as well, but I don't know if I should continue trying with the first place. I'm desperate for the money and desperate for something in my life to work out for once. 
   For the place I'm working at currently the management is nice and the staff are great but... The bartending staff think I'm stupid and I can't deal with that right now. I was told immediately after starting that I didn't know anything and that whatever they had taught me in the classes I took was wrong. For example, I started to tell my trainer how I thought a Manhattan was made and was cut off at the phrase ""1/2 ounce of dry-"" Immediately she told me that you don't go by recipes and you just go by your gut. Which I understand, but you still have to know what ingredients go into the damned drink. I spent my first night mixing every single drink except for the two Mai Tais in the beginning while she talked the night away (5 hours) with two customers. Any time I had to go to her for help she would get very angry and passive aggressive, throwing insults at me. At the end of the night she was handed a wad of cash, tips, for the bartending staff, which she then shoved into her bra and told me only the best bartender gets the tips. I don't have a set schedule and have to constantly hunt down a manager (who si never around) to find out when I'm allowed to come in next. 
   I want to learn and I want to get better, but I literally can't afford to work there if I don't even know when I'm going to get paid or work. If this doesn't work out I don't know what I'm going to do...what do I do? I have so much going on right now and I just keep paying because I don't have a choice. But I'm about to lose my home, my grandfather is dying, my mental health is at an all time low and I literally can't afford therapy or the depression meds; my mom hates my guts my dad is a drunk so there's no support from them, and the rest of my family hates me. I can't smile anymore and I'm really worried this is the straw that's going to break the camel's back.

104,"Context: Portland, Oregon \[USA\]. Our child is due Jan 2020. I was verified with at least 99% certainty to be the biological father by means of non-invasive prenatal paternity test between the mother (blood sample) and myself (saliva sample). Unfortunately, to gain paternity rights I will still need to seek out a positive paternity test once the child is born.

Here's why I have my potential concerns about misuse of child support. She was committed to a mental health institution and, as a minor, ran away from home. Now, she is seemingly housing stable but in an ongoing abusive relationship with a violent gang member/coke dealer. FWIW: she expressed a strong desire to not work as a mother, so I believe she is likely to quit work as soon as possible. Am I right to be concerned? Full custody is extremely unlikely even given the circumstances could be proved in court, this due to such a case ruling in Oregon both being unprecedented and courts almost always siding with at least joint custody for the mother.

Should I be rightly concerned and assuming the child will be born (miscarriage always possible as well as legal abortion up to birth)... if nothing is in my control to eliminate concern about misuse of child support, then I wtf should I do? What can I do?

I still love her so much but i guess something messed me up inside. I started thinking that if she really loved me she would be with me, and she wouldn't be with anyone else or love anyone else. So of course i started being an r/niceguys to her telling her all i've been thinking. I even almost sabotaged her relationship with her current boyfriend by anonymously messaging him on Instagram.

Eventually I found a guy I wanna go out w and I asked her if she could tell my family I’m hanging with her (dysfunctional fam) she asked me why then ignored me and posted a sub about me on fb. 

I scrolled through her page to see if she made anymore subliminal posts and not only did she,

112,"Sorry for the weirdness of this 

I'm a 19M college student, and i feel like i'm really lost. i'm bi, at least to the point that i find people attractive and get romantically interested. Problem is that I have multiple mental illnesses, adhd anxiety and depression, and whenever i'd try having sex i'd feel nothing and not get hard at all. I know it's common to have trouble, especially w anxiety and SSRIs, but this is a recurring thing and the bad experiences really weigh on me. I'm working on the illnesses and I wanna check with doctors if it's low testosterone or something hormonal like that. i know i also have massive baggage, and it looks like i'm genuinely scared of my masculinity (i associate men with the bad experiences i've had over the years). the situation i grew up with made me really hate myself and my anger, so in trying to change myself over the years, i think i repressed those parts of me? i really don't know it's just an idea. Also i masturbate and get morning wood, so it's not vascular. i'm gonna also stop masturbating just in case it is that too. 

i've wanted a relationship for a long time, and i know i at least get sexual urges. but with the adhd and way too much weed one night, last october, i ended up bothering this girl i was visiting and nagging her over and over again to have sex with me, and i think it was because i felt that spark for once and i was scared it would go away. insanely awful of me, but it also traumatized me a little too and i'm recovering from that incident. i've only gotten hard making out once, and i was also stoned there. i swipe on dating apps for hours everyday hoping someone will want to have the patience to work with me, but i know that's kinda useless as well. 

i know i shouldn't be, but i'm scared of being asexual. i think about it and find myself on the defensive and i think it's cuz i'm scared ill always be alone. that's silly but i really don't know also. everything this year has been one puzzle after another in my mind and i'm so exhausted of it. if you have ideas please let me know thanks for your patience

I have next to no confidence and barely talk to women, even though I can objectively say im attractive. People in my family have said i should be getting tons of girlfriends. after ahwile, theyd give me off the cuff pep talks about how its okay to be who I am and theyd love me no matter what. there was this game i was playing with my family and there was sharades involved, i didnt want to do it. so my dad says "" Its okay, its not gay!"" and i dont react in an exactly secure way.

118,"Does anyone have experience with trusting people after situations like this? I'm terrifically lonely and there's all these pretty people around. Itry not to look, I don't want to look, I don't believe anybody anymore. I know I'll have to trust someone or die aching hollow. I just don't know how to do that. Did anyone else try making yourself really pretty and talented? That's all I can think of to try to prevent this, like I keep thinking if I was really pretty/smart/interesting/valuable/not garbage no one would do this to me, if anyone else thought that did making yourself better actually make them like you more or did they hate you for trying? Unhealthy thoughts whatever but I mean, there has to be a reason right? Like I should be able to prevent this kind of sadism?

Specifically, does anyone have experience with trusting people again after a large group of people stalked and followed them? People who knew details about you they shouldn't have and who tried to use those details to get to you, the way a Mean Boy or a Mean Girl might steal a diary from someone, make fun of everything in it and then try to use the contents to get into your pants and perhaps (or maybe not) humiliate you even farther? Except maybe instead of a diary it's following you from work/gym/family/home and they know what you do even inside your apartment? People who seem to be playing a game with rules only they know, without letting me know I was playing anything at all, without even really introducing themselves? I don't wear my glasses and aren't always good at remembering or placing names and voices anyway. They could be anyone or everyone. It feels like everyone. I know that's not true, it just feel like the risk is so huge.., I don't know what they want other than my suffering and they've already achieved that. I've already lost my job and any semblance of community respect over this. It's still not over. I still don't know what I did to deserve this or if it really just is that they realized my softness and are only doing this because they can get away with it, for the thrill of it, for the taboo-breaking being bad of it, for the cruelty of it. It could be anything. They've never told me why. Even when I leave I won't know who, or why or even how many. Without exaggeration it has the potential to be a never-ending torment. How do I know if anyone's ok?

I know it's a risk trusting anyone to begin with and it's my choice to either take the risk or live like a stone and let moss grow under me.  I know i need to leave my situation first but I'm more frightened of never getting close to anyone than anything else. I can't trust my own instincts right now though. Someone I liked, someone I thought was cool, was nice and got me into bands I didn't know before wound up being one of them.  I've never felt this isolated, crazy and unattractive.

He broke his arm and as soon as I found out I felt so nauseous and at one point I even vomited in my mouth. I was extremely worried and he said that he was in pain and I was just so concerned even though he was completely fine and he told me that he was fine.

123,"Sorry this is gonna be long. Sorry for spelling/grammar errors. TL;DR at the end

Ok so I'm an upcoming HS senior in the next few days and I am so confused on what college course I should take. A little background: My mom is a nurse, and growing up, she would bring me to the hospital because I never had a nanny (it was ok in my country idk if it is here), and she was like one of the head nurses in the Operating Room there so I would usually stay in a sort of waiting area outside the actual room where they do the operations and sometimes I get to see different types of surgeries from outside the glass (I would be in a very small scrub suit) so at that point until recently, I've always wanted to be a surgeon.

Fast forward I got to explore the outside world, I found out that I really enjoy listening to people and helping them with their problems and getting them through their emotional boundaries and stuff like that, so I expressed to my mom that I want to be a psychiatrist, psychologist, or some kind of counselor or somebody that studies the mind and how it works. Anything in that field more or less. At first, she didn't really like that idea (we're Asian. It's common practice for parents to kind of dictate what their kids do because they say it's ""payback"" for all the things they gave to us as we were growing up), but then as I kept talking about it and not budging, saying I really want to take anything psych related, she just started saying ok (not really supportive, just ok) and that for me was already okay.

Now, we talked and she asked me ""why don't you just become a nurse?"" And in our community here, we're all a bunch of families that have either a mom or a dad a nurse. And one of my closest friends took up nursing. She's gonna be in her 2nd year of nursing this opening school year. She wanted to be an architect. But she went for nursing and said she might go for architecture after. So now, I kinda do consider taking up nursing too, and maybe get assigned in the Operating Room, at a mental hospital, or proceed with surgery; or take a psych course.

Now, not to brag, but I have no problem academically. I had anatomy classes and psych-socio classes and I realize that I'm okay with studying and reading a lot. I just don't know now which one I want more.

124,"(Second time posting because nobody saw this)

This is a throwaway account because I don't want anyone I know in real life to know about my private issues. I'm a 17 year old guy, and I have a younger sister (14) and my mom and dad are divorced. Let's start all the way back in 2000, before I was born. My parents were already having problems in their marriage, which was barely a year old, and they decided to have a baby (me). As soon as they found out mom was pregnant, they started fighting even more. Fast forward to 2001, and I was born. We're all muslims, meaning that by my birth, I took away the rights of my father's siblings and family to his inheritance, and them being VERY materialistic, I was despised by them the moment I was thrown into this life. My dad sided with his parents, and turned on my mom. More fighting ensued. Around 2003, my mom had enough of my dad's family, and cut ties with them, and then my parents decided to have ANOTHER BABY. I don't know about you, but if my marriage was falling apart, I wouldn't be having more babies. Anyway, so in 2004 my sister is born, things remain as they were for a while, with more and more fighting. It got so bad, that we would sometimes have to go to our grandma's house with mom until she and dad got along again, and during those times, my little sister would stand at the window all day waiting and crying for my dad, and at school I would cry, but have to lie to the teachers so I don't reveal what's really going on, though they ended up knowing when I was asked to draw rooms of my house in 3rd grade and I drew mom's room and dad's room separated. In 2008, my mom got the opportunity to go study in the US, and she did, she then kept extending her stay but studying more and more. It is now 2019 and she's finally finishing next month and coming back, but we visit her every year, so it's not like she abandoned us. In 2014, my mom and dad hadn't spoken in years, and finally got a divorce. During my whole life, and until now, the primary caretaker if me and my sister is our grandma, meaning she missed out on a lot of things in life just for us. For me. Add to all of that the fact that, where I'm from, children of divorced couples are disliked, and when you think about it, it makes sense: if X has never seen a functional family, X would never be able to start one, therefore, why would anyone want X? This is even more prominent for women, so I feel like I ruined my sister's future even more than mine. Add to that my extreme insecurities and lack of self esteem, and even if a woman ever took interest in me, I would not be able to keep her around. Now, it's 2019, and I finished school, and the results take a while to come out. They're coming out tomorrow, 25th of July, now I've always been a nerd and my biggest dream is to be one of the top students in the country. The top 10 are invited to special press conference, only problem is, I wasn't invited, meaning I'm not one of them. So my dream was crushed.

128,"I've worked in IT for almost 11 years now and I realize that I've hated it the entire time. I love computers and tech, but I hate having to study textbooks to get certifications, having to cram information I will never use because it's for a specific field I'm not in, but I need the certification because the hiring managers like to see it.

I've done this all grudgingly because I was always told I was good at it and that it pays well, and while this might be true I find myself sitting in the parking lot at work just wondering if I should turn around and go back home. To be honest I feel like I don't really know anything, and at best I'm just a lucky idiot who happened to be at the right place at the right time.

Part of the problem is that the upper management where I work makes some of the most asinine decisions I have ever seen; I know this may sound cliche but I have some everything in my ability to try and understand where they are coming from, but it almost seems like they randomly make changes just to see what happens.

Now that I'm in a position that pays decently, and I have a family, I feel stuck because I don't want to do something stupid that would affect them negatively. But I want to do something else, and I don't even know what that might be. I'm not particularly skilled at anything, and my life mostly revolves around work and spending time with my family so I don't really have any hobbies I can turn into a marketable skill. If I had to say I was good at anything, it would be that I'm magically affable; I can somehow get along with anyone in any situation.

132,"To start off I'm 28 and live with my mom.  A couple years ago my dad was living with us but because of my moms outburtsts he felt forced to move out and find a place just down the street. Since then I've been here with my mom paying for bills and helping around the house.  The thing is I've been trying to move out but I've been dealing with a horrible mental illness that I've barely started to make progress with.  Living with my mom certainly has been a factor as she's not a stable person but I've avoided moving with my dad for this time because he too is a difficult person especially when it comes to my mental illness. He'd held off on progressing with a divorce because he understood how it her reaction might make it difficult for me but he's through holding off and has already filed.  He wants to mail a letter explaining that he doesn't intend to pursue anything like taking the house and he simply wants to legally unbind himself from her. Of course my mom isn't going to believe him and I'm worried about her reaction.  I feel like my quality of life in this household will just deteriorate and my mom is going to unreasonable lash out on me.  She's always suspicious of things that I do anyways thinking I'm colluding with my dad in some way like taking out stuff from the house to give to him or lying about where I've been for the evening.  I've gotten sick of it but at this point if she receives the letter and the serve from a constable with divorce papers and lashes out on me I might just boogey on out of here to stay with my dad or even attempt to just find an cheap ghetto apartment close enough to my bus route for work as I don't have a car.  

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is ridiculous for someone my age to be wrapped up in a squabble between parents like this but like I said I'm in this situation from the loss of pace in my life due to the struggle with horrible mental illness.  I want to avoid getting in this affair but living here with my mom makes me feel like she'll involve me in some way.  Maybe she might enforce all these rules on me or forbid me from visiting my dad or something I don't know it seems like I'll have to deal with her constant suspicion about me colluding with my dad which would be horribly untrue. It sucks for my anxiety disorder that I have no idea when this stuff will go down while I'm at work or something or this week or next week. I have two 12 hour shifts back to back later this week and I don't know if I'll come home in that night in between and have to deal with one of my moms historic shit storms and lose sleep. I asked my dad if he wanted me to give her the letter and just claim I didn't know what it was but he feels thats letting me get involved too much which yea I agree but it'd allow me to at least gauge her reaction for myself.  Again if it's all just some giant shitshow that I'm not willing to deal with from her then I might just move down the street with my dad which is a small place barely fit for two. I have one friend that could potentially offer me somewhere to stay but I'd prefer to avoid that option as it's too far removed from my bus route.  Maybe just take the money I have to buy an apartment or even a car to live out of I don't know. It's my fault for allowing myself to waste time and not be aggressive enough about finding my own place out of the line of fire lol but again the mental illness is a big factor.

I watch myself make incredibly shy responses to simple questions, force myself to fake-laugh at bad jokes and in general just behave like a complete shell of myself. 

1. ""H-ha yeah... I think so too.."" (When I clearly don't agree with them)
2. &lt;Really bad joke by supeior&gt;  =  &lt;Very fake laugh from me that even I myself cringe at&gt;
3. &lt;Superior demands extremely impossible task&gt; = &lt;Nod and smile, give the good ol' fake laugh and slave away at said task&gt; 

I know quite confidently that it can be attributed to my constant fear of offending them or coming off rude. However, my body's own reflex reaction to this fear is too extreme! At its worst, my co-workers often observe these sudden behavior shifts in the presence of a superior, and label it a bad attempt to be a suck-up. 

Can anyone relate to my struggles? :(",28Jul2019,2

I don't want to make her friends feel uncomfortable(which is what usually happens when people try to get me to open up because I'm really quiet). She's really nice, but I don't want people trying to be my friend if they don't actually want to.",28Jul2019,2
141,"I began working at my job fairly recently. The pay isn't all that great but I needed work so I took it. The coworkers seemed nice to start, but once I got to know them I realised they weren't. 

A lot of backstabbing and gossiping went around the office daily. They would single out coworkers they don't like and try to make them stay later than nessecary or make their lives harder. 

The work is very hard to do and involves many late nights and often time overtime isn't paid anymore than normal work. Ontop of all of this my boss signs me for more work than I can handle. I work 9 hours a day 5 to 6 days a week and she still gives me more assignments.

143,I know it’s bad to think this way but I just can’t help it. My grandparents are both in their late 80s and they are the people I’m closest to on this earth. Im even closer to them then I am to my own parents. Since they are so up in age I can’t help but think they they might pass soon. They are now starting to give me belongings that they have cherished their whole life and every time I leave their house I always feel like there is a chance that was the last time I would ever see them. My grandpa definitely isn’t the same as he used to anymore. I have noticed his health has started getting a bit worse and he’s getting really slow moving. I just need advice on how to accept this because every time I think of it I bawl my eyes out and can’t stop crying. I don’t know what I’m going to do when something happens to them. :(,28Jul2019,2

I’ve grown up always being very involved in my church, and honestly yes it’s true that there are sometimes sexual predators in church, and pedos, but this isn’t about that rn. Well, I went to my brothers church (he’s a few states away and I don’t get to see him often), and as I usually do, I get tossed on stage to be involved in the music. Well one of the musicians sent me a friend request on fb, and since I kinda knew who he was, I accepted. He started messaging me, then texting me, and it got kinda sexual. I told myself it was fine, that adults do this all the time, and just kinda went with it. This guy is like 15 years older than me btw. He suggested we play a game, that Trivia Crack game, and whoever won would get a “prize” of their choosing. He won the first three games at the same time, and then said he wanted pictures. I figured since he’d won, it was ok.  He asked for things like me in my underwear, and course I’d never done anything like that before and I told him so, it just made him say even more sexual things. Course then I found out he was married and had a little kid. He was saying things like when I visited next, he’d show me what being an adult was like, etc. I’m pretty naive when it comes to sex... I was homeschooled and didn’t really learn about it till I was 15.  I’ve never heard such things like he talked about, but for some reason I kept talking to him, swapping pics almost every day. He said something about him being dominant, and that he could tell I was a submissive. After about two weeks, guilt was eating me up, because all my life I’ve had bible verses drilled into my skull. I told him so, and he said it was ok, that we didn’t have to talk anymore if I didn’t want to, so I just used school as an excuse. Telling him I was really busy and such. I’m going to visit my brothers church soon, and I’m worried how to act around him when I see him. He’s a lot bigger than me, and I’ve never been good at verbal conversations, idk how to talk to him if he confronts me. I feel like I’m a mess. Any advice..?",28Jul2019,2
145,"So to sum it up, I am turning 21 next week. I'm not a big drinker, but I wanted to do something special. Just go out to a nice dinner, or go gamble 20 40 bucks at a casino. But thats only part of the issue.  Here's the whole ordeal:

I moved in with my SO about 8 months ago across the country. Our combined income doesnt leave us a lot of play room with money each month. His car loan is a whopping 1,050 a month, rents 800. On top of that every other bill we have to pay for leaves us about 1,500 (after all the bills) to spend on gas, food, and other items for the month that aren't monthly set bills.

If it was a regular month, that'd be fine. But 2 different of his friends are getting married. One in the beggining of Sept. One in the beginning of Oct. We live across the country because he's in the military.  So, we 100% have to fly to the Sept. Wedding, and drive to the Oct. On top of that, we are moving to the next post in November. We are tight for money as it is, but with 2 weddings and moving, im stressing out.  If I have to give up my birthday, I will. 

If anyone has any advice how to deal with all this, or budget. Let me know. Any advice would be awesome.",28Jul2019,1

The years they haven’t been in my life I’ve missed them, a lot. They were my friend (though not a very good one a lot of the time). But I was still happier without them around. Or at least had some relief.

I don’t know why of all people, they are the one who lives in me this way. It doesn’t matter how much time passes. There is just something in me for them that never goes away. And it’s crazy to think a feeling like that can be one sided. How? But all you can go by is how someone treats you. And it’s clear that four years didn’t make them outgrow the things that make it hard to be their friend. They will never change. 

It’s been a decade of this shit with them and I’m just tired. I don’t have time for it anymore. We’re not kids anymore. The negatives of having this person in my life outweigh the positives, and they always have. But it’s like an addiction. And I don’t know what to do. Everything you should do to remove someone from your life, I’ve tried it. It even worked for four fucking years. Never long enough.

155,"Hi! So, that's my first time ever writing something like this, so please don't mind if I misspell, English is not my native language.

Some months ago, my ex-boyfriend broke up with me, and well, at first I was reeeeaallly bad about it but, like, in three days I was fine about the broke up. I notice I didn't love him, and I was actually starting to feel something about my friend (let's call he Damien).

Well, I met Damien 4 years ago, he was one of the friends of my ex-ex-boyfriend; we started to talk a lot! Like, sometimes even more than I talked with my bf. 
Anyways, in 2016 we stopped talking because of some stupid argument we had (I've said I didn't had any friend and he was like: oh, great! So I'm nothing to you! And we stopped talking) 
In the same year, after we stopped talking I've been diagnosed with depression, like, for real. My ex-ex-boyfriend and my childhood fucked up with me in so many levels that I can't tell. But that's not important in this post.

Now we are in 2018, I'm with my boyfriend and really better about my depression. I've started thinking to my self: ""hmmm, why I've stopped talking with Damien?""
I saw we stilled friends on Facebook, so I tried to start some not weird conversation. Everything is fine now, we explained what happened was just a misunderstanding and we tagged one another to memes all the time.
In the end of the year (December) he was forced to broke up with his girlfriend, his mom don't like her at all (for real, she was not the best kind of girlfriend, she did a lot of psychology torture and was an abusive relationship in any way you saw). He was sad about it, but we didn't talked about it, because we weren't really close at the time and he is not the kind of person who says about he feel.

Two weeks after my ex-boyfriend broke up with me I declare myself to Damien, because, why not try? We are both single... right?
Wrong! A close friend (we will call she Kate) said to me Damien didn't really broke up with the girl, and they were secretly dating. I really felt bad about it but, what can I do about it? Nothing.
Some weeks pass by, he still pretends he is single and we act as an couple! 
""Ohmygosh you're so cute! I love you xoxo ♡♡ my cutie pie"" and stuff like that, really sugary. 
I was starting to feel really bad about all this situation so I ""forced"" him to tell about his not so ex-girlfriend. 

After some months he really broke up with her, and now he is really single. And we were, again, acting like a fucking couple! 
But we are nothing but just &gt;&gt;friends&lt;&lt;. Everythime I talked to him about being a real couple he refuses saying is not the time, we aren't ready for this. We hurt each other saying bad things we didn't really wanted to say and if we are going to have a real relationship as an couple we must deal with it before, so we have the best start. 

And finaly I was tired enough of this that I said to us just be friends and nothing more. I'm really sad, I've tried to talk to him normally but just doesn't feel right, you know? Something is just out of place. Is not like we've broke up, because we weren't really anything for real, but there was our feeling and pretending that they doesn't exist is so hard and break my heart. I can't even talk to him properly now. 

I do insist in trying being his friend for now but wanting something more in the future, because we really feel something to one another or I just give up of all this and ""we are friends and that's it, nothing more now or ever""?",28Jul2019,1

We were in a giggly mood, so I didn’t believe her, making me grab my phone and message my class GroupMe group chat asking if the rumors are true. She was a very popular girl in school so we all know her, some closer than others. 

The responses I got to a simple “are the rumors true??” Include:

“Have some respect for the family, don’t be rude.”

“You should’ve texted someone privately.”
(I didn’t because no one ever answers me within 3 days.) 

“What’s your problem???”

158,"I’ve been trying to hook up with this girl in Puerto Rico. I have been telling him that I am super happy around her, and that I want her. He told me she’s not his “cup of tea”, so he will help me. We went to the beach earlier, and we got a little drunk. At first, we were really hitting it off. She was telling me how we need to be much better friends. We went into the water and my friend came to the water. He kept being very touchy-feely and picking her up. I tried to get closer to her, thinking that my friend was going to make a move to get us closer, but he keeps getting closer for a kiss. Soon, me and this girl hook up for a little bit. Then, my friend grabs her and they kiss for like 40 seconds, and then we leave after a while of hanging out. The entire car ride back she is laying on top of him, kissing him sometimes and stroking his hair. He makes absolutely no move to get her off of him, and embraces it. We get back home, and when I get out of the shower I catch them hooking up again. We are watching tv now and they are sitting in the same chair. This girl seriously made me happy, and I loved being around her so much. I thought we had great chemistry.

159,"It’s really difficult for me to be open, and I’m scared that it really hinders the progression of my friendships. 

Everyone always talks about the “toxic friend,” “dropping/cutting off people” and I feel like if I were my friends, I would drop myself? I don’t think that’s good.

I’m just really bad with communicating and when I go through a really tough time, I either become completely unresponsive or I unload everything on a close friend. I try my best to be understanding, to give space, to ask if the other party has the mental capacity to listen. I’m really appreciative when they give advice, but I know my behavior can still be draining in the long run.

I also have a problem with getting uncomfortable when people get close/attached to me? So in turn I distance myself without realizing or confronting it, and I know it’s hurtful and I feel terrible about it. 

I used to think I was a great person and friend, but recently I feel like everything I do leads to mistakes. When I open up too much, I hurt people. When I close myself off, I hurt people. I try to be positive but I end up getting angry, I’m bad at making plans, I don’t make an effort to call or text first because I end up doing something I regret when talking to people or I don’t feel like myself when I do talk to people.

163,"I met this guy through a dating app.
We’ve seen each other only three times (with a couple weeks between each one, due to family travels). Every time was amazing, from the topics we talk about and interests that we share to the chemistry during the sex. We cook together, watch movies, tv shows and random YT videos all night. We talk to each other every day and it feels really good. 
I wanted to see him more frequently but he is probably (99% chance) seeing other women. Because when we see each other on a Friday, he never mentioned the possibility of seeing me again on the Saturday. 
That wouldn’t be a problem except for the fact that I can’t find anyone else interesting but him!
I have no control over how monogamous I am, even when I am single. 

I met another amazing guy, cute, funny, intelligent and etc and tried to go out with him in order to prove to myself I could date more than one person at the same time and NOT fall in love for the first one, it was a disaster. After going out with the second guy for the third time, we went to a hotel and I could only think about the first one, we ended up talking and sleeping after, because nothing would turn me on.
Last night (Friday) I went out with the first one and all I can think about today is how I would like to be with him again. 
He hasn’t talked to me all night and, at least to me, he is obviously with someone. 

I think I should stop seeing him before it’s too late and I end up getting hurt. So I can take him out of my mind after a while, and be opened to other nice guys (more available ones pls). But that’s not what I really want.

166,"Hi all, 

To give some content, I'm located in the US. 3 blocks from my office there's a combo urgent care/primary care center. They have a couple locations, take my insurance, and are open past 5pm. All these made it an easy decision to go there for things like a physical.

About six months ago, I had a recurring health issue that was deeply personal, embarrassing, and fairly rare. To be more specific, we were talking about sexual health. During the course of the exam, I had a panic attack and the NP made several comments that were rude, insensitive, and made the experience much worse. I wrote up 3 pages of notes and he never looked at them, then got mad at me for not being detailed. I sent him a letter through the patient portal that he responded to, but I did not feel it was satisfactory.  Afterwards, I saw 2 different specialists (not at this office)  to eventually receive a diagnosis. 

This week, I hurt my ankle in front of my office and needed to go to urgent care. While I did not see him, I saw somebody else on staff. While I don't plan on injuring myself often, I don't know if it's worth saying that I would refuse to go there. While writing this question, I was tearing up - so I imagine any conversation would be very emotional. 

TL:DR :Is it worth making an appointment with the NP to talk about the way he made me feel, if so any tips about that would be great? Or calling the medical office and asking to never be put in his ""care"" again? Or should I cut my losses?",28Jul2019,1

189,"Throwaway account because it's the internet and you never know. Sorry for the long post.

I was wondering what advice anyone has to give for someone in my situation. My husband and I have been together for 3+ years, and despite the fact that he has had no contact with his ex-girlfriend since we started dating, she's still a problem.

My guy's ex-girlfriend is literally a r/nicegirl. There's too many stories to go through, but my issue is that she doesn't take 'no' for an answer. When he and I first started dating (this was public on Facebook and our friends and family knew) she contacted him despite having been broken up for 2 years (did not end in good terms, but he would casually respond if she initiated). She texted him to ask if she could ""move in with him because she doesn't have a place to stay, and she was sure his current girlfriend (me) won't mind."" He was living at home during that time and that meant they'd share his room. Naturally, he told her to fuck off and proceeded to block her because I was super uncomfortable with how she approached it. He blocked her willingly, and he suggested it. I accepted.

Fast forward a year later and she messages him on Facebook to tell him she ""had a funny dream where he was naked and showering in her house."" and ""isn't that funny?"". She proceeds to tell him she misses him and asks how he is. Again, he doesn't respond and blocks her. This year, she tried contacting him via his old Twitter handle saying something along the lines of how she missed him and she was wondering if he was ""alive"" and ""doing well"". He did not block her there, because he forgot his access to his handle. But he had blocked her on IG, too, after she started creeping on his photos and mine.  


She knows we are married since it's public, and she has seen our photos.Despite having had numerous boyfriends, she has tried to contact him regardless of her relationship status. She retweets things he posted to her on twitter from the days they dated (2012). MIND YOU, they dated for 2 years, on and off. And she was highly abusive during that period (would fake cry to get her way, argued with him for not being Muslim because ""she is"" (quotations because she does not practice, but likes to use it to argue), made him throw out pictures of his friends because there were girls in it, the list goes on.) I have never contacted her, nor met her. I really want to send her a message to tell her to fuck right on off and leave him alone, but everyone tells me to ignore her since giving her attention, even if its bad, would play into what she wants. I'm angry because she has not let up despite it being years, and she lives in the next city over. She comes over to our city a lot to just ""hang"" (she knows he lives here) and I worry that it'll get worse. He doesn't want anything to do with her, and I just want her to move on from him and leave us alone.

So what should I do? What would you do if you were me? 

TLDR; Husband's nicegirl ex-girlfriend keeps trying to contact him despite no contact from his end, and I just want it to stop.

Edit: She's an 'actress' and 'model' on Instagram (has not starred in anything, not even indie films, nor shot anything professional). Everything she does is public on her profile/stories. She's constantly single one day and in a relationship the next, and her SO is either ""the best ever"" or a POS.",28Jul2019,1

191," Hi! So, I'm in a predicament with a plumber where I have been contacting them for over a week and a half about returning a security deposit from a job that was not done. It is quite embarrassing to re-live my naivety, BUT:

it started with a high pitched humming noise my mom heard around the house (for background info, I go to school across the country and she let me know as soon as I got home so I could handle it) and she got a seemingly unreasonable quote of $1000 to do the job-- I looked up a couple plumbing companies on Google and Yelp and found one company that had pretty good and recent reviews. I didn't think anything of it, they had an address which I did not look up (but should have), and we set up an appointment (on July 10) for a free consultation on July 13. I was pretty nervous because I didn't fully understand the issue.

He came to my house and seemed honest and knowledgeable. He was 20 minutes early and suggested we replace all the fill valves in the house, even the basement which had been newly renovated last year. There were 5 to be replaced and he wanted to charge around $700. My mom complained that it was too expensive, so he said he would do them all for only $500 and requested that we gave a $100 deposit. As we handed over the money, he mentioned it was a family business and he was doing ""too much private work, signing NDA's and as a result unable to build his reputation"" and how he ""books up quickly"". I didn't think much about it at the time but oh how I regret it now -\_-.

We scheduled for him to work on the job on July 16, 1PM. On that day, around 1:20PM I hadn't received a call or any sign of his arrival so I called him and our conversation went like this:

Me: ""Hi, I'm calling about our appointment at 1PM?"" | Him: ""... What...?"" | Me: ""The five fill valves...?"" | Him: ""..."" ""..."" ""... OH! Yeah. I was just about to call you to let you know I am running late. Let's reschedule for tomorrow at the same time... 1PM?"" | Me: ""Let me ask my mother what she wants to do and I'll get back in touch.""

Well, we decided to cancel the job on him. At this point my nerves were so bad, I felt so uncomfortable to even speak with him so my sister gave him a call and let him know we wanted our deposit back, that she had hired another plumber for the job. He said he would stop by some time the following day to drop it off.

I called him and he said ""I'm busy"". I left him a polite text giving him my address for an e-transfer for him to return the deposit or that i would be available that day between 9AM-6PM for him to drop it off. I waited all day and nothing, no call, no text, no doorbell, nothing. So I nervously called him to ask and he said ""Ok.... well thanks for the reminder... You know... I have to get in touch with my consultant so stop calling me now... buh bye"" and hung up. At that point I was just taken aback.

Several days passed, maybe 5 or 6 and my sister called in to ask about it and he said he needed to get in touch with his accountant and would do so that day or the following day. Waited another 5 days, and I called him this morning saying I wanted my deposit back, I didn't want trouble, if it was a matter of distance that i could go to the APARTMENT that was listed as his business address to pick it up, and he told me ""You're going way too far with this. I'm not gonna tarnish my reputation for $100. I can't contact my accountant now because they're not open. I already left the matter to my accountant and waiting to hear back. I will contact you by the end of tonight"".

It's night and I haven't received so much as a text. It took me 30 minutes to call him, having to do breathing exercises to calm down, then I cried for another 30 minutes after the call. It's causing so much distress to the point where I kind of don't even want to deal with it anymore, but I don't think what he's doing is right, considering his receipt doesn't say anything about withholding the deposit from me and that he had done no work and seemingly forgot our appointment. Just thinking about interacting with him makes me tear up it's embarrassing. While my mom said to just let the deposit go, I don't want him to put anyone else through this.

\*\*\*

TL;DR: Plumber took my deposit and keeps making up contradicting excuses and confronting him gives me literal panic attacks. I don't know what to do or say. One of my close friends suggested I talk to the police because he's stealing my money, but I don't know if it is because he has a seemingly uncontrollable excuse. But if i'm honest i don't feel like I will be receiving my deposit back. I considered leaving a bad review but my family is suggesting I just wait it out until I get the deposit back but I don't really know if that is my ONLY option or the best one...

Getting into the relationship we were pretty sexual, we've always had this personal connection with each other growing up but distance got the best of us for sometime. Recently we got together, and yeah. Like I said, we've been pretty intimate. It was pretty fast going, it was amazing, and I feel like he's already getting tired of me. I'm who he lost his virginity to. Secondly lately any time I bring up sex to him he rolls his eyes at me and tells me he's not in the mood. 

My only main issue I guess is he's been outright refusing to have sex with me. I'm not forcing it on him, and I do a lot for him sexually. He doesn't really give me anything in return, and that's okay for the most part. I like pleasing him, and he enjoys it and says there's nothing wrong with that. But he won't ever return the favor or he's always just not in the mood to do it. And when I get sad about it he rolls his eyes and tells me that he isn't, ""in the mood for it,"" and that he doesn't understand, ""why I'm giving him shit for it."" Which I don't usually, he just gets so defensive and sometime's even if it's not sex necessarily I just want him to do something with me. I feel insecure and he always seems to belittle the fact that I'm in the mood and plays it off. If I cry about it, its cause I feel insecure about myself really, and I feel bad about asking then and he takes it negatively and really plays it off as I'm in the wrong. 

Am I? Am I being too selfish? Is it wrong to want to have sex every now and then? I know it's only 8 months into the relationship but still, like we did it a lot at first.

Eventually I started to realize that I really was not in love with this girl and that it would never work between us. So I never did anything and we stayed as friends for a long time which was great.

209,"About a week ago, I was on the internet and I made a comment on someone's post in a hobby group. I can't go into detail. All I can say is it wasn't offensive, rude, or mean but people mocked me for it. It wasn't serious either - the original post or the comment but super informal. They started taking pictures from my profile and memeing me. They turned everything I said into a joke (and nothing I said was funny). I have heard of stories like this regarding other people and I've seen it happen from a distance but this is the first time this has happened to me. 

At first it was just annoying but now it's starting to bother me. I didn't do anything to deserve this and the people who instigated it later admitted that they didn't like me for personal reasons and purposefully stoked it to get to this point. I thought it would blow over after the first couple days but it's been a week now and dozens of people are still going on about it. I know it's the internet and basically the stereotype of the internet is that everyone's an asshole but when it's hundreds against one, it feels like a mob. While some have come out to defend me and say ""I don't really see why this is funny"" and ""I think everyone is taking things too far"" they're only a handful and they're worried they'll get dogpiled for the same thing. Now people are taking what I said out of context and attaching my name and photo to it.

 I've tried reporting the ""ring leaders"" who keep instigating this for their behavior (because they keep sharing photos of me and making fake stuff) but it's been reviewed and the photos are still up despite them tagging me and sending people my way. Fortunately I haven't received any unsolicited messages or threats (again because nothing I said was bad) but I feel so out of control with this internet mob. I've tried stepping away but as I've said, it's been a week and it doesn't seem like this is going to go away. I'm also worried that this is going to stick with me and follow me.

If I said something objectionable or bad or wrong or stupid - I could understand at least on some level why this happened or at least tell myself it was my fault but I literally did nothing and people are just taking this opportunity to mock me. I've been told to message the people involved and talk to them personally asking them to take it down but I think if I do that, they'll just post the private messages and it'll prolong things further.

Actually my daughter does not seem scared but instead seems excited and enthusiastic to visit. This is strange to me. Do you find this normal? My daughter seems to find the idea of her mom having to wearing a uniform, sharing a room funny. I wonder why she would think it is funny. My wife says bring her if she would like to and my daughter says she would like to but I don't know if it is a good idea. She hasn't gone yet so we can discuss it",28Jul2019,0

212,"I want to apologize in advance because this might be a bit all over. Since the day I was born, my dad has never once tried to take care of me or put in any effort into our father daughter bond. My mom and dad were separated way before I was born and my dad even tried to say I wasn't his. (there's no mistaking it. I'm a spitting image of him.) He has put in the bare minimum and only cared to see me when he absolutely had to. He has made plans and cancelled time and time again. He makes empty promises that he never follows through with. I thought I had come to terms with him not being a part of my life, but during therapy I realized I didn't work through it, I just shut it out. I have desperately tried to show him I care and put effort into the relationship, but he doesn't reciprocate any fatherly love. He recently apologized to me and my sister for being a bad father, but that was that and he never cared to follow up on that. I really want him to be a part of my life, but at the same time I feel like this is an empty promise and he won't change. I feel like a burden and it skews the positive image of myself I once had. I just wanted him to love me and care for once, but I think it's impossible because of how he is. It's not just me he's wronged, he's wronged my entire family and takes but never gives back. If anyone has experienced something similar, how did you come to terms with the heartache?",28Jul2019,1

He seems to be losing some hair on his face and his ears are rough and losing hair too. It’s hard to get pics cause he won’t sit still, but I got the best I could. Also, when he walks it looks like he’s lost a lot of hair on the back of his ears, too. Could it just be allergies and he’s scratching it to hell while I’m not looking?

216,"I used the word shrink even though there’s a negative feeling behind it, but I heard Dr. Phil say it wasn’t offensive so shrink it is. 
Anyways, I’ve been going through a rough patch in my life between having my child’s mother probably going to jail over drug addition related crimes (theft and stealing shit mostly). Because of her nonsense and lack of responsibility, I’ve had me and the baby move back in with my parents, which at my age is absolutely embarrassing and near degrading. I’ve struggled at work, getting out of bed and getting to where I need to be on time because I just feel like it’s better to just stay in bed. I feel like I’ve just lost all motivation in my life to do better, almost like I’ve just accepted that my life is in a plateau and it won’t get better or worse from here. So ultimately my question is should I see someone to talk to about my feelings/emotions or is it just worth listening to my friends and family saying “ it’s ok man, you’ll get through this”? I just feel like maybe if I talk to someone who has experience in helping people get through the tough times in their lives, then maybe I can become the person I used to be.

220,"Basically, I've got this pretty flaky friend. This used to be a relatively understandable and lighthearted thing to poke fun at every once in a while, but it's been weighing on me more lately, and it's been making me feel pretty shitty. 

I've been relatively lonely as of late, and it's been something I'm trying to work on - ie, reaching out to my friends when something is bothering me, making plans etc. While I'd been reflecting on my habits, I realized a little while back that when it came to this friend, (and most of my others, hence lonely) I couldn't remember the last time she'd asked *me* to hang out (I'd always, always asked her). 

It made me feel a bit sad, but I love her a lot - she makes me laugh and whenever we get together I never got the feeling that she didn't want to hang out with me, she just never asked. Okay, so I send her a text asking if I could be honest because I loved her, and I told her how I was feeling. This was a couple of weeks ago, and I got a nice reply back, apologizing and telling me how she hasn't been herself lately and how it's just easier for her to wait for me to ask. Fair enough, we all struggle at times. I thought this is reasonable and I felt better.

In the spirit of trying to make good on promises, she asks if I wanted to watch a movie the next day and of course I do, but it didn't work out. She'd spent a lot of that day shopping with my sister (I didn't go and had some stuff to do, but assumed they'd be back that afternoon). After supper, they come back and I could tell that because she and my sister had just spent the entire day together, she'd just wanted to go home. Fair enough, another time, another time. 

It feels like me always asking, and her being busy, or me making plans (She hasn't asked since,) and her not being able to pull through. I know you hear about this happening a lot, but you don't think how incredibly frustrating and hurtful it is when it's happening to you.

Just today she bailed on plans we'd made a few days ago - but this time hurt a bit more, I guess. I had to message *her* when she was late asking ""Hey girl, like, when are you coming over?"" Apparently she thought her parents were just taking her out for coffee ""but they just kept driving"", and that she'd let me know when she was back in town (a good few hours later). I'm hurt that she didn't think to or bother sending me a text, but also a bit because she honestly couldn't have let her parents know that she'd had plans and couldn't like, take a road trip? Is that unreasonable?

I don't have a lot of close friends, and I can't afford to ""drop anyone who doesn't make time for you"" etc. I wouldn't want to. I really like her and I like being around her- which is something I don't come by often. 

This last year has been pretty hard for me, well-being-wise. I've just finished my first year at university, but I'm probably the loneliest I've ever felt. I'm wondering how to approach this topic without sounding like I'm hounding on her (remember, we just had a heart-to-heart a few weeks ago). I want to acknowledge how hurt I've been feeling in a way that would make a more lasting impact.

222,"Hey everyone, I’m on here to try and gather some advice on a situation that’s been really stressing me out lately. (As a result of my own stupidity may I add). I have to admit something to someone that I’ve been lying about and have NO idea how to go about it. 

Context is necessary to the story: I met a boy on tinder around last November and we’ve been talking on and off since then. Initially, things were great. We were both super stoked ok the idea of meeting and I could tell right off the bat that this dude was really something special from the hours we’d spend on FaceTime or text. Unfortunately, I thought it’d be a great idea to lie about my age. Because of this, I never went through with meeting him. I was scared he wouldn’t want to talk to me because I’m two years younger than him, so I told him I was his age. Big mistake. I never thought I’d develop this much of an interest in him and literally have dreams about meeting him and hanging out with him to this day. He moved to another state like two weeks after I matched with him so my window to see him was very limited. We lost contact for a little with the occasional response to something I’d post on Instagram or Snapchat, but now we’ve started talking again and he’s apparently going to be in town. He wants to hangout, I’ve never met anyone that I’ve naturally gotten along with more than this guy (I know I sound insane and you’re probably thinking I’m crazy as I haven’t even met him but trust me on this one), and I am scared shitless because he needs to know the truth. 

I genuinely feel awful about lying, and am extremely apprehensive to tell him since I don’t know what his reaction will be like and really really like him. I’m pretty adamant he feels the same too. although the contact has been minimal, he’s made sure to keep in touch even if it’s small things that don’t ensue an entire conversation. Anyways, do you think it’s worth telling him? Should I tell him in person (I was thinking other text just because I have crippling anxiety and don’t think I could handle telling the truth in person). I realize how shitty this was on my part and really want to fix this issue. I’m just worried it’s too late. What do you think? He’s too special to let go of.",28Jul2019,0

226,"So I work 40 hours a week at a restaurant and, due to medical bills, needed a second job to cover essentials things. They are providing some essential extra money right now and I can't afford to lose the job. But tonight something changed. 

Last week, an awkward nervous young kid came in and grabbed two cases of beer. When I asked for his ID, he basically ran from the store and drove away.

Tonight, same kid starts to come in with a girl. He makes eye contact with me through the window and immediately leaves. She comes in, grabs the same type of two cases of beer. I said something to the extent of ""your buddy is the one that ran from me last week"" with a slight friendly smile and asked for her ID. She then loudly said ""FUCK"" and took off as well. I snapped a photo of the car so I can show coworkers who to look out for. 

When the boss comes in, I explain the situation, show him the photo of the vehicle and what time they were by. He said okay and goes to look at the camera.

He comes back out, gathers my coworkers and me around and indirectly berates me about what I did. He said that even though they aren't legal now, they will be someday and future customers shouldn't be treated like that. To just take an ID if they have it, give it back, and sell them the beer. And also the taking a photo of the vehicle was inappropriate. 

I'm not cool with that, just because they will be ""future customers"", I'm helping them break the law by knowingly selling them alcohol. Which I'm apparently supposed to do.

I was fuming. My coworker said it was bullshit. I'm going to put in a weeks notice, to finish the finished schedule, and then I'm out. Am I making the best decision?",28Jul2019,8
227,"I am a person who is more comfortable having deep discussions with strangers than engaging in small talk and socialising with known people. I have a misplaced notion about fairness and justice that does not always hold water in the real world. I am polite and nice to people. I am never rude, at least not knowingly. I might blow my top if someone stresses me out; but that's more of a meltdown. 

I run a small business serving people's catering needs. I hire men, pay them wages by the day and get the job done. 

I must say that its a fulfilling business. Usually people are genuine and nice. Unfortunately, there are a few sour grapes. 

I recently had a case of a person backtracking from a commitment. On the night before the event she decreased the requirement by 50% and expected me to reduce the cost accordingly. That meant I pretty much made loss on the order. Now, I took the order because she requested me. I would not have undertaken the job otherwise because it was a small order. I laid out all the terms clearly well in advance. By reneging her commitment she effectively held me hostage as I had put men and resources on the job. 

I did everything to explain my side of the story; but she absolutely does not care. Considering catering is a business that usually develops by word-of-mouth I cannot afford to create enmity with clients. Now the loss on the order is minuscule (For basis of comparison - a $10 loss on an annual sale of $ 500,000).  It hardly moves the needle from a P&amp;L standpoint.

However, the situation is bothering me. I know I have been cheated and I don't know how to deal with the situation - from a mental standpoint. At some level, its because my effort has not been valued. At another level, its because the rules of engagement have been broken and I am completely helpless. I feel like a victim and that's a pretty weak corner to find myself in.",28Jul2019,1
228,"My boyfriend and I have been together five years and lived at his parents house with his family for one. His parents have just left for thier holiday of a life time, they’ve been saving and planning thier Europe holiday that they didn’t go on because family started a few years too early. 30 years later they are finally doing it and we encouraged them to go before it’s too late. 
 
Problem is the youngest son (my future brother in law) is 16 and getting up to serious no good. He’s been picked up by the police before, smokes more dope than all my friends combined in my teenage years.
Gets into fights. Hangs out with a very bad crowd, Skips school, has unprotected sex, Shoplifts, it never ends. He’s a nice intelligent boy, he’s just going down the wrong path and we can’t controll him. 

My boyfriend went to hospital last night with a throat infection, this morning the brother comes up to me asking for money to “go out with his friends” I ask my spouse if we should lend him any and he informs me that the parents gave the younger bro 250$ to spend while they are away. 

They left on Wednesday and it’s now Sunday. He spent 240$ in four days on “food and drinks” according to him. I’m extremely disappointed. Especially as how his parents signed him up to a food service so he wouldn’t have to buy food or cook while they are away. Where the money went? Who fucking knows... 

Anyway I start back at University tomorrow. My partner works full time. We can’t control him and we don’t know what to do. I’m really scared he’s going to seriously do something stupid and get himself arrested and charged. 

What do we do? I’m so lost and the two of us have to focus on our full time study/ profession. I don’t want to sound selfish but I’m spending so much on my education and I’ve been having sleepless nights and staying up late waiting for him to come home and I can’t do then when I’m doing 4 hour commutes every day to campus and being there from 8:00 am - 7:30 pm almost every day...  my spouse also works 9:00 - 6:30. How can we possibly monitor him?!  We have to hide money out of precaution and he comes and goes as he fucking pleases. Weekends are no longer relaxing times but instead full time baby sitting jobs. I’m not even a week in and I’m scared of what to do!

231,"So I matched with this girl on tinder over a month ago, then got her number and asked her out (she said yes) but I had to travel for a month (to go graduate from university) so we pretty much talked every day for the entire month and I did start actually caring and we got to know each other. She mentioned a few times we HAVE to see each other when I got back etc. Finally got back to my home country (where she is) a few days ago and we decided we’d go out next week for a coffee date or something and she was meant to get back to me when she’s free. Come last Friday me and some mates go out to celebrate loads of stuff and we drank more than we’d have wanted to. I must have had some anxiety bout if she thought we were just mates and friends since we talked for weeks (even if we matched on tinder) so I drunk texted something bout me hoping it’s a date etc.

Once I noticed I said sorry and was embarrassed she obviously replied laughing says she gets it and it’s ok no need to be embarrassed, I tried to pick up the convo again with her and just haven’t heard back since.
Fucked up and probs scared her way off 😂

I was just wondering what could I do or is it just sabotaged? Feel like she replied that it’s ok etc just to be polite but has since switched off read receipts and just hasn’t replied to our convo so maybe I should drop it all?

So I initially apologized and said I was so embarrassed

She replied “HAHAHA it’s ok man no worries; I understand!!!!!!! don’t feel embarrassed tho”

After that I assumed it was ok and tried to just brush it off by explaining we went on a night out, told her it was a stupid thing to do then asked how her weekend is going. Then this morning I still felt rather guilty so I sent another text apologizing again and said if she’s still down to hangout next week I’d be best before Friday cuz I’m busy Thursday/Friday with somethings but her just ignoring our convo and only saying it’s ok to my drunk text coupled with the lack of replies etc may just mean it’s time to drop it

Should I tell my boss about my program? My thought process currently is that the degree I am seeking is not necessarily what I am doing now and since I just got hired, i don’t know that it would make a great impression saying that I might be moving on in a few years.

234,"i’m an american girl who just turned 18 a couple of weeks ago. i have always been a mature kid, my parents said i have seemed remarkably older psychologically even when i was just 4 years old. then through high school i dealt with extremely severe depression and GAD + OCD so that just made my high school years a huge blur. I graduated high school early at 16 and have been in school ever since. i go to school with 25-30 year olds now (confusing situation i know). Now for the crisis- i have had nothing close to the common childhood/adolescence. i fully feel like i accidentally skipped it. I was a part of the “popular kids” in school but never attended parties. because i was so focused on working and saving $ throughout high school, i almost only ever saw my friends during the school day. I also skipped the college experience. i completely feel like i’ve missed out on so many experiences and have been living the same kind of shell of a day since i was 14. i have very few memories of my teen years so far. probably could count them on my hands. i haven’t had fun in two years. there is no life in my life.
all of this is completely my fault by the way, i have forced myself to grow up too quickly paired with the mental disorders listed above. however. i’ve trapped myself in an adults life now and don’t know what to do about it. i don’t want to change my life, i just want to know if i’ve ruined it/anything. i hope i’ll be able to live happily one day and that the effect of the fact that i have trouble relating to my peers will diminish eventually.

235,"I am working a 14 week internship this summer, and my last day is on the 9th. I was assigned a mentor, and he has been less than helpful throughout my summer here. 

Since my first day, I got the sense that my mentor didn’t really like me. During orientation, the manager had set aside 2 hours for each of us 5 interns to meet with our mentors to discuss our projects and everything. My mentor did not show up to our meeting until nearly an hour late, and didn’t apologize for being late either. When he walked in he said “are you my intern?” I said yes and he said “we haven’t had a girl intern before.” 

He then read through my list of projects and goals for the summer (read word for word from a paper I had already been given and read while waiting for him). I asked him a couple questions, and he gave me one word answers mostly. Our meeting ended in less than 30 minutes. 

Since then, my mentor hasn’t really been of any help to me. I have scheduled meetings with him and he has confirmed them, but then doesn’t show up or comes in the last five minutes and says “we can just meet another time”. 

There have been a couple instances where I have left the meeting room after he didn’t show up, and seen him in our coworker’s office laughing and joking with him (clearly not work related). I even called him out on it once and said “hey we had a meeting” and he just told me he was “too busy”. 

I have to meet with him to get his approval to do certain things for my project, like order parts or get approval to run certain tests, so it has slowed me down a bit.

(I also have a hunch that he may be a little sexist. He has made comments about how he believes women shouldn’t work. He also told me that I was “pretty” and asked why I would ever work in this industry (manufacturing plant). He also has been very helpful to the other three engineering interns who are all males.)

On friday, I gave a presentation on my biggest project to the entire management team. It went over really well. The regional manager happened to be there that day, and she sat in. Afterwards, she told me she was impressed with my work. My mentor was nearby and told her that “we” had worked hard on it. That annoyed me more than anything. 

He hadn’t even seen anything about that project before. He didn’t show up to two consecutive meetings, so I found other ways to get approval to order parts and stuff. He made it so difficult for me to complete the project but I found other ways around it. He did not help me in the slightest. 

I also feel like it’s worth mentioning that there are three other interns working in the engineering department. Their mentors meet with them several times a week, and have been very hands on in helping them with their projects. This makes me feel like I’m not overreacting to how my mentor treats me. 

I meet with the general manager bi-weekly. When I discuss my projects with him, I will make subtle comments about my mentor’s behaviors, but have never blatantly said anything it really told him the extent of it. I will say things like “I’m waiting on him to approve it”, or “i’m hoping he can make time to meet this week”. I’m afraid of telling the manager about my mentor’s behavior mostly because I don’t want to sound accusatory or like I’m blaming him for me not getting certain things done.

 Next week, I have an exit interview with the general and regional managers to discuss what I did and my experience. I know that during it, they will also ask about my mentor’s helpfulness. I really just want to rip my mentor to shreds. At the very least, I want to tell him about how he dodged meetings, and told me he didn’t ever have time to meet with me. 

I haven’t ever expressed these concerns to my mentor or my managers before. So, I’m a little worried about how bringing it up now will make me look. Should I bother telling them about it or will I look like I am just complaining and trying to make excuses? Is there another way for me to express my concerns without sounding like I’m complaining too much? 

I also just want to add that I didn’t do poorly during my internship. I got off to a slow start, but once I figured out how to do things without my mentors help I was able to complete most of the projects given to me. So that’s another reason that I don’t know if I should even bother calling him out.",28Jul2019,3

I'm 17 and I live in a toxic home. My father is abusive and downright scary. I love my mom and sibling, but I can't stand to live with my abuser anymore. I have been seriously considering suicide lately. After a lot of thinking, I figured why not just leave? Killing myself would permanently seperate me with everyone I love and everything that makes me happy, so why not just start life over and I guess metaphorically kill old myself instead. And with that, I have made plans to leave once I turn 18.

However, I want to make sure I remain 100% untraceable. I plan on backing up my emails on a brand new and anonymous email, I will factory reset my phone and leave it behind so it can't be tracked, and I plan on changing my name (which I realize is a lengthy process). I have my birth certificate and SSN. I plan on buying a plane ticket in cash. 

Aside from bringing food, money, a means of staying warm incase I end up sleeping outside, possibly a prepaid phone if an emergency arises, identifying documents,  and of course using my brain to steer clear of dangerous situations, what else can I do or bring with me in order to leave safely? 

Thank you so much everyone.",28Jul2019,5
238,"I am in a tense situation of my own making and struggle with decisions that affect other people. I would really appreciate any advice on how to improve things for myself and those affected. 

The situation is: I live in nice, affordable apartment in an expensive and lonely city with two friends, who i'll call Larissa and Chloe. 4 or 5 months ago, Larissa and I developed romantic feelings for each other, and ended up geting physical and feeling each other up, but nothing more. We did this a few times but didn't progress to kissing or sex. However, I was in a long term relationship at the time so this definitely counted as cheaing. I told my partner and shortly afterward we broke up but agreed to try to be friends. The guilt nearly killed me and i spiralled into a bad mental state and self harmed for the first time in my life. Chloe, a long time and compassionate friend, helped me get mental health treatment. Eventually, I  regained a bit of stability but am still very plagued by guilt, shame, sadness, and regert. Larissa too was hurt and stressed but has also been a helpful and nice friend, despite my desire to annul whatever happened with her. 

In the near future, our lease will be up for renewal. I don't know if I should stay or move. I recently passed up a great opportunity to live with other friends because I'm an indecisive idiot and didn't want to upset Chloe, would told me she would be sad if I left. However, I know my ex partner will be happy if I move and I care a lot about her. I'll hopefully also feel a weight off my shoulders, at the expense of being lonely and uncertain about my future. Meanwhile, I also feel weird when Larissa is on dates and I'm home alone knowing that she's with other people that could have been me, which must mean I still have some residual feelings for her that I would never been mentally able to act on. The pressure to make the decision is driving me a bit crazy, and yesterday I had a nervous breakdown (silly I know). I don't want to go on feeling stressed and either way, I need to learn to live with consequences of my actions. 

Would you move or stay, if moving meant easing your contience and minimsing contact with a person who you associate with your worst moment, but also losing a good day-to-day life and good friends? Any advice would be appreciated, and please if you can refrain from chastising me for cheating. I've tortured myself enough, and have gone to great lengths to apologise, make ammends, and be good to those affected. Thank you.",28Jul2019,1
239,"I'm 18, I live with my family. My mother, father, older sister and younger brother. I'm the only kid of theirs that helps them or even speaks to them. I pitch in, I'm beneficial to them. They're overbearing, my sister trusts me for some reason and tells me everything she does while my parents try to get me to narc on her. I dont want to hear it from either party. Only my grandpa ever really supported me as I went on to become a mechanic and took on a project truck, which is now being restored in his honor, as the last times I saw him I looked into his lifeless eyes and later lowered him into his grave. My parents dont support me at all. They see the benefit of my life goal, they encourage it, but stop there. They act like I'm there to take my grandpa's role, to be the problem fixer. To solve their issues that came about from bad decisions. I work constantly. I cant stand being home, and when I am, I have to drown them put with music. They refuse to talk about these issues.

247,"I know the title makes it sound obvious, but the situation feels more complicated than that. Sorry in advance for the long post. 
The basic backstory is that my mother and father separated when I was three. When I was around seven, my dad’s girlfriend (at the time) became pregnant with my now half-brother. Things happened in their relationship (my dad couldn’t keep it in his pants in ANY relationship) and they split. It should also be mentioned that my father is emotionally abusive (I once told him I was dealing with some very intense mental health issues, and he told me that I was just being dramatic. Safe to say a few months later I was hospitalized for mental health issues, some of which have been caused by him) as well as has a history of being physically abusive with the girls he cheated with. Now, my brother knows NOTHING of this, and sees our dad as a normal dad. However, that being said, he has never had to live with our father EVER, as my father ran away to a different city when he was born because he couldn’t face his actions, and so has only seen our father for, at the LONGEST time, a week. So his interactions with our father are very limited, as he is not allowed to go to our father’s house either because his mother does not trust our father. 
I, on the other hand, have always had the choice to go visit our father where he lives. Now, in 2013, my grandmother was murdered in a domestic violence incident. 6 months later, my father moved to that town. Safe to say, for about 2 years I did not go see him or talk to him much, so things were VERY strained. Finally, in 2016, I decided I could brave the emotional trauma of staying in the town my grandmother helped raise me in to go and visit my father and my stepmother. While I was there, my father and I got into an argument about police brutality. Well, rather than keep talking about it calmly as we had been doing, he decided to charge at me, screaming ‘defend yourself’ and pin me to the floor. At this point, I was aware he was abusive and I was scared if I hit him he would hit me, but I still tried to resist. As soon as he finally got off of me, I had a panic attack in front of him. That incident has given me PTSD, as diagnosed by medical professionals. I did not tell anyone about this incident until at least a year and a half after, because I was so afraid of what he would do. 
So, safe to say, my father is an asshole, and this isn’t even beginning to scratch the surface of what he’s done. 
But my dilemma comes in around here. My brother still sees our father as a good man, the only reason I stay in contact with our father is for my brother’s sake. If I told my brother’s mom, there is no doubt in my mind that she would not only confront our father about this, but also forbid my brother from ever being alone with our father again. 
However, knowing our father, I know that if he finds out I told anyone about this, my medical insurance (which he provides) would be cut off, leaving me without a way to afford any of the medication I need to survive. Not only that, but our father has a tendency of ‘punishing’ my brother as a way of getting back to me when he thinks I’ve been disrespectful. Meaning I have one of two choices; tell my half-brother’s mother, and risk my brother having to find out all of the awful details about our father, as well as open him up to our father’s retaliation and have him suffer like I did, or do I stay quiet and do what I have been doing, which is making sure I am with my brother the entire time my father is so that I can make sure he’s safe.",28Jul2019,1

252,"I don’t know where this post really belongs, but I don’t know what to do. To start off, I have had crushes on girls ever since elementary school, but at the time I never really thought much of it because I liked boys way more, even if most of it was just in my head? By that I mean I wasn’t really one to spend a lot of time with boys that much, I’d just fantasize about them. Anyway, skip forward to when I was around 13/14 I cut my hair and started realizing I was attracted to girls too. When I was 16 I had my first proper relationship, with a girl... at the time, I also identified as a male, and was going by a different name as well.
By then, that was just my life. I was a guy, and I was into girls. Simple.
It just felt right, being with girls romantically, and I’ve never felt that way with a guy before. I TRY to replicate the same feelings but it feels so forced. Especially with guys my own age. 

Anyway, my family is conservative in this weird way, and I guess a bit homophobic. They would be absolutely devastated about me being with girls, and would be very mad. They believe men and woman HAVE to be together and anyone who is in a same sex relationship is confused. I have always felt the need to “behave” in my family and felt a **HUGE** amount of guilt about the way I was living my life when I was dating girls. The idea of my family criticizing me and isolating me, maybe even shunning me for liking girls broke me down when I was 17 and I did a complete 180. 

I threw away all my masculine clothes, I went back to using my birth name, I broke up with my amazing girlfriend, grew my hair out to my waist again and started to dress more feminine. Oh, and yeah, started to try being with guys. 
I thought I would have to the power to just “switch” like that. I felt no other choice was available seeing as “god is watching me” and that I have to live “naturally” like how He intended. But honestly, I’ve never been more confused in my life. I feel like a really bad person for trying to be with guys and fawn over them when part of me knows I’m not all that interested. It’s basically like lying to them, myself... just everyone. 
I know some guys are handsome and some have amazing personalities but I have to *make myself want to pursue them*? Whilst with girls I just naturally go out of my way when Ive liked them. And I mean, I’m happy...

Issue: Now I’ve been getting involved with this really nice awesome guy but I just want it to stop, and be alone, which makes NO sense because there’s nothing wrong with him. Its just, if I’m being honest I’d rather be alone than have a boyfriend and I feel wrong for feeling that way.

I can’t just date girls, because I’m too scared of all the consequences of it..
I know I’ll never be able to transition to being a guy so that’s wayyyy out of the picture. I HAVE to live as a woman, that’s fine... but I just don’t know if I can live acting like I want to be with men when I don’t really KNOW if I do.
I don’t want to feel ashamed or like that I’m lesser than the rest of my family if I admit to them that I like girls.
Should I just be peacefully alone? Honestly, I don’t think I need to be in a relationship to be happy right now, but I keep leading guys on because I don’t know how to explain things to them. It’s really bad to admit, but it’s hard to say “So hey I’m really confused about whether I’m attracted to you and you’re really nice but I actually think about being with a girl instead” and get judged for it, than it is to just let things happen. So I’ve been just letting them happen and I don’t feel happy about it anymore... 


**tldr: I’ve been guilted out of exploring my sexuality and now feel like I’m forced to live in a way that seems most acceptable to my family. I’m too scared to be honest with anyone, even myself, and have been leading guys on and it feels wrong. Should I be honest with everyone about my sexuality?**

256,"I would like to remain anonymous but I’ve decided to come on this app because I’m at a point in my life where I’m just hopeless and lost and don’t know where to go or what to do and I have nobody to talk to. So to sum it all up, my parents are divorced and I live with my mom and sister, step dad and few other family members. My biological dad lives in another state and has a new wife and another child but that is unimportant to why I’m here. My mom is the issue. She’s an alcoholic and always has been. I don’t know where her drinking issue started, she used to be a beautiful caring mother, she still is but when she starts drinking things get ugly to the point where it has caused me lots of anxiety. I believe this started when my grandma died, my grandma meant the world to her so when she passed away it was all down hill from here. My mom gets really abusive (emotionally and physically.)  it caused me a lot of mental damage, I never realized that as a kid but now I’m starting to realize that she’s the root of most of my problems, ironically. But I’m not here to ask advice on helping her, because I’ve tried everything I could. I’ve tried being demanding, soft, talking to her about her issues, ignoring her and acting like I don’t care, I’ve tried hiding the alcohol, I’ve even tried drinking it just to show her the example she’s setting but honestly... she’s a lost cause. I truly believe at this point she will never get better because drinking is her happy place, when she drinks it gives her the courage to say things she wouldn’t when she’s sober even if it means emotionally damaging her family. But I don’t want people to get the idea that she’s a bad mom, because when she’s sober she’s super caring and loving and funny. And the morning after her drunken night I can tell she tries to get on my good side but her ego is too big for her to actually apologize. But like I’ve said, I’m tired of living this life with someone who is always degrading me, she degrades my entire family but everyone else is powerless, they’re too scared to say a single word because she gets violent, I’m the only one that puts an effort to try to stop things, that has the courage to say something even though I’m the youngest which really pisses me off that not even my own stepdad will back me up when I need him the most.  I’ve noticed I’m not the same me anymore, I have major body issues and I’m really anti social and stay locked up in my room all day, I feel like my self hatred, anxiety, body issues is only getting worse and all I want to do is live by myself. I don’t want to be in contact with ANY of my family’s members I just want to be alone. But I don’t want to grow up to have this life, I want to do great things in my life and I want to get in the right track because for the past year I’ve been slipping, my grades started dropping and like I said I became extremely antisocial and stopped talking to everyone including my friends. I want to live a good life and not have to fear every time my mom starts drinking. And one thing that I’m really passionate about is moving out. The day I move out will be the day I big heavy rock will be lifted off my shoulders. I get exited just even at the thought of finally getting my own place. I’m 14 right now so there’s not much I could do maybe I could move out at 16 but I would have to really up my game. but if anyone has some advice to pave a future for myself like saving up to get a place for myself(even if it’s just a room), getting a job, doing better at school and being more social I would gladly appreciate:)",28Jul2019,0

I have always wanted to be extremely successful since I grew up in a low-income household and watched my parents struggle with money for years. Due to this, I studied at a top 30 university and studied finance and completed two internships in investment banking. The thing is I did not receive return offers from both places as they told me I lacked common sense and an aptitude for finance. This broke my heart as I invested so much time into my degree and the entire interview process. Because of this, I decided to take some time to think about my next plan, but haven’t reached any conclusions. I am always between so many new potential careers such as “what if I did law or physical therapy?” “Should I go back to school and do a masters, but if so in what?” These thoughts are usually in my mind a few times a day and it upsets me that I still don’t know what direction to head in as I will be turning 24 soon and I can’t just live at my parents house forever thinking. I don’t know if I want to use my business degree again because I realize I am not good with numbers and I don’t want to go through disappointment again. This, I don’t know wha to do and was wondering if anyone can offer me advice or comfort as I feel very lost. I am very career oriented and want to make a good living, but I am not sure what I am meant to do. I have even shadowed professionals in health care settings, but still haven’t gone “yes this is it!” As I am still unsure and not sure what to do. I don’t want to invest a lot of money into a program and not be sure, but I also don’t want to be sitting at my parents house forever never taking a chance. How did you guys decide? Did you guys make any big career laps? What should I do?",28Jul2019,1
270,Ok so one of my closest friends was dating this girl that he was head over heels for. They had a long distance relationship so he couldn't see her often. So one day she has this super bad accident and he thinks the worse when she won't answer his texts. So this is where it gets bad she had someone tell him that she had died. So this makes him extremely depressed for a few days until she texted him saying that she didn't die and that she lied and wanted to break up. Like who the fuck does this?,28Jul2019,2
271,"I’m in college. I had trouble meeting guys the same way I did in high school (it was as easy back then as “I like you. Thoughts?” And it either worked or it didn’t.) 

Now it’ll at a huge college with different people in each class and I’ve only been able to meet people through dating apps. 

I hate it. *HATE IT.* But the only men I’ve met in person are interested in hooking up, or no relationship (because they can easily access casual no strings attached sex on the apps.) 

I want a real relationship that involves spending time together and where we don’t sleep together until we know each other a little. 

I tried joining clubs and groups of things I’m interested in. I get out of the house all the time. I still only meet guys who either want casual sex or nothing. 

I always hoped I’d have a friendship that would blossom into more, but it is feeling more and more hopeless.

273,"This is gonna be a long story so bear with me.

I’m not sure how to start this but I am in love with my best friend. Let’s call him J for privacy reasons. J and I dated over a year ago for 6 months, and it ended with him cheating on me. But despite that, we stayed friends. 

Then after a few months we tried again. And surprise surprise, we broke up again. This time for my ex best friend. After this though, we blocked each other and completely cut off contact due to a huge argument. They were together for 5 months and ended because of family drama. So because he has no one else, he came back to me.

We hung out a few times and became close again, but never showed any signs of flirting but now, we hang out EVERY day (6 week streak without missing a day, babey) and we even work at the same place together. We’ve been talking about getting an apartment together soon which is also fun.

But here’s where the issue is. I REALLY like him. Like more than a crush. I could see myself spending the rest of my life with him because he’s literally perfect to me in every way. But i know for a fact he doesn’t think the same at all. He’s always fascinated with other people and is always talking to a few people at a time. He even had like 5 dating apps at one point. 

But i really dont know if thats like. A sign he doesnt like me. 

Last week, we both stayed for a few days at another friend’s house. J and I ended up sharing a bed, and on the first night, I woke up to him like. Spooning me i guess but his arms wasnt around me. So like. He was pressed up against me in spooning position. I dont know if it was intentional or if he was doing it in his sleep, but the moment i moved slightly, he turned over and  stayed like that the rest of the night. 

That was the only time anything like that happened though. I mean sometimes he’ll say something that sounds flirty, but I have a habit of overthinking too much.

Also he’s told me that he wants me to date someone and to put myself out there, but I’m not interested in anyone else. So idk

282,"I’m going to try to keep this summary as brief as I can. 
Been friends with this one person for about three years now. But by this point in time, our friendship has dwindled down to a lot of arguing. I’ll proceed to list at the signs I’ve gotten as to whether I’m being manipulated or not. 
Side note, this relationship is carried out through a messaging app, and the person in question has issues.

Often times, I feel treated unfairly. Just recently, this person got mad at me for not responding for 24 hours, in which I apologized and tried to clarify things. But not too long before that, they had completely disappeared on me for about 2-3 weeks. With their return though, they never explained anything, nor apologized. 
This isn’t even the first instance of this happening. 

Whenever I try to detach myself from our toxic relationship, it either leads to them: guilting, shaming, or threatening me. 
Sometimes even all at once. 
The worst case being when they mention killing themselves. 

Whenever I speak up and note that I feel unfairly treated, this leads to them talking about themselves and how much of a hard life they have. 

I can go on, but I fear for reaching the letter limit to these posts, so feel free to ask me to elaborate down below. I apologize if this is not enough to work with.
Anyways, I just need to know. Am I being manipulated? Is there something I can do to take care of this?",28Jul2019,7
283,"I (m16) have In the past couple of months been talking to a girl (17) I really like and she has said she really likes me. We were going really good, although she expressed her concerns about dating due to how busy her life is (she has her own business, is very political, and community oriented). She basically has her entire life figured out and is a very independent person.

She tells me that she doesn’t enjoy PDA because she doesn’t want to gross other people out which I can understand, but she is completely fine with anything when it is just us two. But I on the other hand am a really affectionate person and when I see her I want to show her that I care about her (hugs, kiss on the cheek etc.) but obviously I respect her thoughts and so I don’t do PDA towards her.

Last night I stayed at her house and we were talking about dating. She told me that she was going to completely honest and said something along the lines of 

“Belak, I really like you but I don’t want to date you. I am very driven towards my goals and this sounds mean but you would only distract me, I am not looking for a relationship with anyone.”

I was a bit disappointed at hearing this and told her so. I thought things were going really good and although we were 2 very different people, we could make it work. But I do respect her decision and I think she is way more mature for her age, I am not someone that she would deserve.

So I asked her “So what do we do now, do we stop talking? What are we?”

She told me that we are the same as we have always been. Now this is the confusing part. She says that she still wants us to be a “thing” but won’t actually date me, she says that she won’t  fuck around with other guys and that she will stay loyal to me, but she will be so happy for me if I found someone else.

So we are basically dating without the title but it shouldn’t even be called that. 

It is a bit embarrassing to admit, but I am an emotional person and I know that I’m going to stay attached to this girl for a long time, but the fact that she will never date me, but give me everything else (sexually, physically etc.)  is really going to get to me because she will be so close but just out of reach. 

She is not a very emotional person like me and she will be completely fine with it, but I fear for my own mental state.

I can’t cut her out of my life, she is also a very good friend and also in my friendship group. I can’t date her and I couldn’t stand to lose her because I have become so attracted over the months.

What should I do?

Been talking to a girl for months. She tells me she doesn’t want a relationship but wants us to still be together with no strings attached. I really really like her but am concerned for how it will affect me mentally in the future. What do I do.",28Jul2019,86

285,Middle school SUCKS. I hate it I wanna switch schools no I wanna go back to elementary everything was so much easier. Anyways in elementary I didn’t get bullied as bad and I had a ton of friends in middle school I get bullied a lot more and the person who always defended me and was on my side is now on the bullies side. We started going out 6th grade and now we are going to 8th. During the 7th grade I got bullied a ton especially by one specific guy and he pissed me off cause he always acted nice to her like they were friends but then emotionally bullied me and his friends physically bullied me. Eventually I talked to her about it and she got angry at me and said we should all just be friends. It seems like middle school really changed her a lot she is more out going in a different way than in elementary her personality has changed completely that’s one of the reasons I might leave her the other reason is that one night we were having a sleep over (the 3 of us) it was later in the year a few months back. We were at my house since we all live near each other she lives in my apartment suite and he lives a few blocks away. Anyways I was shy and didn’t talk cause it was awkward so they talked the entire time and then we started talking about sexual things and they both laughed like it was funny. I would’ve left if it was her apartment but since it was mine I can’t just tell them to leave. Anyways they started talking about dicks and dick sizes and then somehow we got to measuring them. I’ve never really questioned something like that because that’s things high schoolers do however from the way she talked definitely seems like she has thought about it once again adding to my point about her changing. Anyways she was going to measure us separately and we joked about the biggest one getting a handjob no.... THEY joked about it. I was super uncomfortable and felt like they were both harassing and bullying me... it’s one thing for him to do it but for her to do it just made me feel weird and I felt like I couldn’t say no. So she measured mine which took like 10 seconds then she measured his which took like 3 MINJTES. I was too afraid to go check but they finally came out and after that it was very awkward. Anyways a few days ago we had a group chat and I got my bullies number I’ve been avoiding and not talking to my girlfriend since then and he got mad AT ME. Saying I should talk to her more and giving me advice. Then he got angry and said this is probably why your girlfriend gave me a handjob and like everything bullies do to tick you off I ignored it and haven’t mentioned it to my girlfriend however it’s been on my head since and honestly even if they didn’t do that I just don’t want to talk to her anymore. I’m tired of all the bullying and I just want to be left alone what do I do?,28Jul2019,1
286,"Hello everybody,

This is my first time posting something on this sub reddit, so if I make any mistakes, I apologize in advance.  
I need a bit of an advice towards the following situation.  
I have these two friends, I've known them separately for quite some time now, and I've always had an idea to introduce them together cause I thought they might be some kind of an item. But they met via tinder and when I knew I told them that I've thought of introducing them, but refrained from doing so cause I don't know how they were gonna react (one of em is in the closet), I eventually was happy that they actually liked each other, but on the other hand, I can't help but feel a bit jealous. They're seeing each other EVERY SINGLE DAY, and in some ways I feel kinda left out.  
One day I invited one of them over to hang out, he accepted, but later in the evening he called me to cancel. I called the other one to see if he was free to meet up, he told me that he was too tired and heading home very early (very unusual from him). So I immediately thought that the first one canceled on me to be with his significant other. I have no proof of this, but i can't help but overthink this. I'm just speculating but I have a weird feeling about it. Last night one of them came over, and the other one called him on the phone, and he literally invited him to my place without me saying if it's okay or not, when he hung up he was like : it doesn't bother you right ?. I was a bit shocked, cause they can't keep their hands off of each other, they have just met and already planning a trip together and stuff, which makes me even more hateful. I was insinuating all night long about that day he canceled on me and stuff, subtly, and talking about friendship and whatnot, their reactions seemed a bit guilty to me, but I might be mistaken

I have yet to learn to be happy for my friends in their earlier stage of relationship, but since I've been single for quite a while and gone through life changing events, I struggle a bit to be happy for other people...

What should I do ?",28Jul2019,2

288,"Hey, guys. I have a serious problem that I have tried to fix several times throughout my lifetime and have not been successful. I am an extremely picky eater, and have much difficulty trying out new foods. I have been this way ever since I was little because my parents were not around much of my childhood to force me to eat the foods that I was not a fan of. It may not seem like much compared to other problems, but it has affected my life in a very negative way.  I do not go out of my comfort zone for the most part when it comes to my menu (Meat, fish, pizza, etc.) I also eat very few amounts of fruits and no vegetables whatsoever. Throughout the 20yrs of my lifetime, I have tried to cook foods differently and also have tried to outright just eat new foods. But they always make me uncomfortable to have them on my plate and often stall to the point where I lose interest in trying it or any appetite I had for it initially.       


Many people who are close to me have also warned me about the side effects that this lack of variety can lead up to and how it can severely deteriorate my health. But putting the health benefits of trying new foods aside, they have also made my social life suffer as a result. I recently got a GF, and every time we go out I order the same things from the same restaurants and it gets boring - *quickly*. She also offers to try many of her plates, but my lack of taste just prevents me from trying anything new and disappoints her every time. I also have a hard time going over to her house because her family is very nice and offers me many different dishes and I have to always make an excuse to not eat. I also am ashamed sometimes of going to eat in public with my friends because of this problem and having to be so specific to the waiter about what I want exactly, which is why only the people closest to me know about it. It really made me depressed as I am aware of the problem and have tried to change several times throughout my life, but I just can't put myself to go through with it. It is really hard as I always feel like I have some sort of psychological barrier that prevents me from being able to like new things when I want is to be able to enjoy a nice meal with my friends and family without having to worry about the hassle of having to pick between the same dishes all the time. 

Do you guys have any idea as to how I can fix this problem? 

Thanks",28Jul2019,1
289,"This is probably going to sound stupid, but it's starting to bother me a bit. There's this online game I play quite a lot, where the main aspects are exploration and friendship, and you walk and fly around wherever you want and all that good stuff. So a couple weeks back I met this guy - didn't talk a lot since he doesn't speak English that well, he unlocked chat with me (a feature in the game) right away. But after that it was literally like I'd adopted a lost puppy. He's an experienced player so I'm sure he doesnt need me to depend on. He has other in game friends so that can't be why either. Anyway, 99% of my online time is now spent with him, as he goes wherever I go, and often logs in whenever I do (or is already online). Im the kind of person that likes having company, but prefers to be alone too sometimes. I just don't know what to do but this.. I don't want to straight up tell him to stop being clingy, since he's always kind and patient and it would break my heart to make him sad. But this has come to the point where my other friends have grown pretty distant since I don't spend as much time with them, and I don't like it.

For some context I (26f), met my ex (25f) when I was sixteen and under very unusual circumstances (i very new to posting so I apologize, I can probably go further with that in the comments, I’m not sure). We started dating two years later (it was a long distance), and that went on for 4.5 years. After we broke up we tried to keep a friendship, because we still very much cared about one another, but someone added her out of the blue on Snapchat about 2-3 years ago, and she became very distant, and when I would call it out, it was always that I was fussing, or trying to argue, and she’s never try to see where I was coming from. A few months ago she invited me in a trip, and me still having feelings for her and love for her, I decided to go (it was a very selfish move on my end to go, but i still did it). On that trip she had it in her mind that we would have been intimate, she asked me for a kiss before I boarded my flight back home and I said no (because I knew she didn’t feel the same way for me the way I felt for her), but she asked again and I did. I probably read into it too much, because if felt like we were moving into the direction of a reconciliation, but when I mentioned it she said no, and I was upset, probably not rightfully so. She said we would have been intimate, but I was scared of her. The reality of that is I wasn’t scared, I didn’t want to be inmate with someone I knew didn’t feel for me like I did for her, and said to me we’d never get together ever again. It almost seemed like she thought it would happened because I was familiar and all of our sexual encounters prior to that was all tech based. I’ve tried since February to keep in touch, and she constantly ghost me, and only pops up at her own convenience, and she always finds a way to bring up the new guy(30) she is talking to into it, and when I say I don’t like that please don’t do that, she goes ghost again because she thinks I’m bad mouthing him, and when I go away and give myself some time to try to heal she says I’m popping up, or saying that she doesn’t talk to me because I think she is this or that type of person.  I just feel lost, and I honestly don’t even know what to do anymore, I feel like when I react negatively I’m just feeding into that negative outlooks she’s told me I’ve had for the last few years, and that’s all I’ve been given, we’ve never been able to sit down and talk without it turning into a fight or her telling me how bad of a person I am.

also, this is about platonic friendships. by the wording, it may look like a relationship kind of thing, but it’s not.      

for a lot of time, a certain girl took interest in me. she would often help me, and my teacher also told me to try and be friends with her as she wanted to be friends with me. i tried to treat her back with kindness most of the time, but i accidentally said something (it was not a big deal apparently to her when i apologized after class was over and she continued to be very kind to me). that something will be important later on. things went on, she continued being very kind and my parents continuously told me to hang out with her (as friends). i also developed a crush on her, but i decided to put my feelings away as she didn’t share the same feeling towards me (and i already knew that, don’t ask me how. i didn’t ask her out).         

 eventually i decided to finally do it. i asked her to hang out (as friends) over text. she replied saying ‘look, i appreciate everything, it’s just that the one thing you said’ (that certain thing was two months ago from her text) ‘made me feel horrible, so i don’t want to keep in touch with you, sorry’. 
what?! but you literally took interesting in me the /entire year/!  i believe that she just toyed with my emotions for the fun of it. how else would she simply decide she doesn’t want to be friends any longer? gossip spreads quickly and many gossip in my school, so i assume she has now painted a horrible picture of me. i cry a lot and my reputation is already shit. i have 0 friends.

all of a sudden, some other girls took interest in me. my parents are advising me to try and hang out with them. this time, i’m unsure. i’m trying to focus on myself and my studies more now, and i really don’t need my mental health to be any worse. what should i do? are my parents right? i’m already busy trying to focus on myself and my grades. i don’t need more drama or someone who i put my heart into just for them to throw me out like a useless toy.",28Jul2019,1

But lately she's been acting different, it's obvious she has a crush on me now and I've been seeing lots of red flags lately that I couldn't understand until suddenly it hit me, she's literally a ""nice guy/incel"" but with boobs and lesbian. She's been crossing lots of boundaries lately, from making cringe low-key sexual comments on my Facebook to sending her friends texts insinuating we have cyber sex or some crap like that when everything we've done has been either sharing shitty screenshots of hentai with bad anatomy because as artists that's hilarious, or having normal conversations about contraceptives like everyone does.

It's absolutely cringe, she's become clingy, she texts me a lot, she makes me uncomfortable and even if I inmediately stop her and tell her something makes me uncomfortable when she crosses a boundary, she'll find a new one to cross eventually. It's annoying, but I can't suddenly cut a friendship with someone I've been texting and videocalling two years. Still, I feel she's started crossing boundaries and kind of betraying our friendship so I don't know...

Well my teacher was obviously against the whole LGBT thing and said things like ""gays are sick in the head"" and ""gays will never be men"". Anyways that caused most of the class to argue with him and mostly angered this one female friend of mine who spoke up against him. She ended up reporting him which I understood. I have nothing against anyone from the LGBT community but I did find it disrespectful for my teacher to have said what he said during class.

Now this is the part where I'm against her because I feel that my teacher has every right to he able to think that about gays. The only problem I had with him is that he said his thoughts to the class. And it really annoyed me how my friend just wanted to change the way he thinks. So I'm in the wrong for believing my teacher could think what he wants. Or is my friend for trying to change the way he thinks just because she disagrees with him?",28Jul2019,2
301,"I'm curious so I'm tempted to ask something along the lines of ""Would you ever date me?"" I think that's scummy of me for a few reasons though.

* I'm not actually looking for a relationship. To be honest I've never even had one and I don't think it's a good idea
* It makes it seem like I don't appreciate the dear friendships I already have. I really value them so I don't want to ask something superficial like that.
* The final thing is that the question comes from a place of self-insecurity (which, trust me I've noticed). It might be extra rude of me to ask a question like that just because I don't have self confidence.

304,"Exactly 1 week ago from the time I'm typing this three men decided to break into my home with guns. It was 2:00 AM and I was deeply asleep because it was a long day. My parents work the nightshift together at a factory not too far from where we live, so it's usually me (17 years old), my younger sister (10 years old), and my older sister (20 years old) who are home. My youngest sister was away with her father for the weekend, leaving me and my older sister in the house. 

I woke up to my bedroom door being kicked in and a man standing at the doorway pointing a gun at me yelling commands to stand up and get on the living room floor. I thought I was dreaming for a few seconds, but I quickly threw up hands and walked past him to lie on the living room floor. He was broad and shorter than me with a deep voice, and reeked of marijuana. I planted my head to the floor, too afraid to look at them, but I heard the shouts and cries of my older sister being dragged from her bed by one of the other guys. The guy who was with me put the gun to the back of my head and said, ""Tell me where the money or the safe is and I won't shoot you in the head"". I quickly told him, ""I don't know, we don't have any money"". I could hear the third guy trying to bust into my parents room, because they usually have their room locked when they leave for work. He then asked me who was home, and I told him only me and my sister, or so I thought. I heard my sister crying from down the hall and that's when I heard gunshots with the sound of my front door opening as well. It was dead quiet and I laid on the floor thinking they had shot and killed my sister. Until I look up and see my stepdad come out from his room with his gun telling us to hide in the bathroom and call 911. We were saved by him.

What had happened was the burglars broke into our backdoor by shattering the glass with a rock (I didn't wake up to this). My stepfather didn't work that night, but I was unaware of this. The burglars tried to gather my family up in the living room to begin taking things. I believe it was supposed to be only a robbery, but as one of the guys saw my stepdad with a gun he fired shots at him and my stepdad fired back. No one was hit and burglars fled from our house. 

It's been a week since this happened and I cannot sleep. I'm paranoid that they will come back and try to finish what they started. We've recently installed a security system with multiple cameras but this doesn't help me sleep. How can I overcome this and sleep normally again?",28Jul2019,1
305,"Recently I’ve gotten close to this one girl, let’s say her name is Natalie. I met her around the end of June, we joined this group called Jr League, jr league is basically just a group of kids 18 and younger and we volunteer for our church. So I met Natalie in the group thing and right when I laid my eyes on her I knew liked her. She is beautiful and my type, then later that day I talked to her and I fell even harder, she is also really funny and great at talking (which is kinda hard these days for kids like us, 16 btw). We were preparing and fixing things for the Fourth of July and the bonding and teamwork brought me and Natalie real close. I thought she liked me back by the way she acted towards me and how she always wanted to be with me and things she said to me and whatever. We became best friends, we talk and send each other memes every day but we really never talked about feelings and relationship except this one time where she said that she doesn’t wanna date because it would block her view with school and growing closer to God which is definitely acceptable for me. We have and had so much fun volunteering together and just getting closer every time we meet and she makes me really happy, like a happy I’ve never felt before and that is addicting. I don’t know if I love her maybe just strongly like idk but it is very strong. We mostly met every day or other day for church and other things but I haven’t seen her in a while until today. She wore the same shirt and coincidentally another guy was wearing the same shirt, I didn’t really care much but we went to our church service and we go in with our jr league group but she went with that guy, he is taller, good-looking, and funny. After the service she kinda ignored me and I noticed something weird between those two and we all left. She texted me and said that he was cute and developed a crush for him. She said she was all giddy and talked about him and he joined the Jr league group chat and she texted all weird and wasnt not herself. That broke my heart, like I’ve broken up with girls but it never felt as bad as with Natalie and we weren’t even dating. I really thought she liked me back and we’d have a future together but after today not anymore. It is kinda weird because I’m happy that she is happy. Maybe I’m nice? Or love? Idk.

I recently attended a small private event and got to meet a 
musician that I really like. He was super nice and down to earth, overall very normal dude. When it was my turn to meet him I was nervous so I took a photo with him said thanks and walked away. This would’ve been fine but everyone else was taking their time with him and chatting to him. 

I understand that me talking or not talking to him doesn’t really effect him in any way, shape or form, but I still felt oddly guilty about it? Like I treated him less like a person and more like a selfie robot. 

In an attempt to make up for this I dm’d him a rather long message on instagram thanking him for hosting the event and being so nice, and how much I enjoyed it etc. 

Now, he’s kind of got of a rep for being a self proclaimed “nice” guy (but to me he doesn’t act in an incel way, so- valid.) And the chances of actually accessing him via dm seem feasible. That being said my message might also come across as putting a relatively normal dude on a pedestal, and in general might read just a bit cringe? 

What advice would you offer to someone who somewhat regrets their interaction with a celebrity they admire while simultaneously is mildly embarrassed with the possibly he might read a cringey dm trying to make up for it?

First I tried to laugh it off when he hit on me, but later I realized I would not be able to handle it if things would go a bit too far.

319,"So two weeks ago I had this training session with a group of people, lasted one week. I had no idea who they were, and as there were only 6 of us and this was a very intense and full time thing, we were together all the time. We were together in the classroom, we were together on breaks, lunchtime, etc etc. 

On the very first day I had lunch with two guys. Apparently we hit it off right away as the three of us are all in our 20s. (the other group was all in their 40s, so they formed a sub group too). Meaning we had lunch everyday for the past week and talked all the time. We also exchanged numbers. 

On the last day we went out for drinks when the training was over. It was honestly a lot of fun, as the three of us were much more relaxed, given how the week was over. The last day was particularly stressful. 

The next day I created a group on a social network. We exchanged 2-3 sentences per person. 

One week has gone by and we've exchanged, maximum, 10-12 sentences total. 

Given how much we talked during that week, to be honest I expected much more conversation. A few days ago I asked if they wanted to go somewhere, it was pretty inconclusive as one of them didn't answer me anymore, but the other one explained how he had plans.

I know it's only been a week, I know some people aren't very chatty online, but... I really wish we would remain friends. I feel it was mostly convenience, or maybe they don't like me that much...

Heres an story...
At the end of my school year in 2018, at the end I befriended someone in my class. Let’s call him Tyler for privacy reasons. Tyler had an interest in my friend, let’s say Jessie. I told him I could help him, as I knew she was interested in him too. He started getting really intense about it, saying that if it did not work out, he would kill himself. I couldn’t persuade him otherwise, so I, with the weight of his life on my shoulders got them together by the end of that summer. He also played a small part in getting me and my ex together. I was super happy for them. Jessie had wronged me before, a previous ex had cheated on me with her before and she lied to me about it for a month. (Only he apologized, not her. I am on good terms with that ex now, in fact we’re best friends!) But i decided that i no longer cared and just wanted to help anyways. About a month after I got together with the ex I was helped with, I met my current boyfriend of 6 months (we’ll call him Joseph) and realized my real feelings, so broke up with him (once again, this ex also on good terms as well.) In september was when i realized my feelings for my boyfriend, keep this in mind. Around october, i started to become a bit dependent on Tyler. I get that it’s not always a great thing to be a super dependent friend, but I couldn’t help it. I just really needed a friend at the time and for a couple days too i thought i had feelings for him but in reality i was just confused and sad, i had no one to talk to. Tyler tended to make plans to hangout with me, then the day of would ditch me for his girlfriend. This made me really mad for the sole fact that he could have just told me prior and i would have been totally fine with it. Just a “hey, i can’t hangout that day. I agreed to hangout with Jessie, maybe another day?” would have been nice. I have had anger issues and problems with lashing out since my dad was not easy to get along with. I got them from him. I always make my friends aware of this and tell them if i ever become overdramatic and really angry and lash out to not take me seriously. I always apologize after i cool down too. But he was not an exception anymore. I got tired of trying to be friends with someone who didn’t give a shit. So after about the second half of october was over, I went and hung out with Joseph and my other friend whom I met him from, who will be called Henry. I agreed with Henry years prior that when we went to the same school, i’d hang out with him and his friends (like joseph). Finally i decided to follow through with that promise to join a group of friends where i don’t always feel alone and isolated, and it was a great decision. In January I got together with Joseph, and found that Henry had gotten himself the sweetest girlfriend ever too. I was really happy at this point. In around november was when i started completely cutting off contact with Tyler. I realized I couldn’t depend on someone like him, so i stopped. I realized he didn’t want to hangout anymore, so i stopped. I realized he didn’t even bother to try to talk anymore, so i ceased that too. We drifted apart and i was honestly fine with it. He was happy and i was happy so it didn’t even phase me anymore. Around february, he harassed me in a small discord server owned by the ex i broke up with in september. He started to point out ridiculous things and thought that insulting me endlessly would get me somewhere. It hurt at first, but then i realized that he was a crap friend anyways. He only hungout with me if he wanted drugs, was sad about something with jessie, or wanted me to buy him food from safeway. I just banned him from the server because he was being batshit crazy. I blocked him everywhere and that was that. A couple months later my friends started telling me more and more that tyler was telling everyone i liked him, i tried to break him and jessie up, get jessie to hate him, and that i used people for my own gain because i was selfish. I had no idea what i did, besides distance myself because it was clear he did not want to be friends anymore. He started telling others that i threatened to kill myself if he kept ditching me. What i actually said was, “if you keep doing this i’m just gonna give up.” By this i meant giving up on being friends with him. But i kept giving him the benefit of the doubt till i got sick of it and went to henry. I honestly just blew it off, thinking he was being petty. I didn’t want to be someone forcing friends to take sides, so i just told them to tell me if he ever said anything again, and that it was fine if they wanted to stay friends. It kept happening more and more and i messaged him the following around May(?) “Stop fucking with my friends. They tell me everytime you say something. Just get over it i know you have better things to do.” This didn’t work. Then again in june, this time i told jessie to tell him to stop because i knew everything he was saying was a lie and so did my friends. I knew his attempts to get my friends to turn on me were failing, but it was just a headache to hear this every few days. July. Henry messages me saying tyler messaged his girlfriend, asking her to help him in getting revenge on me for things i never even did... he claimed now that i also had feelings for him, but once i failed to try to break him and jessie up, i went to hang out with henry and try for joseph. She played along for a bit to get information, and it was all just delusional bullshit. He said he wanted to turn henry against me first because he thinks that henry is “the leader of the group” or something stupid like that. It was just the same repetitive lies over and over that he already used. I messaged jessie now to tell him to just stop it. She said she would send the message and i assumed she did. Then of course... it still continued. My friend for the past 7 years, let’s call him Daniel got super pissed. So did my old ex (the one who cheated) and they were trying to resort to physical “solutions,” or, violence. I said no for obvious reasons. Tyler is the one acting like a child here. Instead, Daniel messaged his mom telling her what’s going on and asking to talk about it, maturely. I figure tyler got in trouble or something, because someone with an unknown caller id called him back telling him to back off and that tyler won’t stop. “Well then either he stops or i call the police.” That was the last thing daniel was able to say, because after hearing that they hung up suddenly. We haven’t figured out who called back, but i messaged jessie once more. She refused to get involved whatsoever. I told her i understand not wanting to be in drama, but this is her boyfriend and I don’t see how she’s okay with this going on for 6 months now. I told her i realized that he did not want to do all these things anymore, so i stopped. And that he should realize what i want to stop, and stop too, then blocked her as soon as she read it. I told her to get herself and him out of my life prior to saying the last part. 
Tyler just doesn’t stop and I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. Yes, I still have all my friends and Joseph, but it seriously never ends, you’d figure after half a year someone would stop being petty and spreading lies about you. What should i do..?",28Jul2019,1

We did the usual sexual show and tell thing at the beginning of the relation, discussed body count and expectations and boundaries. We’ve always been super open. 

Recently he gave me his laptop for work because mine broke and he was working from home that day. 

I opened the search history and found a lot of violent porn. A LOT. Stuff that was really degrading to women and really physically violent and unlike anything he’s ever talked about with me or expressed interest in. Rape stuff, torture stuff, etc... It really freaked me out.

I brought it up with him and he basically said “I’m sorry I forgot to refresh my swatch history. I didn’t mean for you to see that. I watch that kind of porn because I’d never want to put you through that. So I keep that part of my sex drive separate from you.” 

I’m still worried about it. We’d been talking about getting engaged.

326,"Hi, everyone. Just letting you know I'm on mobile, so this might suck but it's a doozy.

So, pretty much starting little over two years ago, my cousin (20F) has been coming to me for her problems and usually I wouldn't mind, but it drags me down hardcore. I started dating my now husband (27M) that time and I could tell she liked him from the beginning (which was weird as she had a fiancé but was away for the Marines). Anyway, she constantly needed my attention or tried to get his attention.

I'd say the worst time was when she came to my work and started cutting herself in the parking lot. I felt bad, but at this point I couldn't take it anymore. I called her sister that she was living with and asked her if she could do something. All the while, she was messaging my husband (boyfriend at the time) and saying how she needed to talk to him and blah blah blah. He ended up not messaging her because he was in the shower or something. Later on, she ended up in the hospital where she would be later going to a mental health facility for her problems. She said she was going to leave at 2 am so me being the nice person, FaceTimed her to make sure she was okay. She then started blamed my now husband for her cutting herself when she only knew him for 3 days. 

Some other instances were she threatened to put herself into a car wreck because he didn't hug her long enough. She started bawling whenever he told her that he was there to hang out with me, not her. We were even all hanging out at a park one night and she decided to invite my abusive, cheating ex over there and said she was going with me which caused me to have a panic attack because I have PTSD from past abusive relationships. She just goes overboard with shit and its too much on me.

Now she's at it again because her boyfriend of however many months broke up with her (her marine dude left her) but I work a full time job and haven't been getting a great amount of sleep because I've been too stressed. My car's not working and my house almost caught fire while I was sleeping and she thinks that my attention should all go to her. She's constantly blowing my phone up.

335,"Background: I knew this girl, let's call her Entitled Friend for 7 years and had what I thought was a best friend relationship    turns out I was wrong and just ignored all the red flags because I was alone. After 3 or 4 years of knowing each other she had a kid at the age of 16 or 17 and let me tell you she was not ready. I gave her unless support when everyone else left her, giving her a place to sleep and eat not just that but she would / still does leave her kid at her mom's for days just to party and get drunk. I'm not patty type and stay at my house while she lies to her boyfriend, mom and sister that's with me when in reality she's cheating, parting and doing drugs. I let this slide since she was my ""best friend"" and would always guilt me to help her.

&amp;#x200B;

Now where our friendship started to faded, she would just call me to crash at my mom, eat my food and then she would go back to ignoring me when her other friends would come. I noticed this and started to grow distant since I knew I was being used. 

One day my grandma called saying she was sick and needed money my family didn't have much so I did what I could and wanted to sell my clothes, I told this to E.F. and she couldn't care less. I told her what I wanted to do which her eyes lighted up and said to give her the clothes and she would sell it for me since she knows more people than I do. Flag Number One. my dummy self gave her my clothes, $150 with of new and good clothes, (I shop online so I get a lot of stuff for cheap).

Days later I asked her about it and she said some people had stole it from her but that she would pay me back.

I was sad but I understood, bad things happen and I only cared about her safety. A year and Half passes by and E.F. is more selfish and entitled letting and I notice she is starting to wear the clothes that people ""stole"" from her, I let I pass for now. anyways her kid which btw I love him but he is brat at almost 3 years old and does whatever he wants, she doesn't spend time with him but posts things to make her look like the good mom she isn't but besides that he doesn't even know how to say a single word, not to compare because every kids is different but I have nephew that's a year younger than her kid and he can some what form good enough sentences that we understand him but her kid only screams and gets mad to the point of punching people if he doesn't get his way so she lets him. 

E.F. has a boyfriend let's call him Buttface since that's what he is, he has cheated, hit and kicked her out of the houses they have been together since her mom kicked her out, he also hits the kid so bad when E.F. took off his shirt after spilling juice on himself I could see the bruises kid had and his back... oh his poor back looked so whipped that it made me shiver also Buttface gets drunk and does drugs in front of kid, from weed to coke. one day Buttface and E.F dropped kid at my house without giving me a heads up when I already had plans, but after I looked at kid I canceled everything this kid looked so drugged out when I looked up and saw E.F. I lost all respect I had for her, I think she knew because she simply said, 

E.F: ""Don't look at me like that, he was being a brat and we wanted some alone time so we smoked him out just a little. so don't get mad it was just weed.""

Buttface looked mad and I rolled my eyes, I should've called the cops, I should've call CPS but I remembered an old friend that was apart of the system and was raped by his foster dad so I gave him food, and let him nap. I was so mad not because I had to cancel plans but because she did this to her kid.

The next Monday ... yes it took her a whole weekend to get her kid from my house, she was mad and hungover wearing a sweater and jeans from the clothes that were stolen a year and half ago I asked her about it and she was more mad. yelling at me for not being a real friend and just giving her my clothes, I told her I needed the money but that wasn't good enough for her, she shoves me while yelling at me about how selfish I am and that that's why everyone talks bad about me.. I was hurt but more mad that she had stolen from me, used me and my family to get food and a place to sleep, and for letting buttface abuse kid. I yelled at her and told her to pay me back since she would brag about selling coke and weed and having so much money she said no and that I only wanted attention since I was the ugly friend and she was the hot one.  I told her I rather be ugly than being know as the girl who did a gang bang at a party with 5 dudes.... let's just say that didn't end good.

&amp;#x200B;

now E.F doesn't want to pay me back, and is still with buttface.... I don't want kid to ended up like them... but I'm also scared what might happen to kid if I call CPS on them",28Jul2019,1

Not sure if this is the right place, but about a month ago I commissioned an artist on DeviantArt to do a custom digital art commission for me.

I paid 50% upfront as a deposit, and stupidly picked ""friends and family"" which I had been using for other artists who I work regularly with.

He's been very difficult to maintain contact with and has been ignoring the last couple weeks worth of emails / messages through the site.

I realise that as I used a non service payment form, I really don't have any case through PayPal to chargeback the money as far as I know, the amount was $65 so it's not the end of the world but still sucks on principle to be potentially scammed.

What kind of approach can I take and should I even bother?

The girl I love is Bi and dating a girl.
We both share very common likes and are very connected mutually 

BACK STORY 
So I've known this girl for almost a year and let's call her A.
Anne has shown trust towards me and she always been the girl who wanted to hang out and ether smoke weed or drink with me or just do normal things such as play games and talk a lot about really anything! 

But sometimes we have this thing where we both just never bother to keep the talking and social aspect together and just have this sort of radio silence, but then when we see each other we alway agree we need to see each other more and more. 

STORY
So after a house party me and A with some friends went for a walk leaving the party we are walking towards the beach together as everyone  else trails behind  us (MENTION) A's girlfriend  is behind us, as we're walking we stop by the sand drinking and smoking as per usual with us, it's starting to get late and almost everyone decided  to start heading home. 
Everyone but me and A were left, so she jokes about going to Tim Hortons, a respectable coffee  brand in Canada! But I complain about it being to far away so she reluctantly suggested going to her place around 12:50 pm.
We arrive at her place while I'm looking around I noticed  she's being very sneaky and quiet to ensure her parents don't wake up, when we get inside we are welcomed to her cats at the door, steadily trying to get 100 sneak we get to the balcony and talk and smoke a little bit more.
After awhile being bait for the bugs we go inside to her room to sit down and talk a little more after awhile she asked if I wanted to play MarioCart Double Dash on the GameCube, of course  I said yes in a very drunken state.
What seemed like house of playing turned to me just losing every race to every race so from the things I learned, I'm horrible at racing.
After getting  my assignment kicked to bots and a girl we went back to her room and just went to the bed and relaxed, by now it's like 3:30 am and we're both pretty tired but haven't said anything. I noticed her just getting into bed and laying there, as I did the same we both just doze off.
2 hours past and I wake up to A shaking me telling  me to wake up, I ask what the time was and then I was like ""oh shit"" at that point I'm thinking damn bruh, so A starts leading me to the front door looking very tired and worried.
With out many words I say ""I guess I'll see you later?"" She said ""yeah and then ""bye"". 

So I'm just flustered with thoughts and it's been difficult to do anything, as we both said before ""if we were to do anything  like that, it would ruin to many good things with many friends.",28Jul2019,1

I always feel very down after reading their messages but I sort of need to stay in the group chat in case someone posts something related to the house or something. I don't know what to do, I want to help my depressed friend but at the same time it's something I'm not good at helping with. I thought maybe I could suggest making a 'vent' chat group that's specifically for sending those sorts of messages? I'm afraid they will take it the wrong way though and think I dislike them/think their venting is bad (which isn't true - I'm happy they feel safe speaking their true feelings in the group chat, but they do it constantly and it's wearing everyone down a bit, almost nobody chats in there any more).

352,"Warning!!! This is a bit long and English isn't my first language so you can just look at the TLDR at the bottom😁





I was going to give a post asking advice for my small fantasy novel I am righting but seeing all the advice over life, I thought about giving this post instead!

Ever since I was a small kid i felt that living was something mentally draining to do, interacting with people and going into rhythm was easy but keeping it was defecult.

I always had defeculty studying because I wouldn't sit and continue studying, rather I would move around even though I understand most topics really fast....things caught up and i started alienating most of my friends even though i knew a large amount of them for most of my life, I wasn't the popular kid or I  the popular group in school but I was well known by everybody and I would  hang out with whatever group I felt like hanging out with but I wouldn't connect with them deeply.

I can make friends fairly easily but I wouldn't keep in touch with them for long even if we became close friends, relationships wouldn't last long as even though I would love her very much I wouldn't be able to always constant connection with somebody for long periods of time as it is mentally draining!

That isn't the biggest problem as I have come to get used to it but what hits me the hardest is when I try to do any positive change or even negative, a voice....which is more like a feeling which tells me to stop and not do it, procrastination is literally killing me and keeping me alive at the same time!

I didn't know how much of a problem it is until I went to university, I made sure to be proactive in all my studies, and new friends I made.....and everything went great, I got to make many friends, my grades where almost full and I never missed a class BUT half way through my second term I got hit by a major wave of mental exhaustion!!! I was awake and asleep most of the time but I couldn't tell how much I was asleep or awake, I couldn't get out of my bed to go to, go out with friends, eat or even go to the bathroom. 

Everything went downhill until I got hit by rock button's older brother! I had to redo the year after a huge amount of guilt do to waisting my parents money and shame for failing there trust in me.

I was already suicidal by the time I had that major low but by the time I had to tell my parents I failed the year, I was already counting my days until I end it all. THANKFULLY, procrastination hit me again but this time to delay committing suicide....

Either way my parents gave me another chance, and I toke it. This time with more conviction I strove to fix my mistakes BUT AGAIN lo and behold by the end of the second term that low hit me again, this time with the added bonus of insomnia YAY!!!!

And by the time I was ready to tell my parents I failed the year again, i was ready to just stick a knife in my throat and end it.....i didn't want to see my parents suffer because of me, what kills me more is how supportive they where when I told them a bit about my issues, yet still procrastination stopped me for capitalising on the help I am given, I am stopping my self from getting help. Now I am in another problem which drove me into suicidal thoughts even now.


I know my issues might not be big but the issues are all originating from me and I try to fix them, my body gives me the gift of turning me into a vegetable, even though I know I won't kill my self in the next few days  I don't see a future for my self in a couple months time.



TLDR: I faced problems in mental health and everytime I try to fix it, my body reacts negatively. Also my procrastination is closing myself from anybody around me and any help that I can sustain over time...",28Jul2019,1

All I have to do is get a temp job and raise about $700 or so for gas and the paperwork to become a Canadian citizen.  But then I did something fucking stupid. I told my psychotic controlling mother that I was about to start looking for a job so I could do that. That weekend my keys went missing.  It's been four weeks. Every week she swears up and down she's going to replace my keys that she ""lost,"" but every week something mysteriously comes up and stops her from doing that, and every time I bring it up she screams at me.

I have to sleep with ear plugs because any little noise at night scares the holy shit out of me, waking me up because I think it's her screaming and slamming doors again. Aside from that, this is his house and she doesn't have a car of her own. If he throws us out, we're not only homeless, I won't even have a fucking car to live in because she won't replace my keys.

357,"Hello!

So, I guess I should start off by saying that I've got Borderline Personality Disorder, and (Psychotic) Major Depressive Disorder, two disorders for which I am currently undergoing treatment (medication, and therapy, both DBT and CBT). However, I was only recently diagnosed with these disorders after a suicide attempt (got sectioned, referred to an emergency mental health team etc). The suicide attempt was triggered by my best friend deciding that he didn't want to have me around anymore, and he just left. Along with this friend, every other friend did too, upon recieving the news that I was mentally ill/unstable.

Now, this friend didn't just leave because he didn't like me, or because he got bored. I used to be so afraid and fearful of him abandoning me/leaving, that I would essentially control a lot of his social life (I would argue with him if he was to go out without me, threaten him. If he was to say anything which I could somehow construe as him wanting to leave me, I would begin to argue, become upset, cry, angry, etc etc). I never meant to be so manipulative, and to be honest, I didn't really know I was being like it until he left and I went into therapy. Anyway, he decided enough was enough (which is completely understandable) and told me to get out of his life. I responded by calling him, breaking down on the phone, just crying and wailing. I then decided that the best course of action would be to overdose, so I combined benzos with opiates in the hope that it would cause respiratory depression. However, I got taken to A&amp;E. My attempt was a failure, and I was taken to a mental hospital for assessment. I had another best friend, too, but I would also be the same kind of person with him. Just so fucking afraid that he would leave, that I would make frantic efforts to not let that happen (but these efforts just made things worse, it's ironic). The first friend, after recieving the news that I was overdosing, told his parents. I've been in contact with his parents recently, and they forgive me, and understand the situation (basically, they don't mind if we were to become friends again), but, the friend, is pretty angry and upset about it all, which again, is understandable. As for the other friend, their parents weren't too happy to talk to me, and didn't. They've decided that they don't want me around their son ever again, something which I respect and will abide by. Of course, other friends found out, and they left, leaving me with absolutely no-one to talk to, to spend time with, or to confide in (apart from my therapist).

It's so shit that this happened at all, but even worse that it happened in Summer. I had bought tickets to go to festivals with them, we had a ton of stuff planned, alas, such plans will never come to fruition, and I had to refund the tickets. If I go on social media now, I can see pictures of my friends at parties, events etc, seemingly very happy, and I can't help but question if their happiness is a result of my absence. Just hurts, and I wish I could be given a second chance. This whole thing has acted as a catalyst for me to get professional help, which I am, but I'm afraid that even if I do get better (which I feel I am), I'll never have my best mates again, and such a feeling induces suicidal ideation. If it wasn't for family being upset and possibly ruined by it, I would've taken my own life by now without question. I simply do not want to be here anymore, not without my mates.

Apart from therapy, I don't really know what to do. I've been told that ""time is a healer"", so I'm completely avoiding these people for a while, in the hopes that it will smooth things over. I just really fucking hope that come the end of the Summer, I'm allowed a second chance to prove to my friends the person I will become. What do I do, guys? What do you all make of this situation? And before you say anything about it, yes, I take \*full\* accountability for my actions, and am not using my illness as an excuse as to why I manipulated these people. A reason for it, perhaps, but not an excuse. I am truly sorry to my friends about my past actions, and truly remorseful. I just hope they have mercy, and give me a second chance to prove myself. I'm getting better for me, but I'm also getting better in the hopes that I can have these great people back in my life again.

Any input would be appreciated, please be as detailed as possible.

359,"There is this girl, she is probably my only friend since I have social anxiety and kind of an introvert so making friends is very hard for me, i think we are pretty close since we share personal stuff together, and i really like that I have someone I can talk to.

a week ago she confessed to me that she likes me, I really didn't take it seriously and I just did an awkward laugh and changed the subject (she is a kind of girl that likes to joke around). She has been very different to me lately, we talk only when i initiate and i noticed that she is kind of avoiding me.

just a while ago, her friends told me that she is waiting for an answer, apparently because i didn't reject nor accept her confession. (this is the first time for me)

School is coming up, and we go to the same university, I don't want to be awkward with her and I just really want to focus on my studies for now. 

Please help",28Jul2019,2
361,"(Formatting due to mobile!)

Background: Right! So I am currently in my gap year of college (because fuck college) and have been working 2 jobs for the past 4 months (Starbucks and movie theater). I work about 75 hours a week, mainly opening at Starbucks 5 days a week (5 AM to 1 PM) and closing at the movie theater 5 days a week (5 PM to 12 AM). The only thing keeping me sane is that I have every Saturday off to rest and recover before starting again. (For that first month of two jobs I literally had no full day off from both jobs and it was complete madness). 

Problem: I’ve been at my first job of Starbucks (in a Kroger at that) for 2 years and I’m completely sick of it. Management, co-workers, just the attitude of the customers in that area.. yeah I want out. It’s like 45 minutes away from me anyway so like.. nah. Problem! Would love love love to just quit (meaning put in my two weeks) and just walk away without looking back, but I turn 21 September 7th (about 6 weeks from now) and to celebrate my parents are taking me to Disney world. Great! I’ve never been and it’s gonna be exciting! 

Why it’s a problem: While I can handle my bills with only my second job for a brief moment, if I’m trying to save as much money as possible for this big trip then that is not doable. I can’t have just one job while trying to save up. Also, I highly doubt I can get hired that quickly  for another job while also saying, “oh yeah I need 2 weeks off like right away.” I mean sure, I could totally just not spend much money and just enjoy the sights and sounds but.. nope! You only turn 21 once and who knows if I’ll have the time or money to go again before I’m 30. 

Thus! I am absolutely trapped at the job I definitely hate. I’m completely trapped! The one friend I had at my job just put in her two weeks in since she got a really good job at a school and I really don’t know if I can handle  it without her. I had a moment of panic the other morning when I was talking it out with her and realized how truly fucked I was. How absolutely mouse trapped I was.

Thanks for reading the rant! Happy days, ya’ll. ✌️✨",28Jul2019,1
362,"Hi everyone,

Never posted about anything like this before, just not sure where else I can turn and I feel as though I need to vent:

I used to be addicted to cannabis, to the point where I would smoke around 3/4 grams per day and spend about £400 a month on it. I would never have enough money for food for the month, or I would put weed in front of seeing family; basically weed would always come first. 

I knew I had to change, so 2 months ago I went cold turkey and I've not touched it since. I feel so much better in myself but the problem is my friendship group (who I used to smoke with) now barely text me and nobody seems bothered about meeting with me anymore. I've just bought my first new house and not one of them has offered to come round or anything.

I feel as though I've already lost them as friends, I understand that they still smoke daily and that's *all* they do, but it feels horrible knowing that I literally have no friends anymore. 

I hope to start making new friends, but atm I'm finding it difficult and I do feel lonely especially on weekends. I've got a wonderful girlfriend which I live but I miss the time with the lads so much. But I'm not gonna force them to see me and I'm definitely not gonna sound needy. 

Tbh I don't even know what I want from this post, I guess just someone to speak to or someone who's been through something similair, maybe how to deal with having no friends.

TL;DR I stopped smoking weed because I became severely addicted to it - now my closest friends don't speak to me/do stuff without me. They all smoke weed daily and aren't interested in anything else.",28Jul2019,2

Almost every night, there is a car that stops in front of my house. Either near the mailbox or in front of the trees near the property line. But, tonight was different. They stopped in the same place. My light was on so I quickly turned it off. Then, they POSITIONED THEIR CAR TO FACE THE HOUSE. Recap: they are in the middle of the street facing my house. They weren’t in a driveway because there was a fence behind them. They stayed like that for a minute. I tried to watch them but I was worried that they’d see me. They must’ve seen some cars come down my long road and then they drove off.

He dislikes many of his traits, and thinks if himself to be extremely boring, which I guarantee you, he's not (he just needs to be confident). He gets quiet around people, but wants to talk more, just doesn't know how. He finds that he is only sociable when he is drunk, and that he's always been like this his whole life. He has many friends, but he's just not socially confident, and can't have a proper conversation, as he finds it awkward, and feels as if ""it's like as if my brain shuts down."" The reason this could be so, is that he doesn't get much love at home.

378,"Hello. I'm new to this thread because I need help with this situation I'm in.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in Norway and I finished a semester of university here, and I'm headed back to the United States to continue my degree. But the thing is, I STILL have no idea what I want to do in life. I'll be a junior, and I used my first 2 years to complete my electives that all students take. So now, I have to take classes regarding my major. I get free tuition until I'm 25 (long story), so I need to figure this out soon or I'll have to start forking over some serious dough if I don't get my degree by the time I'm 25. I'll list things that I like and dislike and maybe someone can help me out with a possible career that might be good for me, because I'm clueless. But I don't want to spend my life working in retail. I want to live and work in Europe, and that's not really possible for Americans without some sort of degree. Unless I get married, of course. But dating in Europe is really difficult, in my experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Likes:

* Designing cities. Ever since I was little, I would always build my own little towns out of various household objects (legos, plastic containers, etc.) I also really like how the tram system is setup in Oslo (capital of Norway, where I've been living for the last 7 months) and I think it would be cool to design my own public transit system. Plus, does anybody else remember CityVille on Facebook??? I loved that game but was terrible at it because, like most games on Facebook, required you to pester your friends to advance. That, or pay real money, and ya boy broke!
* Fonts. I like looking at signs and observing the font. Some of my favorites are the classic Times New Roman, Calibri Light, Minion Pro, and Futura (in the Futura font, I hate the j, but otherwise that's it).
* Languages. I LOVE learning Norwegian, and I want to reach fluency, but while my vocabulary is HUGE (been learning for 4 years, and lived here for 7 months) and I can read and write almost fluently, I still am terrible at hearing the language and comprehending what's being said. I'm worried I'm one of those people who are just naturally bad at languages. But I still learn anyway because it's fun. It's more of a hobby.
* Travel. I've considered journalism, but travelling is expensive, and being a journalist and earning a decent income at the same time would need frequent travel. I want to travel throughout Europe. My bucket list has me spending a month in every European country, actually.
* Typing on the computer. I love typing and making guides for video games (Zelda fan here; I make my own guides instead of wasting money on guides made by other people). It lets me design it myself. And I usually enjoy typing essays because I like to see the different letter combinations. My favorite combinations are ""gg"" ""ll"" (ll especially if it's a seriff font like Times New Roman, as it's just satisfying to see those two letters next to each other), and pp, dd, and bb. I can go on forever with this one.
* House designing. My dream is to have my own, brand new apartment and have it designed to my liking. But, while I've thought of interior design, I really don't like to get my hands dirty. So I'm not a fan of painting walls, cutting wood beams, etc. And I remember being in my early teens and always playing house design games. I was a huge fan of Webkinz, for all of you who grew up in the early 2000s :)
* Animals. I love cats and all animals, but I don't know if I could be a vet. I more or less just like having them around. They're like people, but don't talk back!
* Symphonic metal. Evanescence, Nightwish, and Within Temptation are my favorite bands. But I like all genres, generally. Except that ghetto rap trash.

Dislikes:

* People. I've worked in retail, and while I've met tons of wonderful people, lots of customers are very entitled, and I hate dealing with Karens. Plus, I have little patience for people who think the customer is always right. Which, by the way, they're not. I also have a small friend group which I love, and I'm always down to meeting new people, but I'm cautious and skeptical at first to make sure they're not toxic. Very introverted.
* Math. I like algebra (what you do to one side, you do to the other), and can do mental math well, but as soon as we get into geometry and statistics, I'm out.
* Nature. I HATE hot weather. I get sticky, sweaty, cranky, the bugs are flying, and I get smelly. Not my cup of tea. Key destinations are Northern Europe, or Alaska. I HAVE to live in a cold climate. I'm from a small town in Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania heat in the summer is HOT and HUMID. I have a hard time in the summer. I like the woods in the winter, but I still don't like being bothered by insects, especially the bastards that like to suck your blood and give you lyme's disease. But snow is never an issue for me. The only inconvenience I could think of is having to deal with brushing off snow in the morning. But otherwise, bring it on! I like fall too, especially football season. But Spring and Summer can get lost.
* Sports. Not an athlete, never have been. Not much else to say here.
* Politics. There's nothing more toxic than the US government, or any government period. They're all corrupt and evil, pretty much. So I'll stay away from that.
* Children. I've thought about being maybe a language teacher, but nobody really wants to learn Norwegian, and I don't like children. Toddlers are obnoxious, teenagers have bad attitudes, and babies don't stop crying.

&amp;#x200B;

My ultimate goal in life is to make a lot of money for myself (I'm gay, so I'm not having kids), and I want a nice house, while at the same time travelling across Europe. I just don't know what career to get so I can accomplish this. I'm lost. There's a lot more, but this is turning into a book so I'm gonna stop here. All help is appreciated greatly!",28Jul2019,1
380,"I simply don’t know what to do.

I am currently studying abroad, in the country that I really reluctant to come. I chose to come here upon my parent’s suggestion which could lessen their financial burden. The reasons that I’ve never think of coming here to study is first because I have to learn their language, get C1 certificate in order to fulfil the language requirement from the local uni. I just didn't care and never think of learning this language. Second is I always passion for English since young thus surrounded in an English environment is always what I wanted. 

My parent have successfully convinced me to give it a try. I did it. I learn the language, pass the exam and get an admission to uni. (The language learning period was a nightmare that I wouldn’t want to recall back). At the end my motivation gradually dropped, I do not know what course to choose so I simply chose a course as it seems promising. The ultimate nightmare is the course subject is covered in the native language, I literally almost give up my life because it seems like I have no other choice but to accept the fate. Day after day, I’ve got seriously depressed and my motivation has gone to negative value, I feel my soul is draining me away but I just couldn’t do it anymore. It’s hard to study in a subject you are hardly passionate about and what worst is it is covered in the native language. I just didn’t like the language, not the way I love English. How funny it is that I’m willing to invest more time learning English myself rather than learning this native language. Plus I hardly have any friends and 9 days out of 10 I spend time all by myself. Part of the reason is this is a big city, the people you meet may be gone tomorrow and you may never see them anymore, they come and go and that’s why I didn’t really want to invest time on them. I do not smoke and drink alcohol because of alcohol allergic. On the other hand native here hardly speak English, I did speak their language to try to communicate but the conversation never lasted long, they don't seem interested to talk, I am just tired of translating my soul to everyone here. I love to get to know people and love to talk but it's all happened before I came here. I try to find myself a therapist however they are mostly cost a fortune to my budget. I think I’ve lost control of my current situation, I always thinking if there’s any way to get out of here… Few months ago I came across UX design, and it seems super interesting to me and I really want to learn it. But I don’t know if this is the right time to learn it. 

I am almost mentally broken at this point that’s why I am writing on reddit. TBH I do not regret coming here because I learnt how to settle things by myself and be super independence, I understand and know myself more and I believe I would be regret if I never give it a whirl however I just ended up didn’t like it. The things is, I never tell anyone about my problem I really don’t know how to tell my parent about this whole event. 
I always thinking is life just like that? Take classes, go uni because that's the norm, graduate, get a job... This is so linear and it annoyed me. I don’t know if because I’m having -the grass is always greener at the other side- mentality but I really need some advice. Thank you in advance. Cheers peeps.",28Jul2019,2

384,"Hello,

I am 20 years old and currently stuck in life. I am unsure where I want to go and what I should do. Ever since I was middle school, gaming was a huge part of my life. I have been bullied and made fun of, my confidence was at an all time low, and the only place I could find peace was playing video games. I used to be a ""hardcore' gamer. I would spent more than 12 hours a day just playing games, sometimes not going to school just so I can play a few more hours in a competitive ladder in Counter Strike 1.6 and later on to play Dota 2. I knew I was a wreck, but I didn't care. Eventually, it all dawned on me, and I realised I wasn't going to make it anywhere. I started getting more and more angry at the games I was playing, and eventually I decided to call it quits.

&amp;#x200B;

It wasn't until I tried to get back into my competitive side of video games that I realized how much even a short break can impact your performance. I wasn't going to go PRO, I was getting angry over nothing, I was just above average, and it was not enough to justify the time I was putting into the games I was playing and decided it's time to focus on myself, to stop pretending that what was wrong with me didn't exist. I started taking better care of myself, I started getting new hobbies and focused on doing good in school. I passed my first year of college without issues, got myself a good paying job, I started going to the gym and getting obsessed with it, I was living life. I would come home, theorize on what should I improve next, and at best get a 1 hour of gaming in some MMO/single player game, just to get me bored enough to get to sleep. It seemed great, right? I had a mindset to become a better, functional adult.

&amp;#x200B;

It wasn't until a few months ago, when this new game came out. It's an FPS and at first it didn't interest me. A friend of mine talked me into trying it out and I started playing it a bit more often, to see if I can get into it... and I did. I started getting the same adrenaline rush I was getting before while playing Dota and CS. I was playing since day 1 and even though my time allowed for just 1 or 2 hours a day, I was crushing it. Great aim, great movement, I telling myself that I am not just above average, I am finally GOOD at a game I liked. Fast-forward to the presnet, and while climbing through the ranked system, I found myself in the second highest rank, unable to climb further. This is where it dawned on me. I am good at the game, sure, but I will never be as good as the guys who play this game 12 hours a day.

&amp;#x200B;

I am jealous of the people that have that sort of free time on their hands and I regret being 20 and working an 8 hours shift every day. I am looking at streams on twitch and I see people building communities and getting bigger and better each day, while I can only do it for a few hours during the week. I have already dedicated all of my weekends so far to playing the game non stop. I am chugging energy drinks like I am 16 years old, playing all night and waking up the next day at 5PM. I hate the thought of monday coming through and having to go back to work. I no longer have time to do this thing I enjoy, getting better and maybe breaking grounds, going pro, maybe make it into streaming, but I can't help but feel like that's the wrong choice.

Maybe I am telling lies to myself, what if I quit my job and dedicate myself to this game, leading to nowhere, then what? Go back to square one? But what if I succeed? What if I make it to pro, grow a community and make a living off of it? I keep looking at big streamers and tell myself that I could be one of them one day, but at the same time, I see all of these players in-game advertising their twitch streams, and not being able to pull more than 1 viewer a day. I see the guys who made it, and I want to be one of them, but at the same time, I know it is a gamble, I know it can backfire and I know that for every 1 big streamer there are a 1000 that people never heard of in their lives, and probably never will. I need someone to tell me what can I do. I've been trying to find a middle ground, but it doesn't work, it affects both my personal and work life, and the skill and ability in game. I feel like I have to choose, and I know the odds, but I fear of missing out on the only chance I have in life of doing this one thing I love. But maybe it is better that way? Maybe I should take my mind off gaming again? I don't know.

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and mine and sams birthday was only 9 days apart and sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

386,"She left 2 months ago after a 15 year friendship and a 2 year relationship. She gave me no explanation, she was just gone. I found out a few days ago that she left me for a 21 year old and she is 33.

She doesn't know that I know about him and now she has been messaging me again after 2 months like nothing is wrong. 

Should I tell her I know and let her have it? Should I cut her off, move on and let it go? Revenge fuck her and tell her new boyfriend???? Jk. But Idk what to do I'm just so mad that she would leave me hanging these last couple months making me wonder what's going on and if she's gonna come back but really shes just been off with some other dude.

388,"Hey Reddit,

Been on 2 great dates with a beautiful girl from tinder whos a teacher like me; shes smart, funny and honestly I can see my future with her. I've already started memorizing important dates and birthday ideas. So far we plan to have a picnic for our third date.

However, she works full time and I only work part time and I find myself constantly wanting to message her in all my spare time.  She's not the most responsive person either on messenger, but so far she seems to like me back too. I have stuff to occupy my time (music, art, gaming) but I am so afraid of bombarding and overwhelming her when I do message.

So reddit, any advice for me? Have you experienced anything similar? What do you do? Females of reddit, if a guy always messages you first is that a turn off?

Thanks all",28Jul2019,1
389,"Hi guys, so as the title suggests just started working as a Barista in a new city. I'm decent at my job, everyone else seems to get on with me and not give me sly comments but this one manager seems to have it out for me. This store I've moved to is one of the biggest in my country and I moved from a store which was one of the smallest but I think I have been absolutely owning it. Anyway I would like some tips on how to deal with him. 

He comes across as arrogant and claims to be the best. Talks about how amazing he is, saying he would've completed the 6 orders I have to make by now rather than actually helping me complete them. Atm hes adding stress to an already fast paced position. It makes me not want to talk to him when we are closing the store but he cant help but chat to me. I told him about a music event I was going to and he was like ""oh im going to get tickets. In any case my friends cant go can I come with you and your friends"" at which point I was thinking god no, but couldn't help but be polite and say I don't see why this would be a problem. Anyway I need help dealing with him",28Jul2019,1

391,"Hello Reddit, I know this seem a little weird, but I need help to conceal and design the ventilation system for a 100 foot long underground tunnel I built over the course of several years. I have been looking around the internet, but I couldn’t find any information I could trust or verify for this project + I need some clever advice regarding details I might have not thought about.


[Here’s a rough plan of the tunnel](https://imgur.com/a/MNw8Mt6)


Normally, I would not rely on internet strangers for any advice, but since I cannot ask around too much and my research failed, it’s up to you to help me. For info, the tunnel is about 10 feet deep on average and is located in a calm suburb of a hot and dry state. 


Here’s a list of constraints I’m working with to create the ventilation system:


* The ventilation system must not carry any sound from the underground room. ;

* It must be very quiet, especially on the side of the house #2 (see plan) ;

* It must evacuate around 2.3 pounds of carbon dioxide a day. (Let’s say 10 pounds to be safe);

* It must evacuate excessive heat ;

* The whole ventilation system must not be seen from outside the tunnel or inside any of the houses.

***

To sum up, I need help about designing and concealing the whole vent system. 

Thanks in advance.",28Jul2019,1

393,"I am 19 yo uni student. I constantly compare myself to everyone around me. I have a LinkedIn account and whenever I scroll though the feed I get sad and anxious because I see all my peers having internships in top companies and winning competitions etc. during the summer holiday we’re now on when I’m just sitting at home wasting my time. I have bought quite few books to read but I just can’t seem to keep myself motivated to read them pass the first few chapters. I have signed up to volunteering but they are not related to my discipline at all so I’m not sure how much that helps, and I don’t even know if they will accept my application. When I am hanging around my friends I always feel like I am trying to play catch-up in both the life-achievements sense and the socialising sense.

Looks wise I have never been happy about myself. I have learnt to do makeup and I have lost around 8kg using very unhealthy methods (eg eating only one meal a day). But I constantly see so many girls better looking and fitter than me and it makes me sad that I will never look like that unless I go get plastic surgery. I have signed up to gym classes but even if I get really fit I am at a natural disadvantage being quite short and so I look chubbier relatively.

I go for positions of power in the uni to compensate and this makes me constant anxious that someone else will overtake me. I never feel good enough and when I see people at the same stage at me having greater achievement I get super jealous and I turn that jealousy into dislike. I know this is a terrible thing to do but I can help but to dislike them and put them down. I desperately hope that I am the type of person that is secure and not threatened by others’ success, but due to my personality and the way I’ve been raise, I am not that type of person.

Please give me advice on how to change this. I feel like this mindset will limit me in the long run and I really want to change. Thanks in advance.",28Jul2019,1
395," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. 

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

A few days before She had sent me the other side of a city instead of her for an appointment with a letter one day because it was the 6 months stage after I called in sick to an appointment at reception when I wasn’t sick I had a job interview but I hated her so didn’t want to tell her.iv seen dudes sit there and she seems different and happy and then she’s all bubbly then as opposed to her usually being snotty af


I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else instead if that other place she sent me and told her i had an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself. 

Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",28Jul2019,0
396,"Names of colleges won’t be said, but I’m having trouble on deciding which one to attend (if i get accepted into both).

College #1: is 1hr30m away from my dad + other family members. Sadly does not offer my major, but can choose other majors/minors that can substitute. Cheaper tuition than college #2. I can have a car on campus, and i would HAVE to live on campus for 2 years. My best friend goes to this school. A smallish school of about 3,600+.

College #2: 30-45m away from dad + other family members. Offers my major, but tuition costs more here. I can’t have a car on campus for a semester or two (I’m still considered a freshman). And i would be living on campus. A bigger school of roughly 15,000+ students.

Both have gyms, good cafeterias, good educational systems, etc.

I’m a very indecisive person and very nervous about this since I’d be going away to college which i didn’t do my freshman year. They both have pros and cons and i just don’t know which one i should pick.

I’m a very shy, introverted person who has a hard time making friends. However with this i want to become more open, extroverted and i want to make friends and go out and such.

397,"A couple of months ago I was having a bath and my neighbour from downstairs came knocking on my door to complain about a leak. I got an emergency plumber out who fixed the issue. A week later the neighbour's wife came complaining that the leak was still there. I told her the plumber had fixed the leak and it should no longer be an issue. I had been at work all day and had barely used the water in the morning. (I had been home 5 minutes). I checked with towels under every pipe after she was gone and can say for certain their is no leaks in my flat.

A few weeks later I found a note under my door, complaining again. Once again I informed the neighbour the issue was resolved. I went down to see the ""leak"" and whilst their is a mark on the ceiling from the original leak, it clearly was no longer leaking in my opinion. 

It's now been a few more weeks and the neighbour has come knocking again. I pretended to be out because I'm just sick of all of this. 

How do I get the neighbour to leave me alone? I am 100% certain the leak has been resolved and to be honest every time he comes knocking I feel like my privacy is being invaded. I'm a very introverted person and just want to be by myself when I'm at home.",28Jul2019,3

399,"Hey Reddit, I’m gonna get straight to the point.

I (17M) want to get away from my parents for a couple of days. I’m depressed (+ chronic DPDR), and I can’t explain it to them at all; they never have and likely never will listen to me. I’m not going to bother explaining a lot of reasons why I can’t handle my parents, but one thing really tipped me over the edge yesterday. 

My dad comes in, pissed out of his brain, and tells me I’m grounded for forgetting to turn my fan off before I left the house. Now as I mentioned, I have DPDR, I’m very forgetful, but I had only done this once before. I understand it’s dangerous and irresponsible of me, but not to the extent they make it out to be - calling me disgusting and a disappointment.

Tonight, I pack a few days clothes and write a letter to my parents. I plan to explain how depressed I am, and how it’s my life; I’m old enough to make my own decisions. I will go to my friend’s house for a few days, and I will come home. I will not tell them where I am going, but I will say they can call me, keep in contact, whatever will let them know I’m safe.

403,"&amp;#x200B;

So essentially, I've always been a restless soul, quick to jump at opportunities, but struggle to stay focused. Typical high ambition but underachiever type, was always was told I was smart growing up, never really had to study as school was easy to pass just by passively listening in on classes for me.

Currently, my life can be summarized in these few steps: 

* Screwed up high school got bad grades.
* 20: Fixed grades by working my ass off for a year
* 21: Got into nice university 
* 21-22: Put studies on hold to join a company I loved working on a project I loved, worked there for almost 3 years
* 24: Got burnt out, decided to continue my CS degree
* 25: A year after, seriously struggling I got offered to join a startup as a co-founder
* 27: Now almost 1.5 years later I'm sitting at a point where we have made some money, I'll have enough to pay for myself for potentially 5 months, but my startup is more or less dead.

At this point in life I'm just so fed up with my life choices, I'm constantly full of anxiety, I feel that I have wasted my life so far chasing dumb dreams when I should've just been normal and focused on school and got a steady job, now with me being close to thirty with no savings or a degree I'm starting to feel that I'm just inherently flawed, I have never actually been happy or comfortable with life, always felt like the odd one never fitting in. 

Right now I feel forced to just go back to school, one alternative is to find a job in my previous career or try to get a CS job from my education/startup experience. 

I honestly don't know what to do, I got a girlfriend who's finishing her studies and wants me to do the same as she wants to have kids sometime soon, but It would require me at least 2 years to finish it, and after that I don't know how many years until I'm ready for kids, or even what I want anymore. 

Suicide is not really something I want, but I have never thought about suicide as often as I have the past few months, I just don't know if I'm up for the challenge ahead..

404,"My (18m) younger brother J (6) lives with me, our mum (42) and our older brother C (21). Before he was born C and I had a kinda weird upbringing. Mum has depression and our dad left when I was 6 so we had no father figure growing up. C got into trouble with the police a lot and stole from me and mum repeatedly (~£1000 in total) a few years ago. Our mum is a wonderful person but suffers greatly and sometimes can’t control her anger so shouts and throws things around. C and I do the same I guess because we know no different way of dealing with anger. 

Anyway sob story over, J doesn’t know his dad so me and C are essentially his father figures. But I feel like we’ve all messed him up. These are key developmental stages of his life and he’s already dealing with anger by shouting and throwing things, if you try and explain something to him he just shouts “shut your mouth” over the top of you. This morning he was hitting and shouting at our mum because she wasn’t out of bed and he wanted breakfast. 


The thing is he’s such a sweet boy the rest of the time and this behaviour is only what he’s learnt from us. Mum, C and I all have different ways of teaching and disciplining him, but I want to make and effort to raise him well so that he doesn’t end up like his dad (massive cunt). 

Also what’s worrying is J doesn’t have many friends and is kinda shy. I was the same as a kid and it’s taken me until now to get over it. I feel like it’s because our mum has done everything for us so we’re all ungrateful.

405,"So I started with a large company a little over 2 years ago. When I started we had a full team. Since then, there have been multiple layoffs and I am one of the last people left.

For a while now I have been stressing about the future as have realized that my goals/priorities are more focused on my career and becoming  financially stable than getting married or having children etc. 

I come from a family who really struggle financially, that rely on government aids/ benefits (mother disabled, my father me and my brother carers for her). My parent have hinted that they are are going to have to rely on me to to help pay rent and aid them. I can't see myself and my brother moving out anytime soon as my parents also will be needing care and help around the house as they are getting older and they both have health problems. 

I am going to University in September, doing a degree in Early years education and I already have a diploma in level 3 childcare so I am already qualified to be Nursery nurse. 
I don't have much of a plan for the future but so far I have worked out that I want to get a decent job earning over £25,000 a year (hopefully!). 

I understand that probably a big chunk of my wage will be going to my parents so it could be hard to save up but I am interested in possibly buying houses, doing them up, putting them up for rent. Being a landlord at the moment is big interest to me and my brother so that I can have a flow on income every month and it something that I would enjoy doing (we save up and put our funds together to buy the houses)

I understand that this is a lot to read and would be very grateful if you could offer any advice to me about any of this. All I want to do is provide for my family.

412,"Couple nights ago, I got drunk with some friends on Discord (If you don't know what that is: it's an application that allows groups of users to communicate using voice chat and text, images, videos, etc.) and we were playing video games together most of the night.

&amp;#x200B;

During which, a friend messaged me in private asking if it would be ok to invite an old crush of mine I haven't spoken to in 2 years. We didn't stop talking out of any malice, truth is; I had romanticized a relationship with her in my head for months and it had developed into an obsession. I decided to step away for my own sake. Maybe it was because of the booze, but I said: ""yeah fuck it!"" and she came to join our game.

&amp;#x200B;

Once I realized what i'd agreed to, I started to panic internally. I like to think i'm mostly over her, but even if I wasn't, it doesn't matter because I found out my feelings were unrequited a long time ago. I was nervous because what the hell do I say to her? I already have real problems with high anxiety and depression and now i've gotta make conversation with someone I use to really like that I haven't seen in years.

&amp;#x200B;

Luckily, the alcohol calmed my nerves and I wasn't really obligated to make 1 on 1 conversation with her given that we were a large and drunk group. I asked friends how I was and they said I acted perfectly fine; that i'm overthinking it (a common bad habit of mine) but even now i'm still really nervous. I liked spending time with her again; we all had a laugh but I have this mentality: I feel a need to make people laugh; even if I sometimes try too hard and if someone else is making a person i'm interested in laugh, then I feel the need to one up them (something that I realize is stupid and am working on). Since I was drunk, I didn't really care; I accepted that my communication skills weren't going to be great...

415,"I’m basically looking for some advice and opinions on how to have a fruitful conversation instead of an argument about a very sensitive topic.

I’ve been diagnosed with multiple health issues that makes me ill multiple times a week, sometimes to the point I can’t do much at all. Because of this I’m very overweight despite having a relatively healthy lifestyle. My husband knows this, and he’s very supportive, usually. 

The problem is, my husband seems to think my illness is related to my weight, not that my weight is because of my illness. I’ve tried explaining it but he just doesn’t understand. He keeps trying to talk to me about weight loss surgery or seeing a weight loss specialist. I’ve told him multiple times I would never have surgery for my weight, I know women who have had this done and all of them said it’s a nightmare and they couldn’t wait to have it reversed. 

It’s not like my weight is a big problem in our marriage, I dress nicely, I wear sexy underwear. I don’t hate how I look most of the time, and neither does my husband. Our sex life is amazing and in no way affected by my weight or illness. On days I’m feeling okay we go out for dinners, go for walks, go to the cinema, meet friends. It doesn’t stop me doing anything I want. 

The arguments start when he tells me “I’m not trying hard enough” to lose weight. I probably could clean up my eating habits even more if I wanted to, I could go to the gym the one or two times a month I feel well enough, but I don’t want to spend the few days I feel well punishing my body. I want to enjoy my time. 

I don’t know how to talk about this issue because I’ve been bullied about my weight in the past and it’s hard to discuss it without feeling attacked.

As soon as we got here yesterday, he came right up to our door with his face smashed against the glass yelling, ""My uncles lives in that apartment!"" over and over.  I went to the door and then his father said let's go with no apology, which was odd.

When we went to get in the car for dinner, the father stood  in front of the car and stared at us with this confused look on his face.

418,"**Throwaway because I'm very embarrassed and disgusted with myself. Post was deleted from** /r/vegan **and** /r/vegetarian **and I don't know where else to turn. Please, please, please do not tell me to ""deal with it"" because these are my morals and what I believe.**

**VERY long post incoming, but it's probably the most ridiculous story you will ever hear, and I think it's worth it to read. You be the judge. I bolded some details, which will hopefully make it easier lol.**

I (22 f) have been a vegetarian since the age of 12, from the moment I learned that meat = animals. I have always known in my heart that it is wrong to harm animals, and there is almost nothing I have been more certain of in my life. **I am now vegan as of yesterday because of the situation that I will now describe to you.**

I would like to start off by saying that **I live in a major city** in the U.S. - tall buildings, millions of people, great transit, etc. Everything is very close together, and most people in my area do not even have yards. Until yesterday, I had been under the impression that meat comes from... farms. Factory farms, yes, but surely those can't exist in a city where everything is so cramped, and surely not on a main street completely surrounded by houses and apartments. Right? Wrong, I guess.

**My roommate/best friend (22 f, also vegetarian) and I are recent college graduates.** We made the decision to move out of our apartment because we no longer had to live close to our school, and we wanted to live in the area of town our friends were moving to. I'm not sure how familiar you all are with transit, but it was very important to my roommate and I that we live off of a certain subway line. We were looking at apartments in 7 different neighborhoods off of this subway line, all nice areas, some much more affordable than others.

Although my roommate and I were planning on paying for our new apartment with our own money, **we are still financially dependent on our parents in some ways**. For example, we are both still on our parents' health insurance. Additionally, because we are so young and have little credit, we were expecting that our parents would have to co-sign the lease for us. My roommate's parents (not mine) are very, very strict. They were convinced that the neighborhoods we were looking in were dangerous areas (they are actually completely fine). Her parents only approved of ONE of the neighborhoods out of the 7 we were looking at. Of course, that neighborhood was by FAR the most expensive. They told us that they would NOT co-sign on an apartment in any of the 6 other neighborhoods - **in fact, they would be so mad that they would completely cut off my roommate financially and kick her off of their health insurance**.

So, we did what we had to do and looked at apartments in that neighborhood. Getting a third roommate was out of the question for us because we have both had terrible roommate experiences in the past, and we do not trust anyone to be a good roommate other than each other. After searching numerous apartment-finding websites, we found that **there was only ONE 2-bedroom apartment available in our price range in that neighborhood.** I scheduled a tour of the apartment, but I did not have high hopes because I knew that there had to be something wrong with it for it to be priced that low in such an expensive area. Additionally, Zillow said that over 100 people had reached out about the apartment, yet no one had applied for it. I'm not sure if that's normal, but it kind of alarmed me.

My roommate was out of town, so she was unable to come with me to look at the apartment. I went by myself... and **absolutely loved the place!** Great location - right near the train with easy access to everything I would want. The place was decently sized and had no visible defects. The leasing agent (realtor) who showed me the apartment was very pleasant and answered all of my questions.

I asked the realtor a TON of questions, including **""what's the catch?""** to which she told me there was no central air and no laundry in unit. It's pretty common for apartments in our city to not have either of those things, so it wasn't a big deal for me to not have them. I mentioned the Zillow thing to her, and she told me that everyone who reached out about the apartment was just picky and wanted a place with central air and laundry in unit. I also asked her what SOUNDS I would be hearing in the apartment at night, because my roommate and I previously lived near a bar, and it was pretty loud. **The realtor told me that the apartment was in a nice, quiet area.**

I was immediately sold. I sent my roommate a video I took of the place, and she loved it. We got our application in and got approved. (Funny enough, they said we make enough money that we didn't need co-signers.) We then prepared for the move.

I am an only child, and my parents care about me a lot. When I told them about the new apartment, they immediately arranged for movers to come and help us with our stuff, and my mom and her friend took the day off of work to help me pack. I did NOT ask them to do ANY of this - they just did it, and I was very thankful.

Moving day was yesterday. My roommate and I woke up early to go to the real estate office and get the keys from the realtor. While we were there, **the realtor mentioned that our new landlord also owns the poultry store next door,**and that we could just drop our rent checks off in the store rather than mailing them. We assumed that the poultry store was just a deli, because what else could it be? We never could have imagined it would be a **SLAUGHTERHOUSE**!

My parents arrived shortly after we got back to our old apartment with the keys. They helped us finish packing and hung out with us until the movers got there. My roommate and I decided to take a ride to the new apartment with my dad in his car just to look at the place because my roommate still hadn't seen it in person. Upon arrival, we could have sworn we heard... **clucking and squawking? But that just doesn't happen in the city**, so we figured we were just hearing things. We went inside the apartment, and it was even better than I remembered. Super cute, and my roommate loved it.

**As we were leaving, we saw a man outside holding a very small crate of about a dozen LIVE CHICKENS packed into it.** That was when it became clear to us that the ""poultry store"" next door was actually a slaughterhouse, and if our landlord also owns it, that means that our rent money is probably contributing to it in some way. **We googled the name of the place and found pictures of people protesting outside of it.** The realtor did NOT inform me of ANY of this, despite having several chances to do so. My roommate and I began freaking out, but my dad got upset with us and told us that it shouldn't matter (he has never been too supportive of me being a vegetarian).

My roommate and I spent the rest of the day crying on and off and having panic attack after panic attack while trying to hide it from my parents because we didn't want to upset them. When the movers arrived, we went back to the apartment, and the clucking and squawking only got louder. We can hear it from the inside. **FYI, there is NO bad smell inside or outside of the apartment whatsoever - not even a meat-like smell. The place next door 100% LOOKS like a deli from the outside.** I don't know how I didn't hear the animals when I went on the initial tour. My roommate also walked past the apartment 2-3 times before we moved in and didn't notice anything unusual.

My roommate and I have been completely distraught and overwhelmed with guilt. I have no idea what to do. We don't want to live there, but **there are so, so many layers to this**. After my parents left, I found out that they paid over $800 for the movers... we are not rich and don't usually have that kind of money. **So now, we are trying to figure out:**

1. ***How to take action with the realtor*** (I'm considering suing, but I'm not sure if that would be a good idea because nothing she said to me about the apartment is in writing. I'm definitely going to write some sort of an email to her, but I'm not sure what to say)
2. ***If we are allowed to break the lease*** (I know we are definitely allowed to sublet, but who would take an 11-month sublet next to a slaughterhouse?)
3. ***If we would be able to find another 2-bedroom apartment in this neighborhood that is in our budget*** (otherwise, we have to convince my roommate's parents that the other areas we were looking at are safe... they are very strict and will NOT budge)
4. ***How we are going to tell my parents that we don't want to live there*** after they just paid $800 for movers and sacrificed an entire Saturday to help us move, in addition to my mom and her friend taking off work to help me pack
5. Perhaps most importantly, ***how we are going to live with this guilt of indirectly funding a slaughterhouse***. I have decided to become vegan because while being a vegetarian is already great, I need to step up and do even more to help animals. (even if we end up moving out, I am still going to be vegan because the past 24 hours have completely changed my life)

So, Reddit, I am in a very bad place right now and would love your advice on any of the 5 points above. Thank you, thank you, thank you for reading and please help me! Ahhhhhhhh",28Jul2019,0
419,"I had a short notice vacation come up, which means options were limited on my dog sitter, but was able to find one through an app. 
Well I was so grateful that they’d be willing that I told them I would go outside the app and pay cash. 
I keep cameras in my house because of the work I do, needs to be protected phi. Well one of them caught her going into the bedroom, I provided for just her, with her boyfriend and I could hear they were having sex because my dog triggered the motion sensor by the door. 
Couple of days later, she saw the camera and you could see she has an idea of what was captured, but I’m sure they’re not 100% that it was. Well the bf came out of the room naked so there’s no question what happened. Please note, it’s not hidden, it’s out in the open and easily visible. I wasn’t try to “catch” her in anyway. 
Ever since that happened she’s no longer staying the night and when she visits my dog, she is there for 3-4 minutes. Nowhere near how long it would take him to relieve himself fully. Not only that, one day she let him out for the night, in the early evening, and didn’t come back for 13 hours! I felt so terrible for my dog! 

Do I confront her when I get back, or do I just let it go? Do I confront her now, do I have her pay for the cleaning, or do I just let it go? I really don’t know what I should do. This whole “vacation” has been me stressing over my dog and what’s happening in my house and haven’t relaxed a single minute. Either way, I don’t want to jeopardize my dog being taken care of.",28Jul2019,1

421,"My mother was unemployed for 3 years (since i turned 18 and got a life insurance check for my dads death) and me and my stepdad had to take care of bills and groceries while she was getting back on her feet. Problem was 3 years later she didnt and decided the time we were struggling the most was the best time to leave my stepdad. I thought she was taking a step to better herself because she said she was finally gonna go back to work but that was a lie. After rent was up we were supposed to get an apartment and she only had to go to the courthouse and get something cleared up but she hadnt so she wanted us to get an airbnb which ended up being $750. After we paid for that she wanted us to pay for a uhaul and storage when we didnt have that much stuff and thats when things got crazy and she threw a tantrum and told me that i should just find somewhere to stay on my own so i said i will and called a friend to get my stuff and take it to the airbnb and my sister said she wanted out aswell and would rather get an apartment with me. So after figuring she was on her own my mother flew to a friend so she could stay there and i was at an airbnb for 5 days. Today is the day i check out and i had to get another airbnb but it really hurt my savings because im unemployed and now i fear that i wont be able to help with getting the apartment as much as i want to. All of this wouldnt have been a problem if i was by myself but 2 months ago when everything was going normal and i thought we had a steady place to stay with my stepdads new job i adopted 2 kittens and my sister 1 puppy. Pet fees are really alot we have learned and most of my family are afraid of cats or simply will not let me stay there because of space. So i have $500 to my name, 2 kittens, and an airbnb in atlanta to stay at until saturday afternoon. I have been in panic mode and have applied to every place i could online and plan on going in personally to ask for a job in person on monday since most places are closed today. I do have a place to stay with my grandma but i would have to give up my kittens and they have been very important to me with getting through this with my anxiety and i really would rather try my hardest to keep them with me. I decided i try reddit for help while im getting my stuff together. I am 20 since may and my sister is 18 and just graduated in may. What i need advice with is: 

What jobs can i get with no real experience where i could earn atleast $600 a month? I will slave in a warehouse if i have to i dont care.

Will my sister be able to carry our apartment applications if we get a co-sign? She just got a job and also still has alot of money in the bank from her insurance check (enough for definitely over a year of paying by herself but i plan on going half)

Is there a place i could bring my kittens for free or cheap and still be able to get them back in a couple weeks? (I dont want to give them up forever but if i am still without a place to live after saturday then i may have to) I have looked for pet hotels could not find ANY.

I have a monitor and a very high end pc with a 1080ti but after moving my stuff to the airbnb, the display no longer works on either (i tried the monitor with my ps4 and it didnt work but my ps4 works with the tv here) Where would i be able to sell these and for how much? 

Lastly i just thought of this but i do not mind sleeping in my sisters car (She can sleep over friends and my grandparents with her puppy) but would it be ok for my cats to sleep in the car for a couple days if it comes to that? 

Thank you, typing this out was definitely a relief to me knowing that i could get advice from anyone on this tough situation.",28Jul2019,1
422,Not sure if there’s a better sub for this but a guy (23) I’ve been seeing for about two months hasn’t been on Whatsapp since saturday night 3 am. I live in western Europe so that’s over 36 hours ago. Where I live WhatsApp is more popular for texting each other than normal texting/imessage so it’s not like he doesn’t use it much. I tried to call him but it goes straight to voicemail even though text messages still get delivered which indicated that his phone is probably on “do not disturb” instead of switched off. Since I haven’t known him for long I don’t have any numbers of his friends or family whom I could ask but I do know that his family is on holiday right now so he’s home alone. I’m not sure what to do? Should I go over there to check on him already or is it too soon for that? Am I just being paranoid? We met on a dating app and lives about an hour away from me.,28Jul2019,1

Anyways, so lately I’ve been catching him watching porn at night while I sleep, something which I was totally cool w, but for some reason I had the curiosity spark in me this morning to check out what type of stuff he likes to watch (idk maybe i can get ideas i thought, wasn’t trying to be compulsive or anything) but what I found instead, after a lot of digging may l add, was that he signed up for a bunch of dating websites, several of which were actually transgender dating websites, and he was also watching some trans porn and she-man porn (sorry hope the term isn’t offensive, it was literally what he searched for.) Now the most concerning part of it all is that these websites show him signing up around the same date we got married, and around the same time he told me he officially closed his tinder account.

428,"I'm planning to start therapy at my college as soon as I'm enrolled and starting school. To be prepared, and to not back out of it as I've done before - I've compiled a list of what I want to talk about...however, it's kind of long and I'm wondering if it's reasonable to work on all the goals, though some may go hand in hand, I just want people's opinions - especially from anyone who's in therapy or career is in counseling/therapy. 

THERAPY GOALS.

What I want to talk about in therapy…

FAMILY:

Oldest sister’s paralysis and parenting. The anger and sadness that stems from that and being able to unable to cope with “not having my sister”

Being isolated - Nana and Grandpa, Uncle, all cousins and aunts

Family problems; the rape, Oldest sister wanting to kill herself, “family secrets” found in Oldest sister’s journal; mom’s suicide attempt, dad beating oldest sister, mom cheating on dad - the different things we remember from our childhood and the things mom says are different.

Reconciling the fact that my sister isn’t perfect.

Middle sister not having a job/life, how I want to help but it feels overwhelming.

Mom not having a job/life. How the house makes me feel lonely and sad and unproductive.

LIFE:

Perfectionism and people pleasing - learning to say no, learning to speak up about my wants/needs. I feel like I’m the only one in my family left to succeed...so no matter what, I HAVE to do it. I feel very overwhelmed with this idea that I must be the perfect child because my sisters are “problem” children.

School. Degree stuff, stress about choosing the right major.

Motivation. Why do I not really feel it and why do I seem unable to do anything with it?

Work. Why do I feel terrified every Friday that I’m going to get fired and I don’t fit in and that I’m awful at my job? Also help with not feeling so emotionally drained. And am I a workaholic?

Friends: how to make them, how to keep them? Sadness about how I don’t feel close to anyone and have barely ever felt that way. Like stereotypical female friendships. 

Boyfriend: Meh...nothing much to say, I love him and don’t feel many negatives in our relationship. Help with learning to speak up about what I want to do.

Money - help with my lowkey obsession with money.

Generalized anxiety - Constant ""what-ifs"" and death

Also any tips are appreciated. I want to get the most out of it this time and hopefully reconcile and learn to solve most of my problems!",28Jul2019,1
429,"I said something and I'm not sure whether I should apologise or not

So recently, me and my friend (Let's just call her Sarah) have been going through this phase of just ignoring each other. And I'm the cause of it. So to explain it more thoroughly, that day I was just kind of annoyed with her.

Number one, Sarah just wasn't talking to me that much. If she were to speak to me, it would only be for stuff like homework, did I do that, did I do this, can she copy if I finished the work? kind of stuff. If it wasn't that, then it was to ask me for small favours that she could have easily done herself instead of asking people to do it. 

We don't have any main subjects we usually talk about, but we usually talked about random stuff. However, that week, she was just talking to her other friends and would only talk to me when she wanted to ask me to help her with something.

I have to mention my temper isn't that good (but not that bad neither), so those things really ticked me off. And she never really initiated a conversation just to talk, yaknow? Just for exchange of topics or to share interesting things that had happened recently or any sort of stuff like that, what friends do. 

Anyways, on that day (the day I argued with her), we were doing a case study together with another friend of ours. Skipping to the point, she was just kind of sitting there and doing nothing. I asked her what she was going to do, but then she said something along the lines of how she didn't know what to do to which I responded to just do something with the project to help out. But then she said basically the same thing again, she *didn't know what to do* and it mad me madder. So I said ""Then find something to just do then. I can also say that *I* don't know what to do and just sit there doing nothing."" (That's as accurately as I can remember it) and she just stayed silent, with a gloomy look on her face. I don't think it was *bad*, right?

I think it's worth to note though that we have had arguments for small reasons before, and that she just gets moody at random times (whether it's personal life issues or other stuff) where she just doesn't talk to people and doesn't respond when people talk to her (this has also a lot of the time mad me annoyed because I just think, if she's not feeling that good, she can just respond with a simple response like a nod or whatever or even just a *word* but she just ignores us, most of the time I end up brushing off whatever she does I might get annoyed with because, I mean everybody has issues but that day I really just wasn't in the mood).

Anyways, four days have passed and I see that she's goes about her day normally talking with her other friends (just that she ignores me and I ignore her too). It makes me think, was what I said really that bad, should I apologize?

435,"
Where to start? I’m a 17 y.o female student in England with no job. I have no bank account and my money is in a safe that I’m not allowed the password to, but I have around 400 - 600 pounds. My mother is verbally abusive towards me, threatens me, insults me and ridicules me a lot. She used to smack me and bite me when I was younger (around 5 - 12) and has also threatened to murder me and said she would hide the body in a forest or river. She has since stopped being physical, but I know that she would attempt to fight me if she was angry enough. It came to a climax last Wednesday when she had got irritated that I yelled for help after my door was jammed. She threatened to beat me up until I’m in a care home and told me I have no friends and nobody cares about me. She tells me that she can threaten me all she wants and I can’t because I know that she ‘will win’. I haven’t spoken to her since then and it’s very hard living in a household with someone who wants to hurt me. My dad sides with her mostly because she tells him to, but isn’t verbally abusive and has never physically hurt me. He just kind of watches and says nothing. 
In conclusion, I don’t feel wanted and appreciated here and I kind of want to leave. The problem is I have no money at all (apart from the money from my birthday that I may or not be given back) and I have no knowledge of the outside world. I could have a part time job alongside being a student, but I’m in my last year. I also don’t want to drop out and give up on my education. I don’t have any idea on how to do chores either because my dad has done a lot for me. 
I have diagnosed depression and anxiety and was discharged around two months ago, but I’m starting to feel suicidal again. I have done pretty well in convincing myself not to trust these thoughts of suicide and that they’re not ‘me’ talking, but they’re very convincing.

The consequences of this experience is the reason why I feel unfulfilled and insecure. It is confusing and frustrating because I’ve set myself expectations, expectations that have been encouraged by my environment to set. I cannot seem to meet these expectations yet I believe they are realistic and healthy for me to live by. They are ultimately the morals and values that shape who I am and want to be. How can I be fulfilled and confident if I cannot seem to generate the desire to be who I am?  

I’ve been working on this dilemma since I first became aware of it in 2017, yet I’ve recognized no progress.

I recently swapped doctor not long ago now and she told me I could try Intuniv since it doesn't make your appetite worse like the other medicines do. They're mainly used for the hyperactive version of adhd while I have inattentive version (ADD).

I've now taken these for about 2 and half weeks and I become crazy dizzy everytime my stand up. Can be lying down or sitting before, doesnt matter. My sight also gets fucked and it feels like lights are flickering and every time I look at something bright, like just a white house or the pavement on a sunny day I basically go blind.

Either way I want to quit taking these since I havent felt theyce actually helped me any way with focus theyve only made me feel like Im gonna pass out every once in a while. My parents don't allow me to quit because they think I should just keep taking it until it starts working even with the symptoms. 

It is true that intuniv actually does take a little time to work but I dont want to keep taking it since I havent felt anything at all yet, and I'm taking 3 mg a day now. Next week it will be 4mg and if I keep taking it, it will be 28 pills per week (1mg = 1pill).

 So I met this guy from another friend of mine and it took awhile for me to realize that I liked him more than just a friend. I also introduced him to my best friend and he immediately told me she liked him. (Keep in mind I told her that I started to “fall” for him) I was kinda mad but didn’t show it. She said it was fine if we both liked him, she told me she didn’t mind. (Though I did, and I feel like she does too)
 I also started talking about another guy and she started thinking I liked him and not the guy WE currently like. This Monday she invited him(the guy we like) to a Carnival and she would try to spend more time with him. Of course I had to put up and act and joked about her and him being together when in reality it hurt. I really do like that guy, but so does my best friend...

When we started dating I was really into him and I didn’t have any second thoughts about what I was getting myself into, and then, a few weeks in, I randomly started feeling not as into him and I told him about it, I told him I was scared of getting into the relationship blah blah. and although that was partially the problem, I still felt something else bothering me but I couldn’t entirely grasp it. He was very understanding and he said we can slow down and we did and then I was sorta head over heels for him again. 

A few days ago I started getting that feeling again, it’s like I feel sorta trapped? It’s so weird I just feel really uncomfortable in the relationship but I have no idea why.

The thing is, he treats me so well, nothing about him is bothering me. It’s just me being with him. He’s seriously the nicest person I’ve met he’s so in love with me and we’re just sorta perfect for each other it’s a bit crazy because I’ve never met someone I’ve connected so much with, I felt so amazing when I wasn’t having these thoughts of like almost disgust. it’s so weird and I have no idea why I’m feeling this.

We’ve seen each other only three times (with a couple weeks between each one, due to family travels).

I have no control over how monogamous I am, even when I am single. 

I met another amazing guy, cute, funny, intelligent and etc and tried to go out with him in order to prove to myself I could date more than one person at the same time and NOT fall in love for the first one, it was a disaster. After going out with the second guy for the third time, we went to a hotel and I could only think about the first one, we ended up talking and sleeping after, because nothing would turn me on.
Last night (Friday) I went out with the first one and all I can think about today is how I would like to be with him again. 
He hasn’t talked to me all night and, at least to me, he is obviously with someone. 

I think I should stop seeing him before it’s too late and I end up getting hurt. So I can take him out of my mind after a while, and be opened to other nice guys (more available ones pls). But that’s not what I really want.

481,"I really need some impartial advice. I was in a relationship for 2 months (yes i know its short) and we have broken up(it would seem?) over a misunderstanding.  I am gonna preface this by letting you know that we have already had some ups and downs due to communication style and also he is a little or a lot damaged.  He says he has never had a good relationship and I am the only woman who has really seemed to care about him.  On this past friday he was supposed to come over (he lives far away) and he kept saying he didnt know if he could make it cause he may have to work super late (his job sometimes requires that).  Well he had cancelled plans with me previously but for legit reasons. I was just getting really fed up cause we havent seen eachother for a while and its just disappointing. Well i could tell he was annoyed by that because his messages were short. God i hate texting and wish we had never communicated that way.  Well after another message (this one was via snapchat and we are in our 30s so we shouldn't even use that) i became annoyed and deleted my snapchat, thinking he would just message or call me normally and ask why i deleted it and we would proceed from there.  Well he didnt and we still havent spoken 2 days later now. This never happens, we speak and message throughout the day.  I think he assumes i blocked him on snapchat because when you delete it your profile remains there for 30 days but you cannot receive messages and it gives notification that message was unable to send. Well I miss him terribly, and keep thinking of sending him a message, but am afraid to be rejected. We never said we were over. Simply just stopped speaking. This all seems like a big misunderstanding to me, but we also seem to keep having those. He gets very emotional if I don't do things a certain way, i think because he may be insecure because of being cheated on and mistreated in the past. Normally our relationship is quite loving though and full of passion.  I really don't know what to do. Do i just let go and realize what is meant to be will be?

Once in a blue moon, I like to talk to people over there, especially if they look interesting,  so I went up to him and the conversation kind of goes as follows:

Me: ""Hey""

Him: ""Hey""

Me: ""So, are you a sikh or a muslim?""

Him: ""I'm sikh""

Me: Ahhh okay....do you want to know what's wrong with sikhs, the sikh community?

Him: after a little pause ""WHAT""

Me: ""Y'all are a buncha sick fucks!"", and I chuckled a little bit after saying that, (btw I meant this as a lighthearted joke, I didn't say this with ill intent or to bully him, I just wanted to make a joke)

485,"Well, I guess I should start of saying that my best friend is (or was) probably the best friend anyone could ask for. He is always there when I feel down, when I start having anxieties about random stuff (I have been diagnosed with OCD), he understands and actually finds ways of distracting me. He helps me fix my computer when I break it, and he even fixed my kitchen sink recently. We have a lot of stuff in common, we play like 10 games together constantly. And we have been friends for 12 years. In the past, there was an incident where he stopped talk to me for a few months completely, and he said it was due to his own mental health issues and I understood. I don't know if I should add this or not, but I am black and he is white. This fact has resulted in some what of a rift between me and his relatives, as they are admitted racists and they even attend KKK events. I am not sure why he is different or how he avoided growing up that way, but he is not racist and has never really treated me differently. 

But recently he has been acting weird. And yesterday he came over and confessed that he has been living a double life. As in, he has a new house and a girl friend that I have never been introduced to, and that neither one of us know about each other. I already knew he had a girlfriend for some time now, as I am a woman and I am not stupid. He always is texting and i see her picture all over his phone, but i figured it was long distance or something he was just experimenting with because he never came out and told me about it. I would not pressure him into something he wasn't comfortable revealing on his own. 

But now, after going to a therapist, he decided to tell me that he is living with his gf in a new house. And he asked me to be his best man, even though im not a dude, and I don't even know his GF's name.

Most of my life I have always just cut people off when I get tired of their drama. I have a lot of issues on my own, and I don't handle drama well. So my natural instinct is just to cut him off also. But he is the only real friend I have and has known me almost as long as my husband has known me. My husband is kind of upset that I want to get rid of my friend so easily, but I feel betrayed and I feel like he was ashamed of me. I introduced my friend to all of my family, he even goes to my family reunions hes known us so long. 

Do you think I should cut him off and let him live whatever life he is living without my knowledge? It seems like there is a reason he kept me separated from his new life. I can understand me not interacting with his racist parents and brother, but why would you not introduce me to the person you are living with for 2+ years or even mention the fact that you have cats? I thought he was a dog person, and I find out he has 2 cats now. I feel like I don't know him anymore.

490,"Well, this is the second month in a row where I’ve had to ask my family for help because of the amount of medical bills I have. I was scrolling through the webs and saw an ad for some budget-managing book, and decided that I really should start budgeting. I hate asking my family - they’re also struggling - so I really want to do anything to make it up to them.

Well, I decided to look through my bank statements (I admittedly never do - I don’t receive paper ones so I kinda forget they exist) and GOOD GRIEF. The month isn’t even over yet and I spent over $560 on food. And only $195 is from a grocery shopping trip. The rest is from fast food, dining out, and buying breakfast/lunch at work everyday.

ANY advice would be helpful. So much of that could’ve gone to my medical bills/savings/etc.

Does meal prepping save a ton of money? Any good sources on how to start?

Any advice on grocery shopping? My sister and I spent $195 and I feel like it didn’t provide enough ingredients to make enough dinners for the week.

Please help me! Thank you so much! Anything would help! I don’t want to ask my family for help again, and really want to pay them back!",28Jul2019,0

497,"The existential crisis surrounding the upcoming 30 is real. At first, it was anxiety concerning the fact that my appearance will soon fade and that this is the youngest I will ever look. Since turning 29, I've been grappling with the idea that I won't be young anymore and that society seems to view women as less attractive in their 30's. I'm not sure why that bothers me, but it does. It makes me feel like I lack sex appeal and, even if my spouse shows that she is very attracted to me, I don't feel vibrant and attractive anymore and I feel sad. It's the stupidest thing. I know that logically. I haven't changed much in terms of looks since my early to mid twenties. I'm not even a person who usually cares that much what others think and I'm not the type of girl who has ever put THAT much effort into looks. Like, I don't go out for manicures, tanning, etc so I'm really not sure why I'm so bothered by this.   


Anyway, now there's the added feeling of not having accomplished much. When I was fourteen, I thought thirty was so old and I thought I would have accomplished a ton of stuff. I wanted to travel the world in my 20's. I wanted to finish my PhD by 25. I wanted to be relatively wealthy and have a lot of money in savings. I wanted to publish my first book before my 20's were over.   


Now, I'm 29 and I'm still working on my PhD. I'm not sure if I'll finish before 31. I have a tenure track position which I love and it pays well and provides security but I'm nowhere near wealthy. I married in 2016 and purchased my first home in 2017. Most of my money goes towards bills, groceries, mortgage, etc. My savings are pretty stagnant. They aren't BAD but I'm not where I thought I would be at 30. I traveled a bit in my early 20's but I still want to travel more. It just feels like 30 is the decade when I have to become more serious and traveling around like a 20-something, going out dancing, etc. will be looked down upon. My wife and I don't want to have children but most of my friends who are almost 30 already do and have settled down a lot. I don't feel like ""settling down"" but I feel like I should want to settle down at 30. I haven't published a book yet.

501,"I also posted this on r/AirBnB but I really need help and so I have also posted it here.

This is going to be long, but please read because I very much need advice.

I  booked an AirBnB near Detroit for three months while I did a  programming internship for a company that works very closely with GM. I  am a little over two months of the way through my stay.

My  AirBnB consists of two tenants, neither of which is the host, as the  host lives in another house down the street. One of them is a grandma.  They pay rent to the AirBnB host, and the grandma gets a discount on her  rent when she takes care of an AirBnB guest, meaning she effectively acts as my host on a usual day.

A  little less than a month into my stay, the grandma asks if one of her  grandchildren can stay with us for a few weeks while her daughter gets  moved into a new place. Says he will be well behaved, etc, and I  reluctantly decide it is probably okay for just a few weeks.

Fast  forward to a week later, and the daughter as well as her two grandsons  have essentially moved into the house. I was not comfortable with this  arrangement, but was assured that it would be over soon. After two weeks  of this situation, I contacted the AirBnB host who had already somewhat  caught wind of what was going on. She tells me that they previously  agreed that no grandchildren were allowed to stay in the house while an  AirBnB guest was there, and this was an agreement the host and the  grandma had made prior to my arrival. The host arrives, and the two have  an explosive argument while I feel guilty for ""causing this mess"".  Afterwards, we hug it out. The date is now June 27.

That weekend, neither the grandchildren nor the daughter were at the house. I thought it was over.

Later  into that workweek, the grandma calls me in desperation and says she  doesn't know where her daughter can stay. She asks if she can have ""one  more day"". I agree. She asks for ""one more day"" for the next few days. I  am going on a trip with my family for a week soon, so I decide to allow  it and hope that when I get back from my trip she will have everything  sorted.

This is not the case. When  I get back, they are here, and when I talk to her about it, I don't  remember the details, but she essentially ""one more day""s me again.  After three more days of this, she comes up the stairs to my room and  asks me questions.

She informs me  that the host would have evicted her had I decided to leave my AirBnB  reservation after the whole argument from a couple weeks prior. She asks  me how much I pay for my reservation, and counts the days her family  had stayed with us (I feel as though they were here more days than she  counts, but I have no evidence). She comes to a number over $500 (for 16  days of them being there, again, sounds low, but I have no hard  evidence), and asks if she pays me that if I'll stay, don't tell the  host, and leave a positive review. Feeling guilty about draining money  from her, I say that half of my rent for this period would work,  totaling $250.

Her exact words are  ""You will get the last 5 and a half weeks to yourself, and you'll get  this money."" I agree. She says she will give me the money a little  before my reservation ends.

Again,  they are gone that weekend, and everything might be okay. Blah blah  blah they are back again the following week. The grandma meets me  outside after work and says she apologizes and that she will raise it to  $300 for the extra days, and that her daughter is getting a new  apartment for her and her children this Saturday. $50 sounds low for an  extra week, but again, I'm trying to help out someone in a clearly  desperate situation, so I agree.

I  left for a friend's on Friday night, but on my arrival on Saturday the  daughter was still here. The grandma works nights and I haven't been  able to talk to her yet, but there are now 3 weeks and 2 days remaining  in my reservation and I have no idea if I can trust whatever she has to  tell me when she wakes up.

The  host also contacted me a few days ago about whether or not things had  been sorted out since our big argument, but I haven't responded out of  fear of losing my (now measly sounding) $300.

Please,  please, please tell me what to do. I feel lied to and cheated and have  spent the vast majority of my stay here living with more people than the  posting on AirBnB states. Part of me wants to ask for a large amount of  money, but the grandma might say that we already had a deal for a  lesser amount. I could contact the host, but that would go against my  agreement with the grandma, and I'm not sure if I can hold the host  financially responsible for the actions of her tenant. I am 21 years old  and this is my first time living somewhere other than a dorm. Please,  please give me advice. I need this to end and I feel I am entitled to compensation.

TL;DR I have spent over a month and a half living with the daughter,  and usually the grandchildren, of one of the tenants at my AirBnB  reservation. What do I do? They are still here.",28Jul2019,1

503,"This isn’t a new concept that was brought in our relationship. It was nothing more than a thought, but he seems to be developing an increasing interest in trying something new. And by new, I mean opening the relationship. 
He says he doesn’t have the strong desire to do it, but he would like the option. He doesn’t want to feel like he’s sneaking around or feel guilty if he were to flirt or want to date other people. 
I can entertain the concept of a threesome/occasionally adding a stranger into the mix, or so I thought. We’d never done anything to act on this. We’re strictly monogamous. The more I think about trying to open our relationship, the more it bothers me and the more sure I am that that’s not something I want my relationship to become or experience. Some can say “don’t knock it until you try it,” but I feel it’s valid to consciously decide something isn’t for you despite not having tried it.

To give a bit of context, she is very shy and introverted. We met around 2 months ago but didnt really talk much, but for the last 2-3 weeks we have been texting a lot. We don't really flirt coz she seems like too shy to flirt on text especially. We both laugh a lot, even when we voice call, and our conversation flows. She sometimes texts me first. When she tells me about her day or anything she always gives all the details.

512,"Hi, please tell me if this post is not alright for this sub, and if I should post it elsewhere. 

If not, I wanted advice on how to get over past bad experiences. Since I was born, I've had many bad things happen to me, I've been sexually assaulted multiple times, I've been the victim of mental, physical and emotional torture from my father, I've been humiliated by my rich family, I've been bullied by my classmates, and I've been chided by my  homophobic mother.

When I was around 6 to 7 years old, a man working at a moving company sexually assaulted me when he was packing my family's things for moving. I didn't even know it was a sexual attack at that time. When I told my family about it, their only response was 'Don't tell anyone, if they find out, no-one will want to marry you' I felt so sad. 

My father was an insanely abusive person. He was very sexist and hated women. He was abusive to my mom and sister, which was mental torture for me, and he also hit me with his hands and a belt sometimes. I hated him. This happened from when I was a child until I was about 14 or 15.

My family, as a whole, is very racist (they hate white, black, and some types of Indian people), they are sexist towards women, and they are homophobic. They also hate people who are not as rich as them. I am poorer than them. So when I was forced to go to family functions, they would ignore or humiliate me, it was awful for me. I felt so hated and alone. I felt ugly, evil, and detested. They treated me like some sort of clown, for no reason.

I was bullied by my classmates for different reasons, the main reason was that I have large breasts, and also because I am a lesbian. I felt so bad, since I cannot change my breast size, and my sexuality. Recently I broke up with a good friend. She was nice to me but also a homophobic person, my sexuality was a wedge between us. She also spoke badly about me because I was happy I won an award in Global Citizenship. I broke it off with her, and a lot of our classmates choose her side, some were neutral. No-one was on my side. 

My mother is the light of my life, I love her so much, but due to being brainwashed from young she doesn't like lesbians. She thinks they are all ugly, fat, and manly, and that many of them over-sexualise women. I am so angry, I told her I'm a lesbian, and them she made me go back into the closet. 

When I was 16, I almost killed myself by jumping off a 12-storey apartment building. But I never did, I was too scared.

So many terrible things have happened to me, my life is a mess. Recently I was accepted to go to University of Sheffield, one of the best universities in the world for computer science, in a beautiful and friendly city, where no-one will discriminate against me for my sexuality. I am so lucky and fortunate to be able to go there.

517,"I'm going to try and keep this slightly general for the sake of anonymity. Also I'm on mobile, so I apologize for formatting issues. 

I (F, early 20s) have ""old"" parents. They had me later in life and now both of my parents are mid/late 60s. My dad has always had heart issues, but has pulled through each time. My mom has always been healthy, but this month she is going to get a scheduled hip replacement and is talking about walkers and such. This in and of itself is jarring to me, and I feel nervous about their aging. As well, we live about 40 minutes away from each other and I see them fairly regularly. 

While I was growing up from 8th grade until I was in college my mom's parents lived with us and needed 24/7 care due to issues with Alzheimer's and another more rare dementia. My dad's dad had Alzheimer's as well, but he passed away from another illness before the Alzheimer's was ""bad"". 

I've already noticed early signs of Alzheimer's in my dad who's pushing 70. FWIW, I have a half brother who is also much older than I am, but he is unreliable in terms of family health issues.

I'm working on dealing with my parents aging, but the thing that I really need the advice on (now that you know my back story) is that I want to move. I've lived basically in the same town my whole life, and I want to go somewhere else! I have a good job in a large company and could look for an open position in almost any state I want and probably be guaranteed the move. I just...don't feel like I can do that. I don't feel like I can leave my parents. My mom is about to need physical therapy, and if I'm right about my dad I've seen what Alzheimer's can do, and my dad is still very good. He's repetitive, but it's still mild. 

I want to be here while my parents are healthy and in their right minds. I expect both will end up mentally gone by the time they're close to 80, assuming my dad makes it that long (his heart really isn't great). I want to be able to take care of my parents the same way they took care of me and took care of my mom's parents. But I also want to move well away from here and live my life in a way that I want to. I doubt I can convince them to move with me. They still have 15 years on their mortgage and are retired. (I know, what type of financial planning had them paying off a house this late in life?

521,"I have been suffering from social anxiety and emetophobia since 4th grade and I'm now in college, about to be 20 years old. I'm still living with my parents since I'm going to University in my home town, and everything is fine at home, except when it comes to my anxiety. 

My brother has been taking medications for most of his life to help him, but i have wanted to stay away from meds since i dont want to become dependent on them to live my life. My dad was borderline abusive when my brother was younger since he didnt, and still doesn't, understand that anxiety is very real and that its out of our control for the most part. He has gotten better over time, but recently he has been very pushy with me to do things that I really usually can't. 

For example, im currently out of the country on ""vacation"" with my mom and dad for a wedding, but vacations are the worst for me as I have 0 time to myself to recharge my social battery, and i usually cant eat well during them. Last night we had a wedding to go to, but i knew as soon as i got there that there were too many people and began to feel very sick immediately. After being in a restroom alone for quite a while, he calls me and asks where i am so i let him know and he shows up, but hes really visibly angry at me and after a while i tell him i need to go back to our hotel and he gets even more mad and says ""just leave."" It turns out that i am physically sick as well with diarrhea since last night and a running fever that im handling with meds, but hes angry with me and my mom for no reason at all. He even says that im making up that i have a fever and diarrhea even when he saw that i had 38 degrees celcius when i took my temp. He makes my anxiety so much worse in situations like this, and i dont know what to do anymore apart from my recent thoughts of just moving out and, if i take it to the extreme, becoming distant and cold with him.

Please, any advice or thoughts would help. I need to deal with his bipolar nature towards my and my brothers anxiety in some way. Also, as a side note, when i said he was borderline abusive when my brother when he was younger, he is no longer like that physically. I know that he cares about us and wants what is best, but he does a really bad job of it. My mom is the only constant help for me since she understands what im going through. Should i resort to meds possibly, or keep looking for therapeutic help. I have tried many therapists, but none have helped me in the slightest, and i havent been able to find someone who can help with my emetophobia either.

523,"After graduating a relatively prestigious private university with a major in Computer Science, I had trouble finding a job right away.  It seemed like everyone I knew, even people far less qualified, were getting sweet jobs, while I struggled.  Despite how hard I worked in school, due to lack of confidence and poor performance on the ""puzzles"" that CS jobs have as their technical interviews, and perhaps other things, I wasn't able to get a job during my senior year.  I panicked and decided I would do a Masters in Computer Science, essentially to buy me some time.  

Also, I had felt I wasn't done with college.  The death of my best friend during the beginning of freshman year left me depressed for most of college, something that never fully went away.  I felt I was robbed of much of my college experience.  I didn't have much success with the ladies.  Although I had many friends with a very large network, I felt I had trouble developing close relationships.  I tend to be socially awkward at parties, something I hoped to fix  about myself during college, but with not much success.  

Now I'm 22, about to start my Masters, finishing up a summer research program.  With my research, I ran into a variety of  technical problems, and none of the professors were able to help me.  I didn't end up accomplishing as much as I wanted to, and the summer feels wasted.  This really made me regret my decisions to stay for a Masters.

 Most of my friends, aside from my two roommates and a few others, have moved to their new jobs or are away for the summer.  I feel my social life dwindling.  I spent my Saturday night alone at home, and when someone from my research group thought they saw me at a party, they messaged me and I felt ashamed to say I was alone at home.

I'm honestly not even sure what my question is.  I just feel immense dissatisfaction with the way my life has turned out and feel powerless. I feel my life is behind both professionally and socially.",28Jul2019,1
524,"I’ve been in a serious relationship for about 5 years, living together for a little over 3. I’m still young and soon to graduate college. I plan on going to a specialty school after I graduate, and it seems I have a lot of being a kid left. Honestly I’m not a super social guy, in my circles I’m think I do well, but otherwise I choose to be a bit reclusive. I really feel like I love this girl, and I’ve known her for quite a while. I don’t feel like anyone gets me like she does, and I’d love to say that she feels the same. She’s smart, pretty, soft spoken yet easily heard. Alone, I do not doubt her at all, and we share most of my favorite things in life.

BUT people always tell me that it’s unlikely that it will work. We seldom argue, and when we do, we find common ground fairly quickly. Is it really that uncommon for young people to be in relationships that are worth while? I just don’t want to be the “oh, not us! We’re different” person. I just really still see great things for this relationship. I still have intimate dreams of her, and miss her heavily when she’s gone. I don’t feel that it stems from a fear of being alone, as I normally feel pretty comfortable that way. 

It’s probably important to note, that I do have a lot of support from my family, her family, and my friends. It’s mostly people that I don’t know very well that are basically planting seeds of doubt. 

Should I be concerned about the relationship? I’ve been told that it probably won’t work out by tons of people of the years, and I’ve always brushed it off. I just want to see if anyone can relate.",28Jul2019,1

526,"(mind you we're both 15 and new to dating) I'm going on a date to an amusement park with a guy next weekend. This will obviously mean lots of one on one time: walking around and going on rides. We go to school together, I liked him so I told him, and we went to a movie together as a first sorta date. I've now realized that a movie was kinda dumb cause we didn't even figure out if we're actually interested in one another cause there was no time to talk. We agreed we needed another chance to hang out to actually get the chance to get to know each other so we're going to an amusement park.

We're both, I guess you could say, more quiet/awkward people so I'm concerned this date could turn out to be a day full awkward silences and general uncomfortableness. It's not like I'd be able to leave early if we decided it wasn't working out cause neither of us can drive yet so we've committed to a full day together.

529,"A few weeks ago, I met some random guy in the supermarket. He just walked up to me and struck a conversation. He seemed cool and mentioned wanting to get together, maybe grab a bite. I had a feeling that he was trying to get me into some sketchy pyramid/MLM scheme but I figured I should just grab some food because maybe he was just trying being friendly and I could always just walk away. (Plus, I'm somewhat new to my area so I don't have many friends.) 

So fast forward to a few days ago, we meet he's trying to get to know me and the more he talks the more disappointed I feel as I realize he's just trying to get me to buy into his scheme. He's asking ""how much money do you want to make? That's it? How about triple that?!"". He mentions his mentors who used to be executives at a major tech company then were lawyers (this sounds like a lie) and they're training him in his ""business"". He says his business is e-commerce, I'm pressing for more info (i.e. what exactly the does) and he just says it's not important, won't tell me a single thing about the ""business""  not even its name. At this point, I'm blind because of all the red flags obscuring my vision. He mentioned he'd been doing this for 3 yrs so I finally ask if he'd mind mentioning how much money he's actually made he just said ""it's not important"", he just wanted to get to know me  trying to make it seem exclusive by ""deciding if he should introduce me to his 'mentors'"".

By this point, I've already mentioned I think it sounds like a MLM or pyramid scheme he says it's not. His main argument was that if I could make enough money to follow my dream or do whatever I wanted, why would I care how it's done, as long as it's legal? For this reason, he wouldn't tell me a thing about his ""business"" other the fact that he makes money through ""links"" (I think he meant URLS, but still, what the fuck?). He just kept saying ""I just want to get to know you to see if we'd work well together."" But wouldn't say anything about the work. He seemed genuinely baffeled that someone wouldn't blindly agree to go in on this. 

I believe that this guy honestly thinks he'll be making 6 or 7 figures from this scheme. I think he was manipulated and will continue to put time and effort into it. I'm wondering if I should just let it be or follow up essentially saying I think he's being scammed and that I could put a reference at my work for him (he says he works part time currently). I don't think I'll convince him, but maybe a little down the road he'll realize it's a scam and I can help him find work. 

Along those lines, I'm wondering a) if I should report him b)if so, to whom can he be reported? I don't have any info other than his name, number. His linkedIn doesn't say anything about his ""business"". I feel like I should do something, otherwise he'll just be trying to get other people in on it.

530,"So when I was 18 I got stupid and was happy with credit card offers and got my first credit cards. Spent the money and the start to a debt life began. I never paid them off, ever thinking of the long run consequences that would arise in the future. Now here I am, 30 still with this bad credit haunting me, I'm more financially smart, still working on it.

But haven't gotten cards or more loans. Still struggling just a tad, but getting over it. Anyways, I think the best way to feel good is to write down the debts you owe now that can help you climb over the bridge to success. Relieves stress and thoughts on your head about never having money.

For me, doing this, guides me to step on foot closer to buying a house one day and being totally debt free. I'm tired of thinking about money and bills, not being able to think about money and happiness.

Also it should be noted that I usually don’t bring gifts to anyone (unless it’s for a birthday or something) and I also don’t receive gifts from people when they go on trips (I might occasionally ask for somebody to buy something for me but I always give them the money beforehand), as receiving gifts in general trigger all sorts of anxiety. Family knows this, it annoys them but they’ve come to accept it.

My mom was going to be my ride from the airport because I have a really late night flight. Then this thing happened and I’m feeling very sad and hurt still, also she still hasn’t apologized and insists her and brother did nothing wrong and the problem is solved now anyway. I’ve been ignoring her to avoid having a full blown fight while I’m still away (I don’t have regular access to wifi so I’ve pretended I’m not getting messages and phone calls cut off). But she’s been texting and calling more often, since my flight is tonight.

I don’t know if I should answer her with my flight information, get her a gift, and deal with this later, or standing my ground. If I tell her getting my own ride back won’t be an issue at all, she will get super mad. 

I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t want to give in to her, but getting constant phone calls and ignoring them until it goes to voicemall is also giving me anxiety.

Any advice?",28Jul2019,2
533,"I'm a freaking idiot. I got scammed out of 130,000 yen and a photo of my passport might have been taken. Had to make a throwaway account to avoid the embarrassment.

A little background of my situation:

Yesterday was my last night in japan, so I thought I go have some fun at soapland. I walked towards a place called ""Tokyo Hentai Club"" in Shinjuku for the first time and was approach by a guy just as I was about to go in, he told me that the shop is currently full and told me to follow him, being drunk at the time I did. He proceeded to bring me to another guy who happens to speak perfect Chinese (I'm Chinese), they showed me pictures of girls on their phones for me to choose, and also the course. I pick a girl and an hour course for 30,000 yen which they told me to pay, immediately. after which, they mention that there is a 50,000 yen security deposit which would be returned to me after the session. this should have been strike one but apparently drunk me thinks with his penis so I paid the man. After which they brought me to hotel to ANOTHER guy who also spoke great Chinese, they told me the girl is preparing now and told me to wait. They left me alone in the lobby for a good 15min, I should have left then but I didn't, they came back and told me that there's an addition security deposit for the room for another 50,000 yen, which again, like the idiot I was, paid.

&amp;#x200B;

He then ask to see my passport to confirm my age, I showed it to him and I'm not too certain, but it felt like he took a photo of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally They then brought 2 more tourist to the hotel lobby who was also paying them with this ""security deposit"", after which they proceeded to tell us to go up the elevator, and told us to wait at respectively at the top 3 floors of the hotel where the girls will come out and lead us to the rooms. I arrived at the top and waited around 10min before sudden realizing I have read this EXACT scam online a couple years back, quickly I went down to see the other two other tourist to tell them we've been scammed. But it was too late, the dudes were long gone. 

&amp;#x200B;

The first tourist was a chinese guy like me, got scammed out of 140,000 yen, and the other was a korean dude who lost like 350,000 yen

&amp;#x200B;

I arrived back home today, I don't even cared about the money I got scammed out of but I have extremely worried feeling about the passport. I'm not too sure if they took a picture or not, but assuming they did, what would they be able to do with it? is there anything I should do? What SHOULD I do?

537,"I could write a novel about my friendship with this guy but I will try to keep to the important details. 

I have a very close bond with my best friend and we get each other on a level that we don’t have with other people. This past year, he decided to take care of his alcoholism and go to rehab. He was sober for about a month and was doing really great. Our friendship was also thriving at this time. Then he gradually started drinking at different events/occasions until it got to the point where now he is slipping back into old habits. 

He’s admitted to me he drinks more than he’d like to admit and I know he knows it’s becoming a problem. I often wonder during our conversations whether he’s sober or not. There are times when I’m almost completely sure he is drunk but I’d hate to assume and be wrong so I’m hesitant to say anything. Today I decided to speak up because he was slurring his words and I could tell he wasn’t fully there for our conversation. It got frustrating because I don’t like who he is at all when he’s drunk. It’s just a waste of my time to talk to him and in the back of my mind I’m also super worried about him. 

So today’s the day, I decided to speak up and say “i think you’ve been drinking today and honestly I don’t care to talk with you when you are drunk. I think this is becoming bad again and you should get back into rehab or start going to meetings again.” As I expected, he got really defensive and said he wasn’t drinking and it’s not fair for me to assume without giving the chance to have a dialogue. I’m not sure what to do because there is a 1% chance in my mind that I’m wrong and I don’t want to wonder every time we’re speaking whether he’s drunk or not. He thinks it’s really offensive that I would say he’s lying because I’m the one person he was really open with during his journey of getting sober. 

I see where he’s coming from but He’s admitted to me he’s drinking again and I know him so well that I think I can tell when he’s not sober. But I don’t want to be wondering every time we talk or be so skeptical of him all the time. I told him I don’t care to argue specifics about when I think he’s been drinking. I just want him to work on getting sober again. But I’m just looking for advice on how to proceed in this friendship with him always thinking I’m judging him and me always having that question in the back of my mind whether he’s sober or not.",28Jul2019,1

539,"Hey everyone, my friend has been talking about how she is menatlly ill (she has been self diagnosing) and I don't know what I should do. Also, we are both 16 and in highschool and I feel so bad for thinking she could be faking it.

For the past few months she has been talking a lot about how she has anxiety and is depressed. I think she might be faking it because her reasons for having an anxiety disorder are that she has trouble sleeping at night (actually just stays up past 1am playing on her phone) and that she gets stressed before coming to school occasionally. She is also extremely open about it, which definitely doesn't seem like something someone who was actually struggling with a mental illness would be comfortable with. When I have confronted her about her tiredness and told her she should get herself to go to bed at a reasonable time she said that she doesn't like routine, which again isn't really something someone with an anxiety disorder would say.

Also she says that she is depressed, again this is all self diagnosed. Whenever I tell her that she should get help she says back to me that she won't get help until I get help (i have kinda bad eating patterns and she acts as if I have an eating disorder) which makes me feel kinda annoyed because I'm not the one who keeps talking about how they are struggling because they are mentally ill.

She likes to make a lot of suicide jokes and other jokes about being mentally ill as well, and likes a lot of depression memes on instagram, as in publically likes them so people can see that she has been looking at memes about suicide. I know that some people use humor and stuff as a coping mechanism, but I'm not sure in her case.

I feel so bad and I don't know what to do, because  there is a chance that something really is going on. I know she doesn't have any issues going on with her family btw. I just need some advice about how to approach her and encourage her to get help if needed. I'm in Australia and at our school we have free psychology services and it is kept confidential, so I've trying to encourage her to go.

TL;DR: my friend has been self diagnosing and says she is mentally ill, her behaviour suggests otherwise and I think she is faking it but despite this I've encouraged her numerous times to talk to someone about it and I don't know what to do next.",28Jul2019,0

548,"**TL;DR**: A large group of friends and I rented out a lakeside cottage for two weeks this summer and the entire affair is becoming downright unbearable. There's too much noise and chatter, people are egging each other on and really catty and exclusive cliques are forming within this group that are alienating many of the quieter individuals. All of this activity revolves around a young man I regret ever inviting to this house, who is the group's golden boy and who everyone hangs on to for no discernible reason other than the fact that he's hot. He's crass, flippant, and attention-seeking and inexplicably walks around half-naked everywhere and he's the one that seems to be setting the tone for how crazy and rude everyone else is becoming.

**TL;DR of the TL;DR:** I feel like Gatsby upon the realization that no one actually likes him and is just using him for parties. It's becoming unbearable, there's a week left and I just want to ho home. No, I want to kick that guy out but can't.

**How do I cope? What happens in the aftermath? Will I ever be able to look at these friends the same way ever again? Should I just get new friends after this?**

**Or am I overreacting? Am** ***I*** **the asshole?**

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is going to sound straight out of a reality TV show, but hear me out.

My family has a time-honoured tradition of renting out this large lakeside cottage to spend our summers. Now that I've finally started university and live on my own, I wanted one last, nostalgic throwback to this tradition and so a large group of school friends and I promised to go on vacation.

Here we are, a lakeside cottage and it's almost August. The sun is scorching, the swimming cold and the drinks overflowing in multicoloured plastic coolers strewn throughout the kitchen. We have breakfasts on the veranda and sleep in as late as we want.

And I, to put it frankly, cannot stand these people anymore.

Though nothing too rowdy or even remotely property damaging is taking place, the cacophony is constant and no one ever seems to sleep for long. There's regrettable meme music playing from someone's speaker at all times, and people will spend all day chattering in the kitchen, the living room, on the porch with seemingly no escape. The conversation topics get raunchier and raunchier, and tensions are starting to brew between the louder, closer-knit ones and the ones at the fringes of this friend group who feel not only excluded but overwhelmed. I've already had to console a close friend of mine before they ultimately decided against going home.

There are more than definite cliques forming, a sort of nucleus of the larger friend group which is the most active and seems to enjoy pushing out the quieter members in search of more excitement, more raunchy bullshit. They're starting to become outright disrespectful, a group of self-absorbed and clashing personalities seemingly more interested in getting more attention for themselves than really being friends.

All of this trouble revolves around a young man with whom I was not particularly close to before this trip began. I knew *of* him more than I knew him, a peripheral acquaintance who featured in many of my morning history classes and was developing a podcast on Roman history and philosophy (the only reason we started talking, being a massive Romanophile myself). I didn't know he would be this unhinged, and I regret ever inviting him to this house.

Despite his flippant and irresponsible attitude towards all manner of things in life, and his horrifying penchant for just walking around half-naked all the time, everyone adores him. I suppose it makes sense -- my social circle tends to be predominantly gay guys and women, and he is objectively very attractive, if incredibly vain and quite casually bigoted in a way I still can't wrap my head around. He's been hitting on all of my friends, talking loudly about his sexual conquests, and trying to hook up with everyone he can. He makes a lot of racist jokes and is about as responsible as a child, but people inexplicably don't seem to mind and will literally sit around and wait for him to make his appearance every morning so they can talk to him. They have pet names for him. He is their fucking ringleader.

I feel like getting rid of him would get rid of the whole problem.

But, of course, I can't do that. Everyone adores him, and even I, the one who organized this whole trip in the first place, feel as if I am being slowly squeezed out of this group as everyone begins to revolve solely around him, him, him. He eggs them on to do crazy things, or perhaps they do crazy things to impress him. I can't tell him to go home, and he's wormed his way into everyone's hearts and minds like a pubescent infatuation.

I have a feeling he's here to stay, and I can't stand it.",28Jul2019,1
549,"It's not a life ruining mistake, but Im feeling pretty embarrassed. I applied for a local job position. I was recommended to the supervisor by some life long family friends. Last year I took a few classes to get some of the required certifications. Because of school I couldn't actually use them until now.
I went into the jobsite and submitted my application for the position. The supervisor asked me for a specific certification, and under the assumption that it was one of the certifications I completed last year. It turns out, out of the 3 certifications I got, none of them were the one he was asking me to provide. When asked if i could provide it I panicked. It's my fault for not being aware of what I had, but Im eager to get a job (especially one that others have recommended me for). Now I feel embarrassed and like I let the people who recommended me down. I have to produce it soon in order to get the job, which I know Isnt possible. I know I need to tell the truth, but im afraid its going to make me look like an idiot and probably disappoint a few people. Any suggestions how I can handle this?",28Jul2019,1
550,"I am a 17 year old boy and have had a crush on my third cousin (several months younger) for about a year. We live in separate countries, so we see each other very rarely on holidays. Two summers ago all the cousins went on a week-long family holiday, and while I can’t remember exactly why I remember thinking that she may be romantically interested in me. I was only semi-interested at this point. After the trip was over, we occasionally texted each other (she initiated it) but once school had started that year it happened less and less. This summer the family went on another week-long trip together. This was when I really started thinking that she had a large crush on me, and also when I began to fall for her. At the beginning of the trip, I noticed that she would often sneak glances at me, and listen to my conversations with other cousins even when not part of them. We began to talk 1 on 1 more throughout the trip, at first I would initiate this but she also did, and she began to be less of a nervous high-schooler and showed more of her weird (in a good way) and funny side. I noticed that she would laugh at my jokes even when they weren’t particularly funny or imaginative, and when we talked she would maintain constant eye contact and smile. Whenever there was a time to sit down she would often go out of her way to sit near me. Each night we would play board games with the rest of the cousins and even in the group setting we would joke and talk directly to each other. A few times on the trip, my other cousins asked about my current girlfriend. My crush would seem to not talk during these times but still listen, and when that topic ended we would resume our usual happy conversation. On the last night of the trip, I decided that I should confess my feelings to her and see if she reciprocated them. At the time I was 95% sure she would. Early in the night she asked me if I wanted to play ping pong with her. We maintained an entertaining and lively conversation throughout the game and whilst walking back to our rooms. We both showered and then joined the rest of our young cousins to play board games. We ended up staying awake till around 5:30am that night, sharing an insightful and personal conversation with one of our older cousins (female). While personal and covering some serious topics, the conversation was still lighthearted, and we all shared many laughs that night. We ended up talking about my girlfriend a little. I said that I was generally happy with the relationship but didn’t want to commit so early in my life. Eventually our older cousin fell asleep, and we decided to go back to our rooms to sleep. Not sure if this detail is especially relevant but that night I kept eye contact with her longer than usual even when we weren’t talking and she would maintain it for a while then look away and smile. When we got outside, I asked if I could tell her something. I told her that I had feelings for her, it had taken me a while to realize and I understood the restrictions (distance and that we are cousins) but I wanted to know how she felt. She responded in a way that I interpreted as either that she never considered me romantically or that she recognized the numerous restrictions and didn’t want to become invested. She said something along the lines of; I appreciate you being honest, I had a really good time tonight but I don’t see us progressing romantically. I told her I understood, and we said goodnight to each other and went back to our rooms. In hindsight, I should’ve asked her if she felt the same way but at the time I was too surprised and letdown to remember to do so. Did I mess up somewhere? Did the fact I have a girlfriend make it awkward? Was I misreading her signals this whole time? Or is there another possibility that I have not considered. I would greatly appreciate any comments, advice, or similar stories that any of you may have.

TLDR: Throughout the course of a 1 week family holiday I noticed numerous signs of interest from my cousin of similar age (17), who I also have a crush on. When I told her how I felt, she told me that she appreciated me being honest but she didn’t see us progressing romantically. Was I misreading these signs or is there another possibility that I have not considered?",28Jul2019,1
551,"So this friend I’ve had for about a year has begun to raise some red flags that I’m not altogether comfortable with, and as the title(?) suggests I need advice processing. Also, this is my first time posting here, so I apologise if the formatting is messy.

(context) Due to university reasons, my friend group has been pretty split over staying in our hometown, and moving to the city which is only about an hour away — we all manage to stay in touch quite well. 

Anyways, she’s shown what I’ve read to be ‘signs of a toxic friend’; she only ever wants to talk about herself and her struggles, she always seems to be involved in some kind of unsavoury drama, and will only contact me to discuss those things or to ask for favours. She’s  remarkably hypocritical in that she’ll berate her other friends for a certain kind of behaviour, and then participate in it. She forces labels and pushes physical boundaries with me, despite me having stated that I’m not comfortable, she always finds a way to make me feel guilty about getting upset at something hurtful she’s done to me, and - though I’m not sure if this plays into it at all - I’m almost 100% sure that she’s stolen a couple articles of clothing from me.

I’m not sure if I’m overreacting, or if all people are usually like this and I just need to grow up a little, but I feel so ridiculously drained every time our friends go out. I’m never able to even spend time with anyone else as she’ll cling to me all night and not let me talk. Tangents, but I digress, I don’t know what to do about this relationship, any advice is really appreciated.",28Jul2019,3

553,"I’ve tried going to college two years, first with a full scholarship but I dint know what I wanted to study, I lost that scholarship the second year so i tried getting my grades up to get that scholarship back thinking I would and start studying something I might have the idea of or persé  

it’s the first idea that comes up when It comes to study for college. I lost that opportunity because of personal and emotional reasons(got tired of taking random classes that weren’t for my concentration and having to get my gpa up) Now I can only go to a private college, meaning I will probably have to take loans or try to pay as much as I can with a fasfa grant and my own earned money. I’m planning to study Quemistry as I did before, this time I start taking all the classes for my concentration so that will maybe motivate me to move forward and study more than before.  

It’s annoying how that’s the only thing that comes to mind, I want to work in the marijuana industry (laboratory and such and good paying job) for the matter, but I’m really not sure still, maybe I’m just scared of going back and failing like the last two years, but at the same time I want to go back and start something for my future even if a degree isn’t all that great for some people.  

Besides, if I don’t go to college, I will probably stay in my stagnation loop ever since I stopped going to college before, I might say I felt better when I was at college in a sense, because rn just working a dead end job has made me worse mentally and emotionally. So what do you think? start college again is a good choice ? even if it’s with probably student loans or if not maybe a whole lot tighter in money or stay at a dead end job with financial commodity and stay stagnating? 

I know I don’t need to stagnate while staying at a dead end job but just the idea of being at one just demotivates me further into what I’m stuck in. I just probably feel guilty being suspended and not going  to the full scholarship uni and pulling through, I mean I dint know what I wanted to study so I just freaked out about why I was there in the first place, I was irresponsible for leaving but at the moment it felt as the best thing I could do.  would aprecciate opinions. I think I have my answer from all this venting but you know, I still aprecciate encouragement or advice.",28Jul2019,1

555,"Buckle in, this gets complicated.... 
In a not so tiny nutshell, me and my boyfriend converted the bottom of our house into an airbnb which he helps host. Everything has been running smoothly, until a young family with a baby moved in. 

It started out on airbnb, they moved into town from Miami and wanted to rent our place for a week. Great! Then they renewed for another week. Even better! In this time, I got to know the family, they were so nice, treated the space well, and were respectful. 

Well, it was let on that they were going to renew again, so I let their time run out, and on the last day - they failed to renew. I didn't notice immediately and assumed my BF had spoken to them, and it wasn't until the day after that I realized they weren't rebooking. I asked them what was up and she came clean that they were struggling for cash, and the extra fees on airbnb were killing them. Reluctantly, I agreed to move off the protection of the platform, reduce the daily price from 80 to 50 for a long term stay if they got renters insurance and gave us copies of the policy info. 

At this time they reduced from a week at a time, to every few days paying us on venmo. The husband is a boat mechanic, and took their rental during the day to get to odd jobs while she stayed home with the baby. Well, money was still tight after that next week, so I tried to help and put out a recommendation on next door for her so she could find cleaning jobs. I got TONS of responses for her and gave her name out to at least 30 people who asked for it. 

Everything seemed to be going better, until again they lapsed payment again. The day they lapsed they assured me she had a job coming and would pay me immediately. I decided to flex and give them some time, meanwhile my family was coming I to town. During this time, expecting payment soon, I bought food for my family and a steak dinner for my mother's birthday. Well, Saturday came (the agreed upon deadline), no payment. Sunday. No payment. I reminded them that I needed the cash immediately or Monday I was going to be overdrafted. Monday my Bills hit... STILL no payment and I get overdrafted. I asked what the heck was going on, pushed harder, and Tuesday I finally got paid. They didn't offer to pay the overdrafts, and I didn't ask for it back in an effort to help. 

The following weekend me and my boyfriend had a previously planned trip coming and were to be out of town. I moved from daily payment to every couple of days so they could catch up, and again on the deadline set they failed to deliver the money and also disappeared to go on a trip to FL to see family for their 1 year olds bday. Well, we come back from our trip, they come back with an additional child, and were happy to show me videos of this great airbnb on a river they stayed at. 

Now I'm usually pretty easy going, but I'm not going to lie, still not having payment while they went on an outing kinda pissed me off. Eventually, days and days late. I get paid again. Behind and having a hard time catching up now, she offers to trade food stamps for discounts off of what she owed. Reluctantly, again, I agree and take the trade as we needed food, and I really wanted to help them out. 

The next day they excitedly tell me that on their trip, that he just scored some bomb medical from Miami. Later I smell weed under my porch. I used to smoke myself, so it doesn't bother me... but again. Kinda a slap in the face to be told ""oh we don't have the money yet"" and they are spending their spare cash on weed instead of paying me. 

At this point I'm getting pretty mad. But I get it. They are struggling, green helps anxiety, I know they are stressing, so whatever. I'll forgive.

At this time they lose access to their rental and were relying on uber, ended up being cheaper for them just to uber to their odd jobs than to pay for the car. We also moved to weekly payments so again... they could try to build up their cash. I sat them down, let them know that they HAVE to stay on their payments, I can't keep having this crazy all over the place payment stuff, as I'm on a thin budget myself. I let them know the serious situation they can put me in by not paying me... and they understood. We set a hard deadline of every tuesday they pay 400$. 

Me and my boyfriend just got back from a 10 day vacation, where in that time I said he could work on boats at the house to build cash and work on multiple boats at once while we were gone.  Well again, they are late paying us despite promises promises that he already had cash ready for me. Their hard deadline paying us on tuesday was again not met, telling us another sob story of not being able to catch up. Truthfully, it breaks my heart, but I can't keep covering for them. It's now Sunday, I haven't gotten paid still, and they now owe us 510$ up to today, and they are about to overdraft me again. They put me behind on MY finances by not paying, and are about to do it again. 

I spoke to the local sheriff, he told me they are committing (at this point) felony fraud against an innkeeper. In reality, I don't think they mean to, but their priorities aren't in line, I'm not being paid on time consistently, and right now we are on our way back to the house...

I don't know how to deal with this delicately... my boyfriend no longer wants them there. I've spent the last three days of our vacation upset, nearly overdrafted again, and so sad because if they don't want to leave peacefully, I'm going to have to get the police involved, and may have to press charges to get the money we are owed.  

I want to make some sort of trade deal again, but how can I help them and myself? I feel like shit kicking out a family with two kids... but I can't keep doing this. Where can they go? Are there programs for them? Idk.",28Jul2019,2

558,"So i'll start by saying this is a throwaway account to protect my identity, the last thing i want is to get recognised on here. 

It started when i was around 14/15 when i first asked my parents for some help with my agoraphobia/depression, i left school when i was 14 as i wasn't able to go most of the time because of anxiety, i'm talking 30-40% attendance in a entire year.  So i told them all about how i felt honestly, at first i was thinking they are very understanding of my situation and could really relate to me. Based on that you would think i would have been helped but nope there has been barely any help from my parents at all, in fact its quiet the opposite. The only time they have ever helped me is when they can also benefit from it as well, i first went to the doctors when i was around 18 but the appointment was more about my dad asking the doctor for a fit note so i can start claiming benefits. Now i am not against claiming benefits to pay rent and help them pay for the food i eat etc. But i had been asking almost all the time 3 years previous to this including my grandparents continuously telling them i need help. I got prescribed anti depressants, but this just made me feel even worst, stopping me from eating and sleeping aswell so i stopped taking them after a week or two. I started going back to the doctors monthly but it was pretty much only for a fit note as my dad did pretty much all the talking because i am not so good at talking to people outside. After a few months i got issued a medical assessment ( this is where you go to people and they determine if your fit for work ) my dad sent me in alone so they can see me exactly how i am alone outside. In my head this was a good idea but at the same time i really really didn't want this and i expressed this to my dad. Regardless of my concerns he sent me in alone, so i got on with the appointment and got out shaking like a leaf. Anyways a few weeks come by and i don't know what i did wrong but they determined i was fine to work. Even tho i had expressed deeply that i hadn't been outside in about 3 years and even then i really really struggled going outside. Anyways that doesn't matter i thought, its help i need not money but at the same time i felt bad because now i am living at home not paying any money to my parents. So i went back to asking my parents all the time to take me to doctors so i can get the help that i badly need, but just like before i got no help and i think its because i couldn't claim again for 6 months since my decline from the benefit people. Anyways about 7 months later they finally take me to the doctors and yet again its the same thing just asking for a fit note for me not anything about help. Even tho i had expressed to them multiple times that i had been experiencing suicidal thoughts at this point. So i went into a no fucks given mood and foolishly singed up for college not thinking about the last 4-5 years at this point of not going outside at all. As you can expect this went very very badly, i tried my best to get out but it only lasted about 2 months before i was kicked from the course based on my attendance. I yet again expressed to my parents that i felt at my worst and was getting very mentally ill. Yet again no gain for them so no help because i didn't want to claim benefits as i wanted to see if they would help there own son when money wasn't involved. As you can expect there was no help. This is when i was getting very mentally ill ( around 19-20 at this point ) i felt i was wasting my potential when i'm indoors all the time, i started self harm around this time and just badly wanted help. About 8 months later i agreed to claim again and as you can expect my parents almost immediately "" helped me "". as you can expect it was just all about my fit note again no real talk of my mental stability. Even when i tried to talk about stuff my dad would interrupt me and kinda blow it off, then talk about himself and the bad stuff that happened to him. About 3 months ago we had a argument and they was complaining at me saying i have been living here for years paying no money and i should be thanking them that they haven't kicked me out yet. They was saying how they feed me and keep a room over my head, but now i'm just confused, am i the one in the wrong here ? i have been nothing but polite to them everyday. I ALWAYS thank them after every meal and ask before i take anything from the kitchen then thank them after. In the past they have asked to use my name because they are in to much debt on all internet providers so i have agreed to let them use my name only if they pay the bills. They have taken stuff out in my name illegally without my consent putting me 500+ in debt. I feel i have always been so good to them but yet they don't see it that way. Now i'm just confused and don't know if i'm in the wrong here. Am i in the wrong for depending on them so much to help me?   


Its really starting to get me super down and i'm just thinking maybe there better off without me. My mental stability has gotten to the point where i am sometimes hearing very quiet whispers that sound like there coming from the next room. Normally when people are in the next room i think they are whispering about me. Its really really horrible but to make matters worst i can't understand what the whispers are saying so it makes my anxiety much worst around them because sometimes they do trash talk me whispering in the next room. Anyways this is kinda a very long story short because it really does depress me thinking about it all but there is much much more.

559,"My best friend is the most kind hearted person I know, she works harder than anyone I know and will sacrifice herself for the sake of others.

I've always loved her mother, but her problem with alcohol has progressively gotten worse over the past few years. It's undoubtedly always been there but it's really taking it's toll on my friend.

The worst part is the own and run a bar. Alcohol is unavoidable.

She's 22, trying to balance working full time with working in the bar in the evening, and a relationship with a guy that lives 1.5/2 hours away.

Yesterday she noticed a glass of brandy tucked out of sight and lashed out at her mother. She gave out to her for drinking behind the bar (which is something that upsets her because it sabotages the business) and she was upset because her grandmother is staying at their house and she's also drinking while she's there.

My friend got in her car and drove off to get out. On her return she realised that her mother had driven off. She was missing for hours. No way of contacting her. My friend was worried sick and her dad went driving looking for her mother...

My friend apologised to her mother this morning. Her mother said she wouldn't have come back if she wasn't on her antidepressants. Her mother says manipulative things like this to guilt trip her. 

This is so fucked up to me. She's a sensitive girl and this really upset her.

I got really fucking mad

&amp;#x200B;

I use diapers for my lizards ""substrate"" and normal towels underneath in case he doesn't poop on diapers.

Also when his stone gets dirty i clean it and let it dry and use a towel (normal) and roll it up so he can use it for basking instead of a stone.

My father also wanted to restrict me from using these also but i seriously freaked out and said

&amp;#x200B;

""You can't take those away from me those are necessary (i lied they aren't necessary) and he needs them (he doesn't), i completely understand why you took away towels from me but you can't take these (i didn't understand shit).""

I knew that i shouldn't say it like that but it was the only way in convincing him.

Is this just tactical persuasion or plain manipulation?

To get some shit clear, when i said they are necessary i knew they aren't necessary and that i could've used paper towels instead of that but paper towels get wet from shit easily and stuff so yeah they were necessary in a way that a dog bowl is necessary to a dog - it's easier to feed your dog with it.

562,"I apologize for the long nature of this, there is a tldr at the bottom. 

I’ve had this friend for almost four years and I’ll admit at first I had a bit of a crush on her. I told her this but the feeling wasn’t mutual. It was alright and I didn’t hold any kind of grudge and figured I’d rather have a good friend than anything else.

When it comes to my friends I want to help them anyway I can. Whether it be hanging out, giving advice, food, and even money. 

This friend I know was having some money troubles, and even though she came from a family with money she didn’t want to ask them. So I helped where I could. Bought her lunch just to help her out. I was doing it because I would help anybody who is my friend. But lunches became groceries, and then it just kind of became “I want a donut too” or “can I borrow money to pay bills?” I didn’t say anything but I realized maybe I was helping out too much.

I got a new job in a different city and told her that if anything came up I’d help her get it. So cut to a couple months later and I helped her get a job at my new work place. The job pays more and has better benefits compared to her old job. At first when she moved she needed help to getting started, so it was me helping her out. First she promised to pay me back when she got her first “real paycheck”, then something came up and she couldn’t do it, offering to do it next month. Then after a while it just became quiet. When I told her I didn’t want money to get in the way of her friendship she said the same thing and said she would pay me back. But that was some time ago, almost a year ago. But she had money for her family and friends Christmas gifts, parents birthday gifts, two tattoos, piercings, things for her long distance boyfriend, and a trip to another country. 

Why didn’t she ask her parents, her boyfriend, or even other friends she knew for help? I don’t have nearly as many friends as she does yet I’m probably the only person she’s asking. I originally wanted to help a friend but the more and more I think about it, the more I ask why was I just asked? I keep thinking it’s selfish and wrong to ask this question, that it might be unfair and seen as some kind of attempt to make it about a crush I don’t have anymore if I bring up that she’s never asked her boyfriend along with the other groups of people in her life that I’d like to mention. 

I’m not one to get confrontational with people and I’m worried with her it’s just going to be a shouting match with nothing solved. I’m not a fighter and I’ve seen things get nasty with her. One time she said she needed money to pay for a bill and I let out an audible sigh. She got offended at me sighing and I apologized for that. After that incident I honestly lost a lot of trust in this friend. I don’t have many friends and I really have a hard time trusting people for a lot of issues from growing up. 

Now she’s decided she wants to go back home after a year and I have this feeling she’s never going to pay me back. The only thing is would it be worth it to confront her? She’s been telling me because she’s leaving and she knows I have a hard time making friends, that I need to trust people more, and let people into my life, but I just want to tell her I can’t trust people, especially with how she’s treated me. 

TL-DR- Is it worth asking my friend to be paid back for money I’ve lent them after seeing them spend money on things like gifts, tattoos, friends, family, and their boyfriend? Also, is it unfair to bring to attention she has other people on her life, including her parents, her other friends, and her boyfriend.",28Jul2019,2

***this is the backstory***


Basically what happens is that my boyfriend and I broke up about a year and a half ago. We lasted 3 years. That relationship was perfect. He decides that we should break up because we were so young and literallly didnt know how to live withoit one another since we literally grew up being together. (we started dating when I was 15 and he was 14) I am now 19. everyone told us that it was just puppy love etc etc but we both knew we were meant for each other. we started out as bffs and we ended the relationship still commited to continue being bffs. we tried but of course, when we saw each other we went and kissed again and blablabla. we couldn’t be “just friends” obviously. i realized that he wanted to have me for himself but he wanted to be single at the same time, it was just a mess. he wanted me without the commitments. Ik we both were very immature. 

later i thoight that he was kinda using me because he was undecided of what he wanted and i thought he had already get over me. so i de odes to start dating a friend of mine and it was unexpected. he was friends with my ex too because were both from the same group of friends. my ex did not take it well and everythint went to shit. we both suffered a lot, him obviously and i because i suffered for him and because i felt bad that i did this to him. later he startes texting me really bad things and basically saying things out of rage that ended up hurting us both. 

later i grew thick skin and discovered that i was not mentally ot emotionally ready for commitment and decided i should break up with the guy. 

my ex and i spoke and he asked me for forgiveness because he of course did not meant any of what he said and he basically matured a bit after the whole thing happened and we ended up in good terms. he realized he treated me like a dumbass and an asshole and that everything had happen for a reason then thanked me for always being nice and calm with him even tho he was an asshole with me. 



***Here’s the real problem***



After we fixed things and we both asked for forgiveness everything was fine. until one nate we kissed again and we confessed how much we missed each other and how much we really love each other. 


we ended up being together in secret for about six months. we were something but both were with the same mentality that we did not want anyone to know about this etc etc.

its was great. we are both so inlove with each other. the thing is, that now i am going to college to the US. he is staying in my country and he is already attending college there. in his college he met a girl and he talked to me about her and as soon as he mentioned her i knew something was going to happen. 

he denied because he doesnt like her that much but she’s cool. he loves me truly and we both know that we’re meant for each other. we both want t be together, however, he hasnt been or had anything with another girl ever, so i took all the courage and understanding i had in me and told him to try something out with her, he needs to also discover what he likes and if he really wants me. he says he already knows and he is not sure about having something with someone else because he is willing to be with me. but we dont want to do long distance because that will affect us even more than if we end up splitting up. 

we talked about this and we saw each other and he still grabs my thigh or my hand etc. later that day i discovered that the day before he had seen the girl and they kissed. of course that broke my heart because i love him and he told me he did not want anything serious with that girl because she is not what he wants. but he did not tell me that “nothing serious” meant a “fling”. so of course we ended up being heartbroken because he did not think that through and he wanted to tell me but he did not know how to. he now feels so bad because he felt that i did not deserve that but he still believes we are soulmates. we both know that. however i understood his decision and i want him to have something with someone else since im moving and he will basically be alone here. the only option was ro at least have a fling with someone. 

however now i decided that i should be mature and respect his decision. we still talk. however i try to be the most comprehensive as i can be and i try to not think about the situation but that is all i ever think about. we both want to stay together but he is afraid of being left alone and of losing me so he is basically risking everything here. idk. it’s just theres nothing we can do about the situation and since everything is a secret (because if i tell my friends, everyone will tell me all kinds of shit because i got back with him blabla. but they dont understand what we’ve been through and how he actually acknowledges the wrong things he has done to me and how he regrets it). 

i cry everynight, and i know he is suffering too because he just is afraid of being alone and he wants me to stay so we can be together again, but that just makes me even more sad. knowing that we both want something and the time is just not right for us. it hurts so much and i suffer in silence because i dont want him to feel the way i felt when i tried something with someone else and he made me suffer. he is thankful and he says that he does not deserve me because i treat him so well and i am so understanding. however i dont know how he will not deserve me, he is literally the light of my life and i am his. 

he tells me that he is willing to change and become better because he feels devastated for hurting the person he loves most and cares for most. he tells me that if i want to vent with him i can do so and he will listen, but i dont want him to suffer seeing me suffer  


everything just really really hurts. and i am fighting through this one alone.",28Jul2019,1

The last few relationships I’ve had have ended because the person wasn’t feeling attracted to me anymore. I feel like people get attracted by this shiny veneer that’s not at all how I really am, which is scared and anxious and depressed. I’ve noticed that I feel this fearfully towards about other stuff (dancing especially) and will avoid it at all costs even if I want to join in.

It’s gotten to the point where I don’t even want to think about casually hooking up, and I almost see it like an addiction: if a recovering alcoholic could successfully take a pill to prevent them from wanting to binge drink, wouldn’t they?

We have been here about a year and I'm getting fed up with the constant contact with my family, especially my grandma. It's not that I dont want to see them or to be around them, it's more the fact that they are constantly coming by unannounced, calling, just generally forcing themselves into our lives without any warning. A common example being: my grandma will make food, well enough for 6-8 people and bring it by after multiple attempts on my part to deny it. I like to cook and normally make dinner 3-4 nights a week. Last night I made dinner for my wife and I and we have enough leftovers for another day. I'm not denying it out of spite or anything like that. We just want our privacy (being from the south, at least where im m from family is supposed to be your number one priority). Even after several phone calls from my grandma and me telling her I'm not interested, she'll still bring by bags of food and other things we've told her we dont want.

He then puts his dick in me. I told him “no” and “stop” over and over the whole time but he didn’t. When he was done I went to the bathroom and went from numb to furious.

A few days ago I've slowly moved from doubtful to nearly certain about myself being transgender. Within the community, this is known as ""cracking"" out of our ""egg"". Now I know that the people who browse this subreddit are not as well versed on this subject as people on say r/lgbt or other subreddits like that. The reason I'm here is because of a number of reasons that I believe will not be healthy in the long term and want help with.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm male to female. Ask anyone who is transgender and they'll probably tell you that they experienced some kind of dysphoria, meaning that they don't feel like they're in the right body. I can sympathize and I have felt that in the last few days. My reaction to all of this news was very emotional. I went for a run hoping to clear my head but it did the opposite. My mind feels like it's just switched to TV static and the things that I used to enjoy I no longer do. I want to curl up in my bed and sit there all day. Since I am 16 years old and it's summer time, I should be able to do that, right? Nope. I'm signed up for a Pre Calculus course and I also am getting tutored in writing and I have 3 classes with summer work. It means that I have very little free time and I especially knew this going into this weekend. 

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't come out to anyone in real life. A week and one day ago, my dad learned that I was bisexual, which is something I've been sure of since I was a child. His response was not what I expected nor what I had hoped for. He essentially said, ""so you think you're bisexual?"". I know this doesn't sound like much, but the tone he spoke in as well as his reaction was one of doubt. For those of you who don't know, being bi is basically the tamest of all the LGBT... identities. Needless to say, I don't feel comfortable at all if I were to come out as trans.

&amp;#x200B;

By now you're probably wondering where the part of me asking for advice is, and it's now. With all of this happening, I have not felt like myself. I love my parents, yet I am trying to avoid them at all costs because they interrogate me about nearly everything and any attempt at acting more feminine will be spotted and probably shut down. I feel trapped. My parents know me as ""the happy one"" of the 3 of myself and two older brothers who have now gone off to college. I fear that these thoughts and feelings are going to bleed and continue for a long time and really affect my relationship with my parents and friends. I would really like to experiment with presenting as female but with the current restraints, my parents are in the house with me almost the entire day and there's no way of my sneaking in any clothes or anything. If I were to shave my legs they would notice, if I were to use clear nail polish, they would notice. I feel like I can't express myself and if the feelings I have now continue, I think it will be really bad for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr recently accepting myself as trans. my thoughts feel like tv static and i am not comfortable talking to anyone, especially my parents. i'm avoiding them because of their interrogative nature which has proven difficult because i live in the same house as them and am in the house nearly all day. help.",28Jul2019,1

594,"I was hired at a manufacturing company right after college and have worked there for over two years now. I entered the company as an entry level engineer and ended up filling a void in the quality department. I didnt mind that for a while but felt like I needed a change after 7 months since I couldnt see myself doing that for many years. At that time, a different engineering related position opened in which I applied and got the job. I did that for about 9 months. I eventually felt the need to do something different, yet again, since I wasn't feeling satisfied with the work. In that role I felt that leadership was lacking and that there wasn't much structure to my job. I applied for another position in the automation department that was open. I'm currently in that role and have been there for 11 months. I now feel the need for change again. It's hard to pinpoint the cause of my dissatisfaction with all of these different roles but I feel like I need more out of my work and career. In my current position, I don't feel like there is much structure or maybe as much leadership as I would like. I also don't feel as if Im truly working as part of a team. Maybe I just dont feel like I have been given good enough direction. Maybe I'm simply not good enough at my job yet to where I feel like I can be effective and confidently give value. My personal life could be affecting this as well since I moved to this city to work at this company, I'm living alone, and don't have a real close network of friends in close proximity. I often visit good friends only on weekends. 

One of my theories for constantly wanting to move on is that I'm leaving the ""honeymoon"" phase of these new positions. From that, a question arises. Do I push past and stick with the role to hopefully gain fullfillment out of it or is there a good chance that me and the company/these positions are simply not a good fit and I should move on? If there are recommendations to push through and hopefully get re-engaged with the work, what is good advice to do so? I currently feel stuck and regularly don't want to go to work in the morning.

I know I have issues with social anxiety to the point it paralyzes me, but I don't want to just submit to that. Does anyone have any advice about what I can do to try and put myself out there? I always used to rely on school to make friends, can't really do that anymore though.

Sorry I kinda just ranted. I had a lot on my mind I wanted to try and put out there and hopefully someone sees this. Thank you!",28Jul2019,1

If I have a choice between doing the work and doing something else, I NEVER do the work and it needs to stop.

A little background...

At 12 I was diagnosed with ADD and mild dyslexia. I would always zone out in class and so they put me on Ritalin. They took me off of it for some reason in 8th grade. I really don't remember why. I would typically do very poorly the first quarter of the school year, get grounded for the following quarter and be locked in my room with nothing to do but my homework and so my grades would improve quite a bit. The third quarter would go much like the first and the fourth much like the second.

High school followed a similar path and then I got to college...community college.

Without any real accountability, I would do none of the work and then become so embarrassed that I would simply just stop going to class. This continued until I dropped out completely.

The thing is, I am not lazy. When I worked during high school, I would always go full time in the summer and well into adulthood I have never turned down overtime at my current job and have even taken on side jobs. I work hard at my job because if I don't there are immediate consequences if I don't and that's not the case with school.

I am not lazy at all, but when it comes to sitting down to read something or write a paper, I'll find any reason not to do it.

A few years ago I was dating a woman who was a lawyer and when she told me she got a job as a prosecutor, I remember later that day sitting in a parking lot in my car and sobbing at the thought of all the money my parents had spent on my education (I went to a very expensive private elementary school and high school) only to have me drop out of community college and take these sales jobs.

I called my Mom and explained that at the age of 30 I wanted to move home and work during the day and take classes at night and she agreed to let me. **I signed up for 3 classes and did none of the work and eventually withdrew from the classes. Just like before!**

I swear to God, if there was a way I could sign up for a 4-year jail sentence where I could have no other option then to go to class and do my work, I would sign up for it in a heartbeat, I wouldn't even have to think about it. I would gladly give up 4 years of my life to come out with a degree.

I have read all kinds of self-help books and went to my doctor for an RX and he gave me Adderall. Being on Adderall gave me the energy to get stuff done, but also had awful side effects.

I'm so lost anymore and I just don't know what to do. I need help.",28Jul2019,0

I don’t know what it is. It’s not a lack of interests because I have interests and passions, but sometimes even those things don’t excite as much as I wish they did. Perhaps I have too few interests.

604,"I've had an on and off friendship with this one girl in my class. We would usually be friends for like 2 weeks before we had a fight. 
She would usually start something with no real reason behind it. 

Now that we're on summer break, she came to me on instagram saying ""care to explain this?"" with a screenshot of my friend telling her that my mom had said about a year ago that me and her now ex-boyfriend would be a cute pair.

Me frustrated that she would start something like this, told her it was a year ago and now getting mad at me for something that my mom had said.
Now she was starting to call me names like ""two-faced"", ""bitch"" and was telling me to fuck off.
And I get it, I can be a little two-faced when I'm around her, but she could have just talked to me about this like a reasonable human being.
Then she started to say ""no one would ever love me"" and how disgusting I am, wich hurt like hell.

at this point I was getting angry at her and told her ""at least I don't date guys for a week and then start dating some other guy"".

We fought for some time before I told her that I'm not gonna fight with her anymore, because nothing I say goes trough that thick skull of hers and I block her, she sends another text saying that maybe I should just date this guy in our class because ""we were both egually disgusting"".

Now I've felt guilty about everything for the whole summer break and want to apologise, but I don't know if I should...

605,"I posted this in another sub but didn't get many responses, so I'm copy pasting it here:

I've been going to college for the past four years now. It was only last year that I finally transferred from a community college to a proper four year, but the two semesters I've done there went insanely poorly, mostly due to me discovering I actually hated my major. I ended up dropping all the related classes to them both times, and even then I just don't have any motivation in any of my other classes anymore. The obvious answer is to swap majors, but I have no idea what to swap to. I just feel like I'm taking random classes hoping something doesn't feel like pulling teeth to take, and I've spent so much money on tuition and all from this one uni alone I'm going to have to take loans out soon and I don't even have anything to show. The fall semester is starting soon, and I still haven't talked to my advisor (I have to do this every semester so I can even register classes) yet and I don't even want to, I'm embarrassed with my performance and I know all that's going to happen is him telling me to take the classes I dropped, and just thinking about it makes my stomach hurt. I'm pretty much going to have to, though, I don't really have any alternative plans right now. I don't know what I'd do if I wasn't doing this, I've considered going back to community college but neither of my parents know about how poorly this is all going and I'm too embarrassed to admit to them how much I actually hate my major and how I want even more time to study. They'd probably kick me out and then I really don't know what I'd do. I feel really directionless right now, everyone I've bothered to ask has just told me to suck it up, but that's what I was trying to do before I got to the four year and discovered I still had no idea what I was doing. Something similar actually happened my first semester at community college straight out of high school, I got super depressed because I felt like I was just taking random classes and ended up dropping everything. My parents found out and they let me take a semester off, and now it's just happening again and it's pathetic.",28Jul2019,1
606,"So my friend, 
let's call her sarah, 
met this guy, 
let's call him tim, about 6 months ago. He was her uber driver. Apparently they hit it off right away. He even bought her shoes the DAY they met ( I say red flag...she says I'm jealous ). He told her that he is part of the cartel and makes millions of dollars and yadda yadda apparently though she got him to leave the cartel. Sarah claims and tim is a really nice guy and doesnt need to deal with the cartel. She he ""quit"" 
Sarah tells me that they arent sleeping together. Sarah is a very pretty 29 year old....tim is an average 40ish year old guy.

About a week ago she informed me that he ""is in love"" with her...she I guess told him she didn't have the same feelings for her and I guess he is cool with that because he still is promising all this stuff to her.


I want to add that about 3 months ago he promised her this back house. Had pictures for her and everything....it never happened, obviously but someone she still believes him. Im Not sure if she has seen any proof of the things he promised her.
..over the past 6 months he has promised here

1. A brand new million dollar home.
2. Her own marijuana business
3. A brand new Mercedes Benz. 
4. Her license back (she got a dui last year and apparently he has connects to get it erased and her license back)


She played me a video of a voice message from an apparent relator. The message was as followed ""They accepted your offer for the house...you can sign the paper work on Thursday. Congrats""

It's a 7.7 million dollar beach home. 🤷🏾‍♀️

Also..about a month ago she got her phone ""hack"" they sent messages to Tim's phone only....Tim told her that he knows someone who can help with hackers and she gave tim her phone so he could install some shit on it. Shr obviously is talking to other men..texting other men...sending other men videos and pictures and I personally think Tim just took her phone to peep what she has been doing. I dont think he phone was hacked at all and I really think HE just got a fake number and was sending her texts. All the threatening texts that the ""hacker"" sent came from Tim's number
..but tim swore it wasnt him and that it was a hacker. 

She believed him.







Anyways I'm really trying to figure out if maaaybe this is a true story. I've never heard anything like this before but also anything is possible. 

I just have a weird feeling that this Tim dude is sus...and is probably planning some weird shit.


Also.
He picks her up from work everyday...but he has never been inside to talk to any of her co workers.
All of his socials are sus looking (I've peeped them)

I've tried talking to him before but he is always very quiet and answers are short. It just all seems sus.


What do ya'll think. What would you guys say to her.

Anytime I try and doubt any of these situation because to me they seem like BS she just calls me a hater.


I just dont want her to end up in a ditch somewhere one day.",28Jul2019,5

608,"This is very long so I’m sorry in advance. 

  My ex and I started dating in my junior year of high school and he was a freshman in college. Let’s call him Denny. It was nice and gentle at first but I made the mistake of ignoring some red flags. The biggest one was how he described his ex and what he did to her. He slut-shamed her and bragged about how he pushed her down the stairs and snitched to her parents about their relationship. In our culture, dating is very taboo so teenagers usually hide it from their parents and snitching is incredibly foul. I tried to brush these things off because she cheated on him and he said that he only hurts people who hurt him. 
Fast forward a few months, he started exploring the idea of us being sexually active but I wasn’t really ready. I was extremely spiritual at the time so I felt that I would’ve been doing my relationship with God an extreme disservice. When I told him this, that I felt guilty, he immediately got defensive. He told me we didn’t have to date anymore and that we could be platonic- that it was one or the other. He seemed genuinely upset and refused to find some middle ground so I caved. I said I’d try my best. Throughout that first year of the relationship, that part was the least of my worries. He’d slut-shame me, tell me that my crop top that rose half an inch above my belly button, was disrespectful to him. He tried breaking up with me during a college trip because I wore that top against his wishes.  Now, looking back, I should’ve ran far at this point. But I didn’t. I was young and stupid and allowed myself to develop a sense of dependence on him (daddy issues?) He knew it and he liked it. I posted a photo of me in a one-piece swimsuit that showed my legs and arms at the most and he broke up with me again. His friends roasted him, “you let her post that bro?”  
Eventually, the shaming came to an end. I loved him and I couldn’t breathe without him. 
      One of my biggest problems was that I was too young and he was too mature but he didn’t see that. When we first met, his parents were contemplating on moving ten hours away. He asked me if I thought he should stay in the area with me because it seemed like we had potential. Of course I said no. I was in HIGH SCHOOL. What do I look like tying someone like that down? I barely knew him. It was two months in and he had made the decision to stay despite the fact his family was gonna move and he’d be all alone. “At least I’ll have you.” He told me that this decision was one he made on his own and that it wouldn’t be held against me. He kept saying that throughout the relationship but it felt otherwise. 
    Fast forward to my senior year, he was considering on moving to where his family was and transferring to the college there. He wanted me to come with. He told me he could buy us a house and give me everything I wanted. I didn’t have to dorm and I would save money by living with him. He’d buy me a dog and this and that. He kept pressing me to commit to the college he was going to transfer to. I had other plans and I tried to tell him as nicely as possible without saying “I don’t want to go with you”. At this point, his family had moved away and it felt like I was all he had. I would go to his place after school everyday. I felt isolated from my friends. He didn’t like most of them. For my birthdays, he would always complain that I paid too little attention to him and more to my friends even though I tried my very best to make sure he was included. Maybe it was the age/maturity gap but he couldn’t fully fit in. 
    Here was my biggest issue. Sex. I couldn’t have it. I don’t know why. It would hurt every time we tried and he would keep pressing it. “I haven’t had sex in two years because of you, I deserve this.” “I’m not trying to force you but please, I know we can do this if you try hard enough.” So we did other things. At first, it was okay. I was never too fully into it. I felt good sometimes but otherwise it was whatever. But at some point, it became a daily thing. Even when I didn’t want to, he would coerce me. He would get quiet when I said no. He would try again. He would poke me with his dick while I was trying to nap. On my birthday, I promised him we’d do stuff at the end of the night but I was so drunk and tired I couldn’t. He got upset and didn’t talk to me the rest of the night. At some point, I just started saying yes because I knew it was faster. The sooner I said yes, the sooner it would be over. It became like clockwork. After I gave my hesitant yes, I would disassociate and try to focus on something else while I waited for him to finish. And then it would be over and I could go back to sleeping or eating or watching Netflix. I knew something was wrong but he always made me believe this was something he deserved because he does so much. I knew something was really wrong when kids in my school started going around giving talks on the line between consensual and non consensual acts. It hit me that what he was doing to me wasn’t okay. I didn’t think it was rape but asking me over and over again until I said yes, guilt tripping me through silence, using favors to sway me for sure isn’t okay. 
    This continued all throughout senior year and I was miserable. I didn’t know what to do. I was scared to break up with him. He said if someone hurts him, he would hurt them back. My friends told me to break up with him but they didn’t believe he would actually tell my parents or anything. I knew he would. I knew he had it in him.  While all this was happening, he would constantly pick fights with me while important events were occurring in my life. He would pick a fight before my college apps were due, while I was writing my essays, or while I was at school events. I felt like he was intentionally trying to sabotage me so I’d have no choice but to stick with him the rest of my life. It honestly felt that way. I couldn’t see a way out but at the same time I didn’t want a way but at the same time it was all that I thought about. Every time something happened, he threw in my face how he stayed for me. I don’t want to exaggerate and say I was depressed and take away from those who actually suffer from depression, but I remember wanting to be dead so I wouldn’t be directly hurting him. 
     Here’s where I’m TA. I couldn’t talk to my friends but I grew close to my coworkers. Let’s call my coworker George. He listened. It was nice. I would talk to him about regular things and having someone new to talk to was nice. Eventually, I began confiding in him about my relationship with Denny and he didn’t tell me to break up with him. He was so sad for me. He offered me a shoulder and I’ve never felt better. I really loved his presence. Eventually, he and I grew feelings for each other but he didn’t want to act on them, naturally. But I, on the other hand, kept trying to advance things. Looking back in retrospect, that was terrible of me. I took advantage of George and Denny. But in the moment, I was so tired of my body being used again and again all because Denny does so much for me. I was so tired of being miserable and I wanted relief. This escalated into a full relationship between George and I. I had never felt worse but at the same time I never felt better. I liked how George asked if everything was okay before anything happened. I liked how he took the smallest hint of hesitation and knew to back away until there was none anymore. Denny ignored those signs for his own benefit. While I was shitty to cheat on him, I can’t forgive how he intentionally ignored signs of discomfort for a nut. 
      When Denny found out, he was so hurt. He was so so hurt and I felt so horrible. But he stayed with me. He cried to me for hours but he stayed. He asked why and I said why and he downplayed it. “You cheated on me because I would get quiet after you said no? Any guy would. It’s nature.” And it made sense at that time. It didn’t hit me that most guys just say “oh okay” and not go into guilt-trip mode. 
        The day after he found out, I went over. We were on the process of mending things. He was doing his best to forgive me and move on. At some point, he asked if we could have sex. He was hurt that another guy touched me and that my body was only for him. He said he deserved it. He demanded that only he gets to have my body. We tried it out. He went in and it hurt like a bitch. I started crying and I kept begging him to stop. To this day, I don’t know if he actually didn’t hear me or if he just pretended not to because he kept going. He kept going and it was the worst experience of my life. I did what I usually did- I tried to tune it out. Once I left his house, it hit me what happened. I didn’t know if I was allowed to call it rape but it felt like it. This was the first time I felt like I had been truly wronged because I am a loud and ugly crier. I was sure he heard me but just decided to keep going. I called my friend who told me it was basically rape. I then called him to talk about it and he came to where I was. Then, he talked me everything out of what I realized. He said he loves me and he would never, ever do anything like that. He didn’t realize he was hurting me and thought I was enjoying it. He thought I was moaning. He talked about how his family left and he’s been so alone. He made me feel bad for him. He reminded me how much he loves me and how much he does for me. I went home confused and unsure of what happened.  
      Fast forward, he visited me in college. We went to a party where a guy danced on me and then got very aggressive when I tried to push him off. That night, Denny kept trying to fuck. He kept trying to wiggle his dick in. The dorm beds are tiny and it was hot and I had yet to buy a fan because there was no AC. He spent what felt like hours grabbing me and squeezing me and playing with my ass as I tried my best to sleep. It felt so wrong. I kept trying to say no and that I was tired and I felt nasty. But he kept saying he missed me and that it’s been so long. I tried to disassociate. When I confronted him weeks later, he played the victim card again. 
     We broke up a month into college. He was extremely clingy. He would track my location and accuse me of cheating. Of course, I didn’t blame him for being paranoid but at the same time it was stressing me out because every morning I woke up to a fight. “Where were you?  How come your location said otherwise? How come your phone was off?” I had done nothing throughout college. I would just go partying with my girls and my phone would die at some point. I was so tired of the fighting. Long distance wasn’t for me. I was torn between actually being a college student and making myself available to him 24/7. 
    We broke up and it was bad. He slut shamed, body shamed, and everything shamed me. He sent me my nudes back to me and told me how ugly and fat I am. He threatened to physically harm me. He threatened to leak my nudes to everyone constantly. I had to cry to him on the phone for three straight days so he wouldn’t leak my photos. Eventually, a fake number messaged my family and sent them photos of me and him kissing. It told them I kick out my roommate to fuck boys in my dorm. It told them I drink and smoke. My parents never looked at me the same. I liked the bitter feeling of knowing that my friends were wrong, that he IS the type unlike they said. Months later, he tried to coerce me out of $300 for reparations for all that he had spent on me. I always told him not to spend money on me because I never had that much and he made a lot and promised that it wasn’t a big deal. 

I know I am the biggest asshole for cheating on him and nothing can forgive that. My affair was inexcusable and I’m so sorry for that. But I like to think I had reason for turning to someone else because breaking up with him honestly didn’t seem like an option.",28Jul2019,1
609,"So this is my first post ever on a forum so please bare with me lol. For this post I am W and my friend is C.

So here's the situation, I'm going to start from the beginning and try and clearly get through this without making it to confusing.

My friend and I are both white, in our lower 30s and are veterans (I dont know if all that information is necessarily relevant but I thought I'd include it to provide some insight on his perspective) and he has been going through the worst few years of his life and I've been trying to do everything I can to help him, at this point he is keeping himself trapped in a relationship where he is miserable and depressed and I cant motivate him to start changing his situation. 

So here's what gets us to where we are now. C grew up in Florida, in severe poverty in an abusive household, he was molested and witnessed his parents doing drugs and his mom servicing men for drugs/money. He was in and out of school to hide marks from teachers and friends so he can protect his parents. 

He escapes this cycle by joining the Army and being an infantryman, he had several deployments and has been through it all, losses, survivors guilt, guilt for killing, and suffered several concussions from IEDs. He has PTSD, with really bad ups and downs dealing with depression and anxiety, he has bad knees(Airborne) and after I rallied to get him into the VA, and he does get disability now, but that's about the best part of this story. 

So the real problems are coming, last year C had a fall out with his girlfriend at the time, basically they hadn't had any kind of sexual contact and he was taking on all of the household responsibilities and working, she worked also, and he was doing well with his responsibilities but wasnt taking care of his health(this is when I was getting him to the VA) and in the end they separated as friends, he wound up living in his car for a couple of weeks(I had no idea this was going on, the last he talked to me he was living with that ex until she kicked him out because her new boy wasnt liking it, which was only a week after they separated), and he randomly moves from CO to NV to stay with a buddy he served with. That apparently was awkward, so after being there for a couple months he meets some chick on tinder or something and ends up just staying with her, she is a manager at walmart so she makes decent money with benefits(been there for 10 years). 

While living there he finally gets his VA, 50k in back pay and awarded 100% disability. Well.. he sets the direct deposit to her account... HE pays 20k of her debt off(he has debt he still hasnt paid), they take a vacation that costs 7k... they get a newer car(after she wrecks her car) and he has to sell his when they moved back to CO early this year. She still works here in the same job, bought a house and now here's where we are at..

She had 2 kids (diff dads, 8 months and 4yrs when they met) C has just been home raising the kids while she worked. In NV it was over an hr one way for her to get to work, so he was almost solely taking care of them and still is. 

He is miserable and depressed and again in a relationship that lacks sex, he says he doesnt want to with her because he has no connection, and hes doing everything in the house, accept now shes home a little more. He doesnt trust her alone with them because she doesnt pay enough attention to them. He wants nothing to do with the relationship and essentially explained that hes repulsed by her, but he wont leave because he doesn't want to leave the kids, he still doesn't have his own bank account and she gets him cigarettes and his monthly Cannabis supply but that's all he sees of his money. He has no car of his own so he just plays around the house all day. 

I've tried talking to him about leaving, and he says he wants to, but he wont do it. I've begged him to open a bank account and get control of his money and he just excuses it, he seems to think that it would somehow hurt the kids, and she makes enough money that she would be fine, I even went online and showed him all of the cost breakdown and her income and he wont see it. 

I'm in the beginning process of building up to start a business next summer hopefully, and we both have culinary and pastey degrees so I was trying to get him to join me in that. I found him apartments and showed him his income breakdown. And I'm a full time Student, getting laid for school is something else, and I told him if he did a couple semesters I'd help him, and the extra money would help start this business which would be able to pay us forever.. he wants to do it, but he wont leave her. I have no idea how else I can I help him? 

I told him that those kids arent his responsibilities, and it sucks, I understand hes connected but this is literally killing him. I had to get him over here a couple weekends ago because he said he was going to .. well you can guess .. he said he talked to her about what's bothering him and she was going to work on some stuff, but I don't believe that. I'm not even sure he told her anything.. he just keeps telling me that he'll wait a little longer and then pack up, or something, but he doesn't do anything else to actually move forward. 

I talk to him everyday to make sure hes okay, but hes just sitting in that situation waiting for something to change. I'm afraid that one day he will just be gone and I know I can push him to hard, and I'm literally the only one that he talks to anymore aside from her. 

I'm sorry for this being so long and hope I didn't over explain but I figured I'd try and provide as much information as I could to hopefully find a way to help this kid.. thanks guys

610,"Hi everyone,

So I'm going to try to keep the background short but try to make sure everyone understands the situation.

I'm a female security officer for a college. I have been here for almost a year and I've only had two major problems with students. One of the students has been harassing me because he has broken policies and I've been the one to catch him. That is an ongoing investigation and it is being taken care of.

The other student is an African American male who no longer attends the college. The reason why I say his race is because she thinks I'm being racist and targeting him. The interactions he's had with the other male security officers has been fine and he treats them with respect. Every time I've dealt with him he has been extremely disrespectful. Now I understand nobody likes security but I didn't realize how much he didn't like me. Every time he's called for door to be open I immediately go over there and I open it and I always kept a chipper mood and let him in without any problems. One day he had entered the security office and wanted to be let into an area that we have for people who are underprivileged and can't afford food. Unfortunately we aren't allowed to let anybody in that room with a key unless they have their ID to scan into the room. That is what I was told because they want to keep track of who enters the room. I had explain this the male and he got extremely upset and started yelling loudly and cursing and said he was going to call my boss who is the head of security. I told him he's welcome to call my boss but unfortunately I can't open up the door for him. My coworker who is also a black male was sitting in the office too. When the male turned around and left he immediately came back and looked at my co-worker and said that it was a joke. When the upset male left I turned my co-worker and told him that the only reason the upset male came back is because he was there. My coworker agreed and said that for some reason the upset male thinks him and my coworker are friends based off just because they share the same race. He then informed me that one day the upset male had went into the security office and told my boss and him that he doesn't think a woman should be in security. Upon hearing this from my coworker I told my boss that I was uncomfortable with that and it should be addressed. My boss immediately got on it and had a meeting with the upset male and told them that it was not okay for him to treat me like that and it will not happen again. Me upset male had said he was sorry to Carlos and offered to apologize to me but I told my boss I did not want to speak to him and that from here on out everything will be kept out of professional measure.  The past was the past.

Today the upset male had told me he needed some things out of a storage closet in the college. I asked him what it was for and if he got the okay from someone or if he let my boss know. He told me that he had informed my boss and one of my other co-workers that he was allowed to grab stuff. I was a little leery but I let him grab the things he needed and then went on my way. Later on the upset male needed into a room that was locked and wasn't supposed to be opened yet. I asked him why he had lied to me and told me that my boss said it was okay when my boss had no idea of it. The upsetting male started yelling and getting really pissed off at me because I called him a liar. I kept my composure and remained calm on the phone while he screamed and yelled at me. He wanted to talk to a higher up because he didn't want to deal with me anymore because of the past history. I informed him that my boss will be back Monday morning at 8 a.m. and he said that I need to call higher up right now or else he was going to write a letter to the president of the college. After the phone conversation I immediately called my boss to let him know about what just transpired and to give him a heads-up that on Monday he will have to contact the upset male. During my call with my boss be upset male knocked on the security door wanting to talk to my boss. I kept my boss on the line so he could hear everything that was going on. When I opened up the door the upset male had a friend with him. That door is the only exit of the security office. I was blocked in as the upset male began yelling and screaming at me. I made sure to keep a proper distance between us because at this point I felt intimidated and cornered. I kept a cool and calm composure as he screamed at me. My boss told him that he was not at work and he will deal with this Monday morning and upset male started yelling at my boss. The upset male then started taking steps towards me making me feel uncomfortable so I took a step back and he stepped forward again. I had no exit and felt completely unsafe because there was two men blocking my only exit and one was filled with adrenaline and rage. The upset male said that he was going to contact the higher-ups and make complaints about me and my boss said that was completely okay and he was allowed to do that. My boss had stayed on the line until the upset male finally left. My hands were shaking and my voice was wavering because I had felt completely unsafe when the upset male was there. My boss told me to take a few deep breaths to calm down and not to worry and he will handle this. 

At this point I don't know what to do because this man is no longer a student but is still staying on campus. I don't have a duty belt or anything else on me for protection otherwise I would have felt okay. 

I'm not sure if I can work at a place that allows someone to be outright sexist and makes one of the faculty and staff feel threatened. My boss is awesome and he goes above and beyond for his work and hears out both sides of the story. My boss did inform me that I shouldn't have said he lied to me and maybe had worded it differently which I take full responsibility for.

Does anyone have any advice? I know the college is terrified of being sued but likes to sweep things under the rug. I don't want to sue because I don't have the time or money and I absolutely love the people here. But if nothing is done then I think I might just quit.

I'm so sorry this was long. 

Does anyone have any advice?

TL;DR: A man thinks I'm being racist when he outright told my boss a woman shouldn't be in security. Then him and another men cornered me in my office, blocking the only exit, as one raged at me because I wouldn't open up a door for him that wasn't allowed to be opened. And because I asked why he lied to me. He said that he isn't a ""liar"". The college pushes things under the rug so the public doesn't know about the shit that goes down. I don't know what to do.",28Jul2019,2

612,"I was born in a shitty small town in florida. I lived there until my dad wanted to take my mom and me away from there so he could abuse us freely without having to worry about my moms family intervening. I spent about 7 years of my life swapping between living in various cities and towns in washington state.

My mom was addicted to drugs and my dad would abuse her and me regularly. He was also an alcoholic. I finally mustered the courage to go to a youth center across the street from my house and tell them my dad wouldn't stop drinking and yelling at me and my mom.

I got taken away from my parents and lived in a foster home for a while before moving back to florida with my grandpa.

My mom came down here too, and went to jail for 3 months. I don't know what she did and i don't even care. My grandma told me she had gotten texts from my dad saying he was gonna come down here but i didn't believe he was actually gonna do it. Nevertheless i informed my family that i would leave if my dad came down here.

That leads me to now. I learned about 2 hours ago that my dad is on a greyhound bus to my town right now.

I can't deal with this shit anymore. I have about 1000 dollars saved up and i'm thinking of buying an amtrak ticket to as far away from this goddamn place  as i can. 

My only problem is my grandma. She's not in good health and i'm afraid that me leaving might just be too much for her.

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and  said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she  come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled  to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone  and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back  at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.",28Jul2019,0
614,"So! Last Friday, I found out my best friend (who is my x of 7 years) OD'd on heroine. Before this happened he had been spending a lot of time at my house. Sleeping over before work, on weekends, and we were getting close again. We were cuddling in bed, he was telling me he was happier being at my place and didn't like being home... Said it felt like a storage unit. 

He lives in a separate basement apartment in his parents house. So the thing is... We had relapsed on opiates for the last 3 months. We were sober for years... And this time we had a plan to taper down and get sober together. We werent using them anymore to get high.. Just enough not to get sick. 

Last Friday he was going to get us pills... And we were going to use them to taper down. The guy he gets them from offered to give him a deal if he drove him to get H. Now my friend doesn't ""do"" heroine... But this time he was offered to try it And he took that offer once they got back to his house. 

I hadn't heard from him for hours .. Kept calling.. When eventually someone picked up his phone and it was a cop. He said he was starting to breathe again.. And would be going to hospital. Said someone called 911 and he was protected under the 'good Samaritan law'. 

So he's a hospital .. I called many times to find out when he was leaving ... His mother was called as emergency contact. 

Eventually I heard from her and she said he was ok and that he would be in touch. He called me 2 days later.. For maybe 2 mins. Said he was on methaone now... Getting counseling and his mother has his car keys (she is driving him to work and and where ever he needs to go) , his cell phone and he is living up stairs with them. 

He promised me before this he would never abandon me while we were trying to get sober .. And that we would kick this together. Now I can't talk to him at all.. I've been utterly alone.. I am going Monday to the clinic to get methadone myself... But I have been losing my mind not being able to talk to him... I have been having suicidal thoughts ... No one to talk to.. Broke and alone all the time.

This last Thursday night... Was a particularly rough night for me.. I had texted his mum saying I need to talk to him. His birthday is next weekend and I have concert tickets.. No clue what is going on... She left me on read all day and night... 

I was drinking alone that night... And started feeling suicial. So I being the stupid person I am... Texted his mum saying I was having a hard time..  Had no support from my family or friends ... Was feeling alone and afraid and needed to talk to him. I said some other embarrassing things... 

So! After I did that I felt stupid and embarassed and deleted Facebook and messenger ... So she was unable to reply. Then he called me at midnight after work. I told him what happened... He was quiet ... I was quiet. He said he had to go... And he was going away camping for the weekend ... 

So! It's Sunday and I have not head back.. And I'm losing my mind thinking I fucked it all up. Idk what to do... I feel like if I lose him I will lose myself... Which is pathetic I suppose... But no one is here for me. He has his family now.. And left me all alone to deal with this. 

I'm lost..",28Jul2019,0

621,"I (17 F) am an atheist while my whole family of 5 are prodistant Christian. I stopped believing around 6th grade, that's also when I was diagnosed with depression. My whole family knows this and once my mom found out about my beliefs she dove deep into Christianity (going to o church more, reading the Bible, being more involved in church activities) at first I was made to go to youth group, Bible studies, and church, I was mad because it took away lots of my free time after school. Eventually I was able to stop going to bible study, last year I stopped going to youth group. I sometimes bring up not going to church, but my mom always says ""it's family time!"" Because we go out to eat after church. I have tried to compromise, I offered to make lunch or meet my family at the restaurant, but they always say no. I think I would be fine with going to church if I had a choice, but I don't. My parents make me, and if I don't then they threaten to take away my phone it my laptop. This past year I've been sitting down during worship (singing religious songs) to a. Protest, and b. Not worship. I have also slept during the services, witch is I admit, a bit rude. 2 weeks ago my dad told me to stand up during worship or he'd ground me. His reasoning was ""it's rude to the the band and it's disrespectful to him."" So I walked out of the sanctuary. For context the band cannot see me because of the stage lights that are nearly blinding, I think my dad just wants to look good in front of everyone. Since I sat outside if the sanctuary last week I figured I would sit out this week to, since it's my only way to protest without being mean to my parents (besides this we get along really well). I thought I could get some summer homework done instead of wasting my time in a sermon and I actually did get a lot done today. My mom came out and asked me why I wasn't in the sanctuary and that I was being disrespectful. I told her that I didn't want to go in because I didn't believe and if they didn't respect my lack of belief then I wouldn't respect theirs (though I've never said anything to them about their religion, personally I think it's fine for others to believe in a God, it helps. But I just don't and that's ok) after church we went out to eat as usual and my dad brought up the whole sitting outside the sanctuary thing, he told me that I was very disrespectful and that I was basically slapping them in the face. I couldn't control myself and started crying quietly, whenever my dad even raises his voice slightly I start to bawl. They kept asking me why I was so offended by their religion that I had to sit down during worship and sit outside of the sanctuary. Why I couldn't just spend one hour a week sitting next to them listening to something I don't believe in. I'm stumped honestly I just don't want to go to church, I like the free time in the weekend and I like to sleep in especially during the school year where I already have to wake up at 6am every morning. Not to mention I recently just got a job so I will have even less free time once school starts up. I love and respect my parents and I'm greatful for what they do for me, but I just don't want to go. I probably sound childish, I don't know. Can someone help me out here? Tell me if I'm doing something wrong or what I should say? My dad wants me to tell him why I don't sit with them. Sorry this post was so long, thank you for getting this far. Bye.",28Jul2019,2
622,"Im 16 and my three friend i will call them Brad, Andrew and Jonathon. One day we were all playing fortnite when Brad and all of them started arguing over a fortnight skin, all i did was just sit there and laugh because tbh who wouldn't. But after a bit of arguing Brad got angry and left the call on discord so me, Andrew and Jonathon we to play minecraft. A few hours go by and Brad DM's me asking why i didn't defend him over a fortnite skin and brings up old stuff that happend in the past and that i need to listen to him talk. So i respond with ""ok"" then a lets play 8 ball meme but then he left me on read.

\-A Few Days go by-

I contacted Brad about me sending a eight ball meme after ok and i apologized and told him that i read what he said wrong and took it the wrong way because i thought he was joking. Brad responds with-

""no you actually dont understand what was wrong with the situation because if you did you wouldn't have taken so long to realize that what you did and said was nothing but wrong and insensitive as hell, and for you to do that and now tell me "" i thought you would of been like ok since i said ok before"" is bullshit  because i know the entire conversation you had with you're gf and you straight up told her what you said wasn't insensitive and that you did nothing wrong and you kept comparing that one time i sent lets play 8ball just to lighten the mood in a completely different scenario, im done, im done giving you chances.""

The things is i never told my gf anything about what happend at the time, i tried telling him i was sorry after that but then things started getting out of hand.

\-A Few Days go by-

\-I got attacked by Brads Gf saying i was a bad friend.

\-Brad told all my friends a one sided story. (even though i wasn't the one arguing with him over it)

And let me tell you she is gorgeous. She has a beautiful face and stunning body (to me at least I think she looks like a super model) and she just got her masters degree. Then here lies the problem. I look at myself and see I'm overweight and have had a problem with most girls rejecting me because of that. Then I'm also not going to collage (because I'm lazy not because I'm stupid) and I lack a job (I've been applying but nowhere is accepting me. Even entry level stuff).

629,"So I have been out of work for about a month. (Cue increasing panic and anxiety as each day without a new job offer goes by). I've been sending out my resume everywhere but my phone is on contract with Verizon; I have an iPhone that's not yet paid off. I can't pay my bill right now and exhausted my promise to pay (yay poverty), they won't reconnect me until I pay the past due amount of $335.63. I don't have that right now. I found an app called textme that will let me receive and make phone calls, but only on WiFi. I've been using that number on new job applications, but it's spotty at best and also only works on wifi.

Is there anything I can do to get the phone number I have moved into a different phone (can I move the SIM card? Or will Verizon lock the number?) so that I can use the number on and off WiFi in case potential employers call? Next week I should have enough money to buy a pay as you go phone, but with my main number having gone out to so many job applications I'd really like to not lose it. 

Any ideas? I do plan to pay off my Verizon bill once I'm working again, but I'm a single mom of 3 kids and have $2 dollars in my checking account. Rent has to be paid too, and my complex is quick to threaten eviction if you're late. I don't even have that right now, and the anxiety is making it hard to figure out what to do. 
As of right now my account isn't locked or frozen, it still works on WiFi, and if I pay what's due everything is fine with Verizon. But I know if it takes too long to pay them then at a certain point they'll lock the account and freeze the number (my fiancé left a few years ago and my old phone was on an account with him, and that's what happened when the bill got to around 4K). 

Finally, this week I'll have about $1100 dollars come in. I COULD pay the back due on Verizon (it's $510 total and $335 past due), but I also have rent due ($1360, and if you're 3 days late more than twice then they threaten to start eviction - I've been three days late twice this year), childcare past due ($1400), and electricity ($125). My car payment was due a week ago but I'm not even going to think about that right now. I have to buy groceries for the kids (I can feed them cheaply enough) and daycare will work with me and probably not kick us out (we've been there 2 years). I have appointments on August 5th to try to sign up for WIC and electric assistance, and I've applied for welfare child scholarships to help with daycare (that will be about 30 days out before they say yes or no); I don't think the car company will try to repo my car unless I'm 3 months late so I'm trying not to think about that. And if electricity gets shut off we can live until I get it back on. I'm skipping my psychiatrist this month because it's $100 dollars to go.
I just don't know what to pay first. I'm selling whatever I can from the house, and i promise it isn't just irresponsible actions that got me here. We don't have cable or fancy clothes. I had a job paying 40k that ended on a contract and I had to go off my anti depressant when my insurance ended with the job, so I spent about 3 weeks in serious withdrawals. Those are over now but I've got all this catching up to do and I feel like I'm in a deep hole and not sure how to get out.

634,"I'm new to reddit. A friend of mine suggested this. If you think there's a better sub, please let me know. I just want advice and I don't where to go.

Almost a year ago, my wife (S) and I first became foster parents to T, when he was 9 (10 now). T's mom, K, was doing drugs with her boyfriend and left T alone, so he went to foster care and K went to jail. Thankfully, this was a wakeup call for K. She realized she might lose her son so she went to rehab and kicked the boyfriend out. She's been in a half-way house since then and has always had clean urine and has seen her P.O. regularly. She writes to T and they talk every week they don't have visitation. K even sent him a birthday present. She's been in therapy, has a new job, really, really doing well! She was in the process of getting an apartment and as soon as she was moved in, we were prepared to give T back to her. He really wants to go back, obviously.

But last weekend, K wasn't there for her visitation. The social worker didn't know where she was and she wasn't at her job. We found out from her P.O. that she had been arrested. She was the getaway driver for a string of robberies with her old junky friends. We don't know if she's always been in contact and still doing drugs the whole time with someone else's urine or if she really was clean and only recently fell back into bad habits. Because these were armed robberies and a clear violation of her probation, she's facing serious, serious jail time.

T is beside himself. He is so let-down and disappointed. He started back-talking us and won't go to soccer practice. He won't work with his math tutor, even though we've (me, S, AND K) have all told him he needs to stay in school till graduation and he needs to do better in math. He doesn't want to see his friends. He got into a screaming match with S on Friday and punched a hole through his door. He has NEVER been violent before. T is incredibly sweet and he's always been a model child.

We know he's hurting. We know he thinks that K chose drugs over him again, and maybe she did. We're not going to lie and say that she didn't or that she just made a mistake. We're also not going to say ""wow what a fucking junky"", which was my brother in law's responses (thankfully, T didn't hear that), and slander K. He loves his mom and he wants her back, and he deserves that to have a normal life.

We just don't know how to help him. He's already in therapy. The situation feels hopeless. It feels like we can't make him feel better, no matter what we do. But we're at our wits' end with the fighting and shouting and the raw anger. My wife floated the idea that T would do better in a group home, but I said absolutely not. He needs stability from some of the adults in his life and we're not going to put him into a strange environment with other boys who are also hurting. (Plus I've read too many horror stories.) Once I voiced my concerns, S agreed (and regretted even mentioning it). I think S is just worried because she's petite and doesn't know how to handle violence at all. We are going to keep T with us for as long as needed, until K gets her life together.

Any thoughts, Reddit? Thank you for anything you can suggest.",28Jul2019,1
635,Most people are very surprised when a small 19 year old girl lets out the most glorious beer drinking man belches they have ever heard. And I do it often. It’s not intentional and it’s not effected by what type of food I’m eating. People my age are either impressed or genuinely concerned for my health. Older people are usually just kinda horrified. I’m as polite as I can possibly by when a huge burp rips out but there’s not much I can do. Do other people have this? Is this a medical thing or just unintentionally swallowing air? I can rip massive burps from just drinking water or really anything. I always have.,28Jul2019,1
636,I’m talking to this girl that I really like but I’m not sure when to say I love you? In my past relationship we started dating right away but now I’m kinda wondering when?,28Jul2019,1
637,"Okay first off - don't judge me. I am busy enough judging myself to be honest.

I will of course have a TLDR at the bottom that gets straight to the point and asks for the advice I need.

Back Story:  This man, lets call him Chad (cause he is a little bit of a Chad) and I met when I was about sixteen. We went to the same high school but because he's a few months younger than me he was in the grade below me. We started dating soon after my seventeenth birthday and went on to date for eight or nine months. I would never say that he was THE love of my life, but he was definitely up there. Probably number two or three if I had to put a list together. We were each other's first sexually and I was his first for everything (relationship, kissing, even first date he had ever been on). The relationship obviously wasn't perfect because no relationship is, but we always had chemistry, rarely argued and always went on adventures together. 

The one thing that I loved so much about our relationship while it was going on was the fact that it was honest. There were never any games, never any doubt about how the other felt. He literally cried in my arms, told me about his secret struggles with anxiety, and made me laugh just about more than any other person in my life. But his ego is literally the size of a fucking whale. He could never be wrong, especially in his political and social beliefs. He never could take help when it was offered to him, even when he desperately needed it (like for his studies, which he was nearly flunking while I on the other hand was getting near straight As).

We planned to go away on vacation for Valentines Day when, two weeks before our planned trip, he broke up with me over text. Out of nowhere. Just claiming that he ""didn't care for me the way I cared for him."" This was a day after a normal date at the park that ended with the usual - a kiss that lasted a bit too long and a promise for the next date at the movies and ""Bye, I love you! Text you when you get home.""  
Literally there was no fighting, there was no ignorance or lapse in sexual behavior and after we broke up and I accused him of breaking it off to try to hit it off with a mutual friend, he literally broke down. My reaction to the break up was not healthy even though his method of breaking it off was equally unhealthy.

About two years later of no contact he showed up again through a phone call he made to me from Basic Training. The first words out of his mouth were ""I am so sorry."" and he explaining that he understood how wrong he acted and I reciprocated that I should have reacted in a much more civil manner (there is more to the story of how I reacted, as I also went through a phase of attempting to make him jealous). After that we had a writing and phone friendship while he was finishing basic and at first, it was fine. Just some laughing and catching up, normal talk. Then it turned romantic and a little sexual (I was actually shocked how he wasn't as sexual as before).  
Considering the fact that I never got any closure about the sudden break up and the fact that at the time I had just been through a failed engagement, I leaped at the idea of trying again. The chemistry was the exact same as when we first dated - butterflies and fireworks and all. Banter was even better between us then before. But the moment that he and I started hanging out and I started pushing for commitment, he froze me out and dropped out of the picture again. This time it was a bit easier, I mean it's not like it hasn't happened before and we had only been seeing each other casually for like two weeks tops.

I moved on with my life. I went to therapy, found out my issues and started working on them. I worked towards finishing my studies. I dated around, discovered more about my sexuality and frankly, save for the occasional facebook stalking - I never thought about him. Then a week ago he just messages me like nothing is wrong, just ""Hey"". Nothing instigated him making contact other than the fact that he had just broken up with his last girlfriend (again I occasionally facebook stalked). The cynical side of me was like ""Oh here he goes, trying to get ass because the last relationship didn't go well.""  


I basically told him to fuck off, like literally in those words. Then he messaged me two days ago to have a conversation and I decided to stop being petty. Again, immediate banter and great conversation but this time the conversation wasn't getting romantic, so I relaxed. Then yesterday he gets drunk and starts being all dramatic and emo and I take it as an opportunity to get some things off my chest but otherwise, I am just relieved he seems alright and comfortable enough to be honest with me. Again he says the usually shit he says when he's drunk or feeling honest - that when he broke it off he actually was still in love with me but just decided that I wasn't ""marriage material"" (his actual words were that he couldn't see himself marrying me).  
I find this explanation total bullshit. We were only seventeen, nearly eighteen, when he ended things. We had only been dating for nine months. I do think that he still cared for me, but that marriage thing was not the reason he broke it off.. and frankly I have finally stopped caring so much about learning that reason. 

Anyways, after things were off my chest, he went to lay down apparently and nap the beers off and he woke up and called me at like 1 am. The conversations was pretty normal and I was talking about how my family was up at the lake and I wish I could've gone and then I heard something that sounded like he had closed a car door.

&amp;#x200B;

yes, you thought correctly. HE SHOWED UP AT MY HOUSE AT 2 AM. I immediately said no, I am not letting him in. Que him sitting in his car for thirty minutes talking to me on the phone, having no issue with the fact that I won't let him in. Says he likes driving around at night sometimes and just happened to remember my address from memory. Eventually I let him on the porch where he smoked and had a chat and then he left around 3:30 am to go home. Me being the stupid idiot I am, I suddenly realized how dangerous it is for someone to drive around that light at night in the summer when everyone is out there drunk. So I called him and I told him to come back and crash in one of the open bedrooms or on the couch.

&amp;#x200B;

When he came in, I was already in bed. He did not come into my bedroom, he went off into the bedroom across the hall and he kept pacing. I went in to see what was wrong and we ended up hooking up. He was off by the time I woke up because he was visiting his parents and they would guess where he went.

I didn't know what to do and I was a little tipsy from occasional drinking last night so I took some time to think through things. I come to the conclusion that although I don't regret last night, that it gave me some closure because when we were together... somehow there was no chemistry like before. The sex wasn't bad, but it wasn't butterflies and fireworks like I experienced when we dated and when we were together dating casually last year. So unknowingly, he gave me some of the closure I needed.  


I was honest, I told him I didn't regret it, that I thought it through and it's really helped me to get over the last bit of bitterness and ""one that got away"" feelings I had.... but then somehow Chad started talking about how he wouldn't sleep with me again unless it was a 3way? And other sort of shitty stuff like that?  


Did I say something wrong? How do I smooth things over without sounding like I want something romantic or like that I want him sexually? Cause believe me while Chad is funny, goofy, and naturally sweeter than he comes off with a huge hunger for travelling - he has a massive ego that I cannot stand.  


I just want to move on and be friends. I am friends with all of my exes and I have always felt a little wrong that I couldn't be friends with him.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Hooked up with an old ex that I have a long history with and lack of closure. The actual hook up helped me to realize that he isn't some Perfect One for me that got away. Just some sweet guy that things didn't work out with. I tried to play it cool afterwards and talk honestly about how I am over it - mostly because I wanted to smooth things over and not make them complicated. I want to be friends. Now he's been saying things that really hurt me about how he's not into me and stuff.   
How to I explain to him that I don't want things to be complicated? That I am learning to let go of the past and want a stable friendship with him without all the shitty feelings?",28Jul2019,1

He's also iffy about me coming over and I think it's cause of how he's feeling, I want to just go to make sure he's ok and get his mind off of it but I also want to respect if he wants to be alone.

640,"Me and wife rent a flat in a converted Victorian house. The flat is near the main front door and it can always be heard every time it is closed. The house has 8 flats therefore it is passed through several times during the day. We are moving out in 3 weeks. 2 months ago I payed someone to install a door closer to the front door. The closer works as it should however other residents still pull it closed which still causes a slam. I have put up signs on the door to ask people to not slam the door but people don't seem to care. My wife has  been to police, council, citizens advice, the doctor and they all are concerned yet can't really do much. My wife is at home nearly all the time and I basically work 2 jobs to make ends meet. I feel that my wife needs to go out more and focus on other things to get through this last 3 weeks but she thinks I'm against her and should help her solve this problem by contacting the property managers and insisting they should install a heavy duty door closer that could only close on its speed and not be forced. I think there is little point to this but she interprets this as me not caring about her. She wants wine every night to cope with the unpredictable slamming and I'm working a little extra to save for the deposit on the new flat.

646,"Last night I came home around 11:30 to my brother and his friend getting drunk and playing video games. I quickly said hello and then went to bed. Later that night (I don’t remember the time) his friend that we’ve known since we were kids woke me up by jumping on my bed belly first, then started talking to me. I was barely awake when he stroked my shoulder and suggestively drawled “Hey (my name), wanna have some fun”? I’m pretty sure I turned on my side and didn’t answer. He kept talking (pretty sure it was slightly dirty), and being the annoyingly polite girl that I am, I started talking about how overly expensive my manicure was and how crazy that was. To get him out of there, I got out of bed and walked to the kitchen, he followed l, then I walked quickly back to my room and closed the door. 
There’s a baby gate that locks between the hallway with the bedrooms and the rest of the house, and I heard him struggle with it as I went back to bed and I hear my brother call to him about their game. Obviously I KNOW he didn’t do anything sexual and am not accusing him of anything... It just keeps bugging me that he jumped on my bed and was talking about fucking me WHILE I was asleep and when I was barely awake. He has a girlfriend, so I’m pretty sure he was joking around.... But it just feels creepy and weird. I don’t know, maybe I’m being too sensitive? 
For some reason I can’t put it out of my mind, despite the fact that when I told my brother about it, he laughed it off and said that he was really drunk. It just felt WRONG, and I’m so mad that I can’t decide if I’m being too dramatic.

649,"Background: I knew this girl, let's call her Entitled Friend for 7 years  (I'm 20 and she's 18 almost 19) and had what I thought was a best friend relationship    turns out I was wrong and just ignored all the red flags because I was alone. After 3 or 4 years of knowing each other she had a kid at the age of 16 or 17 and let me tell you she was not ready. I gave her unless support when everyone else left her, giving her a place to sleep and eat not just that but she would / still does leave her kid at her mom's for days just to party and get drunk. I'm not patty type and stay at my house while she lies to her boyfriend, mom and sister that's with me when in reality she's cheating, parting and doing drugs. I let this slide since she was my ""best friend"" and would always guilt me to help her.

&amp;#x200B;

Now where our friendship started to faded, she would just call me to crash at my mom, eat my food and then she would go back to ignoring me when her other friends would come. I noticed this and started to grow distant since I knew I was being used. 

One day my grandma called saying she was sick and needed money my family didn't have much so I did what I could and wanted to sell my clothes, I told this to E.F. and she couldn't care less. I told her what I wanted to do which her eyes lighted up and said to give her the clothes and she would sell it for me since she knows more people than I do. Flag Number One. my dummy self gave her my clothes, $150 with of new and good clothes, (I shop online so I get a lot of stuff for cheap).

Days later I asked her about it and she said some people had stole it from her but that she would pay me back.

I was sad but I understood, bad things happen and I only cared about her safety. A year and Half passes by and E.F. is more selfish and entitled letting and I notice she is starting to wear the clothes that people ""stole"" from her, I let I pass for now. anyways her kid which btw I love him but he is brat at almost 3 years old and does whatever he wants, she doesn't spend time with him but posts things to make her look like the good mom she isn't but besides that he doesn't even know how to say a single word, not to compare because every kids is different but I have nephew that's a year younger than her kid and he can some what form good enough sentences that we understand him but her kid only screams and gets mad to the point of punching people if he doesn't get his way so she lets him. 

E.F. has a boyfriend let's call him Buttface since that's what he is, he has cheated, hit and kicked her out of the houses they have been together since her mom kicked her out, he also hits the kid so bad when E.F. took off his shirt after spilling juice on himself I could see the bruises kid had and his back... oh his poor back looked so whipped that it made me shiver also Buttface gets drunk and does drugs in front of kid, from weed to coke. one day Buttface and E.F dropped kid at my house without giving me a heads up when I already had plans, but after I looked at kid I canceled everything this kid looked so drugged out when I looked up and saw E.F. I lost all respect I had for her, I think she knew because she simply said, 

E.F: ""Don't look at me like that, he was being a brat and we wanted some alone time so we smoked him out just a little. so don't get mad it was just weed.""

Buttface looked mad and I rolled my eyes, I should've called the cops, I should've call CPS but I remembered an old friend that was apart of the system and was raped by his foster dad so I gave him food, and let him nap. I was so mad not because I had to cancel plans but because she did this to her kid.

The next Monday ... yes it took her a whole weekend to get her kid from my house, she was mad and hungover wearing a sweater and jeans from the clothes that were stolen a year and half ago I asked her about it and she was more mad. yelling at me for not being a real friend and just giving her my clothes, I told her I needed the money but that wasn't good enough for her, she shoves me while yelling at me about how selfish I am and that that's why everyone talks bad about me.. I was hurt but more mad that she had stolen from me, used me and my family to get food and a place to sleep, and for letting buttface abuse kid. I yelled at her and told her to pay me back since she would brag about selling coke and weed and having so much money she said no and that I only wanted attention since I was the ugly friend and she was the hot one.  I told her I rather be ugly than being know as the girl who did a gang bang at a party with 5 dudes.... let's just say that didn't end good.

&amp;#x200B;

now E.F doesn't want to pay me back, and is still with buttface.... I don't want kid to ended up like them or be In that unhealthy life ... but I'm also scared what might happen to kid if I call CPS on them",28Jul2019,1
650,"My problem is probably very common but I will ask anyways. A couple of months ago I was introduced to a nice guy through a mutual friend. We talked a bit that night and met for a coffee a couple of days later. He then travelled back home, as my hometown is not his, but we stayed in touch almost every day through messenger. 

I didn't really like him in a romantic way, I just liked talking to him. He was a bit strange at times and I got stressed about the whole situation.

 It's now been two months since we first met. We have met up once more and it was really nice! My view kind of changed and I felt like maybe eventually there could be something more there. 

The problem is that he is moving away from my hometown to another for school. I did not think that it would get to this point, but yesterday I actually cried thinking about the fact that I may not ever know if I could have developed feelings for him. He is the first guy who has ever given me so much attention and in many ways I start to think ""what if he is the only one who will ever show interest?"" We still text and we probably will for a while more. But I feel like I don't know him enough to keep the conversation going until he perhaps visits this town again. That could be weeks or months and what if he finds someone where he moves? 

I don't know if he is the one and I know that he probably isn't the only guy out there, but I'm having a hard time letting him go. What should I do now? Let him go? Keep talking? How will the conversation go from ""friends"" to ""romance"" only over texts?

655,"Posted on mobile, so sorry for formatting.

I’m the new Program Director at a summer camp. I’ve worked at summer camps for 5 years, with 3 of them as a supervisor. The last 4 years were wonderful and I always received positive evaluations from my bosses. I was so excited to work at a new camp as the program director. I spent 3 months planning activities and writing schedules for each week of the season. I truly thought I had everything figured out as far as programming. I told my boss all of the supplies I would need to order for our program. I was told I would have them before camp started. They still haven’t showed up, and my boss is wondering why programming has been “lacking.” Because... I have no resources?

As anyone who has worked at camp before can tell you, drugs and alcohol on camp property are grounds for immediate termination. Well, not only does my boss allow our counselors to drink on camp property (including underage), my boss didn’t fire 3 counselors who I caught smoking weed on the property. All that happened was the rest of the staff turned on me for “betraying their trust.” Several weeks later most of the staff hardly speak to me outside of work. 

The culture at this camp is so incredibly toxic and I believe often unsafe for kids. Counselors barely keep track of their campers and then get mad at me when I call them out on it. The counselors drink and party all weekend and end up trashing the camp, then get mad at me when I ask them to clean it up. The counselors complain to my boss that I’m not friendly with them or a member of the “team.” But at the same time, they go out of their way to avoid talking to me. And, again, my boss asks me why programming has been lacking. All I can think is, “you never got me the program supplies you promised me 6 weeks ago!” 

So yeah. I think I’m just about done with this job and this camp. I’d rather spend the last month of the summer doing things I enjoy than feel stressed, depressed, and beaten down. But, hey, any advice is welcome.",28Jul2019,1

Coming into the workforce with roughly $100k in student loans, the stability of the start-up is scary to someone with this amount of loans, where as the other company comes with more stability and safer for someone in my shoes with loans to pay off. Would love to hear advice of how I should truly make a decision like this. I also like the work at the financial services company, just the idea of the startup in the videography world makes me more interested.",28Jul2019,1
658,"I’ve had this goal, that I would like to live on my own before I turn 25. I have talked about it with my parents a few months ago, and they were kinda accepting at the time. So, in the mean time, I started preparing myself. But now that I’ve saved up enough money and found a house I liked, I told them I would be moving out. And now, they are not supportive anymore. They argue that it is not that urgent, and that I should be saving for my future, and stay with them for the time being.
My reasons are mainly independence, wanting to learn to be an adult, and me wanting to stay away from them (living with them affects my mental health, but I won’t tell them that).

663,"So, there's a room next to mine. It's acting as a storage space for random junk. It's used to be my room, but I switched (A decision I regret, as I'm not allowed to have black walls in this one, but that's a different matter)


I want to sort the spare room out, move the stuff into the sheds or something, and use the room for all my arty stuff.


I am aware that I could just do it in my room, but here's the thing, I am aracnaphobic. I can't leave my window open without watching it. Also, as someone who has ADHD, I'm not too good at guarding a window for more than three minutes.


I sleep in this room, I will not do anything that can allow spiders into the room I sleep in. I've woken up with a spider next to me face far too many times.


However, as I don't have my window open, all the fumes from my art supplies, super glue, everything, is getting into my eyes, into my lungs. It hurts. It really hurts.


When I told my mum this, she gave me some goggles, and told me to open my window.


I don't understand, she knows about my aracnaphobia, my ADHD, and my breathing problems, but she cares nothing about it.


I have said that I can do all the heavy lifting, which I can, I can move all that stuff out of that room, and put it neatly in another place. I can do whatever I need to do to the room myself. She won't need to lift a finger.


I'm certain she just wants me to suffer. So, how do I get permission for that room?


Also, I'm not being greedy, I just don't want my eyes and lungs to burn anymore. It really does hurt.",28Jul2019,5
664,"I’ll start off by saying I work at a boutique hotel in the middle of a very very small town. We often get locals that come in to use the bathroom or hang out at the pool, we know everyone’s face. This one man comes in every now and then to freshen up before work, he does transportation and partners with the hotel so we don’t mind. He’s an older gentleman maybe in his 60’s and very keene on talking to everyone even if we’re working, the whole staff knows him very well and they all seem to love him. Normally I’m the person he sees now, I’ll give him a razor and some shaving cream and he always chats me up. Things have gotten a little too strong for me though. He’ll stop me in my tracks if I’m doing something and have me talk with him for a while and it’s to the point now that he mentions we should go for lunch “I’ll teach you Spanish” he normally says. He tells me often how my smile and eyes brighten his day and he used to be rather persistent on having lunch together. I made the mistake of letting him have my number but I’d keep making excuses. But at the same time I’d think he’s this friendly with everyone and they all love him, he stops everyone like that and talks with him. Yesterday was when I was the most uncomfortable. I was taking trash out the back and ran into him. We talked for a bit, I being friendly and nice as I always do. Saying he hasn’t seen me in a while, wondering how my mom is(she works with me but is on medical leave), telling me how pretty my eyes are again, and saying he’ll stop by at the desk to see me tomorrow(today now). He ask if I have a phone and tries to offer me his new iPhone saying he doesn’t understand it very well but keeps offering me the phone. I say no. He then says he has a gift for me and my mom but we’ll have to met up sometime to get them cause they aren’t on him. I tell him that’s nice but he doesn’t have to do that. Then he goes to bid me a farewell and he hugs me many times also kissing my cheek. This makes me very very uncomfortable but I say nothing. I’ve worked with older Latin men before and I know they tend to be affection like that i.e. lots of hugs and cheek kissing so I kept telling myself it’s nothing. Everyone else has no problem with him but he just makes me feel weird. I don’t know if I’m overreacting or not but I just really don’t like being around him and I try to avoid him if I see him. 

Sorry about the bad grammar and run on sentences, I’m kind of all over the place and jumbled mentally right now. Writing this durning my lunch break in hope of missing his visit.

666,"First of all, I’m sorry about length and if the writing is kind of erratic. I’ve always been so shitty at explaining my feelings.

I guess I’m typing because I’m finally at the point where I realise that maybe I need help. A few years ago, I was fresh out of uni. It was 2016, I was living with my best friends and I was looking forward to starting my graduate teaching degree. I had gained like 60lbs over the course of university which was having an effect on my self esteem, and towards the end of my university career I was drinking on my own more and more often.

As I was about to start my teaching degree, my best friend and I had allowed a weird flirting game to become a thing, until it all got very fucked up and nasty - he told us he hated us all and we haven’t spoken to him since. I was broken up in bits for about 4 months following that. I don’t know how I functioned, but I didn’t wash my self or clean my room. I didn’t cook. I just ate cheese strings and pepperamis, washed down with 4 cans nightly. On the weekends, wine and cans combined. I ordered fast food constantly. It was shit. I was acutely aware that I barely saw my friends from university, and that our days of close, consistent contact were over. I was kind of a huge crisis for me. I felt alone.

Things began to feel kind of alright again at the end of the teaching qualification. It was summer 2017, I was going on holiday and seeing friends. I was still drinking though, quite a lot.

I get a job in the town I grew up in. I moved in to the family home, which is a council house (its a UK thing - the government offers homes they own at reduced rent prices. It allows you to buy the house at a massively discounted rate also). So I move in, and I’m looking at buying that at some point, or at least I feel I have to stay here and buy it, or I’ll be losing out on a good deal.

Flash forward to now. I’m doing well in my career, but I find I’m tired all the time. I nap often when I get home. I still drink almost nightly. I become so intensely bored that my only refuge is youtube and beer. I buy four pints almost nightly. I worry that its not enough so drive down again for a further 330ml. I obsessively check that windows are closed and the toilet seat is down (I have a cat. I obsessively check that the hobs on the oven aren’t on, that doors are locked and that things aren’t plugged in that I can’t see.

I just kind of accepted this is my life. Until the last few weeks. I’m a teacher, so its the start of the six week holidays. I’ve found that I’m becoming super emotional. I caught myself crying 4 times in 3 days which is unlike me. I’m struggling to clean or find anything interesting. All I can bring myself to do is use my computer. I’m just so disinterested. I’m lonely as fuck. I have vowed to stop drinking the last 10 days running, but I fear the intense boredom of not drinking. I just can’t not drink. I’m ust waiting to go to bed because I can’t bring myself to do activities. aLL I want to do is get some beer so I can bear the evening, sitting watching Netflix.

I had such a large meal an hour ago, that I’m lethargic and just want to sleep. If I can’t drink, I eat. I panic and worry about my weight constantly, to the point I avoid people or going places. I feel so heinously out of control. I just don’t see myself as somebody who is worth anything. I feel like a joke. I have gotten myself into a ridiculous amount of debt this year. I really miss my friends, and we speak most days on a facebook chat, but the connection is becoming looser - we maybe see each other once a year. i've tried to organise meetups. Most are just super caught up in relationships.

I have a meeting with the nurse on Wednesday morning about my skin - its been breaking out a lot recently, something I’ve never experienced until now. I want to say something to them but I just don’t feel like I’ll be taken seriously. I've bought some equipment to try get myself to do a modelling project, though it'll take 3 days for the stuff to get here.",28Jul2019,1
667,"First of all English isn't my native language and there are probably a lot of errors so I'm sorry about that.

There's this ""friend"" of mine who let's call her Z,
she's quite.. annoying to be frank.
We were in the same class back in 3rd grade but we never talked to each other and we weren't friends.. that's until 7th grade when i changed schools. She was the first person i met there so you know where that goes. We became friends but her personality changed drastically even since she bought herself a phone in the 8th grade. you see, she's the emotional/sensitive type of person whereas I'm the cold and awkward type and she enjoys attention.. a lot. she craves it to death. she lost a ton of weight just to look good in pics even though she was already thin ash. but that wasn't the problem. the problem started when she found out about the lgbt community.
sadly, being a part of the lgbt community has become a trend for some attention seekers. I respect the community but i hate it when someone pretends to be lgbt when they're obviously not.
so back to the story : She used to talk about having a crush on this dude but stopped talking about him all of a sudden and came out as a whole ""lesbian "" a year later after she found out about lgbt being a thing. she used to be interested in some bands/gps and had some fav OTPs and that's how she found out about the lgbt community in the first place. 
I know this is going to sound ignorant but i knew she wasn't gay and i was sooo mad about her using it for clout like it's nothing when in reality it's.. you know what's it like. it's messed up to use it for clout and attention. she got herself a gf in the role play community who lives far away from where we live and would brag about being ""gay"" and having a gf despite thirsting over men all the time. it was driving me crazy. 
So I did something stupid.
I started talking sh** about her behind her back.
but i didn't talk s*** about her to everyone. I just.. I just expressed how i was feeling about this whole thing to my best friend.
we goofed around and made some private channels on tele mocking the way she talks and stuff like that. I know it sounds messed up but everyone makes mistakes right? I regret doing that but what was she was doing wasn't exactly great either.
so fast forward to now.
I think she found out about what i did. 
 She posted a long a** story shading someone ""anonymously"" but the details are just.. I'm like 99.9% sure it's me.
here's a summary of what she posted:
you can talk sh** about me all you want ""behind"" my back(okay so a lot of shading and talking about how the ppl close to her and ppl who love her won't believe or care about the things i said which I'm going to skip) and then she goes on and uses a derogatory term to address the person she's talking about and mentions her following her each and every account which isn't true at all she's making it sound like i stalked her and i did NOT.
What am i supposed to do about this whole situation? What if she confronts me about it? My anxiety is eating me up and idk what to do.",28Jul2019,2

670,"Hello, everyone. My husband and I have just started a serious talk about starting our family and having a child (we really only want one) and the question of adoption or pregnancy came up. 

I have no experience with adoption or any systems around it, but I was raised with a very fluid idea of what family means. Basically that blood means very, very little, and it is the love, joy, and memories that you share that make a real family. Because of this, I never saw an issue with adoption as a means of bringing a child into a family. It was all the same to me, once a child was in your family, it was as good as blood. This is actually a bit of a problem, because I am on the fence with which option would be best for my own branch of the family tree, and my husband is as well. We aren't sure which we really want. 

His family has a much stricter, more traditional view of what family is (largely blood unless it's a spouse). They seem to view adoption as an outlet for those who simply cannot bear their own children, and his mother thinks adopting when you can bear a child is just insulting to those who cannot. She is quite upset that we are considering adoption, to the point of not speaking with him at the moment (this argument happened a day ago, and she has not responded to any texts he has sent her since. She usually replies fairly quickly). I have a lot of opinions on this, but I won't go into them now as they are not relevant to what we will ultimately decide, but that is part of the situation surrounding this choice.

Our biggest pro for pregnancy is seeing our own traits and physical appearance in our child. It is a little sad to miss out on that, though I personally think some of this is a matter of nature vs nurture and we will see some of ourselves in a child we raise regardless of how they came into our family. We've also considered health records (ours is fairly clean, no big issues that can be passed down). Another point he has made is that we may have a stronger connection to a child we had naturally because of the extra 9 months of bonding and the experience of giving birth. This is a point I would love some opinions or advice on, as I do see his logic and it is drawing towards having a child via birth. He has a great insurance plan through his job, so it may also be less expensive to have a child through birth. However, my husband hates seeing me suffer, and we both know pregnancy can cause plenty of that with the good bonding.

A point we take with adoption is that the world doesn't need more people, but there are people in the world who need the love we have to offer. As such, our big pro with adoption is that the idea of giving a loving home to someone who needs it, but I do worry that this is a romanticized way to look at it especially since we would be looking at infants or just above. Not to mention the horror stories I've heard of people having more or less the same mentality, only to find that they ""aren't connecting with the child like they want"" and end up hurting them because of it. I wouldn't be able to forgive myself if I put someone through that kind of experience. Another factor is that we do want a specific gender. Obviously our child will be our child, gender will have no impact on our love for them if we can't choose. We have discussed raising a boy and a girl at length and in various scenarios, but if we were given the opportunity to choose, we wouldn't be able to say that we don't care. I understand that is some selfish reasoning, but it is factoring into our consideration. Health history would be a greater concern, at least to my husband and I understand why. We don't know how much of the child's history we will be able to see ahead of time.

So finally, the advice we are looking for. What are some major pros and cons with both pregnancy and adoption, especially where the above background in relevant? Is there anything we are wildly wrong about or misunderstanding? Are our reasons for considering adoption too self-centered? Is there anyone who agrees with my mother-in-law, and why? What advice do you have regarding that opinion? If you have experience with both pregnancy and adoption, what advice or experience would you share on this situation? Thank you for your time reading this, and thank you in advance for your input. We are mainly just seeking a wider range of opinions on the matter, as our circle is fairly limited.",28Jul2019,4

Hugh Jackman, Tom Cruise, Chris Hemsworth, Johnny Depp, are famous actors society deems to be beautiful. It is very fascinating to think that within seconds of meeting someone we can find them to be physically beautiful or not but this begs the question, how can one determine what is beautiful or not beautiful about someone? What is beauty as a whole? How come many people find beauty in colorful art while a minority of people find beauty in darkness and horror? Can we find beauty in horrific events such as killings? Can chaos be considered beautiful? These are all the questions that I have asked myself throughout this course while studying the textbook Sagmeister &amp; Walsh: Beauty. All of these questions can have different interpretations to them. People might find one celebrity more aesthetically appealing than another and so on and so forth; however, for the most part, we can all come to the conclusion that there are certain characteristics that emit beauty: eyes, healthy hair, clear skin, nice smile but can we see beauty in unnatural or even “ugly” traits. If people are able to come to certain conclusions that characteristics can make human body beautiful than can beauty actually in the eye of the beholder? Ever since I was little, I found it fascinating how most people do not find certain traits like a large amount of body fat beautiful while some do. I believe beauty is something that is both natural and something we have been exposed to at such a young age which makes beauty, for the most part, in the eye of the beholder, but it is not limited to the hands of society. Although unusual, I believe there is beauty in disfigurement or in darkness and horrific events.

To begin, it is vital to define what beauty is. According to Google, beauty is a combination of qualities, such as shape, color, or form, that pleases the aesthetic senses, especially the sight. The most common form of beauty that is around constantly around us is the human body. At a young age parents encourage their kids to go outside and get some sun rather than waste away in the basement playing video games. They know that making good, active habits at a young age will not only help them stay healthy in the future, but it will keep them at an attractive weight. A healthy weight is an incredibly important feature for most people when searching for a partner. Some may even find it embarrassing to be in public with someone who is taking up space on the subway or an airplane because they are extremely overweight. To even question if weight matters to most people would be exceptionally foolish. If weight did not matter than there would not be so many weight loss pill commercials on television or a new fitness program that is guaranteed to get you results in ten weeks. All of those people who buy into those scams, for lack of a better word, are just setting themselves up for disappointment. These people most certainly know that it will not change their physique drastically but still buy into it because they are very desperate to look beautiful since society has set a standard that a thin body is attractive. Another example of weight being a significant feature to the human body would be when many people on dating platforms are worried if their date comes in and “catfished” them. This term refers to when someone comes to their date looking like a completely different person from their profile pictures. If beauty were to be abstract then it would not matter is someone is fat or thin, everyone would be beautiful in their own way because every individual is different but we know that is certainly a false hope. If people did find that there is beauty in “ugliness” than the weight loss industry would not be worth 70 billion dollar nor would the makeup industry be worth more than 500 billion dollars. This raises the question, can beauty be found in conditions that society does not traditionally find beautiful? Parents simply know that their child will be more happy if they were beautiful. Beauty can go a long way in finding a life partner of your liking or even landing a job at a company you have been working so hard to get.

As a personal example, I find beauty in my own physical flaws and in other more nuanced scenarios. As a teenager I started to get a bit of acne, which is normal for most teens but this was out of the ordinary. I woke up some mornings to see my pillow sheet had spots of blood on it from rolling around tossing and turning at night. I had to sleep a certain way in order to make sure my wounds do not burst and become worse. At the peak of my “ugliness”, I had gotten weird stares and even strangers making comments about my skin in front of me. The most notable comment was at a Taco Bell. I was on a work vacation and had stopped to get some food. As I was sitting down eating my food I heard a young kid, who had looked like he just got back from a baseball game, ask his friend next to him “Oh my god, what happened to his face?” The kid undoubtedly meant no harm but his statement pulverized my self esteem. Not to long after this ordeal, a family doctor had recommended to me that I be put on Accutane which would have cost my parents a few thousand dollars. After they had heard of this new, they tried to console me by saying that it will go away soon, or that it does not matter. For a bit of context, my parents are from India so they have different a different value system than the most western parents. Most western parents understand that your appearance does matter quite a bit, especially in our current generation. I was more upset at the fact that they were not able to understand what I was going through rather than the acne itself. I was eventually put on Accutane which had cleared my acne in a matter of months. People treated me differently, girls started calling me cute and showed me some attention. This was within a span of a year or so and in between that time, I was more or less the same person. My personality had not changed, my behavior had not changed, my bank account had not drastically gone higher or lower, I was just myself, an introvert who is not charming and does enjoy socializing all too much. Women gave me attention because I was a more beautiful man. In my own experience, beauty is important and it can be found both on the outside and inside. I never had someone come up to me and tell me that my acne is beautiful and that I should be proud of it but I did get a few compliments from people after my skin had cleared up. Years after suffering from horrific acne, I am left with grotesque scars for the rest of my existence. These scars run across my chest and back and I have a few on my cheeks. I understand some people find them to be ugly but every day when I wake up I am reminded of a horrible experience I had to go through which makes my “ugliness” beautiful. Moreover, I have actually come to a liking of my scars even though other people could find them repulsive. I am quite proud of the man I have become today and these scars just remind me of how far I have come as a person and at the end of the day that is what truly matters. On my deathbed it will not really matter if I had acne as a kid but more so how I reacted to having a conventionally unattractive trait. Telling someone that they are beautiful in their own way even if they are traditionally unattractive is nonsensical; however, I do think that there is something beautiful about each person in a more figurative way. Life in itself is beautiful. As humans we are able to comprehend our actions which makes us free beings with emotions and memories which leaves us with different experiences. These experiences from our actions is what makes us who we are and I find that beauty to be indescribable whether your action is moral or immoral.

On a broader note, beauty can be found in art. Art is the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power. I can see art all around me, from the orthodontist working on my teeth to the people who make my pizza. Art is everywhere. Most people refer to art as vibrant or moral but I believe there is beauty in dark more sinister things. For example, I was watching a documentary by Bob Arno, who is one of the greatest stage pickpockets of all time. Bob performs on stage so that act in itself is deemed to be moral and entertaining since no one is at harm. He went on a trip around Europe with a camera crew to find the best of the best in their craft of pickpocketing. He met a group of thieves who were able to steal a wallet from him without him knowing in the moment. The camera crew told Bob so he went out and talked to them. Eventually he was able to charm them so the group shared some secrets with him. Bob was quite impressed with their skills and invited them over for some dinner and insisted on them bringing in other thieves so they could take about their experiences pickpocketing. On the night of the dinner these men, and some women, talked about their craft like it was a work of art. They talked about their actions with such pride and elegance. These pickpockets knew that what they did was immoral but they have fallen in love with the art of pickpocketing that they will not be able to stop. They have found beauty in something so evil but yet they still continue to do it even though they know that they are in the wrong. If someone were to pickpocket me, I would be upset but quite astonished as to how they were able to misdirect my attention and steal whatever belonging I had. These thieves are corrupt human beings but most people can understand and find the beauty in being able to direct someone's attention in order to steal their wallet or watch. “American philosopher Denis Dutton posits that all well-executed human achievement could be described as beautiful.” (Sagmeister &amp; Walsh, 12). These pickpockets have perfected the art which must not have been easy. They are well aware of the risks but advance forward like David fighting Goliath.  Although I have no intention of becoming a pickpocket, their art is very interesting albeit immoral.

Now, moving on to some darker topics, I believe beauty can be seen in even the most horrific of acts: killing. For example, when a serial killer commits a heinous act of killing, most people view it as an eerie tragedy but they view it as art. In the television show, Dexter, the main character takes a sample of his victim's blood and sees the act of killing as a fun game. In most serial killing cases, a serial killer seduces the victim and brings them over to his or her home and kills them. Although most of society can not see the beauty in it, I’m certain that a few people are able to appreciate the serial killers act even though it was immoral. Being able to build enough rapport to lure and kill someone is quite intriguing even for me. Why did the victim trust them? Why did they enter his or her home? Getting someone a stranger to trust you enough to have them come into your home is not something most people can do. It takes a certain charm and skill to be able to do that which I can appreciate even though this is something I find frightful. 

Since the topic of beauty being in the eye of the beholder is such an important discussion in philosophy, I would like to touch up on the subject and relate it back to my topic: can beauty be seen in dark things. I believe that beauty has to be in the eye of the beholder. The example with Coca-Cola cans and different company logos (Sagmeister &amp; Walsh, 111) is too dubious. Beauty, for the most part, can most certainly be manipulated by society; however, I believe that at the end of the day society can only influence you to find something beautiful not change your perception on what you already think is beautiful. For example, if tons of male celebrities grew out their hair, sure many people would copy that style but a small group of men would not find that attractive and keep the hair that they already have. The people who chose to change their hairstyle and make it longer are people who are too consumed in media and care too much about their appearance, in my opinion. Another example would be with different styles of art. Many people are able to appreciate the work of Vincent Van Gough or Salvador Dali; however, there minority of groups who like more lesser known styles of art such the Weeping Woman by Paublo Picasso which portrays asmusic simply find it appealing. It is hard to change someone’s taste in music. You simply like it or you do not. Just like the different hairstyles, you either like it or you do not.",28Jul2019,0
673,"Made a drunken mistake one night; said I would be ok with a friend I once (and still kinda do) have unrequited feelings for joining a group chat I frequent, thinking I was mostly over it and could handle speaking to her again. The second I realized what i'd done, I was internally screaming at myself. It's been 2 years since we last spoke and I have no idea what to talk about with her. I find myself either trying too hard to impress or overthinking my interactions with her.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day, I saw her playing video games with other friends in our group chat and it brings my blood to a boil (basically jealousy) Why can't I do that with her without being scared? What if she develops feelings with someone else? I know I can't be with her; that's her choice and I have to respect it. But I don't want to be in a situation where the girl I like(d) got with one of my other friends; would rather it be some guy I don't have a history with and won't have to see.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like i'm falling back down the rabbit hole; the very rabbit hole I tried to avoid by cutting ties in the first place. Now that she's part of this group chat, i'm going to have to interact with her more and see her with my other friends instead of me from time to time. I have been anxious about it all day and I both can't stop thinking about it and have no idea what to do about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**: A girl who I use to like and haven't talked to in 2 years has come back into my life and in a way that I can't just ignore her. I thought I was mostly over her, but now i'm not sure given that I get jealous seeing her alone with another guy. I think it's a fruitless endeavor to try and flirt with her, so I think being friends is the right way to go. But I have no idea how to approach her; i'm scared of trying too hard to impress her or that i'll overthink the situation and hate myself.",28Jul2019,1

675,"( Long text / read if you're bored and want to help a sis out :))

Iactually am really sensitive about this topic but i have to let my thoughts out now.
I need advice...
About 3 years ago I met a girl (let's name her Mia). A mutual friend of mine (Liz) was the cause of the meeting.
Mia and Liz were best friends, I was just a normal friend to Liz, because Mia and Liz were going to the same class. ( I am older than them, that's why I was going to grade 8 and they to grade 7 back in the day) so we still were school friends you could say. We became a trinity and later Mia and I became really really close because we were goong thru the same family issues atbthe same time. That was the real cause of our strong bond. Last year when I was ready to go to highschool I prayed god for a friend ( I was scared to be alone all the time because I wasn't really friends with anybody who was in my grade) To my surprize a new girl (Alex) came to our school and we automatically clicked. Well, I have to admit that 11th grade changed a lot in my life. I was a person who had panick attacks because of school, really bad anxiety and I left home and stayed over at Mias place because I fought with my mom ( I wanted to drop out of school because I was crying everyday and I was scared, scared for no real reason that was just who I was). Mia was always by my side I have nothing to say against that. Actually, that's the reason why I am confused aboutbthis situation.
Over the past year I was stressed out because of high school. I had so many exams etc etc etc. That was kinda the reason why I couldn't do much with my friends at all.  1. The situation at school was hella important for me due to the fact that these upcoming 2 years (11th and 12th grade) would decide wether I could gontonuniverity or not AND 2 it was all about my mental health which was at its lowest point.
So over the year Mia started fights over chat with me and always told me what I did wrong. 
I mean I have nothing against people telling me what I do wrong or what may make them sad but the way she approached me was shitty af.
It was always ,,Are you fucking kidding me ...... you did that you do that.""  She legit started fights over little thing and wrote paragraphs telling me how she had the right to react a certain way because of something I did. (For example I cried my soul out after I fightbI had with my Mom and atbthat time she was at a wedding butbinstead of having fun there she texted me to cheer me up, and 2 days after that we met at school but her and Liz were not so talkative so I didn't talk to them asmuch aswell ( and I just wrote an exam before seeing them) well afterwards I saw some guys from my grade and I laughed because of the answers they wrote on their exams and I talked to them a little bit ( mia and liz watched me from a distance) my mood was still down because of the fight I had but luckily ( sarcasm) Mia texted me and attacked me. Because ,,What the fuck is wrong with me for ignoring them and laughing with the guys from my grade even tho she was there for me a couple days earlier and helped me out instead of having fun on that wedding"" 
Questioned me on what type of drugs I was
Oh nvm I just read my text and realized how stupid I am for even asking for advice because now I realize how crazy that girl must be.
Shall I move on anyway? Yeah because I can't stand being silent about the bs I had to go thru.
NOW we always had lil fights over little things JUST like that and guess what after reading her long ass texts I always apologized because I didn't want to continue the bs.
I knew, she knew that I'd rather apologize than continue a fight because I always think life is too short for bs like that until.... a couple weeks ago.
Sooo btw at the same time I became really close with Alex who is MY age. 
And a new girl named Zara came aswell and holy we 3 really got along together . 
Why you may ask? We studied for exams together we went thru thick and thin even tho we were knowing eachother for like a couple months. They were..... more mature I guess and that was what made me comfortable.
Hold on don't think I am a bad person and replaced my old two bestfriends.
I did not.
Mia and Liz had their own place in my hear even after all the drama ( Liz was actually always chill I had NEVER EVER a fight with her but imI had too many with Mia. )
So the past weeks Mia and I rarely texted and we couldn't hang out ( we wanted to but I had to bail because of family issues etc so it wasn't on purpose I really missed her ) whatever.
I texted a couple times but no with the same energy I used to ( she drained my energy enough) but Instill wanted to check on her and always asked what she's been doing and how her school is going.
well she answered but at the end of the convo it was always me who was left on read. So i stopped.
On the last day of school I saw her after 2 weeks in the hallway, she almost ran away from me and my smile faded away. Fast forward I started hanging out with Alex and Zara. AFTER our exam season I HAD THE TIME to actually DO something with friends. And alex and Zara always asked me if we wanted to donsonething so we did. And we sometimes posted it on our insta story. Well guess what. These stories triggered someone enough to bash me.
After the first story, Mia posted a story about cutting people off of her life and I found out that I was the only person who could see the post. I did not react. Her cousin whom I was kinda chill with blocked me after they hung out. 
I did not react. Then, Zara and I posted sonething on our story ( Henna on our hands and it was a beautiful design , Zara posted it so I just reposted) well guess what, someone texted me that night because nightine is the best time to start drama.
Again it was ,, do you remember what you told me about not changing? Well youve changed idk you anymore böah blah"" i told her that I couldnt understand her and wanted specific REASONS for her thinking. Keep in mind I texted, I checked on her, I even mentioned her running away from me. But guess my ""change"" is the reason why the friendship slowly broke. 
She said that I bailed on her enough and never asked another time to hand out ( I mean she couldve asked me aswell, I was waiting for a great timing to ask her again but no patience) She told me that I ignored her and Liz on purpose at school ( I see no point in doing that and Also my eyes are bad and the school is crowded ashell and last time I checked she was running away from me?¿) and she said that we don't talk the way we used to ( I always texted her every two days to start a convo it never worked out so I gave up) well. That was my exact response and I've said that her reaction to all that is not my responsibility. And I said that if she still felt that way I couldn't help her at all. Well, she then said that our friendship isn't her responsibility aswell and again said that she just ,,wanted to clear things without knowing the I wasn't capable of starting a discussion"" so again, I am the fault :)
After that she posted things shading me, changed her bio shading me, and simply somehow shaded me, while I.did.nothing. No reaction . (Did you notice that I did not apologize this time for anything? Crazy right)
Well after that ""fight"" I texted Liz because Inknew that Mia told Liz about all that ( they are bffs) I wrote Liz that I didn't want the situation between me and Mia affect the friendship between us and she said yeah nothings wrong so I was like great.
Well now 5 weeks after that. 
Liz apparently spoke to a friend of Zara. (Liz is friends with that girl and Zara is friends with that girl butbthat girl does not know me)
Zara told good stuff about me tonthat girl and apparently the girl said to Liz that she heard that I was a really good person while Liz responded with ,,I don't believe in that in fact she is worse than you might think you don't know what happened etc""
well? Never expected that.
Also Mia unfollowed me weeks ago but I still followed Liz. Now Liz unfollowed me out of the blue aswell and my conused ass sits here like.
What? 
Did I do something wrong or what the heck?
So the advice I need is.
How the heck should I react to the situation or how do I handle it?",28Jul2019,1

678,"A bit of intro. I'm in my 20s, lived with my dear family for my entire life until I moved out a few weeks ago because I got a great job in a different city that's about 500 km (311 miles) away from my home.
At first it was great because my company had provided me a business class hotel for the first couple of weeks so that I'll have time to look for a place to rent. My hotel duration was running out so I had to find a place to stay, desperately. I found a place to stay and moved in there very recently. This is when the problems started.
The locality of the place is bad. The place itself isn't too clean, neither too dirty.  Now, obviously the solution is to find another place to live. But I can't. Every place that's good enough (or even average) is totally out of my budget. They cost about 70%-80% of what I make only for the rent. So I have to settle for a place that is below average, so that the rent will be about 50% of what I make and I can still afford other expenses.
I don't want to quit my job because it's like my dream job. They unfortunately don't hire in my city so I have to stay here if I want to work here.
I broke down today because I really don't want to live in a place riddled with mosquitoes and without clean water. But I simply cannot financially afford to live in better places.
On the contrary, my workplace is extremely good. The locality is where the rich people live and I'd rather be at my office 24/7 than go back to my place.
I don't know what to do, if I cannot adapt to live here I'll have to quit my dream job (which I don't want to) and move back to my home city (which I would love to). I just need a better place to live, that's really the only problem I have. Everything else is great. 
Any advice? Thanks.",28Jul2019,1

Okay, I understand that $10 per person is a lot of money for a high school performance. Spring show comes around and I am pumped for my family to come, last weekend of the show my mom goes up to me and says ""I don't want to go so here's the $10 i would spend."" And the rest of my family said nothing.

And it's not like none of them knew, I had a poster on the fridge and it was on our calendar all month and they just said nothing. There was also two other fundraising events (one i planned completely so i was really proud) that they still didnt show up.

680,"I'm about to head off to college so I will likely need to find a new therapist anyway since I'm going out of state, but I need some advice in regards to my current therapist as to drop her completely or to go to her whenever I'm in town.

I'm transgender and have pretty bad ocd, and my parents are both convinced that the idea of me being trans is a result of my OCD, and my therapist is on the fence about that as well. My parents are narcissistic so I'm not asking for advice on that front, but my therapist has been making a lot of claims that seem to be grasping at straws, such as her saying that because I've had boyfriends, that I may not be trans. I'm bisexual so that point makes no sense to me as is, but I'm mainly concerned about her competency because sexuality =/= gender. This is true medically speaking as well. She implied that because I cry when talking about being trans (a result of my home life) that it's all a part of my OCD. She also compared me to her other patients in this situation, which wasn't very professional.

But on the other hand she has been very helpful with other issues that have arisen due to my OCD causing intrusive thoughts, and making me think things that aren't true. I can't differentiate certain things from my ocd and reality sometimes so I'm very concerned that I'm actually being delusional. 

I don't want to stay with her if I'm being manipulated or experiencing some sort of malpractice, but I can't really tell. I'm open to giving more details if needed, thank you all in advance!",28Jul2019,0

686,"I truly fear at 36 I’ve ruined my life.  

I know this is an incredible long and maudlin post, I apologize for this rambling mess but I have no idea what to do and sending my voice out into space is the only thing I can think of at the moment to easy the pain and anxiety I’m in. 

The circumstances of my life are as such, when I was in high school I was obsessed with art, film, and acting/performance art. I would draw and make short films with an intensity of focus bordering on tunnel vision. I now see this as also a coping mechanism for my turbulent family life. My parents had me young and had an incredibly messy divorce, blamed having me for their wasted lives and promptly kicked me out the second I turned 18, refusing to help pay or navigate the paperwork/logistics to go to college. I was truly terrified of school debt and the application process so I avoided it all together. At the time I looked up to guys like Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino, and Paul Thomas Anderson. Basically everyone that preached “going to films” instead of going to film school. This felt safe to me and justified my decision(out of fear) to not go to school. So I hung around my home town working in the same grocery store high school job dreaming of making a film that would get me out of there and into a career. I was going to be Soderbergh. I was going to be Spike Lee or Linklater. Of course this was the terrible decision making skills of an 18 year old kid with absolutely zero adult guidance. In reality, I was going to be nothing. At first I did work on the side, but as the years ticked by I got more and more depressed and my creative output ground to a halt. I stayed working menial customer service jobs and my depression grew and grew as all of my friends moved on without me. First through undergrad then graduate school and finally respectable positions like professors and doctors. Meanwhile, I’m still working at a locally run grocery store. I read a lot and take in a lot of art, eclectic interests, so I still feel intelligent can hang/keep up with conversation despite my deprived environment. During these years dating became harder and harder. I had a decent personality and could be charming despite the fact that my exterior life in no way matched my internal life or who I am as a person. It’s easier to live like this when you are 25 but It became a very big problem as I approached my thirties and I found relationships would have about a six month expiration due to the fact that I am very depressed, not doing anything with my life and have no money. The thing is, I was very good at hiding these things and I put forth a very cheerful and easy going demeanor when in reality I’m depressed and scared out of my mind about what I’m going to do 24/7. So the danger is with familiarity in a relationship, the hold on that normal facade cracks and the depression seeps through. What kept me going was the ability to fantasize about this other life I could be leading, that of a filmmaker or artist. Or the fantasy of a fulfilling relationship. That helped me get through these grueling days but also prevented me from making any big change or steps out. I was constantly looking for bandaid solutions rather than treating the larger problem causing my severe depression. The environmental ones. I got into working out, I got into tarot cards. I got into poetry anything to keep my brain occupied. Flash forward to now, two decades flew by faster than I could comprehend and I’m 36. I’ve accrued $9,000 of meaningless credit card debt and I’m still working an easy, slightly above minimum wage job. I couldn’t afford a car so I’ve been biking to work the last three years which felt amazing besides the social negatives of not having a car. I was also working out more intensely to have a decent body to make up for all the things lacking about my life. I’d go on dates feeling like a Swiss cheese person, with all these gaps and holes in my life. My misguided thought was maybe id be able to enter a relationship and they’d let the more rotten parts of my life slide. I figured, if I can’t find meaning in the only career I wanted, at least I could find meaning in a relationship. Time spent with someone I love helps to suppress the depression and makes me feel like I’m spending my life in a meaningful way. 
This year everything came crashing down in a total collapse. It’s like all of the bad decisions I had been making consistently for over a decade were slowly loading a punch with enough knock out power to put me down permanently. I started the year in a relationship with someone I’m crazy about, unfortunately six months in I developed an injury from a decade of accumulative tension due to poor squatting/powerlifting form and running, rugby and bike commuting and extreme anxiety. It’s a rare and freak thing but in conjunction with two labrum tears in my hips I have pelvic floor dysfunction which manifests in all sorts of terrible discomforts the most severe being medication resistant erectile dysfunction. The stress of this caused my relationship to implode and I lost this person and all hope of a future relationship. The doctors seem clueless and give little help besides PT(which I can’t afford with my insurance) to alleviate my symptoms. It’s possible this might be permanent and sex may be out of the question from now on. This caused an even more severe spiral into depression. I’ve been prescribed anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds, but neither are doing the trick. The worst thing of all is this has snapped me out of the idiotic fantasy I’ve been living in the past twenty years. I feel like I’ve been in a coma for the last twenty years while someone else was living(and ruining) my life. I can’t believe I’d make such a stupid decision as to think I’d make movies on my own, so far from LA or NY and that would actually pan out to something like a career. Now I’m incredibly regretful for having not applied myself when I was younger and gone to college. It’s clear I needed structure and it’s very hard to survive in this world without it. Especially the incredibly vague path of the art world. All I wanted in my life was to make films or be in that world and make art and I’ve ruined all chance of that now. I recently lost my apartment and I’m crashing on my friend’s floor. I of course am not riding my bike or working out anymore, just taking a bus everywhere. My exercise now is stretching, some yoga and long walks early in the morning because I can’t sleep. Everyone tells me to get a job at Whole Foods because of the benefits but it feels awful knowing that’s all I’m qualified for after all these years. The world of film has changed today and the type of auteurs I looked up to don’t exist anymore, especially with streaming content. It’s very hard and sobering. Seeing movies and art made by people my age or younger is also painful. I feel like I’m grieving my own life, like I was committing a very slow form of suicide the past few decades for no reason whatsoever and nothing to show for it, except to say I was very depressed. The conclusion is, I don’t know what hope I have now. I know it’s impossible that I’ll ever be a filmmaker or work in that field at this age, I blew that completely. Working a minimum wage job is not sustainable but that’s all I’m qualified for.  I have a hard time figuring out what career I could fit in that would be better, because I have interest in nothing else. I have no car, or apartment. My friends have almost all moved on and moved away. I can’t sleep at night due to constant stress/fight or flight mode. The last few months I’ve just been completely adrift doing the bare minimum to survive and it feels like that’s all the future holds for me. I think about suicide almost constantly as my day to day is racked with pain and pointlessness. I took psychedelics out of boredom and hope that it would free my mind from such rigid depressive thought, but that resulted in a series of bad trips spent sobbing under the blankets. I have no idea what to do. It seems like I’d have to accept my current situation, accept that my dreams are not going to come true and I’m at fault for that, but I just don’t think I can. How do you forgive yourself for pointlessly ruining your own life? I ruined my body out of vanity, because i hated my body and  thought no one would date me unless I looked good and I ruined my career out of fear, depression and anxiety. For my adult life I didn’t make any risky decision out of fear I’d make the wrong decision but as it goes, no decision was the worst I could have made. I just have no idea how to proceed or dig myself out of this deep deep hole. I truly understand hopelessness now and when I think about my life it amounts to the most cliche, whiny story about being swallowed up by a meaningless life, a slave to debt and bad decisions. I just spent my entire life in this delusion that things would work out and seeing with clarity now that things will not and I have to live with the consequences of these decisions is too much to bear. I’ve always had a lot of resilience and could take a lot of, honestly needless punishment, but I’ve reached the burn out breaking point. At the worst I feel like I’m wasting away in the void, I don’t belong anywhere or to anyone but I have a desperate need to. I clearly needed guidance, especially when I was younger, but I’m at a lack now. I’ve tried life coaches therapists, but the pool is small with my insurance and financial situation. What do I do? What am I going to do? I live with this constant hum of pain, like I have a migraine of the soul.

My dad has immigrated to the UK fifteen years ago, and i've been living with my mother and stepfather.

I really want to stay here in the UK. I feel safer and will have way more oportunities for the future. My dad doesn't have a citizenship, but he does have permanent residence.

The marriage and divorce between my mother and father was not pretty.They still hate each other. I have some bad things with my mother and stepfather as well. I am scared that things will get bad just like before if i try to tell my mom so i can stay here, or if theyll press charges.

While it seems really nice to stay here in wales, and stay with my dad that i have a far more close relationship thawith my mom, im scared of creating a shitstorm by trying to stay here from what was a  vacation.

690,"So long story short, my current position is IT and System Admin for almost 1 year. Our company has been recently hiring more people and acquiring new systems including the new CRM System for organizing sales, marketing, finance, and overall operations. 

Our company has an owner and he is the CEO and he recently hired a 'Managing Partner' to oversee the company's operations and do the management. 

I've been told by the managing partner that in the next months we need to focus more on building the CRM and automating much of the work so he told me I might need to shift my position from system administration to become the CRM Manager.

I asked for an honest explanation. He told me that the owner doesn't want me to work on my current position anymore \[ No idea why, I always receive positive performance reviews and solved many critical problems among which is the recent crash in one of our productions servers, so most probably I was being backstabbed by one of the owner's favorites as the managing partner said to me ). For this reason and for the fact that they need a solid and creative person to handle the CRM operations as a business IT, the managing partner described.

So these are the two reasons I was told. But I was more honest and I asked him if I'm being laid off, he said that the owner tried to lay off before but he couldn't find an alternative but for now we really need someone for the CRM system.

Therefore, I will be shifting my position and start handling the CRM in the coming days while they look for someone to take over my current position. 

So I was 50% convinced that he might be right but at the same time I have the hunch that once they hire the new sys admin and once this new hiree takes over my current position, they will even lay me off from the CRM Management and by that they secure the data and information related to their IT resources from any reaction from me should they directly lay me off without this story.

692,"So a friend of mine was raped by a taxi driver a few weeks ago, and the story is after filtering through to me now.

Obviously, i’m in shock that something terrible could happen to someone i know, so i’m still trying to comprehend that.

She obviously hid it from a lot of us, which i don’t disagree with at all.

I just want to know is how i should react when i see her? I don’t want to treat her differently, because she is still the same person, just a terrible thing happened to her.

Should i tell her i’m sorry about what happened and that i’m there if she needs me, or is that to in your face, as if i want to know all her business, which i don’t.

I want to let her know i support her, and that we all love her as a friend, without mollycoddling, or treating her different.

694,"Context:

* I (20F) don't own a car. 
* My dad let me borrow/drive his old one for the past year. 
* I have savings, but &lt;$10,000. I'll have more by the end of this summer. 

The car in question is a 2012 Prius. It's in pretty good shape. Has &lt;100,000 miles on it. Hasn't been in any accidents. He's selling it to me for $3,000, which is a deal for this car.

My issues with the car are minor, but kind of annoying. 

* The front is very low, so if I accidentally pull too far forward over something (e.g. a parking bumper), the bottom of the car's bumper falls off. I have paid my dad to repair it 3 times. Now I just duct tape it up. 
* I can't drive it to do my hobbies (snowboarding, camping, etc.). I rely on friends to drive me, which is fine, but then I'm always running on other people's schedules/wants and needs.
* Its battery just died, so I am not feeling very happy w/ it right now.

&amp;#x200B;

My options are to either buy this car with approximately 40% of my savings (so far), or blow 75% of my savings at the end of summer on a car that I actually like. 

&amp;#x200B;

I recognize that this is a great deal, and that I'm probably upset at it dying on me. However, I'm just bummed at the thought of paying $3,000 for something I don't really love. Not sure what to do.",28Jul2019,1

700,"My BPD ex [M,25] and I broke up a year ago. He dumped me over text after a year and half with no explanation and has been out to ruin my life ever since. He has smear campaigned over social media, in person, turned my best friends against me and drove me to the point of wanting to kill myself.

As of a month ago he started dating/having sex with this girl that I was friends with for 4 years before he turned her against me. They stopped talking for some reason. 

As of today, a girl I would’ve considered my “best friend” randomly texted me and said, “[BPD ex] and I are talking.” When I have confided in her and she knows the fucked up shit my BPD ex has done to me. I have told her everything about BPD ex and I. She said, “nothing you can say can change my mind because I’ve heard both sides of the story and that’s what swayed my decision.” It hurts.

So I didn't care, but yesterday I got curious and checked them again and, there's was only 1 and everything was moved around.

707,"For reference I’m a 23-year-old male.
 
I don’t know where my expectations were for house parties and clubs in high school, but I just don’t feel like I’m enjoying them like I’m supposed to. My family is mystified by my attitude for house parties, but I’ve been to a few, and I haven’t enjoyed a single one. I’m constantly being pressured in to going to these things, but I just can’t anymore. They’re just not fun for me. Maybe I’m just a grumpy old, 23-year-old man.

I went to a club with a cousin two weekends ago, and I’m confident that will be the last party I ever go to. I just want to make sure I’m not missing something.

When I’m with my best friends, it’s different. We sit around. We talk. We play cards, board games and DnD. We watch movies. We play video games. We watch sports. There’s very little drinking. Not much music. We all bring a dish to pass but usually the host cooks dinner. I especially like to grill. We just chill and talk. In high school, we were nerds. But now we’re just grown adults that like video games. And as time has progressed, our group has gained and lost people.

The problem is that I only see my best mates every once in a while, because we all have real lives and work and school and budding families. I.E. none of us peaked in high school. The rest of my acquaintances act like bar hopping counts as a personality.


House parties and clubs are the polar opposite of chilling. I think my main beef is with alcohol. I have no self-control. I have an addictive personality. When I start drinking, I can’t stop. Same as when I gamble or smoke or play certain video games. When I’m pressured in to drinking something at house parties, I get uncomfortable. 


Also, modern music sounds like shit. I haven’t enjoyed a pop song since I was in middle school. It all sounds the same to me. Just the same snap-track over and over and over. Except at parties, they turn the bass all the way up so you can’t even hold a decent enough conversation with the person next to you. You probably already guessed that I’m not the dancing type either.


!Controversial opinion incoming!: whenever someone tries to explain hook-up culture to me, I think rape. I can’t comprehend how hook-up culture even works. Just get as drunk as possible and then have sloppy sex? Also, when I drink, my gun doesn’t cock. It just won’t. Tmi, I know. All and all, hooking-up at parties is a nono for me. 

I don’t know. When I turned 18, I went to parties for the experience and the alcohol. Now that I’m 23, I just feel like I’m over it. I feel old. Meanwhile, I have acquaintances in their 30’s that still party hard – kids and all. And I’m sitting home with my cat playing Yakuza 0.

Tl;DR

I don’t want validation or anything. I just want to know how partying is supposed to work versus what I’ve experienced so far. Even my parents judge me hard on this, and I just want to hear your opinions.",28Jul2019,0
708,"I’ll save all the unnecessary details and just get straight to the point.

I am a 17 year old female. I have been suffering from suicidal thoughts since the age of 12. I have had 3 attempts, all which were obviously unsuccessful and only landed me trapped in a psych ward.

I have been on many, many, many medications to help treat my depressive disorder. None of which have worked.

I thought things were finally getting better after a 8 month bipolar episode; i was clearly wrong.

Every single day I imagine ways that I could take my own life, and to be honest with you, I’m afraid. I’m afraid that I might actually be successful this time. And I’m afraid that I won’t be afraid much longer.

I do have a psychiatrist and psychologist. Neither have been helpful lately and it’s my fault. I feel completely hopeless. During our sessions I often feel invalidated so I leave out many details. I’ve given up on therapy, nothing is helping me.

I don’t think this post is really asking for advice. Maybe it is? I don’t know.

We do not currently live together and have been struggling to find a place even with local gov't assistance. My income isn't high enough with my current job to afford a place as most rentals require we make at least 3x the rent to qualify for housing.

I’m at the point where I don’t even want to or know how to study properly because my brain immediately slows down or at worse time stops completely at the thought of school or studying. 

I’ve been to three therapists but instead of trying to help me deal with the present issues they always try to dig up a problem in my past. All they do is make me cry, get depressed and really worn out. Energy is what I really need instead of getting home worse than I’ve ever been.

716,"I’m about 10 years older than my little brother. I stopped by my mom’s house (where he lives) and found the remnants of a party in the basement. There was a broken stool, liquid sprayed on the walls, beer cans, etc. 

He’s going into his sophomore year of high school. He does well in school and is a very talented athlete. I’m not too sure how to handle this. I know ultimately it’s my mom’s job, but his dad doesn’t live with him and isn’t a great role-model. I feel like he looks up to me and takes what I say to heart. 

IMO 15 is way too young to be drinking. I know it happens at every high school in the US at that age, but in my experience the kids who started early didn’t end up being successful go-getters. (I know it’s not black and white. Early drinking age doesn’t mean there will be a lack of success).

I know there’s psychology behind how to handle this. Kids rebel. You tell them they can’t do something and you can bet your ass that they will. 

First step would have to be talk about the effects of drinking. Show how it doesn’t match up with his goals of being a D1 athlete. I’m just having a hard time with what rules my mom can set for him. Wait until your 16 and you have to communicate when you will be drinking? He goes to a very good private HS, but all of the athletes party. (Also, he plays up in sports so he hangs out with the old crowd). I don’t think it’s possible to tell him not to, because it will create resentment or he will do it anyways. Any input would be appreciated!

725,"Hello. Sorry for the long post, but I really need to get this off my chest and get some advice. 

I'm 19 ftm, and I'm moving to a new city to start uni in a few weeks. I'm not on hormones yet and unfortunately won't be for another 6 months or so. I also look very young, presumably because of my height (5'4) and my babyface. I usually pass, but other times I'm forced to just out myself because explaining how I'm a 19 year old guy with the voice of a 12 year old is hopeless.

As you can imagine, this is less than ideal. I'm tired of having one of my first interactions with people being me having to come out and just HOPE the other person is open minded enough to accept me but to also not treat me like a poor little uwu precious bean (you know what I mean). I pretty much look and act like any regular guy, but finding people who are able to treat me as such is rather difficult. High school sucked, I was always stuck with people in between two extremes (""all trannies are gross and disgusting""-people and ""your neongender dragonpony identity is valid""-people). For this reason, I didn't have many friends, didn't try to make friends either, and just tried staying invisible for those years. It got insanely lonely and I feel like I missed out on a lot. 

Now that I'm moving away to a new place far away and starting uni, I kinda want to make up for those years I lost. I crave friendship, parties, random hook-ups, just stupid and fun things you do while you're young. However, I'm just constantly plagued by worries about how the whole trans thing is gonna fit into the picture. For me, my identity is not a big deal, I don't want to bring attention to it, I just want to be treated normally. The whole transgender trend going on is really bothersome, and I don't want to be associated with it. I wish people would stop associating me with pride parades and radical opinions just because I'm trans. How do I deal with all of this when I'm pretty much forced to be out? How do I navigate between the two extremes that either pick on me or patronize me?",28Jul2019,0

I[19 F] was at a party yesterday. It was 3 am and it was getting kinda boring. There was this guy[27 M] that I just met that day and we got along great. We started talking and he said we should take a walk. I don’t know why I said yes. So we walk and talk and then we sit down on a bench. It was in a public place but nobody was walking around. Suddenly he starts to kiss me, which I was fine with. Then he immediately put his hand under my shirt on my boobs which I was not that comfortable with but I did not comment on it. Still I told him that I don’t want him to touch me further. Then he suddenly pulls up my shirt, takes one of my boobs out and sucks on my nipple after I told him I was not comfortable with that. He asked me if I wanted him to go down on me which I said no. I also told him not to touch me anywhere near my vagina because I had a medical problem( which was a lie I did not feel comfortable).He then repeatedly put his hand under my shirt and I told him that I was not comfortable with that and even repeatedly pushed his hand away but he seemed not to care. At one point he even pulls hard on my hair. He even got me to be on top of him for a while and then we were done. I told him I didn’t want sex and he understood that. Afterwards I did not know how to get away faster. I was shivering from what had happened. I am so stupid for going on a walk with him. I did not enjoy the way he was kissing me, it felt forceful and like I was being used for his pleasure. I basically spaced out hoping it would pass sooner. I told him repeatedly that I was not comfortable with what he was doing to me. I don’t know why I didn’t push him I guess that in the moment sometimes you are too overwhelmed to do something.

I’m not sure what our relationship is right now, but everyone else in both of our lives think we are dating. I need help on what to do about this situation. She lives about 45 minutes away, and we go to different schools. I don’t if it is worth the risk to tell her and ruin our friendship, or keep it from everyone. 

P.S. I know that some of the posts on this subreddit are a lot more problematic, but I haven’t told anyone and I needed to get it off of my chest.",28Jul2019,1
731,"It's been nearly a month since I got a Alaskan malamute puppy and hes very much an outdoors dog. I've tried so hard to get him trained to be indoors but he enjoys running around in the garden and taking a snooze on the porch. 

We have a dog house which provides shelter, food and water but he avoids it unless hungry or thirsty. Recently its started raining so I'm trying to get him to sleep inside or in the doghouse but either way he makes such a racket and is only quiet when hes left to his own devices. Been told this is normal for the breed.

Neighbours from a few doors down came over today to tell me they're reporting me for animal neglect because the noises break their heart etc. I explained the situation to them but they dont seem convinced.

My partner wasnt home at the time and is fuming and wanting to go over there for a chat. I know this will make the situation worse. But I'm so upset that someone would think you're capable of animal abuse &amp; neglect. 

How can I diffuse this situation? Need to calm my partner, keep the dog quiet and pull myself together.

I'm surprised because as of late the street has gone downhill with new ppl moving in (increased noise levels, fights, kids being a nuisance etc) so shocked that my dog is an issue but nothing else was.",28Jul2019,2
732,"This is a very long and complicated story but I’m going to try my best to be as concise as possible. If anything needs to be added or clarified please let me know.

This time last year, my mother and I were forced to empty out the house we had previously lived in for many years in a very short amount of time (within ~6 weeks). (The circumstances of that is a whole different story in and of itself, definitely don’t have the space to discuss it here, but it was a very traumatic experience.) At that time, we each had our own apartment. The house wasn’t empty/abandoned (friends of ours had been staying there), plus the majority of my mom’s belongings and some of mine, were still in the house. 

My mom has always had a lot of “stuff” – books, clothes, collectibles, household products, you name it, she had at least 3 of it in different colors. An issue we always clashed over was that I said she was a hoarder but she vehemently denies it. Granted, our home was never filled with trash, just a lot of clutter. Growing up, she had a very hard life and her parents and siblings never really let her have anything of her own. I am sure this is why in her adult life she has accumulated so much.

Back to what happened last summer. We had to empty out our house which was packed with stuff and included a full basement and garage, also filled with stuff. I moved what was left of my things to my apartment and we rented storage units for the leftover furniture and some of the other stuff. We started off with 4 storage units but there was still a lot in the house. (In the end, there was a lot that we had to leave behind.)

Then came probably the worst thing I could have suggested. I told my mom that we could move some of her nicer things to my apartment so we didn’t have to get another storage unit. I knew she had no space in her apartment for anything else, and my apartment was nearly empty as I did/do not want to have a lot of stuff. This was the main reason why I had moved out in the first place - I couldn’t stand being surrounded by mountains of stuff that wasn’t mine.

For the first 8 months after the house was emptied, I paid ~$800 a month in storage fees to store my mom’s things. The plan was for us to sell the majority of the things/furniture, but we’ve really only sold a handful of things. Nothing has been taken out of my apartment. We spent many weeks moving stuff around in the storage units, condensing boxes and containers but never really throwing anything away. I blew through my entire savings account (over $5k) before I told my mom I couldn’t afford to pay anymore. The fees are now on her credit card, with a balance of over $3k because she can only afford to pay ~$300 a month towards the balance (she’s disabled and cannot work and has no savings).

I’m at my wit’s end with the stuff in my apartment. I have no idea what her plan is for the things in the storage units and every time I bring up the stuff in my apartment, she tells me it needs to stay where it is until the stuff in storage is gone. I live in a very small studio apartment. Today I walked around and made a little list of what’s here: about 50 boxes of varying sizes, a large pile of books (30 stacks of about 25 books each so at least 750 books), and at least 100 pieces of glassware on top of my kitchen cupboard. This doesn’t count things that aren’t in boxes and just scattered about. Yes, my mom has been here since last summer and has seen what’s here.

I don’t know what to do. I used to have copies of the key and fob to her apartment but she took them back after I told her I couldn’t pay the storage fees anymore. At one point a couple months ago, I said to her that I was going to bring some boxes to one of the storages and she made me give her my copies of the storage unit locks so I can’t even go there. We used to be close, but we’ve gone several weeks without speaking because I told her I can’t live surrounded by her stuff anymore. We have no family or friends that can talk to her. She will hang up on me when I try to talk to her about the stuff over the phone, and if I text her, she will just ignore it. 

I suffer from anxiety and depression and a couple years ago I needed to take a medical LOA from work because of it. I was just starting to feel better when this whole thing happened last summer. Since last fall, I’ve been feeling just as I was during that time. I feel so trapped, so alone, and I feel like my life is out of control. I’m getting to the point where I feel that my only option is to move out of my apartment and leave her stuff here.

What can I do and/or say to her to make her see how unreasonable it is for her to keep so much of her stuff in storage and in my apartment?


TL;DR my apartment is being used as my mom’s storage unit and I can’t take it anymore",28Jul2019,1
735,"First of all I’ve never been sexually or romantically attracted to another girl before and I have a boyfriend. Her and I met in Chemistry class last year and we’ve recently become closer because we work near each other in the mall. 

She is moving to Ontario next week. I’m really sad that she’s going because four of my friends have moved there this year. She is seeing this guy and they are really hitting it off, she tells me a lot about it but they can’t date because she is leaving so soon. I feel so attached to her and we aren’t even that close. Recently we’ve been talking more, and it hurts me that I can’t let our friendship keep growing. 

I feel a craving to be with her that is similar to being in love and I don’t want her to leave. To make matters worse, my boyfriend is also gone away for the summer, and my favourite co worker is moving as well. 

I don’t know how my life is going to be next week when she leaves, all I know is that the thought already kills me.

Today I took my dog to the park behind my house. There was a lot of homeless people at the park, but I didn't mind. One of them asked to pet my dog and I said yes-- but his questions made me nervous.

The symptoms include, nausea, frequent urination, mood swings and irritability, intense food cravings (she rarely is hungry), hives and pimples on her chin and spotting after just having her period (and she’s never spotted after her period in her entire life).

750,I know that school’s out but recently I’ve been avoiding my extracurricular activities and I’ve also been trying to improve my art.,28Jul2019,1
751,"This is my first time posting here so I'm not 100% sure what I'm doing but I really appreciate any advice I can get. Sorry for it being a long story... there will be a tl;dr at the bottom. 

I'm a 27 year-old female and I think this guy is around the same age, maybe a year or so older. We met back in high school during the mid-late 2000s, and our relationship was strictly platonic--in fact, we met freshman year because he was dating one of my friends. They broke up eventually (they were like 14 years old so it never became a serious relationship) but he continued to be in some of my classes throughout high school so we remained friendly until he got expelled senior year for smoking weed on school grounds.

Four-ish years later, I've now graduated from college and I'm living back in my hometown. Guy messages me on Facebook. We begin chatting, he tells me he's living just down the street from where my parents were living. He asks if I want to meet up and smoke. I was a broke 22 year-old fresh out of college at this point, so I wasn't going to turn down someone offering to smoke me out. We met up, smoked, had a few laughs, it was fine. This became a fairly regular occurrence (1 night a week or so) when I wanted to get my fix. After a few times, he started getting creepy and making unwanted advances towards me. I made it clear I wasn't interested but he kept trying and at certain points would touch me...I remember I almost caused a car accident once while I was driving with him because he grabbed my thigh and began moving up and squeezing. I slammed on the brakes super hard because it caught me so off guard. 

So I decided to stop hanging out with him and only purchase from him---that way our interactions would be short. This worked out for about 2 years, until all of a sudden he send me a text pretty much saying if I wanted to continue picking up from him, I'd have to wear spandex/booty shorts during ""transactions"" and I have to let him grope me for at least 30 seconds. I remember specifically him telling me *""I understand if you don't want to do it but I think this seems reasonable and honestly I could ask for a lot more.""* This obviously creeped me all the way out, so I promptly ended all correspondence with him. Never responded to the text and that was that...or so I thought.

This all went down in March 2016. I thought he was out of my life for good. Then in the fall of 2018, I get a friend request from him on Facebook. My friend (who was my roommate back in 2016--the last time I spoke to the guy) said that she also got a friend request from him as well. Neither of us accepted it and we shrugged it off. More recently, he's been trying to contact me again. He sent me a text on June 17th that was pretty much along the lines of ""hey, it's \_\_\_, long  time no talk"". I didn't reply. Two days later, he texts me again, telling me that he now has a decent paying job and a nice car. Once again....didn't reply. 

Then, on July 11th, I'm at work and I get a phone call from the same number that texted me on June 17th and 19th. I hit ignore. I get two more calls from the same number. I let both of those go through to voicemail. Immediately afterwards, I get a call from an ""unknown caller"". Still, I ignore it. Then he calls me again, this time leaves me a voicemail....pretty much he says the same thing he did in his earlier texts..he has a nice job and car now, wants to hang out and chat etc. etc. Never replied and blocked the number afterwards. I figured he'd get the point after all that...but then this morning, lo and behold, I have a Facebook friend request from him. 

He clearly is not understanding that the reason I have cut him out of my life is because he told me that I had to pay for weed by pretty much letting him molest me...which is creepy and disgusting. He thinks I cut him out because he did not have a nice job or a nice car back then. 

**So pretty much the advice I'm asking for is: what should I do about this guy? should I just continue to ignore him in hopes that he one day finally gets the point? Or should I point-blank tell him, ""I am not interested in talking to you whatsoever""?**

**tl;dr:** I cut out an old acquaintance from high school about 3 years ago after he tried to get me to let him grope me in exchange for weed. Now he is continuously trying to contact me. Do I continue to ignore or tell him to f\*ck off?",28Jul2019,1

757,"Let's start off with a little context. I'm 16 years old, and was homeschooled until eighth grade (do not recommend). My best friend is a kid with Tourette's (who we'll call Dave for now) that I've known since I met him in fourth grade at Hebrew school. I became friends with him initially because I felt bad for him (the other kids seemed a little wary to approach him because of his Tourette's), but once I started talking to him I realized he was a really cool kid. He was funny, and nice, and before I knew it, I was no longer his friend out of pity. 

Fast forward to around eighth grade, when I started school. Because of the amount of time I had spent around Dave (and not around other kids, fuck homeschool), the way that I made jokes was very similar to the way that he did. As a result, I was immediately labeled as a retard by the more generic subset of the students. No fair trial, just ""you act like Dave, you must be as retarded as he is"" yada yada yada. It was pretty discouraging, but I defended Dave. I knew he was a nice person, not a retard at all. Just a normal kid with a not so normal disorder.

In ninth grade, shit got worse. I had developed a hatred for the other kids at school for the way that they talked about Dave, so I was constantly starting shit with people that had done absolutely nothing to me. I even made a diss track on this one (semi-popular) kid, which of course lead to a lot of backlash against me. I know that was a stupid thing to do, but I was just doing what I thought was right and attacking the ""bad guy.""

I transferred schools for tenth grade because of the shitstorm that I had created for myself at the old school (there are two high schools in my town so it wasn't a matter of moving or anything). For the first time, I wasn't associated with Dave, and lo and behold, I made friends. A lot of friends. Some of them I had met through Dave, but others I made by myself. It was so weird to have more than one friend, and so easy to make them when I didn't have Dave associated with me by everybody at my school.

Dave got into a bit of drama with one of the kids in our friend group, let's call him Parker. Now, Dave somehow had a girlfriend at the time (she was a total whore but an ugly one) and he literally would not. Shut. The. Fuck. Up. About. Her. My friends even told him multiple times to stop, that we didn't want to hear about every personal detail of their relationship (including their sexual relationship, mind you). He was basically gloating the fact that he had a girlfriend and that they had sex often 24/7. Anyway, that's why Parker was mad at him. Parker had a decent amount of ""influence"" in our friend group at the time, so he was able to basically get Dave kicked out of the group. I still defended Dave, even then, and somehow managed to convince my friend group that Parker was a manipulative asshole and got him ""banished"" for doing absolutely nothing wrong. I know, I am an asshole. But in my mind, he was attacking my best friend for no reason.

Ever since Dave rejoined the group and Parker left, it's gone to shit. Everyone has fucking depression. It's not necessarily because of Parker's departure/Dave's return, but it certainly seems that way. And Dave has completely changed as a person. He's arrogant in that he thinks he can get with any girl just because he fucked one land whale. He can never admit when he's wrong, which is most of the time. He touches my friends' asses all the time, which they've told him to stop doing as it makes them uncomfortable, but he doesn't stop. He puts on such a fucking mask around our parents so that they all love him and guilt us for saying anything negative about him, telling us that he can't help it because of his Tourette's. Be that as it may, I can't fucking stand him anymore.

I'm starting eleventh grade this fall, going back to my old school. I don't want to be associated with Dave anymore. I don't care if that makes me an asshole, so don't even bother saying it.

What I need advice on is how to fix my reputation and prove to my classmates that I've changed as a person and am not as cringy as I used to be. I'm done taking flak from people for defending him. I'm done defending him. I'm done with him in general unless he magically changes as a person.

Help. Please.",28Jul2019,1

762,"Since two weeks I've been working at a sushi restaurant from 5 PM 'till 11 PM. The owners of the restaurant are super nice and they always give me sushi to eat at home. Though I only ate it myself twice. I'd always give it to my mom and then she refuses because she wants to give it to my brother since he likes Japanese food a lot.

Today I worked for 6 hours and I have only eaten a leftover bowl of noodles. Today my mom asked me to bring some sushi for her and I did. I left it on the table and quickly went upstairs to my laptop to fill in my hours. When I got downstairs I saw my brother eating all the sushi while I told him to give it to mom. He said mom refused to eat it because, again, she wanted to give it to him.

I got so angry. I work so goddamn hard and I bring them food that's supposed to be for me cus I barely eat while I work and every single time my mom just gives everything to my brother and he doesn't care about saving some for me. And when I got angry he said ""Stop bitching"". How ungrateful can you be?! And my mom said that I'm making a scene and that I just want drama and I should stop being so aggressive. But it's so damn frustrating that I always do everything for my family and I never get something back from my brother. He NEVER said ""Hey sister, let's go eat somewhere, it's on me"". Not even a $1 ice cream. I bought him pizza so many times and now I bring him sushi almost everyday. Not even once he wanted to share it with me. He only sits on his lazy ass all day and it gets me so frustrated!",28Jul2019,1
763,"I've made a post in mental health about my boyfriend being suicidal a while back before he got the episodes. The episodes have been a thing for a while, but really minor. The last month and a half it's been getting worse and worse and I really dont know what to do anymore. He is in intensive therapy and is willing to take medication if they might help him. 

A description of these episodes is that they start out similar to a panic attack. When they get psychotic he has his eyes wide open(sometimes his mouth as well), he will change between laughing or crying hysterically, he wont be able to talk most of the time and when he is he tells me he wants to run away, he tells me to close my eyes by closing them for me and then hits himself as a form of self harm. He also has spasms, shocking movements and makes random noises. He told me about audiotive (?) And visual Hallucinations and is really scared of them sometimes. If anyone knows what I can do to help him, please tell me. I just really want him to be okay",28Jul2019,2
764,"Hello all. I want to have your advice and opinion on my situation since I feel like I have to figure it out as soon as I can. Letting it get worse is not a solution.

For the background: after school, I went to a university and almost all my friends went to others. I did not talk that much with them (as I remember it). I had a good/functionnal phone quite late and we saw each others every day, so I was not used to it, and plus I am more an introvert. To sum up 3 years of university, I lost agroup wich was not very ""unified"" by having to do the year again, then I got a group of people that are not very connected to each others as well. They were living ""far"" (\~1h30) from uni so we did not hang out that much. The exception was a girl with whom i had a daily high rate of messages, we where close. I lost her friendship and we now despise each others. I don't know how much I am responsible for this situation and I am now out of this group for this (they did not bother to ask why). The other group I found is okay but again, they talk relatively more between them than with me (1 person with whom I talk). 

This made me realise I had no one reaching me out. Someone I was eating with quite often to not let him ""alone"" (he has friends from school not far from his home, like can see them in the evening) and because we had nice conversations found a group and did nothing to reach me out for months.  I contacted school friends more than before, they respond and all, but I have to reach them out and conversation won't last long if I don't ask direct questions. I get some ""ahah"". A lot of conversations from whatsapp / snapchat (that i grab a bit of attention of some people a lil bit more easely) are left with one of my message/picture/etc seen. 

It feels like I am uninteresting to talk with, that I can't find my place, that I have to chase people. While I know I shouldn't try to be a standard of my generation, I can't help but see that every one of the personns I mentionned above is quite active on social medias. I don't have a daily conversation with someone, I dont have more than 2 personns who will send something first.

767,"I went through a really hard breakup end of last year (the relationship was five years long). There’s been so many ups and downs since but when I got past the grieving stage and was in the “new me” kind of stage I was so happy to just be on my own. I hooked up with a few people but it was for me, like i wanted to, not that i needed to. And I didn’t feel any attachment and was enjoying my alone time so much. There’s been off and on moments of this since, and I feel like those times I’m content to stay away from my phone and entertain myself, enjoying my hobbies and being alone. 

But the last month or so I have been just waiting around for someone to ask to hang out with me. I use tinder a lot and I’ve got some things going. So on days off or after work, instead of planning my day or settling in for some alone time I’ll just sit on my bed on my phone waiting for someone to pop up. And if they don’t I get frustrated and go to bed. I can’t stand it and it’s not healthy, I don’t know how to get around this. It’s nice having people to be social/intimate with but that shouldn’t be something I NEED and I shouldn’t be arranging my day around it.

2. I plan to get a job at college to pay off my loans, and I need a car to get there
3. I fish all of the time, so my car is where I’d keep my rods and tackle

770,"I was very sick from age 15 to 21 to the point where everyone thought I was going to die. I had to stop school. Stop seeing my friends. Every day was being in pain and trying to figure out how to be in less pain. I was resigned and believed my life was over. I tried making plans for the future during the first three years, but it hurt every year when I realized I wouldn't be able to do those things and wasn't getting better, so I eventually stopped. 

I didn't think it would get better, but now it's getting better because I've finally found the right medical team, and even if I'm extremely happy to know I have a life ahead of me now, I'm lost. I couldn't finish high-school, I don't have any friends. I don't know if people will want to hire me for basic jobs because my CV is blank as I couldn't get any work experience during those years I spent being sick. 

I don't know where to start. I wish I could be 15 again, but I'm 21, and most people my age are already in their final years at uni', with friends, part time jobs, and living life. I want to meet people too, but I don't want to tell them a sob story when they ask what I've been up to these past few years, and I don't want to seem lazy if I lie pretend I wasn't sick either, since I have nothing to show for those years I spent doing nothing. 

I know I'm incredibly lucky because some people don't live through their illnesses and have no time to question the future, but it's weird to be free. Really weird.

Any advice is appreciated. (Preferably suggestions that don't require a lot of money though, because most of what I have access to was/is being spent on treatment plans.)

TL;DR: I was incredibly ill from age 15 to 21 and unable to do anything. Spent those years being in pain, handicapped, and wondering if I was going to die. Finally found a solution thanks to better doctors and now I'm free of all that, but I'm also very lost. I've got no friends. Had to stop school. No money or way to get a job (CV is empty). I don't know where to go from here. Any advice is appreciated, though preferably suggestions that don't require a lot of money as most of what I have access to was/is being spent on treatment plans.

My wife, who loves our small dog more than anything, has been really stressed during this pregnancy. She's got a bunch of other things adding to the challenges (school, work, etc), but she's communicated to me that the biggest stressor in her life is handling our golden. For the last week, I've brushed him every day, and walked him as much as I can - his shedding has gone way down, but not to zero, and even though his energy is less, he still always wants to hang out.

775,"As the title says, I am curious if anybody has had friendship with another parent after their kids stopped hanging out.

I think I have to go into more detail as my neighbor has three boys all close together in age and she shares custody with her ex but school year she mostly has them and summer he has the more. 

The youngest is two years older then my boy (he is an only child) but for years my son has played with all three really well, (that's how I became friends with neighbor) but I have seen a change last year when the oldest wasn't that interested in playing anymore and middle one went along with the oldest. It happens but that just leaves the youngest and my son's lest favorite one as he tends to scream a lot and has a bad temper.( I hang out with my neighbor when they play so I can keep eye on them.)

The last two years I have seen her youngest grow more angry and pron to flip out. Finally this summer he physically hurt my child because my son was ""annoying him."" The youngest refused to apologise to my son and had a tantrum because ""we were being mean to him.""

At this point I will not be bring my son over anymore and I am really great friends with my neighbor but I can't subject my son to being hurt. My neighbor always apologies but says ""Well they didn't sleep at their fathers house."" Or other excuses for the youngest and I get that's her kid. 

I n she have visited each other while her kids are away but I feel like there is an elephant in the room. I believe it will pass but not sure how this friendship will hold up as school starts.

Anyone with similar experience have any advice?",28Jul2019,1

779,"I’ve always been said to be good at advice, but the only people that can experience it is over text.

My friend jokes with me, calling me a “super empath” as whenever someone is sad, angry or annoyed, I seem to get the exact same feeling as them. If someone looks like they’re gonna cry, I feel like I’m gonna cry when I want to cheer them up, if someone is complaining to me about unfair stuff, I also get sad and angry and can’t do anything. 

Usually over text (and from what I see on tv shows and what friends say), it seems like a way to give advice is when you do that thing where you first crack a joke so they can at least smile a bit so they aren’t so tensed. And then once they tell you what’s up, you’re meant to be convincing, if you’re telling them to be happy, you’d look happy yourself. 

But I can’t seem to do that. If I want someone to be happy but can’t smile myself, I’ll be telling them happy things awhile super somber, or if I’m telling someone that they shouldn’t be annoyed, I’ll be annoyed myself. Maybe I’ve exaggerated this empath thing a bit, but the point is that I never am in a positive mindset when trying to give advice, so I always end up being unconvincing or I make them feel guilty, which is quite common. 

Sometimes with this trait, people won’t even open up to me. It’s rare for me to get past the “are you okay?” “I’m fine” stage. I’m not saying I should force every single person I ask, I think I know the boundaries. But sometimes I feel like I just did such a terrible job and I may as well not have said anything and it wouldn’t have made a difference, or maybe if I were someone else, I could’ve easily done the job. 

One of my friends is going through something right now, and I just can’t do anything to help her. I feel so useless, so pathetic. 

And I’m not saying that you must be happy or positive when you give advice, but it seems like it’ll be a big help. Any advice for me in my case? I feel like my friend really just needs someone that’ll allow her the chance to smile at least, before hearing advice which won’t go into one ear and out the other.",28Jul2019,1

781,"I’m at the end of my rope. I truly love my job but there is one person who makes it miserable for not only myself but everyone else. 

Some background:
I am an in home caretaker for individuals with intellectual disabilities. I have only been working with this company since February. The woman I work with on Sundays (all day) has already been kicked out of two other group homes within the company due to consumer complaints. The home I am in has two individuals who are non-verbal. Therefore they are unable to make complaints. This woman constantly bullies and harasses all of her coworkers. There have been numerous complaints about her to HR by other employees. She has caused all of them to leave the house and/or the job altogether. We are part of a union and she’s been reported to the union as well but they are not doing anything either. 

In the three months that I’ve been actively working with her (just changed shifts), she has constantly made reports about me. I’ve been reassured multiple times by the people that she has reported me to that they don’t take her reporting seriously, but it’s up to ten or more times a shift. She has now taken to telling everyone that I am sleeping with my boss. This began because my boss and I are both nerdy and enjoy dnd. So we do have small chats about nerdy things. This somehow (in her mind) equates to us sleeping together. I work all day on Sundays with her and she makes snide and underhanded comments about the “relationship” all day. Due to the nature of my work, I can’t go off on her like I would like to without potentially getting fired. 

I also really love my job otherwise. My clients are great and I get along with all my other coworkers. The clients I have do not handle new employees very well but they too are suffering due to the turnover because staff are basically being forced out by the company’s inaction towards this person. I don’t want to leave my job or my clients and I don’t want to lose my job for taking things too far but I am at my wits end. And I am not the only one. 

What, if anything, can I do that won’t jeopardize my employment?",28Jul2019,1

Some background info: I have been dealing with severe depression for the last two years. about 1,5 years ago I had a complete mental breakdown, because the girl I had feelings for got a boyfriend. She was the only thing making me happy, and the hope of getting into a relationship with her kept me going. She got a boyfriend, and that more or less broke me completely. 

I have now been invited to this girl's 18 yo birthday party. It's going to be a small party with only 10 or so people, her boyfriend being one of them. I have been doing therapy and medication to cope with the depression, but I still struggle. 

The main problem boils down to me not knowing how to deal with seeing them together at her party. Last time I saw them together at sports practise, it hurt me so much that it almost lead to me comiting suicide. I really don't know how I'll react when I see them together. She has also told me that she really wants me to come to her party, since we are very good friends, and I don't feel like I can bail on her (have done that too many times)

794,"I've got to give a senior speech about anything, and I was wondering if you were in high school, would you find this funny/pay attention? Do you have any other ideas for jokes?

People don’t know me personally. Someone who tries too hard at school. Someone that carries an excessively large backpack and likely has scoliosis. A Game of Thrones fanatic. An overly obsessive Ariana Grande fan. These are descriptors that many of you would likely categorize me under, and you are absolutely right. But, beyond this superficial level, with the exception of maybe ten of you, nobody really understands me. However, today I would like to share with you my most personal experience, my pilgrimage to find religion. 

Sitting in front of the pooja altar with my Ba and Dada, choking on the intense smell of agarbatti, while reciting familiar Hindi mantras was a regular part of my childhood. Following half an hour of prayer with my grandparents, my cousin and I would rush into our bedrooms, slip under the covers, and wait patiently for my Dada to come and tell us a bedtime story. While the phrase bedtime story may conjure thoughts of Clifford or the Frog and Toad, I assure you that no kind companions or scandalous cookie jars could be found in these Hindu stories. On the contrary, these were stories of ravaging wars between almighty gods. While my Dada told us hundreds of stories, one, in particular, has always stood out to me: Hanuman - the flying monkey dude- ‘s journey to save Lakshman. 

In a fierce battle between Ram and Ravan, the evil guy with ten heads, Ram’s younger brother Lakshman is fatally injured. After being counseled by monkeys and bears, Hanuman discovers that he can only save Lakshman by venturing to a distant Himalayan mountain to recover a rare medicinal plant. After leaping and flying across India, Hanuman arrived at the mountain to discover that he in fact did not know what the plant looks like. So, picking the only reasonable solution, he decided to pick up the entire mountain and carry it back to Lakshman. Additionally, realizing he was running out of time, he also decided to casually grab the sun in his other hand. After hearing that, how could I not be Hindu? I had to maintain my beliefs, not because I was afraid that I would turn into a cow in the next life, but because I needed to hear more stories about gods beating the \_\_\_\_ out of each other. 

But then schooling happened. I went to Buffalo, where my grandparents used to live, less frequently. Math and science came to the forefront of my interests, and suddenly the idea of a monkey carrying Mt. Everest across India didn’t really click with me. Don’t get me wrong...the idea of gods jumping on top of three-headed serpents and stealing mangoes was still really sick, but I wasn’t quite confident enough in the reality of my beliefs to continue identifying as a Hindu. Consequently, I decided that maybe I wasn’t cut out to be religious.

I spent the latter half of my middle school career identifying as something between an agnostic and an atheist, crafting logical arguments to validate my beliefs. In the back of my mind, I still felt attached to those Hindu stories, but after my sixth-grade experience in Mr. Rider’s class, I decided that being an atheist was the lit thing to do. All of my close friends were atheist and most of my close friends are still atheist, so I couldn’t logically find a reason to revert back to my Hindu beliefs or place my faith in another religion. But, that all changed last year.

Something inside me has always been there. But now it’s awake. (If you got that reference, you are strong and wise and I’m very proud of you). Last year, I discovered that I am a real Jedi. 

Although I’m only coming out as a Jedi now, it’s something that I think I’ve always known. Whether it was reciting lines from Revenge of the Sith like Bible verses or finessing my dad in daily lightsaber fights, my connection to the force has always been strong. However, afraid that my elementary school friends would be jealous or that the military would abduct me and weaponize my powers, I concealed my strength for years. But, after having a spiritual awakening last year, I decided that I could no longer hide my true identity from the public. Whether it was my excessively high midi-chlorian count or my ability to open the doors to Target with only my presence, I solidified my belief in being a Jedi. However, for those of you that are so uncultured that you’ve never seen Star Wars or for those of you that are confused by the purpose of this speech, you may be wondering: *What does it mean to be a Jedi in real life?* 

This is a valid question. I’m possibly the only Jedi that you’ll ever meet. The true power of a Jedi relies on his or her understanding of the force. The Force is not the ability to annoy your lab partner by reciting Star Wars quotes incessantly. The Force is not a power you have. It’s not about lifting rocks. It’s the energy between all things, a tension, a balance that binds the universe together. A balance between life and death, warmth and cold, peace and violence. And inside of every Jedi lies that same balance...that same energy...that same force. 

The Jedi don’t believe in emotion. They believe in peace. The Jedi don’t believe in ignorance. They believe in knowledge. The Jedi don’t believe in passion. They believe in serenity. The Jedi don’t believe in chaos. They believe in harmony. And above all else, they don’t believe in death. They believe in the force. Although being able to lift X Wings out of swamps in Dagobah is an added benefit, the principles of Jediism are what truly called to me. There is no entanglement with politics. There is no discrimination of individuals based on their identity. There is no incitement of violence. There is simply an understanding and appreciation for the force that binds all living beings. So, if you’re uncertain about your religious beliefs, you’ve felt a calling, or you happen to have a high midi-chlorian count, I encourage you to join me in the ways of the Jedi. Thank you and may the force be with you always.",28Jul2019,2
795,"So, I'm 18m. Last year when I was 17 I met a girl my age on tinder, after talking over Snapchat for a week, we met in a public place, had a little date. Then went back to her place for drinks, where I ended up staying the night. 

My mum went berserk, saying I'm gambling with my life for meeting people on tinder.

I met my current boyfriend on tinder sometimeast year, we've been together for about 10 months now but back at the start I was staying at his place and vice versa at the early stages of the relationship. 

Me and him took a break recently and while on the break I made a new mate my age on tinder. We're just friends but we've spoken on snapchat/Instagram etc for over a month now, and I've also briefly met him in person where I work. 


I'm planning on going to his house to order some food and chill out with him tomorrow.


Again. My mum is going crazy. I've attached a screenshot of just a few of the messages she's sent tonight. 



I'd like to know if anyone agrees with her? Do you think she's right for wanting me to not meet people online (isn't that kinda how we do things these days?)

796,"The last time I saw my father, I was around ten years old, and I am now 24. My parents divorced when was four and I always knew that my father had addiction problems and pretty severe mental health issues. A couple of weeks ago I received a phone call from my older sister saying that our father had attempted suicide by hanging and was on a ventilator and can no longer speak and was expected to die. 

Well, he made it. He is in *very* bad shape (he will never really recover) and I am currently deciding whether I want to see him or not. It's been eating away at me and I have been handling it very poorly. I have little contact with my family and don't live near them so I don't feel like I have much support. I haven't even spoken to my mother or older brother about it. On top of all this, I just moved and started a new job about three months ago. It's at a very prestigious university and it's an amazing opportunity. But I've still adjusting to the new workplace because my new manager isn't the greatest and it's busy job. I feel like I am spiraling and need some time and understanding instead of continuing to hide everything.

I know my father did not die, but in many ways he did. What he did is deeply affecting me in ways I never thought something could. What I really need advice about is whether or not I should tell my manager (or perhaps the director of my department who is more understanding and friendly) that I've had a family emergency and need a day or two off. I am near the end of my 90 day review period, so I am technically not allowed days off for another couple of weeks. But this weekend was *very* bad and I'm starting to see my stress showing in physical ways that are affecting my health (fainting, not being able to eat, panic attacks, etc.) Is this lying since it didn't *just* happen and my father isn't dead? 

I'd also welcome advice on how to handle/cope with this situation in general. I feel like since he did not die, I can't really tell people because it would mean I need to explain really personal stuff...so I'm just pretending it didn't happen right now.",28Jul2019,1

My dad has a lot of money, very wealthy, and he always provided for me. At the beginning of the year, after we had a big fight, he stopped helping me completely. I don't have a job and is really hard to get one and he knows that I am in serious needs like food.

Do u think is moral for him to deny ANY kind of assistance. There is, to not even give me frozen meat or a bag of rice? I guess that he has no obligation to provide for me since I'm more than old enough. But is it moral for him to deny even food? What is ur opinion?

So, I have met this girl a few months ago (I am a man btw). She is a student from another country studying in mine. We quickly became good friends. Really good friends. To the point where we would talk every day for hours (via text messages) even though we didn't see each other every day (I met her at an internship in the university she is studying at. My internship has since ended). If you are wondering, yes I do have feelings for her and she knows. She kind of rejected me but wanted to stay friends and I am fine with that if she is too.

As I said she comes from another country and she went back for the holidays but she will be back later in August. Since she went back in her country, we nearly haven't talked and I don't know why. As I said we used to talk every day for hours. I don't know what to do. Should I talk to her about that? Should I ask her if she doesn't want to speak to me anymore? Or if I did something wrong? Each time we speak at the moment, it is as if she doesn't want to. She answers hours after my messages.

I don't know if she is simply too busy to talk to me or if it is something else and I am afraid to ask her. Even though I don't know her for very long, I can say that she is easily one of my best friends and I am certain she appreciates me too. I am afraid to ask her if there is a problem or if I did something wrong (even though I don't think so). I don't want to lose her as a friend and I don't want to seem too insistent. It just seems weird that she would simply stop talking like that. I figured of course that we would not talk as much when she would be home with her family but it seems strange. We went from talking all the time to barely a message one every two days.

It has been two weeks now and I feel lost.

My mother fled away from abusive sociopath father when I was 6 leaving me and I have been with my father since.

At first I couldn´t believe this was happening, I´m single for about 8 years and had alot of bad luck with love so this was a real shocker. We dated for the past month and although she mentioned that she just broke up ( 2 months after a relationship of 5 years), she told me she really liked me and wanted to give it a chance. And although it wasn´t without any struggle, we kept trying because we really felt that there was something special. Last week we dated again and we kissed for the first time. It felt like we made a step forward and that we were on a good path to something. We got all mushy irl and over in text messages so I went along with it. This week she went back to her parents to babysit the dog and we sad that we would see each other asap when she got back.   


Aaaaand this is where it all went downhill. Yesterday I asked her when she was bussy and when we could meet.  Immediately she told me she will be really bussy and she might not be able to meet up and didn´t wanted to set a date upfront. The fact that she will leave in a week for another 2 weeks made me really disappointed. So I asked her why not etc. and she mentioned that she still needed her time and space and it was too suffocating for her. And ofcourse I made it even worse by asking her if we couldn´t just meet up for an hour or so, so we see each other more than once a month. Eventually we agreed that we should keep it casual and that time will tell. Today I texted her that I regretted the way I reacted the day before and she could hit me up whenever she feels like meeting up again. She responded with something like this: that's fine, let's just stop talking about it, you're making it harder and weirder for me.  


So I really feel like I messed up a huge opportunity with a great girl, although we both have our issues I still think it's worth it. What do you guys think would be best thing to do? Should I just leave her be and hope for the best?

810,"Hi

I am a female, younger than 25 and i am currently hysterical over a situation regarding taking a holiday with some friends. 

I should probably explain i’ve been up and down with my mental health issues for countless years, and being away from home for ‘long’ periods of time really damages my progress and increases my anxiety by a tonne. I’m not much of a drinker, don’t get me wrong - i like nights out in my home country but something about going abroad with anyone other than a few select people really floors me. 

I have been on holiday with this friendship group before. It was horrendous. I lost a lot of trust and confidence in them and it took me a while to mentally get back to where i was even when i returned home. It really pushed me over the edge mentally, and i promised myself i wouldn’t put myself back in that situation. However, i recently went on holiday with someone else and i was fine and very comfortable the whole time (other than a tad of homesick). 

A few years later and i book to go on holiday with this group again - i imagine it will be fine. I’ve handled this before and i’ve just had a great holiday with someone else so i must be fine now, right? 

I then went on holiday with another group, and although i was far better, i still felt quite similar in that i needed some space to be alone and i was getting too overwhelmed, although i joined in with every activity which is a big deal for me. I tend to find my brain switches off for a second and plunges me into the deepest, darkest, pit of depression where i immediately feel like i must die. Its obsessive and compulsive and it takes over my entire body and shuts me down. 10 minutes or so later, i’m fine. Repeat. Im exhausted. 

It really is hell for me to try and control and i feel like i can’t put myself through it again. It knocks me physically and mentally so sick. I’ve already paid this holiday. (Grand total of below $600). I don’t care about the money. I just want out. My doctor is writing to the airline for me, in hopes for at least some money back. I haven’t told the group how i’m feeling yet, as i definitely do not want to go. I don’t want to ruin their time either. Should i just be honest? How can i help myself in this situation?

It's very difficult to pinpoint a location as it's kind of all around the left side. I've tried reading a little bit on the internet but I learned from previous mistakes not to believe too fast in what the internet says. I'm absolutely terrified, I haven't been to the doctor yet because of fear.

The pain doesn't feel like it's directly something with the heart, when trying to feel my chest with my hand it feels more like it's the skin, not in the inside (though what the hell do I know). I'm starting to feel that my left shoulder is getting stiff little by little. Again, I know the doctor is the best solution for this but I'm... so afraid. Taking a deep breath (I do this often now because I keep paying attention to my chest which automatically means my breathing.) makes the pain sting a bit but then feels like a release when I breathe out.

Cute barista makes extremely provocative eye contact, and asks me what I have planned for the day, which I hadn't really considered yet and said so, and then asked what she was doing, which she replied ""probably going home and taking a nap"" but gave a very sly smile afterwards.

Now part of me really wanted to say ""that sounds nice, take me with you"" but instead I blurted out something far more innocent and yet somehow less appealing in ""it's a very nice day outside, you should take advantage"" and then stupidly ignored what she said in response while I counted money for my purchase.

820,"So it's a really long story and for the sake of not writing a book I will stick to something short.

This is concerning two close friends of mine. The guy (Joe) I met in college 8 years ago and the girl (Jane) who I met through Joe while they were dating and lived with her after college. In the time that me and her lived together we became close friends.

So about a year ago Joe and Jane broke up. They were living together at this point and I had moved and would occasionally visit and crash on their couch. I this was the plan one weekend when she told me they were breaking up. This was not a surprise to me because they constantly fought over personality differences. She is an introvert and he is the exact opposite. I actually thought finally it had happened. But she told me that he was in love with her sister and was leaving her to be with her sister. As the story unfolds Joe had been secretly seeing Jane's sister for two years. Jane moved out and her sister out of guilt broke up with Joe. Joe who makes very good money hires a couples therapist and tries to work it out with Jane. Obviously now there are some trust issues. They work it out and he proposes to her 6 months later.

At the beginning of this year Jane tells me that she doesn't trust me. That something weird is going on between me and Joe and that she loves me but can't trust me and needs space. I don't have any feelings for Joe. We hooked up in college 8 years ago but that's all it was. We hardly ever talked about it and I never had feelings. I was mad I felt like I didn't do anything to her for her to not trust me and I had now lost two very close friends and the whole friend circle was affected. After about 6 months of silence between us she apologized to me and we reunited and are close once again. Thank God.

A couple weeks ago I found out through a friend (who's a bit on the edge of the friend circle) tell me something very serious. Joe had slept with his brother's wife a month after telling Jane he was leaving her for her sister and then the sister breaking up with him. I felt very sick. I don't know what to do with this information. This is something that will hurt so many people I'm having a hard time counting. Joe's mom walked in on them having sex and I think also Joe's younger sister know too.

Then two weeks ago Joe tells me late one night after all day drinking after everyone had left and it was just us two that he loves me. That he feels jealous of my boyfriend and that he regrets not pursuing me more in college. He thought maybe we could have been together when he broke up with Jane in pursuit of her sister and that not panning out. He tries to grab my hand I pulled away. I told him I did not feel the same. I go to bed I feel very uncomfortable and guilty thinking about Jane who I love very much. In the morning when they left Jane gave me a kiss when I was in bed and hugged me told me she loved me and they left. I felt so sad.

I think back too, to before I knew Jane that well and Joe telling me he went to go visit my ex girlfriend who lives 2 hours away who rejected him when he asked her to be his girlfriend. He went to see her while he was with Jane. She's my ex girlfriend because shes extremely self destructive. He told me he went to go see her and that she expressed remorse for rejecting him and that night they made out. They didn't have sex but I can't trust him anymore.

I don't know what to do. I don't know if I should say something to Jane? I think about all of the people's lives that would be affected by these things. I think about the fact that she took him back after betraying her for her sister. I think about Jane being happy now and me telling her the worst news of her life. I really want no part in this. I think about how I am the maid of honor. I think about this all coming out years later. I think about her catching him fucking someone else. I think about Jane not wanting to be friends with me anymore. I think about Joe feeling like I betrayed him and his trust. And I think about all of us friends that break up with each other as we all take sides. I think about his brother finding out that his wife and brother fucked. And that his mom and sister know. His brother and wife are pregnant now.

What do I do!?",28Jul2019,1
821,"To make a long story incredibly short, I have been in a relationship that has been on and off since we were freshman in highschool. (Almost 6 years) we have not always been truthful with each other but we have overcame a lot of adversity. 

Recently she went on a trip with her family to Hawaii, and while there she got a tattoo without telling me about it until after it was done. I am not opposed to people having tattoos, I think you can express yourself that way if you choose to, but personally, i feel like it’s a big decision. I have none and that’s how I was raised, and I feel disrespected that she did it without my blessing, regardless if she would have still got it. I feel lied to in a sense. Now I know some one will say “it’s her body” and yes I agree. But at the same time, it’s hard because it’s really the principle of it more than the actual tattoo. This isn’t the first time this has happened. Any advice on what to say or how to say it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks all.",28Jul2019,0
822,"So this literally happened hours ago. We are vacationing in a small city surrounded by a forest with a lot of mountains so therefore, there is a lot of trails, so we decided to take one this morning. 

We go up this sketchy trail in the woods that is isolated (it’s more of a camp ground) and we are up 15-20ft.  And we decided to take a quick rest at a curve that leaves up the hill.. 

So as we are rehydrating on the corner we start talking about if there is any bears and mountain lions in the area and a few moments later we hear loud hooves  and heavy breathing rushing towards us, I turn around to run and I thought it was a bear and I can’t even describe the fear I had, I accepted my fate that we were probably going to die and that’s when we hear barking... 

There were two big white dogs (probably pitbulls) about 5-6 feet from us. I thought they were stray dogs and were going to attack so we were all scared until we heard the owner calling the dogs.

So it turns out there were other people behind us on the trail and the dogs heard or smelt us and that’s why they rushed us. No one was harmed tho.

I just can’t get over that feeling of hearing the ground rumble a bit and heavy breathing running towards us on a hiking trail. (I didn’t see it happen because I was looking the opposite direction) and I feel upset that I wouldn’t be able to defend my family because I didn’t bring my Glock (I should have) and all my kids are around 6 and 17..  It scared the living shit out of us

826,"My LDR bf of 1.5 years asked me to go on a break 5 days ago. It’s a complicated situation and we really love each other, we’re just struggling to get past how to close the gap.

We had a big talk last week and he said he couldn’t tell me he didn’t want to be with me because it’s not true, but that he feels that now is not the right time for us and he needs some time to think. 

We agreed to a break of a few days and that we will not see other people. The next day he was talking to me but I clearly cut it off. I told him I will always be here if he needs help but that he’s asked for time so I’m going to give him some.

It’s now been 4 days since we last spoke. The longest we’ve ever gone and I’m sure you’ll understand every hour feels like a month. 

My question is, how long should this break go on for? I can’t consider us officially broken up until we both agree it’s over, but this is some kind of torture. I thought I would have heard from him by now. I have every intention of giving him his time and space but also I won’t be able to continue without clarity forever. 

TL;DR my bf asked to go on a break and I want to know how long before I ask for an answer.",28Jul2019,2
827,"So, I started working in the cooking industry when I was about fifteen, and have worked full time cooking since I graduated HS, up until December of last year when I got let go at my job of 10 years. 
I stayed unemployed for six months, living on saved money and just taking a break while I looked for something that I would consider an upgrade.  The restaurant industry isn’t bad, but unless you want to start your own restaurant or go into management, it’s somewhat of a dead end with mediocre pay and benefits; and I don’t want to manage or own.  So, about a month ago I got a call from one of the big shipping companies, not UPS but without saying their name, the OTHER big one.. figure it out if you want to... but, they were looking for someone to work on their dock operating a forklift and loading and unloading trucks... now, I’ve never done anything like this... I’ve never been the most “manly” man, but I’m okay... I’ve done landscaping and some odd jobs, and I work really hard, but working in this setting was gonna be brand new to me and I let the employer know this and they were totally fine with it.. said they’d train me and the pay is quite an upgrade as well as the benefits. To sum it up, it’s a good job. 

Anyhow, I took the job and started last Tuesday.  The job starts at 3am and goes to about 11 or 12 or whenever we get done.  The first day didn’t go so bad, it’s a lot of identifying product, putting it into the computer and moving it with the forklift to wherever it needs to go, easy right? Well, maybe... but I feel like I can’t get out of my own way... I’m hitting the wrong buttons, screwing other people up... backing into things on the forklift and the people training me are being nice, but I’m self aware enough to know that they’re looking at each other like “where’d they find this guy?”    The second day was bad, with everyone kind of wanting me to be able to be on my own while still giving me orders, and me screwing up more... the third day, I feel like I’m improving but screwing still screwing up to the point where I’m walking with my head down and angry at myself. On Friday, the fourth day, a couple of the guys are starting to give me some grief, they’re all older guys who look like they were born in a garage and I’m nervous to even talk to them at this point... the big boss says everything’s fine and thinks I’m “doing great”, but he’s not out there with us... he’s in the office.    I have weekends off, so all weekend I’ve been a ball of stress, dreading going back in tomorrow and to tell you the truth, the though of looking for a new job gives me a lot of relief even though I know it’d be a process and I’d still have to work this job for a while until I found something. 
I just don’t know what to do... I hate feeling like I’m in the way... the pay and everything that comes with the job is great... the schedule sucks and has been getting in the way of me seeing my daughter much but... my whole family was so excited that I landed this... I really just want to quit.   I know this post was long, but I haven’t told anybody how I really feel about this job and I felt like I had to. 

TLDR: I started a job on a dock, operating a forklift and I suck at it, and it’s really messing with my mental health.  I want to start looking for something new but it’s only been four days and part of me says I should stick it out because it’s a good job.",28Jul2019,2
828,"So I recently ended a relationship with this guy. I told him in not uncertain terms why I wanted to end the relationship but he still refuses to accept my reasons and keeps demanding I give him closure. The thing is closure for him takes the form of giving him information about people in my life which I am unwilling to give since he has absolutely no respect for others' privacy or safety.

So with him blowing up my inbox with streams of semi-coherent messages I changed my phone number and deleted all social medias he had access to as he likes to contact even people who had only passing interactions with me with his grievances about my person and will not hesitate to be quite insulting to those people (seriously I wouldn't be surprised if by some creeping around he ended up finding about this account). So now he can only contact me through e-mail (I would change e-mail however my google library is linked to that account and deleting the account would mean losing it). 

I stupidly responded to some of his e-mails but once he started making crazier and crazier threats regarding how he was going to ruin my life I stopped responding. Is my silence playing victim? How do I keep myself from responding when his saying he loves me gets my blood boiling?",28Jul2019,1

830,"So, my boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year, I know, not very long.   But we have been threw a lot together.  His mother’s partner passed away. Since then he has been “helping” his mother out.   Which I am okay with.   But that was 8 months ago and she has been using him.   He will go to her place to “help” her from 2 pm till 10pm some nights even later. EVERYDAY! Then on the days he can’t make it for life reasons she guilts him into come over.    He has to change the litter box, take her garbage out do her every day to day crap.  She is fully capable of doing it her self.  It would take her a while but she can.  (She’s got tunnel vision).  
She will use his  car (which she bought it for him so he can take her to her doc appointments and to go grocery shopping) and for his personal use because she couldn’t get into his little car.  So he had to sell it.  Any ways. She will use the car against him stating if he doesn’t help her she will take the car back and what not.   He has told her number of times to just take it.  But now this is all starting to interfere with his Kids life. And our relationship.  We can’t make plans because she will call him just as we are about to go out crying that she needs his help and if he says no she will threaten suicide.   It’s a big game to her.  But lately it’s getting worse.   I use to help as well so we can get the stuff done faster. But now that I started to stand up to her and her BS I’m no longer allowed over at her house.  Every time he mentions we have plans and he has to be home for a certain time she will deliberately keep him longer.     She has told all of her friends that I’m a whore and I’m cheating on him, has even told him that I’m a whore.   I have done nothing wrong to her. Or given her a reason to be mean to me like she is.    But I’m getting frustrated at the situation.  I’ve told the boyfriend he needs to step up grow a set n what not. But he won’t. I don’t know if I can take much more of it.  I don’t know if I should leave him because of his mother.

831,"Hey guys! 
So a little disclaimer beforhand, english is not my first language so sorry if there are some errors.:)
Here's the backstory for those who are intressted, TL;DR at the end. I've known this guy (i'll call him L) for about 5 years now and started developing feelings for him about 3 years ago. It never really was something because we've only seen eachother sometimes in the hallway and never did anything with the same circles. Until we got into the same class, that's when my best friend (A from now on) also started developing feelings for L but didn't tell me about it. I started talking more and more to him as we were often in the same groups and both speak a different language (we used to gossip about the people in that class). We started bonding more and became kinda close. One day him and his ,and also my male, best friend (he'll be called K from now) threw a party, I was invitd but not A. Because i didn't know anyone there expect L and K I asked them if I could take A and of course they said yes. At the party then L and I got close and cuddled and held hands almost the whole time, at this point I still wasn't aware of A's feelings towards him because if I knew i wouldn't have done that. The next schoolday A and I started talking about the party and what had happened, because we are best friends I told her about my crush but not how long it has been going on. We talked and joked until K came to our classroom to talk to me. He suspected that i had feelings for L after he saw us at the party togethr as I usually don't act that way, i told him the truth and since when it's been going on (I told him but not A, because we've known eachother the same time L and I knew eachother as we were once all in the same class and L and K are besties so he might've have some advice for me), he promised me that he would try to help as he thought that we would be a cute couple. After like 2 weeks A then finally told me that she also has feelings for him, so I stepped aside and tried to be a good friend and to support her by telling that it was just a stupid crush that I had on him. I love her to death so i couldn't do that to her, i forced my feelings for him in the darkest corner i could find. She started to talk more and more to him and telling him that she loves him which he said back (in german they said ""hab dich lieb"" which isn't really saying I love you"" but I don't know the english equivilant to that lol). I continued to try giving her advice but I just felt so sad the whole time. I don't know what to do now because if they get together I couldn't stand seeing that and would get insanely jealous. What should I do?
TL;DR: I've been in love with a guy for almost 3 years and as I start acting on it my best friend confesses to me that she has a crush on him so i step aside and now I don't know how to not be jealous.",28Jul2019,2

He’s always apologized and I’ve always forgiven. Now, even though I can see that he has really improved and changed his ways, I still feel the insecurity. When I have weak moments in which I text him emotionally, rather than being comforting, he says “you can leave if you want to” and “I support whatever decision you want to make” rather than stopping me from leaving.

A little bit about me:

I graduated from college, 2018, with a film making degree. I currently live in my parents house and work as a video editor at a toy company. Through college and since graduation, I have worked for many agencies and independent film makers as an editor and have established a name in my community and network as an experienced and talented artist.

My problem is that I seem to have so many options in front of me and I am having difficulty deciding what to do. The next 12 months hold many big decisions to be made.

The reason I'm posting here is not to ask for advice or for commentary on my personal situation. I'm simply interested in other people's experience at my age. I feel very alone and confused.

How did you feel at 23? What were you doing? What were your plans?

And where are you now? What did you wish you knew at 23? Did your plans work out?

Please, this is the time to tell your story. I'm very interested and would appreciate any and all comments.

Thanks so much.",28Jul2019,1

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and mine and sams birthday was only 9 days apart and sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

842,"The last several years my dad has been battling terminal cancer. I have been having a hard time with emotions and caring for my wife. 

It's been so chaotic I didn't realize I hadn't been giving her enough attention or pleasure. I'll back up a few years now. Before I met my wife she had an online bf that she'd talked to for years. He eventually found a real girlfriend and ended it with my wife.  They kept in contact and were still talking when I met her. After a few years we were married and she still would talk to him on and off with snap chat and Facebook.


It made me uncomfortable and I told her that I didn't appreciate it. She told me she understood but there was nothing to worry about. I didn't believe her but let it slide because he lives in the USA and I am in Canada.


This morning I went to use the computer and she had her Facebook open with a message telling him she loves him. I never snoop her phone or Facebook but it was open so I saw it. Broken hearted I scrolled up and she was talking about her feelings towards him and how I am distant in the relationship. She went in to details about our sex life and what not. I stopped scrolling because I don't want to know what else was said.


I confronted her about it without yelling or getting mad. She admitted everything while crying and I told her to cut it out and get to the truth.

She admits she has always had feelings for him and has been flirting. I asked her if she'd ever sexted with him and she says no but I honestly don't believe it. Now, we have been married for a few years and have a beautiful boy. I told her she can cut contact with the man online completely or we are done. If she ever talks to him again we are done.

I said it firmly and she agreed after crying for a few mins. I told her if we have problems she needs to talk to me and not a man on the internet or at least one of her girlfriends.

I let it go emotionally but now as I'm in bed I'm flooded with emotions and might call in sick from work and tell her to go to her mom's for a few days.

845,"Hello reddit, newbie here. I thought the internet could help me figure out what the hell I am, or least let me know I'm not alone.

Here's the BG: I'm a female to male trans guy (pre-op, so that means i havent got a dick yet). I was raised as a girl, taught that girls liked guys, so I thought I liked guys.

Fast forward a bit to when i had That Sex, and i realized that oh crap, I have never found this guy attractive, and kissing him is pretty gross, but i still love him right? So, that was the point I started identifying as asexual, ten years ago. But then we broke up, and lo and behold I fall in love with a girl! And since I identified as asexual, it made perfect sense that I didnt want to have sex with her. So at that point, I came out to my parents first as liking a girl, then as finally coming out as a guy. It was at this time though,that I started thinking more and more about screwing guys with a dick that I didn't have, but not girls.

Fast forward a little more, and I fell deeply in love with another girl who thought she was a trans guy but she wasn't in the end. This made me question everything. Did I force myself to fall in love with guys and I've never actually loved them? Am I forcing myself to love girls now that I came out as a guy? Because, the way I see things, girls are stunning and beautiful and I want to kiss them and take them on dates and love on them, but I dont want to have sex with them. Is this maybe a byproduct of me being trans and severely hating my feminine body? But on the other side, I'm jerking off to thinking about screwing guys when I have a dick, but I'm not attracted to them and I think guys are actually kinda gross and not very kissable and I can't see myself falling in love with one?

So, if I'm thinking sexually about men but cant fall in love with them, and fall in love with women but can't think about them sexually, what am I?!",28Jul2019,0

I cant fulfill my career as wanting to be a full time escort as I live with her and literally wants to be together 247 she is deeply in love with me and wants sex more than I do. I usually will give it to her once every 3 or 4 days or so and actually enjoy it once I get going. But have no desire for her sexually but I truly do care for her emotionally. I just wish she was more understanding and if she could escort we could do it together but shes totally against it as I've brought it up jokingly a few times to see how she would react. I'm going to be on this lease until April. And starting a trade program to learn a trade skill. Have a criminal record and these are my only options as of right now. I want to move to Toronto around this time next year to have lots of clientele for escorting as I get paid 200$ an hour just for getting my dick sucked and light kissing cuddling etc. (No anal) I will pursue that path if this trade program doesn't workout and I end up hating it. It's to be a plumber. Deeply love this girl just wish she was the type to escort with me and we could make lots of money cause she loves money just as much as me I want to buy a house one day.

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and mine and sams birthday was only 9 days apart and sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.


This is me if it helps:

849,"TL;DR: Hi everyone I’m a 19 y/o male looking for advice. Life is full of experiences, yet this is one I struggle with.

I currently have a really hard time connecting with anybody. The ones who are in my life are very negative for the most part and murder my spirit. I find myself struggling to maintain a friendship( especially to begin one).

How do I meet people with positive lifestyles and personalities? Ones who won’t try to manipulate, exploit or insult others or myself. It seems I always attract the wrong crowd. It always seems like everyone I meet has a hidden agenda",28Jul2019,1

855,"For starters ... My X of 7 years, whom I've been extra close to, OD'd last Friday. He has been my best friend always, and I broke up with him bc I felt like the intimacy was lost. We would go months at a time not fucking. I thought maybe by breaking up he would come around... And in a way he did, because we broke up last July and have been better friends since. We have banged a few times and in the last few weeks he has been over to my place sleeping over before work and on weekends, wanting to cuddle and stuff. 

Anyway! Since that happened his mother basically has him on lock down. Took his car keys and cell phone and has him living up stairs with her (he rents the separate basement apartment in their house). I have spoken to him maybe 3 times and for only a couple mins at a time... Not being able to talk to him has been killing me. I know partially it's not his choice and it's for the best he takes some time away... But it's been really hard on me. 

We sadly relapsed on opiates about 3 months ago. Had been clean for years. We had a plan to taper down and quit, and we were doing well with it. He was going to grab for us last Friday and get a deal if he drove this guy to his dealer for him to get H. My X I guess decided to try H that day... And as I said.. He OD'd. 

So.. With all that going on.. And me being left alone to deal with my addiction... Thinking about how I almost lost him... Picturing him convulsing...(i was not there when this happened) not being able to talk to him, I have been losing my mind... Feeling suicidal. I have little to no family support... Friends are all busy or I have not told them bc I don't want to tell them his buiness before he does.

Well.. I have this one friend I'm super close to, or thought I was. He's been short with me and giving me digs about how I'm so desperate to be loved and blah blah... Not to mention passive aggressive. 

 I've been broke and depressed and have horrible anxiety... So I asked him if he could sell me a couple Xanax so I could sleep. He gets them for $8 bucks each.. Told me he would sell me 2 for $20. 

I got upset that he wanted the 4 bucks so badly... He knows I'm having a hell of a time dealing with all this shit... You would think he would even offer it as a spot or just for free so I can get some sleep. 

So I reminded him of how I was there for him when he was in the hospital a while ago and then off work with no money.  I helped him out with getting beer and smokes and food... Just so he would be able to hang with his friends and not be stuck at home with nothing to do being depressed ... 

.. He basically told me to fuck off. Said it's 2 for $20. Take it or leave it. And leave him the fuck alone and find it from someone else if I can't pay $20.

Anyway.. After that I recently found out he too did heroine and almost died. Same dealer .. Same deal. Drive the guy somewhere get a free pill. What has me going is that when I told him about my x (who is also his close friend) being in the hospital for OD'ing... He put him down and said ""what an idiot, why would he even do that shit..  Told you guys not to talk to that dealer"".. Or something close to that. 

Now anytime I talk to him or ask him for a favor that isn't out of his way.. Like grabbing me some beer on his way to drop shit off to me.. (and I would be paying for it not asking for him to pay) he says ""nope, not my problem , I'm not getting beer so figure it out yourself"" 

Like wtf? After being there for him.. And him knowing what I'm going through I get all this attitude and unwillingness to help a girl out when she is down. Like .. Remember when someone is there for you when you are at your worst and return the kindness when they need it most. Or is that too much to ask?? 

More to the story if anyone wants to know.. Wrote too much already and doubting anyone will read all of this.",28Jul2019,1

858,"I've always been an anxious person, though I don't think it's serious enough for medication and such (they did diagnose me with GAD and depression a few years ago, but the medication didn't work out and now I just take medication for my depression).

Anyhow, talking in front of people has always been the worst situation for me, so class discussions are always a nightmare--I'm talking hands trembling, nausea on occasion, voice ever-so shaky, mouth dry, palms sweaty, heart speeds up very quickly when I'm barely about to open my mouth to contribute something as it's a participation grade (even though I know what I want to say and I'm aware of the ongoing discussion). This all often happens during a discussion where I'm in the room with classmates who I've known for seven years, and I know rarely judge in situations like that, yet I still experience it.

Now that I'm going to college, I found out through rate my professor that one of my harder classes has a professor who requires class participation. Just thinking about talking out loud in front of new people makes my stomach turn and my hands tremble (doesn't help that I hate attention, positive or negative).

I don’t really know how to start this because it is pretty long, but basically there is a kid at my school who has a mental disability of some kind (autism or aspbergers I think) and he has a habit of finding people to latch onto and tell them lines from movies that he thinks are funny all the time. I am one of those people. I make sure to be as kind as I can, and never make fun of him or anything like that. However, in this past year (I have known him and his family for about three years) it has gone past harmless jokes and conversation into something else. He asks me and my friends to stick out our tongues and will tell us how much he likes them, even when we are in the middle of a conversation with someone else. He also told my mom that he likes the way I look in my lifeguard bikini, which made me very uncomfortable. I am on the swim team at my school and so is he. I also lifeguard for outside swim meets and events like that. He sometimes shows up at my work and waits outside the lifeguard room, so I hide in the back until I have to go sit at the pool. At first I thought it was just him struggling to express himself and understand boundaries, but the tipping point came when he cornered one of my friends at school and asked her for pictures of me in a bikini. Hearing that from her made me feel like this could actually be a dangerous situation to be in. I know that was a lot of background, but now for the actual thing I need advice on. Recently, he has began asking me for my phone number at swim practices. The first time he asked, my phone was dead and I was hoping it would be a one and done thing, but he has been very persistent. He went to a summer camp with my brother and my mom chaperoning and asked them both to give him my phone number on multiple occasions, but they refused. Every time he asks I come up with an excuse, but I often have to leave the pool surrounded by friends so he won’t follow me out asking for it. I know that eventually I will run out of excuses and will have to either give it to him or turn him down. Obviously based on his past actions, giving him a way to contact me could put me in a dangerous position, but I’m afraid that if I turn him down, it will come off as me being unkind. I know this is a lot, but everyone I have asked has told me to just ignore him, which is almost impossible. What should I do?",28Jul2019,2
861,"Typical kind of story, but there are factors which make it slightly different, so it's a bit harder to find advice. 

So: I started to develop feelings for a friend I'd gotten to know over last summer, and I told them about my feelings. It wasn't a great time for either of us, (they were actually leaving for the year) so we took some time, and eventually they said they'd prefer to stay friends. A little while later, a misinterpretation happened in a conversation, and they accidentally turned me down again by saying they thought a lot of me, but they didn't see anything between us. 

Fast forward a year, they're coming back permanently again soon, and we've become very close over the past year. During this period of time I've accepted us staying friends, and what I would love now is for us to become all the more closer in that way.

The ONLY thing is a small part of me still remains that still holds them under that light, and so, I would still jump at the chance if they were ever interested in becoming more. 

But lately the feeling has been growing a bit again, and I need to get over it well and truly. I genuinely am at the stage where I'm content, but it'd be preferable if I didn't still harbour feelings....

I have this friend I used to hang out with when we were kids. However we had a 5 year age difference and we no longer hang out. He’s still in school and I’m very busy trying to figure out my life and goals. So the point is his mom wants me to be friends with him again because he has no friends, but I simply don’t have the time to see him again and again on a regular basis.

I already saw him once and had to leave after 3.5 hours because I had to study for exams. His mom tells me I didn’t even hang out with him  and that I should come back tomorrow and the day after. I would do this but I know this will not solve his problem and his parents think sticking me in this situation will magically solve their worries. 

I have a busy life and I cannot see him on a regular basis.

So my question is, how can I tell this kid that his mom is worried about him having no friends and how can I talk to him about making friends without it seeming like a lecture/attack?

869,"Okay, I have a quite long story. Im Turkish so my English is not very well sorry for that. I just graduated from highschool. 

In my first year, in second week of 9th grade me and my  friend who i met on the first day of school decided to get new friend so we took a look at the classroom and chose people who looks like more sincere and warm. 

There were 2 boys sitting together and clearly have not much to talk about so we went to their desk and introduce ourselves to them. We said ""Lets buy tea and cookie and hang out beside the sea"" (our school' yard is on the sea) and they accepted our offer so we clicked of easily and started to hang out more and more as 4. 

We even opened a whatsapp chat group named ""Berkem"" which is their couple name (Berkay &amp; Emir). I was really getting along with B. well so we were talking like 24/7. I was 14 and I was looking for a crush you know. I was hitting on him jokily and he was accepting me and doing the same back to me. And I was always acting like thats a total joke to me. 

After couple of weeks i realized he was checking out a girl who was sitting in the back of the class. She was kinda sick so she wasnt coming to the school very often. So one day i asked him ""who do you like"" and he asked me to guess so as you can easily say i knew who it was but i put two options just because. 

Then he accepted he likes that girl. I offered him help (idk why i did it i guess i have tons of insecurity and i didnt believe i can make him like me) And i really helped him, found her number, text her, gave her the notes she was missing out bc of hospital and literally tried to be her friend. Fortunately she was really sweet and funny. So i started to match them up. I was talking to both of them. They were both asking me about how to answer the messages other sent (which was stupid bc i was literally talking to myself lol) 

But that friend of mine insisted that she doesnt like B, B is like a brother to him. She said that billions of time. Even to B. So i keep on helping him but at the same time we were talking ALL the time. We werent sleeping at nights till 3-4am. He was a person who is always down. So my job was literally make him feel better and i was doing it so well. I was doing tons of jokes, compliment him, creating games for him. I gotta accept it was hard but it was one of the most beautiful times in highschool for me. 

After a while i started to think he MAY BE likes me too. And i want to give a lot of reason;
- as a 'joke' i saved him as ""my bedman"" and he saved me as ""my beauty"". We were always ""joking"" about what would our parents think if they would see how we saved each other. 
- he was calling me ""my beauty"" and i was calling him ""my love"" when we were chatting all the time. 
-we were flirting a lot like A LOT. 
- in our friend chat room they were always treating us like a couple.
- his best friends were thinking we were dating and they always were saying we would look good together.
- he was getting jealous so much. like one time when we were talking at 2am i said im gonna sleep but one guy friend of mine wrote smt so i replied to him and we started to talk but he saw me online and he gave me a cold shoulder for a long time. After that time i promised him i wont talk to anyone while i was talking to him at nights and he did the same. Honestly it was the moment i really thought okay he likes me, right? 
- i was generally agreeing with him all the time against my best friend ( that friend i met on the first day) so i dont remember why but couple of times i took my friends side. I wasnt doing that bc of a reason i just simply thought she was right. That night he sent me a pretty long message about this. He was asking me if something is wrong. If he did something that made me upset. And he was apologizing. 

I was obviously hinting that i like him. I kissed him on the cheek, always compliment him. He asked me to go to a festival together but he also invited a girl named D. ( i wasnt very liking her bc i was thinking she likes B. boy i was wrong but whatever ) and i said i dont want to if she will be there too cause i think i will be alone. And this stupid me did bring a friend. But B. was always with me that night. He didnt care abt D. At all. And after in that night he said you bring that girl bc you were angry at me right? Do you know what could happen if you didnt bring her? 

I mean isnt this a sign? That is my biggest regret abt this situation honestly. Anyway. Briefly; i had a BIG crush on him and i thought he likes me as well. 

One night he was 'pranking me' with his friends. He sent a message which says "" i like you so much"" and i said dont joke abt this. He was insisting and i didnt believe him bc i knew he wasnt serious ( yeah i dont understand myself either) and i didnt wanna be fool and jump on it. After he accept he was joking i said if you continiued this i'd believe you. He said what would you say then. I said "" I would accept you and i'd say lets date. What would you do if i would have said that? Huh?"" And he was like i would have go out with you. 

Tell me this is completely normal.

Btw that girl he liked before did become one of my best friends that time. So one night while we were playing truth or dare with B on the phone we dared each other to  trick our friends that we like each other ( yeah so clever i know ) his friend didnt even get suprised he was like yeah i knew it but that girl friend of mine was so deep abt it. She was so angry with us when she learned we were joking but without telling B. i told her i actually wasnt joking. I clearly said her "" I like him so much"". 

A lot of thing happened between 9th grade and 10th grade. B. suddenly got away from us slowly. He was interested in that girl again and he wasnt messaging us for week etc. ( yeah it sound strange but we were so confused too. We wrote long passaged to him asking if we did smt wrong etc. He replied by saying friends can not talk for 1-2 weeks. Like wtf? ) he was hanging out with D. and her friends all the time so i gave up. I literally gave up.

When we started to talk again he was talking with that girl he liked before all the time. It was like our relationship was over and it was turn back to LITERALLY just friends era. 

But i was in love with him. I dont know why, i dont understand WHY now but i was so i didnt wanna lose him. If it would make him happy i would support him anytime. I encouraged him and keep trying to make him happy at nights but after a while i got tired. He was giving me short simple answers and he wasnt like he was interested in talking with me so i just stopped talking. My bff continued to chat with him but he wasnt hanging out with us anymore. He was with D. and her friends. 

After the summer ( which i barely chat with him) in the start of the 10th grade that girl and B. started to dating and they were trying to hide that from us ( it was so pathetic ) and me &amp; my friend were SO mad. It was obvious that they were dating but they were acting as if we were paps. 

One day that girl ( her name starts with S i will just say S ) S started to cry, she was literally sobbing. Everyone was shocked but i kinda knew why. I was feeling so hurt that she was dating the boy i love. I was so hurt that she was dating with him while knowing i love him. And she was feeling guilty, it was so clear. 

I hugged her, cleared her tears, kissed her on the cheeks and just made her feel better. Even though i was so hurt I didnt want to see her like that. 

1 week after she sent me LONG LONG message abt how much she loves me and she feels so guilty abt keeping it like a secret. I know she was expecting me to react badly but i dont know why i didnt want to. I didnt want to be mad anymore. I was tired. So i said send this message to my bff too. ( I knew she was so hurt as well. She always lookes more rough than me but i know shes more fragile)  but she just changed the name and sent her bc i guess she wasnt caring abt her so much? But my bffs reacting was hella bad. 

After that i didnt talk to both of S and B when i dont need to. They were making out in the class like they want us to see. It was so hurtful. 

My bff continued to talk with B, still does but i didnt want to talk with that bastard honestly. But in 11th grade i had to change class ( our system wants us to choose between math&amp;sciene and math&amp;literature. Me and my bff were in M&amp;S and my close friend and S was in M&amp;L) since i chosed M&amp;L i messaged S and start to talk with her again. I dont know why. Now we are still very close friends and B &amp;S keep breaking up and getting together. I lost the count. S always says its not a serious thing for her and she just wants someone. I just dont understand why she did this to me while its not even serious for her. Whatever... 

What do you think? Am i just stupid or..?

→ absurd things i would like to add
~ i knew my bff also likes B. and he knew i like him but we never talked abt this ( we talked abt him a lot but not talked abt liking ) so we had never problem between us.
~ she is now dating with a girl
~ i learned that S is also bisexual and likes girls more so thats why shes not very serious with B
~ i never kissed with B, but i kissed with S couple of times when we are drunk ( and i guess while they were dating idk )

I'm so close to getting my first home, my only obstacle is being short $200 for the deposit. 

I've already figured in this weeks check and all of my bills (minus the 98$ phone bill on August 5th) 

I have to come up with the money by August 1st.

The reason I'm looking to move so quickly is because of my current living situation. Don't get me wrong, I truly appreciate having a roof over my head, but I don't think I can do this anymore.

I live with two relatives, both of which hid the fact they had bed bugs from me. So when I moved in, they eventually got into my room. Due to that, I moved to the living room and bought bombs to kill them off. Now that I'm sleeping on the couch, I have zero privacy, which, is needed since I'm 21. Well, my two relatives scream *constantly* at each other, don't use AC no matter how hot it gets, and repeatedly bring me down. 

You may be asking yourself, ""OP, why don't you move farther out?"" 

While you'd think I'd be able to, no one took the time to teach me to drive. I have no vehicle. 

Honestly, I have no support from family. I've been raising myself for so long now. My parents left and are living their own lives with their new families.

That said, I'm struggling to find a way to get the money. I have a job at Kroger, making minimum wage. I don't know what my options are.

Anyone, please, I'm begging for some advice as to what to do. I need to get out of here while I have the chance. I have to escape these people and be my own person. I just need to get over this bump and it'll get easier as I start to finally save up.",28Jul2019,2

This is my first full time job out of High School and started out as a single role for low pay but this has turned into a job where I now have multiple roles in different areas which I don’t really have much support in since I’m the only one who can do it.

Been told by my family that I should be asking for a raise but I get super nervous around my managers and can’t work up the courage to ask for a raise since I have never done it before and I don’t want to risk anything at my job since I am the only source of income back home (living with partner). 

Also feel like I have major cases of imposter syndrome at my job because I always feel like I don’t do enough and I’ve asked my managers if there’s anything else I could be doing but they don’t know either and I feel like this is holding my back from asking for a raise too but I have no idea how to stop feeling like this. I constantly upskill myself and try to figure out what more I can be doing when i have spare time but never feel like it’s enough.

Sorry if this is too long - never posted anything like this before and was feeling nervous",28Jul2019,1
874,"So about a month and a half ago, the girl I was almost dating (we weren’t officially boyfriend and girlfriend but we basically were) broke things off just cause like it wasn’t really working, details aren’t important. We’re still friends and talk every now and then but we’re not that close anymore. Anyways, I got over her pretty fast but still caught myself thinking about her and what we had on the occasion but i was able to stop it usually. Things have been fine lately, I hardly think about her and we barely talk anymore so I was all good. But then yesterday, for some reason, I couldn’t get her out of my head even once. I was constantly thinking about her and what we had and I think I miss it again. Last night I went to bed thinking about her, this morning I woke up thinking about her. I can’t get her out of my head. Why all of a sudden am I like this again when 2 days ago everything was fine and I was completely over it? All of a sudden it’s just like the day after things ended. So can anyone help me with why this is happening and how I can make it stop?",28Jul2019,1
875,"When I was younger my dad and I had a good relationship, but now I'm 14 and we hardly ever talk. I get sad about it because I miss spending time with him. My dad goes into his room at around 3 or 4PM now and sleeps all day (sometimes even earlier). I think he may be depressed, but I dont know how to help. I'm scared for his health because of this too. 

We only exchange a few sentences every day now, and they're always the same ones. He'll wake me up in the morning because I have the tendency to sleep in if he doesn't, later on he'll ask me what I want for lunch, I'll tell him, he'll give me the food and I'll say thank you. Then later he'll say he's going to bed and I'll say goodnight (even though it's the middle of the day). That's pretty much it. It's been 2 years since I've hugged him. 

It doesn't help that my Mom doesn't love him anymore (it sounds brutal but its true). They dont sleep in the same room, they dont talk, if they do talk they're fighting over tiny things like there not being any more cigarettes left. My mom even refers to my dad as ""him"". 

I feel so sad, I miss my dad so much. I've had to stop writing this post multiple times because I keep crying writing all of this. Please help me :(",28Jul2019,2

878,"none of my close friends really share the same interests nor style as me and i love them to death but i just kinda want someone that i can relate with. for example earlier today my friend was driving and she asked for a suggestion on what we should do and i said “lets go thrift shopping” (because its something i enjoy) and she immediately shut me down saying it was nasty. also none of my friends share a similar music taste to mine and i just wish i could have someone to go to a concert with :(. i totally understand that individuality makes friendships more interesting but sometimes i just want to share something similar with a friend ugh i don’t know. i just feel like every time we hang out im bored out of my mind or just flat out annoyed. this is probably really selfish of me. anyways, what do i do about them? how can i get my friends to do something i like once in a while?",28Jul2019,1

881,"I had great credit. I leased a car. Credit went down because I couldn’t keep up with credit card debt. I was a server at the time so the cash flow was completely different. Now I have graduated from college and have a full tome job that pays well. I have never been behind on payment since then and have enrolled in a debt program. My score is still wrecked tho. 

I lease a car now and an looking to buy it. I guess the best way would be to take out a loan and pay off that. My monthly payment would be significantly lower. How do I do this with a poor score and no co-signer? I can’t figure it out and I just want to be more financially stable. Any advice is appreciated.",28Jul2019,1
882,"The charge is a check fraud charge and it is a seven month sentence. My daughter she seems to be handling it fine. I told her right away about it and she reacted pretty calmly. I told her mom did the wrong thing and is rightfully serving her punishment. They have a good relationship. The main problem I have is she will see her mom in a jail jumpsuit and see guards and other inmates that could be intimidating. Is that ok for a 15 year old to see? Actually my daughter does not seem scared but instead seems excited and enthusiastic to visit. This is strange to me. Do you find this normal? My daughter seems to find the idea of her mom having to wearing a uniform, sharing a room funny. I wonder why she would think it is funny. My wife says bring her if she would like to and my daughter says she would like to but I don't know if it is a good idea. She hasn't gone yet so we can discuss it",28Jul2019,0

886,"Okay so I have made this post on r/offmychest however I thought it might be suitable here too. Firstly, throwaway account because he is a huge Reddit user and there could be a chance this reaches him which I wouldn't like. Secondly sorry if the formatting isn't great I'm on a phone so I apologise if this is difficult to read.

Okay, so a bit of background; it's been two years and seven months since he first asked me to be his girlfriend and a year and two months since we broke up. It's been six months since I told him I couldn't do 'friends with benefits' anymore. I have held onto every second.

He wasn't always kind to me but I understood why. However those months we spent not as a couple but not really as single people either (FWB) were too much for me. He refused to make us official again so I felt like I was always walking on eggshells to keep a desperate hold of him. Especially as he'd often cancel on seeing me. At this point it felt very one-sided however I couldn't shake my feelings. But it was no way to live, I couldn't do it anymore.

I met a nice boy who surprised me. I convinced myself I deserved better than someone who wouldn't allow himself to compliment me for fear I'd get too used to it. That I deserved better than someone who used to have all my social passwords and check them often. (Although only during the relationship, all passwords were changed after that). That I deserved better than someone who could date another girl a week after I'd made the best expression of love I could give. 

So I told him, six months ago that I couldn't do it anymore. I'd met someone else and it wouldn't be fair to continue seeing him. He told me, as he had before, he changed and was back to how he used to be. But I put my foot down and told him I'm sorry but I had decided. He threatened that he'd had sex with other girls whilst seeing me but retracted it saying it was a lie. (this for the record I do believe he was truthful in saying it was a lie). 

I was angry and sad for a long time. But six months later and I check up on his socials most days to see how he's doing. I have come to the conclusion that he was telling the truth, and he has changed. I saw videos of him laughing and dancing just how I remember he used to be.

I'm happy for him knowing this of course but I can't help but feel like I'm missing out. Every few months he texts me to see how I'm doing and honestly seeing his name on my phone fills me with happiness and reminders of the old days. The somewhat rarer texts from his mum also give me the biggest boost of happiness. I find myself hoping that they keep messaging me back because I know I can't text first. 

I'm afraid if I wait too long he'll lose his feelings for be (if he even still has them now).

But I'm happy and finally in a stable relationship right now. I feel guilty writing this post for others to see but I have no one I can get objective advice or support from. And I really needed to get this out before I explode. 

Thanks Reddit, any advice at all will be majorly appreciated. Even just to know my thoughts have been heard will be a huge relief.",28Jul2019,1
887,"I've never done one of these before, but I thought I'll give it a shot because there's no one in my real life whom I'd ever voluntarily bother this with. 
I have issues with myself, my self-esteem and self-love. I mean it when I say I don't like even a single iota of myself. A year ago, I stopped subconsciously fishing for compliments from people in my life just to make myself feel about my existence. When people me ""you're this, you're that"" (good things), it had a feel good factor to it and I learnt how other people saw me. Naturally, I gave them the benefit of the doubt. I've stopped doing that after realising how shallow and bad it is for my overall mental health. But the main issue is, I can't seem to love myself otherwise. Forget love, I can't even begin to like myself. I purposefully hurt people in my life because I'm afraid to express love. And majorly because I don't know how to. I hurt my best friend because she complains about how I don't give her my time of the day and how she feels so alone. It's been going on since the last two years and I've been guilt tripped into believing I'm the bad person because I don't like being super close to people. Which is true. My boyfriend of 6 months is a GREAT person and I love and treasure him with all my heart. But my emotions go berserk around him. I can't control them. Some things just hurt, but I always try to hide the pain. And in the effort, I end up getting distant. Which hurts him. He honesty deserves better. I've unintentionally hurt him countless times. And he's better at hiding pain than me, so I'm assuming the number is higher than all of the instances I know of. And THIS thought just repeatedly drives home the belief that I'm unworthy of everything he has done for me and all I'VE ever done is hurt him. All of this.. it just strengthens my belief that I don't deserve any sort of love in my life. 

My parents? My relationship with my mom has deteriorated. It's worse than what it's ever been. I barely talk to her. And I hurt my dad, I'm assuming, everyday because I lack ambition. I'm intelligent and I've got a knack for quite a few things, but I lack ambition and purpose. My boyfriend is also very ambitious, and I guess it hurts him to see me waste away my potential this way. I've become very indifferent to pretty much everything in life. Nothing makes me feel anything good or bad in extremes. I sleep in order to avoid responsibilities. I sleep a fuck lot. I meet deadlines last minute. I don't act unless I absolutely have to. I don't know what to do. I don't think I'm depressed, but I do have fleeting suicidal thoughts once every month or so. I listen to sad music all the time. My boyfriend asked me to start listening to more cheerful music, but they're all trash to me.  I don't know what to do. Maybe all of this is very clichéd, but it all gets very alarming for me when I allow myself to feel the gravity of everything. I don't want to become complacent with my life. I also don't want some major tragedy to propel me into action, altho I have some major self-destructive thoughts every once in a while. I always ALMOST act on them, but I've gotten a little better at reigning in my emotions and let logic take the frontseat.

I don't know what I'm looking for here. But this feels very cathartic. If you made it this so far, I truly thankyou for hearing me out.",28Jul2019,0
888,"I work at a local restaurant where my boss is an absolute asshole. He gets on me about the smallest of things even when it’s things I hadn’t properly been taught to do. I have other female coworkers who have been in exact situations as mine where he could care less. In fact one that I am good friends with he will compliment and say things like “hello beautiful.”  I have no clue what I did to have him on my case like this but I am also not alone. There are about four of us he absolutely gets on and despises. Some examples of things he will do are have me doing something simple because all of my major tasks are done and him saying “why aren’t you doing anything?” And of course one of my female employees who hasn’t been working nearly as hard that day will be on their phone and he will walk past them without saying anything. Yesterday I was working a catering event we were doing and he told one of my female employees to “take all the initiative because he doesn’t want me doing much besides filling drinks.” There have been instances where I’ve seen him watching me work my ass off and not complimenting me like he does with my other coworkers he favorites. It crushes me inside and hurts my self-esteem. I come home wondering what I did wrong and feeling like a failure. It’s taking a toll on me to the point where I don’t even want to work there anymore despite the amazing friendships I have gained with my coworkers, the flexible hours, and the great pay. I know I’m going to have to deal with people like this throughout my life, Im just wondering if anyone has any advice as to how to handle this situation better?",28Jul2019,2
