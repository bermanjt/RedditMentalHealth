1,"By free bleeds I meant she just drips her literal period chunks all over the bathroom, and leaves it in that state indefinitely. The toilet, floor, bathmat, and shower have all been splattered with her bio-hazardous waste. I'll call her Tammy for this post. I've been living in a basement suite for a year, this is Tammy's most recent behavior. Up until November, I was only here sporadically. Every single time I would return, nothing in the suite would have been cleaned since I left. Tammy doesn't rinse the sink after brushing her teeth so its moldy. The shower drain almost has enough human hair piled on top to make a wig. The garbage hasn't gone out. She leaves her dirty dishes on ever surface of the kitchen. It's all so piled up and dirty that the appliances don't function the way they should. I clean the suite because I want it to be livable. I'm not a neat freak, I don't care if the suite is messy, disorganized, or cluttered. Bloody, moldy, and filled with garbage is too far. Be disgusting in your own room. It's so dirty it can't be an accident, that's the part that pisses me off the most. I've wondered if she acts like this to *encourage* me to move out. 

 I broke her coffee pot by accident while doing dishes. I was going to buy her a new one until she put all the garbage on the counters on my food in the cupboard. Then she knocked one of my plates on the floor and just walked around it while she cooked dinner. I'm not replacing anything. My boyfriend is staying with me when I'm here and she complains to the landlord she doesn't feel safe with a man in the house. Okay, that's fine, whatever. We generally avoid her, and don't talk to her. I'm biased obviously, but how are you afraid of someone who doesn't talk to you, look at you, and generally avoids you. Everyone should feel safe in their own dwelling but I don't care, I can't empathize. Tammy is the most disgusting person I've ever had the displeasure of meeting let alone live with. 

I am hesitant to complain because my boyfriend does spend a lot of time here! I don't want to make the suite more livable for 3 1/2 weeks just to be alone in the suite with Tammy. I know she complains because I have to keep explaining to my Landlord who really doesn't give a shit. I avoid conflict, I don't enjoy it. What should I do? I'm not the best roommate but I've never been spiteful, and am respectful of shared spaces. I thought we were going to be pals when I first moved in. What do I say? How do I take action? Should I take action? What's 3 1/2 weeks, when I've lived with her for year? Why bother when I'm moving out anyways? If you were me what would you do?

Every story has more that one side, but I cannot see things from her side! I just can't understand where Tammy is coming from even when I try. Am I in the wrong honestly? This feels really long but I'm also venting. My last roommate regularly used *my* toothbrush so after Tammy I'll never willingly have a roommate again. Thanks for reading! :)",07Dec2019,1

3,"I need some advice. I'd like to know if I'm shooting for the stars, or if I'm shooting myself in the foot.

In 2010, I applied to work In a call center for one of the largest Internet Providers in America. I worked in Tech Support. I have a GED. After a while of working in Tech Support, I got promoted to another team.

This is where it gets tricky. My current job is highly specialized and why I'm using a throw away account. Without going into too much detail, I'll try to explain. The ISP is required to take action on certain topics or they can (and will) be fined quite literally millions. When I got promoted to this new team, I realized they were not correctly fulfilling their requirements. I submitted a rather detailed action plan on how to correct the issue. My management team and multiple executives realized they were making this mistake and decided since I was apparently so we'll versed on the topic that I could run the team. I was promoted and provided a (what I thought at the time) generous raise. My at the time manager was just reassigned to another team but soon after quit ( or was fired ). 

I started out making about 10$ an hour. I make 26$ an hour now. I have been getting rather decent raises yearly on top of the promotion raise. 

I recently found out that others in similar positions for other ISPs are paid about 5$/hour more. Keep in mind every year I've received a perfect evaluation, so I'm doing a good job. 

My question is, should I bring this up and see if they will provide more of an industry standard, or should I be thankful for what I have and continue to build up? I wish I could provide more detailed information on my job requirements, but it's honestly so specialized I would be basically giving my contact information and I'm a rather paranoid person. I want more money, but I don't want them to think I'm going to quit or ungrateful. I'm in my 20s. I've been in charge of this team for about 8 years now.",07Dec2019,1
4,"I need advice on how to get into sex again. When I was 18 I had a ton of fun with it, but over the years I just can't seem to, not want it necessarily, but understand the drive for it. I know this probably isn't going to make much sense, but I just don't get it, and to be honest life kind of sucks right now. 

Even masturbating, I do it but it's almost more out of habit than anything. Afterwards I don't really feel satisfied or even like I enjoyed it. Honestly I only masturbate because if I don't I feel like I'm missing out on something.

Does anyone have any ideas on how to help me gain some interest or something like it? If you have any questions or want more information you can pm me.",07Dec2019,1

8,"Hello, so here's a dumpster fire issue for ya. 

&amp;#x200B;

Friend (18F) had a kid with her highschool boyfriend (20M) ((He graduated a few years ago)) last year, and they got married earlier this year.  After they got married, he basically gave up on the relationship and dropped out of school to work at his Uncle's restaurant.  She became extremely unhappy with the relationship and started telling him she wanted a divorce.  We found out he, and his entire family are actually illegal, and think he was just after citizenship.    


He is fighting the divorce, and going after full custody of the baby...  But we don't know if this is even possible if he, and the family that has been helping take care of the kid are illegal.  She doesn't know what will happen, and doesn't know if it would be better if he were deported or not.  

&amp;#x200B;

They have been married for 6 months.  Is annulment a better option, since he wasn't legal? Is deportation a potential outcome?",07Dec2019,1
9,"Hey, let me start off by saying, i‚Äôm completely lost. I don‚Äôt know what to do, or where to begin. So let‚Äôs bring it back to the beginning.

I moved to a different county in 2017, and started high school. I was a freshman. I didn‚Äôt have no friends and didn‚Äôt socialize with many people on the first day of school. In gym class (4th and last class of the day) towards the end, some girl came and said hey to me. We hit it off a little and became friends. She attempted to braid my hair (LOL) and it was ugly so we laughed and took it out. 

*Side note, my best friend tells me everything. Every dick appointment she goes to, every boy she talks to, EVERYTHING. Later in the story you‚Äôll see why i said this*

We exchanged snapchat‚Äôs, and started to talk regularly. We became best friends second semester, and started going to each other‚Äôs houses. She was a sweet and innocent girl; total opposite of me. I wasn‚Äôt sweet nor innocent. I introduced her to boys, and got her her first boyfriend. I influenced her to loosen up a bit and have fun. She ended up losing her virginity to her boyfriend. 

So fast forward, it‚Äôs summer time. My birthday is towards the end of June. when my birthday comes around, i invite her to come out with me to a water park. She agrees, and came over to my house. We had fun at the water park. Best day ever with my best friend, or should i say ex best-friend...

After the water park, we return home. She agrees to spend the night. Me, her, and my cousin decides to watch a scary movie. While watching it, my cousin speaks to me in pig latin that he‚Äôs interested in her, and i said no, but i agreed to let him smash one night. 

They smashed and my cousin started getting clingy. To make a long story short, my cousin started to date my best-friend. While dating, my cousin began to take her away from me. For example, me and my bestfriend would be in the room chilling, having a convo, and my cousin would come in and start being clingy, holding her, kissing her for WAAY too long, (i‚Äôm talking 5 mins straight), and basically interrupting us like he doesn‚Äôt give a shit.

That was in July.

Think about that happening for 5 months. The month is now December and me and my ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù don‚Äôt even talk. We keep our distance. When we did talk she didn‚Äôt even tell me things anymore. Before we stopped talking, when we did talk, she‚Äôd seem like she wasn‚Äôt interested. Me and her met at the bathroom everyday at 2:30. she stopped going. She‚Äôd walk past me in the hallway without saying anything. She‚Äôll just act like she isn‚Äôt interested in being my friend anymore. 

My cousin told her whenever he goes to her house he doesn‚Äôt want me there because he feels her parents won‚Äôt let him come back, (her dad is homophobic, i‚Äôm gay).  Mind you, he lives with me. So i have to watch him leave and go to MY best-friends house, alone, leaving me by myself lonely.

What should i do? I don‚Äôt regret nothing in life but hooking my cousin up with my best-friend. I told them both that. They seem not to care. Mind you, the cousin i‚Äôm speaking of is supposed to be my favorite. Whenever me and him is in a conversation, my ‚Äúbest-friend‚Äù would call and he‚Äôd leave me by myself and not say anything. not even a ‚Äúhold on‚Äù. he‚Äôd just leave.

So basically, i lost a best-friend and a favorite cousin. And i don‚Äôt know what to do. From this post it seems like i‚Äôm jealous, but i‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm hurt. I want my cousin and my best-friend back. Please help.",07Dec2019,1

My parents make me work in the family business, saying it ""builds character"" (I feel like it is free labor)  I have 0 friends and I don't get paid a dime for working.

15,"In my friend group theres a girl who is really petty. Like she‚Äôll hold a grudge for days and says comments under her breath. Let‚Äôs call her E.

I think the sole reason for it is jealousy. She‚Äôs dislikes another girl in the group who is best friends with the girl E desperately wants to be best friends with. Because of this, she doesn‚Äôt make an effort with her and makes sly comments under her breath about her like ‚Äúoh i wouldnt dare do this, blah blah blah‚Äô

Then she was angry at us for not being put into her study class and not having to stay after school because our study teacher had a meeting while she had to stay back. How is it our fault, we didnt even choose the groups. We got given an essay to do at home instead and she said ‚Äúoh I‚Äôd rather stay after school than do that‚Äù but she was very obviously bothered since beforehand she was complaining and saying it was unfair for the whole of lunch. Btw we were put in this study group cuz we performed the best in our exams meaning she didnt perform as well to get in.

Then today we got awards for getting good results and she didnt get one and she was clearly peeved about that aswell. She claims we leave her out too but she just sits silent anyway when shes being petty even when we try to include her. She snapped at my friend aswell for asking E to repeat something because she didnt hear. 

Basically every time before an examination she bigs herself up and when she gets her results its a massive kick in the teeth. She never performs as well as she says she will and when her results arent as good she says she is t bothered but then complains about it for 2 days - so youre not bothered yet you complain.",07Dec2019,1

Like all you of you, I am an introvert.  Plain and simple.  I am extremely grateful to have a job in this economy and am thankful for all I have in life. 

I work with a wonderful team on a remote basis;  Our entire company works from home which enables us to be much more productive in the work place, and we communicate through e-mails, phone calls, and virtual team meetings.  This is especially important to me, as I am dealing with quite a few issues on the home front and working remotely allows me to get my work done without putting on a mask in the office.

That said, early next year, the higher ups have planned a retreat for everyone to attend across the country.  As I said, I am introverted and really do NOT want to attend.  I imagine most will tell me to suck it up and go, but am wondering if anyone has a legitimate excuse for why I can not attend.  Would people view me differently if I don't go?

For example, he's gone to many things without me. The movies, hiking, fun events, and did not invite me. I don't mind, he needs to do his own thing I need to do mine. We need space sometimes. I told him I was going to the movies with my family, he got mad and asked why I didnt invite him. He is literally going to hangout with his friends the same day I was going to the movies. He got mad at me today because I told him I needed to stay late at work because I'm behind. He was like ""geez fine do whatever you want"" he told me on the phone that he was only mean to me so he can toughen me up and then  break up with me. I'm not sure if this is abuse but I feel like it is.  I rely on my guy friend's compassion because my boyfriend doesnt give me any. I dont flirt with him, I just need someone to be nice to me.

35,"**TLDR**: I graduated college last spring, immediately got a good engineering job with what seemed like a lot of opportunity in a Fortune 250 company, they sent me to Utah for 6 months, I feel like I have no idea how to do my job and have little guidance at work, I want to find another job but don't think I should for multiple reasons, and to top it all off, I've been pretty depressed, lonely, and stressed out this whole time.

**This is going to be a long story; sorry in advance.**

I'll start while I was still in college. I went to a pretty good state school for engineering, and did well because I guess I'm above average intelligence wise. I got an offer from a large company with a nice salary, which was a need due to the amount of students loans I racked up getting this degree (I now have a really negative view about college and student loans). This job is a type of ""leadership development program"" where I rotate through different locations for 6 months at a time, two years total and at the end will be offered a more permanent position. My first location is in Utah. I'm from the East coast, just fyi.

Now the problem I have with this is I think I have basically no idea what I'm supposed to be doing at work. I was given multiple projects with very little leadership, basically just me and one other young engineer. I've yet to really finish any of those projects but I kind of feel like I've done okay for what I was given. Now my rotation is ending, and I'll have to present these projects that didn't really turn out well to a bunch of important people in the company. I'm pretty stressed about this and don't know what to expect.

This experience has made me not want to be an engineer, at least at this company, but for one, I don't really know what else to do, and two, I signed an agreement that said if I don't complete the two years, I have to pay back like $5800(which I don't have).

At the same time, I have a pretty serious girlfriend from college that is a year younger than me. She's a senior now and couldn't move with me. Basically, I really miss her because shes also my best friend.  This time apart has also taken its toll on her I think, and I don't want it to end our relationship. 

To summarize all of this into what I'm feeling right now: overwhelmed, lost, depressed, confused, lonely, stuck, stressed

But there was this one day like 2 months ago where I had to go to the doctor‚Äôs office and I stepped on their scale and it said 294 and I saw that and I was completely and utterly disgusted at myself and I saw the expression on my Dad‚Äôs face and it just felt like he was so disappointed in me. So I made a vow to myself to absolutely never, under no circumstances, hit 300 pounds. But I stayed at 294 for awhile, roughly a month and a half, and about 2 weeks ago I started to REALLY go after it and drop those lbs. 

So I started off with walking every now and then and simply just not eating so much sugary and salty foods, giving up soda and candy and what not too. And at the start of this week I start to do a lot of sprints and simply not eat for the most part. Along with the my new medication for ADD, Vyvanse which suppresses hunger and in a way makes food seem kinda gross, and my new willingness to shed pounds I have been losing a lot of weight. 

The last time I weighed myself, don‚Äôt remember when I‚Äôm sorry, I was 280 so that‚Äôs already progress right there, and on top of the rest of this week it is probably even more. I even had a confidence boost today in school, I noticed that I fit into all of my desks better!

45,"Hey, I would appreciate it so much if you read this wall of text, it took me over an hour to write and I could use some advice with my situation.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 17 year old Finnish gamer guy who has trouble making new friends without being forced together in an environment like school and I feel like I can't talk to anyone in my life seriously about our relationship or about how I or they have been doing, or about anything meaningful. I had like 2 close friends, but now that one of them started his upper secondary school (At least that's what i think the English equivalent of the word/stage of school is) in August, we haven't talked at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing really happened between us, except I stopped reaching out to him because he never started our conversations or invited me to do stuff, it was always me who contacted him. Now that i haven't been doing that, we have had 0 contact. It feels shitty because I had considered him my best friend and I knew him for the longest out of any of my current friends.

&amp;#x200B;

The second close friend is a mutual friend of mine and the first friend, but there was a period where it was hard to see him because he moved to another country for a few years. We still played games every now and then, but he spent a lot more time with his school friends, which really is understandable, but sucks for me. I feel like there grew some distance between us while he lived in there and I didn't know that much about his personal life, and now that he has moved back in here, I sometimes speak and play with him, but he doesn't really seem to want to talk about his school or friends there and we don't often meet up with him in real life.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't feel like I connect with my current ""main friend group"" in school, but they are the people I know best in school. We have a class of under 30 students, and I only have like two people I could become friends with, I've chatted with them a little when they have sat next to me in class. The thing is that I don't really know how to make friends or know how to just start speaking to acquaintances(not close friends or people I'm usually hanging out with) without them starting the conversation with me.  Also they both are already in sort of a group of friends at school and at least the other one has a decent amount of friends from outside of school. Both of them are also girls and I don't have and haven't had any girls as actual friends that I would talk to outside of school. So I kinda feel odd about that too. But I feel like they are actually genuine when we talk and all parties seem to have fun when talking.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do, I want to be close again with those 2 first friends, and I want to make friends with those two people from my school.

47,"Let me give some context. There is this girl on my wrestling team. Me and her do not get along in the slightest but I have always kept my distance from her to not cause any problems. Me and her had an argument about her lying about her summer wrestling points yesterday. It wasn‚Äôt a big argument or anything but she said her feelings were hurt. I don‚Äôt care honestly that I hurt her feelings because she said rude things to me too, but I don‚Äôt really get affected by things that other people say about me.

Today I came to practice and got pulled over by my coach. He told me that her parents called last night saying that I was spreading rumors that she gave me oral sex. I literally make an effort to not talk to this girl or do anything with her practice wise. I dislike her to say the least. She said she heard it from someone else (let‚Äôs call him Chris).

49,"As you age you learn many lessons and through my journey I'd like to pass this word of advice on to all of you brothers and sisters. First let me fill you in on my story, I was born in a small town by a single mother, at age 16 I lost her from a rare form of stomach cancer that quickly took her life. The only family left was my grandparents, who abandoned me and all of my belongings on my first day of junior year. The school counselor offered me 3 days in a motel before he'd have to report it. For 3 days I begged him to change his mind, terrified of foster care and where I would be put. I had him convinced I was going to be staying with a friends mom for awhile and also laid out on the table that in 4 short months I would be 17 eligible for an easier emancipation process. Success. One night at my friends house and off to live in my ford escort. I'm a free man. I cried and grieved and screamed to world why me, why take my mother and leave me alone. You would never know, in school I was the class clown, always making you laugh and never letting you know the truth. Most made fun of me due to the fact I would wear the same clothes a lot or didnt smell the greatest but only if they knew what I was going through. Through all the struggle I stayed dedicated and never lost hope and graduated high school on track. Terrifyingly approaching my next chapter of life with no resources around me no guidance, no knowledge of money management I fumbled into the real world. I bought two 30$ tents posted up in town behind a DNR center and called my camp home. I found a job in the construction trade and it was the best thing that had ever happened to me. For 18 months I lived in my tents, experienced water damage losing majority of my belongings, insects that would invade every night, and the mysterious noises of what was crawling in the night. Eating potted meat and crackers for the typical dinner. I saved every dime. After 18 long months I rented my first home. Shortly after I was lucky enough to meet the love of my life. My career has carried me back to life, hard work and perseverance truly overcame the cards I was dealt. I'm more than overjoyed to say that my love and I just purchased are first home and are planning our wedding. My word of advice to you all is never give up, no matter what life puts in front of you. Light that fire inside you and realize what you are worth. People who go through hard times earn a certain edge on life. Never give up.

52,"This isn't an easy post for me, in fact, I've thought about making it for a while. We met when we were 12 on an online game in March of 2013 and we immediately clicked. We met a couple times in person (she lives one state above me, pretty much a 5 hour drive) and she was super fun to hang around... until I realized who she truly was. When we were 14, she began to act differently. She would bully me and threaten to commit suicide if I didn't talk to her. At times, she would get mad at me if I spoke to anyone else but her, even with a common friend she became jealous of because him and I had a lot we related to (video games, favorite music, etc). She never embraced our differences, anytime I liked something different to what she liked, she'd call it trash and make fun of me until I cried. We were on and off for months at a time, but we tried our best to repair it. In a way, as gross as it sounds, I became addicted to being treated this way and thought it was normal. Right now, I feel awkward. After a year and and a half of not talking (since November 2017), I decided to contact her earlier this year (May 2019). She claimed I ""ghosted"" her when really, I was dealing with a lot of personal shit (my uncle dying to cancer, cousin committing suicide, another friend died to cancer as well) and I told her I would be taking a break. She ""understood"" but said I still shouldn't have ghosted her, but whatever I apologized for ""ghosting."" I noticed she took on a very weird attitude with me, like she didn't wanna know what was up. I was always the one initiating conversation and it makes me look so clingy. She never, in these few months of starting the friendship, again tried to make effort. Not only that, but she's kind of grabbed this ""fake cutesy"" way of talking with me (if you use social media a lot, you know what I mean... \*cough\* uwu \*cough\*). It pissed me off cause I knew why she was talking like this. She used these mannerisms back when she would shit-talk me on Twitter. I can't even talk to her about my personal life anymore without her trying to ""one-up"" me (i.e. I mention something cute my boyfriend did, she then mentions about how her boyfriend took her to a fancy dinner and had sex after, like what?). I hate the negative impact this friendship has had on me, but am I wrong to be feeling so emotional about it? It's not easy to leave something, no matter how bad it is, and I wanna be able to do it without feeling like I'm going to string this burden along for years. I was abused, manipulated, and here I am, like an idiot thinking that she would change. How can I let go of this once and for all?

TLDR; I (19f) wanna just drop this toxic friendship I've had with a girl (19f) for almost 7 years. She was abusive and manipulative.

I can chat up a girl no problem and keep the convo going. But up until now, I've always made an effort to bring up height in the convo so they aren't alarmed - it's not like I can hide it. 

Without fail, the second I tell a girl that I'm 4'10"", and that yes I'm being serious, the conversation quickly comes to a close or I get ghosted. This has happened over 20 times by now. No matter how good the convo was going, my height was a dealbreaker for every girl that I've chatted up so far. 

I had many opportunities to schedule dates and could've went on a few, letting them meet/see me in person instead of telling them my height beforehand. I didn't do this because I was concerned about the shock factor when they saw me/""duping"" girls, etc. 

Is the move to suck it up, not tell them, and just go on these first dates - risking making the girl feel uncomfortable or feel like she was bamboozled? Or do I keep telling people first, let them ghost me, and keep searching for someone who doesn't care. Any suggestions are welcome. Thanks!

I chose my school for its expertise in engineering and didn't really consider other factors. Now that I've been here for half a year, I really feel extremely discouraged. It's true my program is just a 30 credit Masters course and more of a money making machine. But, it's like I'm just floundering at this school and I can just disappear and die and no one would know or care.

I have a program study advisor who doesn't care the tiniest bit about my experiences. I have adjunct faculty who doesn't care and is teaching from material that is repeated course after course, year after year. I have fellow classmates who are not inspiring or outgoing. I have professors who seem to think project/group work is just about assigning work and everyone doing a piece. I am losing my mind.

There are people who care about me at this school. A retired professor in my profession sought me out and gave me a prestigious scholarship and also gave me job opportunities. I have made some good contacts within my profession as well. The name of my school carries prestige and weight, but anyone who went through my school knows how bad the administration is.

We had this lovely lady ( [https://i.imgur.com/n9JDgXO.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/n9JDgXO.jpg) ) left behind in one of our apartments with two bowls of water, her litter box, and we assume some food. The keys were turned in for the apartment on Monday, and our turnkey person found her this morning. When I brought over some food, she was clearly excited to eat, but she didn't scarf it down or go crazy. She seems healthy, has been using her litterbox despite having been abandoned in an empty apartment (poor thing) and is very sociable. 

I mean it seems like I should obviously just adopt her myself! But... I have two cats already. A scrappy indoor/outdoor who knows what, and a real sourpuss Maine Coon that is already moody if she's not the center of attention. Besides knowing nothing of the FIV status of the abandoned girl, I'm not really in a financial place to get a full vet panel done (my girls are still due for theirs, and that's $400 usually).  If I knew she had a clean bill of health we have a room we could isolate her in, and I wouldn't mind fostering her until she's adopted (which just sounds like adopting her myself with extra steps, with my self control) but i'm just generally stumped.

I was thinking of becoming an uber or lyft driver to make some extra money on the weekends.

To be honest, I do sort of have driving anxiety. I drive all the time to school and it's no problem. It's like an hour drive. I sometimes drive to Philly which is 3 hours, so I'm used to driving I think. It's just sometimes it kind of makes me nervous driving in certain areas, like parking. Parking is a huge issue for me. I can't parallel park at all.

I think city driving is a bit nerve-racking because of all the rules and one ways and everything. But wouldn't it be good to challenge myself and learn how to do this?

I thought being an uber driver might be fun? I live in a suburbia, but the city is only 15 minutes away.

I am TERRIBLE with locations and street names and all of that. But I was hoping I could just use my GPS to solve that problem.

I do have social anxiety and I'm a very nervous person. But I think it might be a good idea to challenge that anxiety by forcing myself to interact with others.

I don't know how uber works exactly. But I thought you could just drive whenever you want and make money whenever you want?

I really am tired of working at stores like Target or Kmart which just suck my soul and feel like such a waste of time. At least with uber, I can make and decide my own schedule, right?

I just need extra cash to pay for school. An uber seems like a fun way to make some extra dough. I just worry about messing up or something. What if I take the wrong way, or something. I have sooo much anxiety which I take medication for, so I think this job might be good for me and teach me some life lessons.

A job that you get to decide when you want to work? That seems pretty cool.

Does anyone have experience with uber? Is it worth it? Which is better, uber or lyft?

It's been a month but they're in town now and I see it on snapchat or whatever. Wondering if I should give up. I thought they were friends but they don't hit me up, one of them did when drama happened to say he had my back but im not sure if I should ask them twice or three times.",07Dec2019,1
64,"Long story short, yesterday I broke my ankle unloading a patient from the ambulance (she's fine, I broke her fall).

But I'm having trouble doing really,  anything now.  For those interested,  it's a closed displaced fracture of the right medial malleolus.

I can't reach very high anymore. I can't drive.  I can't put weight on it.

I'm going to visit an orthopedic surgeon to see if I'm getting the chop.

I am on light duty and can get 40 hours a week,  no OT.

I've got a snake. (Pretty sure other places won't deliver frozen mice)

For groceries,  what major retailers deliver,  I've never done it before. I assume there are fees? 

I've hit crutches and a boot for now.  Can I get a temporary  handicap tag for any vehicle I ride in?

I can't even carry a laundry basket.  I have a roommate,  but we're not too close and someone shouldn't become what a mother should do because of my injury. She's also rarely home. 

I'm not in pain,  I'm not on any drugs for it.


I just am a little lost and need help.",07Dec2019,1

He became my closest friend and I talked to him all the time. Here lately I haven't heard from him in a month which is entirely unlike him. He's also suffered from suicidal tendencies and was seeing a therapist along with taking antidepressants. I always tried being there for him to try and help. He uses telegram mostly and he hasn't been seen within a week. All my messages haven't been delivered they only have one check mark. I tried contacting him on snap but my messages are unable to send.

74,"a few years ago, i watched this super sad animated show about a boy and a girl who's parents had to leave them with their grandparents during wwii. it was one of my favorite shows that was on netflix at the time. i can't remember the name, it's killing me.

the show was about a boy and a girl, brother and sister, who had to move in with their grandparents, but they thought it would only be for the summer. they eventually noticed their parents probably weren't coming back, so they started going to school, where they met some of their soon-to-be friends, one of which is jewish, but in hiding. 

they also live near a family with two boys, both of which bully the other boy, the one living with his grandparents. the boy and girl decide that they want to build a fort/house in the woods, and they find a pig, or save it, i'm not sure. 

eventually, the german troops start moving in and it causes a lot of trouble in their town, one group of soldiers moves into the grandparents home. one of the boy and girl's friends, who's a bit older, joins a group of spies, after finding a wounded soldier, and they start planning an attack on the german.

over time things get way worse, and the boy and girl, along with their school friends, join the group of spies, and give them letters. one of the soldiers staying at the grandparents place is nicer than the others, and starts to help them. in the end, the wounded soldier, who's no longer wounded, and the older boy end up dying, and the boy and girl's mother comes back once to say that their father died.

I'm depressed because my stepfather told me he was proud of the man I've become but I never had a chance to be with him just him and I. My mother hated me because she resented my father and I'm the oldest of 3. My brother and sister had everything handed to them on a silver platter. I was left to struggle alone. I wanted nothing more than to be the son that my mom and stepdad wanted but I always came up short to my brother and sister.

78,"So i'm 20 years old, withdrew from college in my second semester because i just really didn't like it and i didn't know where i was gonna go in life, so i decided to stop/wait. Anyway, I've been looking for a decent job that i can stay in and grow with, thought about being a cop, then i was looking into maybe becoming a Lineman, however there are no apprenticeships near me, closest one is 3 hours away, so that might be on the difficult side for now. There's a Bridge to Canada near me and they are hiring Customs officers there, and it pays pretty well for starters and there is room for growth, i'm currently working in a warehouse making about 11/hr but if i got into the customs job id be making about 17.50/hr, so big step up, and they offer annual raises, and they are pretty hefty as far as raises go. Problem is, i'm not exactly fit at the moment, and they do require a good physical fitness (like any police officer position would) i'm not like unhealthy or anything, just out of shape. So that's one thing, not a big deal, would take me like 30 days to get into decent shape again. My #1 issue though is my girlfriend, she has severe separation anxiety and if i get hired in, they send me to Georgia for 4 1/2 months for training and she has told me she didn't know if she could handle it. This is the girl i want to get married to within the next 5 years, so her well being is important to me, you get the idea. so i guess i'm asking for advice on whether or not to try and get the job and try and make it through the training period or try to find something else closer in order to avoid any serious issues.

79,"I'm 24(m) and I've been in a low place for awhile. I've been depressed and smoked weed since I was about 15. It used to just be a weekly or weekend thing but then it turned into addiction. I became lazy, and never tried anymore.  That didnt help my lack of motivation that was caused by my depression.  This obviously affected in college.

This January I lost my scholarships and financial aid, and had been out of work a year. This led me to getting a job in in a different state on the west coast. I was working at a resort with fellow delinquents such as myself and some college kids from in state and across seas. I made some really good friends out there, but I ended up home sick. I decided to go back to school with the money I made and I ended up coming home. However, I never paid for classes. Stupid, obviously. 

I got a job and I'm thinking about going back to school in the spring. The thing is, some of the friends I made are having fun at a resort in Colorado and I'm worried I'll do poorly in college again. I cant help but to envy them even though I'm back home with my family, dog, and friends. 

Should I go out there, have fun and earn money for school, or stay home and go see a therapist? I went to one when I was 16 but I didnt take it seriously at the time.

80,"So it's been a long day. I had 3 classes then a 7 hour work shift. I literally got off 20 minutes ago and walk to my dorm. I swipe my card to get in and right next to our door is a vanity and which I can see my roommates side of the room through the mirror. 

So I walk in and I look into the mirror out of habit and my roommates girlfriend locks eyes with me while she is riding on top of my roommate. He just said ""hey"" while she said ""duces"". I then just turn around and leave. 

First idk by what she meant by duces. I think she meant like bye or leave. Second, my roommate knows my schedule, and we have never had problems in the past. Third, I don't care if he wants the room to himself and his girl, I just ask him to tell me, because if I were in his position I wouldn't want my roommate to tell me I can't have sex with my girlfriend.

I'm not as much a annoyed, as more as I'm worried I made things awkward both between him and his gf, him and me, along with me and his gf. I just don't want them to feel bad or embarrassed. 

Another thing is, my roommate works graveyard and his gf practically lives with us. She's always over because her and her roommate don't really get along. I totally don't care that she lives with us, but now that's going to make things awkward. 

A) idk what to do.

81,"I do not handle death well at all, luckily it‚Äôs something you generally don‚Äôt (or shouldn‚Äôt have to) deal with a lot of in life, but my reactions to it tend to be a little rough. 

When my cat passed away a few years ago I kinda just went into a weird phase where I decided I didn‚Äôt need to take my meds, I didn‚Äôt sleep for a week, and because of how horribly depressed, anxious and delusional I was from the lack of sleep I slit my wrist open.

Last year my emotional support dog very suddenly passed from her stomach flipping. I don‚Äôt think I could‚Äôve fallen harder on my face. I immediately started having night terrors, and stopped sleeping, and I was so depressed I was numb. I was so sad I couldn‚Äôt even feel the sad. I drove myself very far into a hole of agoraphobia and strange OCD habits, some of it has gotten better but not really, and I still have to take Ambien to knock myself out, and I still have night terrors.

Buddy has been in my life since I was 9. He‚Äôs been the most consistent thing in my life. More consistent then my parents staying around, he‚Äôs been here through all of this but the time is coming and we all know it, and I cry myself to sleep every night scared that when I wake up in the morning he‚Äôll be gone.

What can I do to try and not take the loss so hard? I‚Äôve put everything into trying to pick up pieces and I don‚Äôt want to break again.

82,"A quiet hotel on a my residential street has been looking to increase revenues, and they've done so by transforming into an outdoor nightclub on Friday nights. Of course, they didn't request permission or notify anyone on the street, because everyone would have said a resounding NO. It sort of just started, and has gone on without fail every week.

Undoubtedly, there is massive noise pollution perpetrating into my house, which continues on until 3-4AM on Saturday morning. 

I don't doubt that some people might think it's not a big deal, but if this is occurring on a regular basis, and one only has the weekend to study, or will like to get a good nights sleep after a long work week, it can surely be quite frustrating.

I doubt permission was granted to allow this, since the hotel isn't officially licensed as a nightclub.

* wipe down the sink with soap after every use
* don't leave dishes in the sink for more than an hour
* remove hair from the drain after every shower
* wipe down the stove after every two uses
* wipe down the microwave if there are small splatters that happen

i've never really been the dirty roommate, so this is a bit weird to me to get texts from my roommate once every few weeks about how i need to be cleaner. i'm not sure how to assert myself and say that i think this list of things is just a bit ridiculous, and that when living together compromises need to be made. i struggle with anxiety a bit, so every time my roommate is unhappy with me it makes me feel uncomfortable and nervous at home / around him. how should i handle this situation?",07Dec2019,1

85,"

My mom and I have a very bad relationship. My entire childhood I was always afraid of making her the slightest bit upset about anything.  She would scream, chase me around the house to beat me, etc. At the same time of her being so negative towards me and telling me how useless and much of a mistake I was she also will switch over and tell me how much she loves me and how much I mean to her. It‚Äôs a very messed up relationship and I can‚Äôt do it anymore. She had controlled every single aspect of my life until I turned 18. She sent me to treatment centers because she thought something was wrong with me and I wasn‚Äôt allowed to go anywhere unless she knew the exact address, who I‚Äôm with, and all their phone numbers and parent phone numbers. All the way until I was 18.

My plan my entire life was to get enough money and move completely out of state and never have contact with her again. Earlier this year I had hit a very bad spot with my depression. It got so bad that I literally sat in my room for months on end. Not even going outside. This entire time my mom was extremely negative and made everything about my situation harder.

One day during that depression my mom has came to me and said she is going to buy me a house to get me started in life. I tried to tell her no. I said I didn‚Äôt want it. But she still did it. Since she had bought it I decided I might as well live there compared to being in her house. Ever since I got out of her house I‚Äôve been so happy and stress free. My social life has been improving and I‚Äôve held a job the whole time I‚Äôve been there. It feels so great to be able to walk have my own space where I don‚Äôt have to be controlled and talked down to.

The one thing is that my mom wants to include herself in everything. She texts me everyday. Calls me about every other day, shows up uninvited, even tries to guilt trip me into hanging out with her on my off days.  I just can‚Äôt deal with it anymore. Everything she says has some manipulation or negativity to it.

I really don‚Äôt know what to do. I want to cut her off but at the same time she bought me my house and car. But it‚Äôs obvious she did that to hold control and manipulate because my other family members had told her I was going to cut her off when I get to move out. I‚Äôm just lost and feel like I‚Äôm loosing the battle with my abusive mom.  I just want her to leave me alone.",07Dec2019,1

89,"So we currently live in a studio, not really any option here since there is only 1 room. But we are upgrading to a 1 bedroom and I am trying to think of a good place to set up his desk (he plays PC games) where it's not so disruptive. We will have an apartment with a living room, dining area and kitchen all in one open space, then a bedroom with a walk in closet. 

Options:

1. Dining area - pros: he can still watch TV and hang out with me while not playing the games or if he is here by himself. Cons: although it will be further from the living room area than it is now, I feel like it might still be loud and annoying. 
2. Bedroom - pros: will not disturb me when I am in the living room or kitchen. Cons: he does stay up a little later than me and even with ear plugs I can still him (and will know when his 'orbs' are in perfect alignment). \[Side note: he is not obnoxiously loud and he tried really hard to be considerate, but when you are chatting with your friends and playing a fun game, the volume can escalate without realizing\]
3. Walk in closet? - this sounds super weird to me. Would that be strange to put him in the closet? Pro: solves both cons from 1 and 2. Con: feels weird, also won't have the benefit of being able to hang out in the living room when we are both just on the computer or if he is here by himself and wants to watch TV while doing something on the computer. 

I'm really looking for any advice that could help. For instance, is there some sound proofing material that could be placed on the wall in the dining area that would reduce the noise? Has anyone partially built one of those hardware store sheds in their apartment as a means for sound diversion? Does anyone else have a gaming setup in a walk in closet and it is not weird? Etc...

91,"       Okay so I‚Äôm planning on buying a leather jacket for my gf but I‚Äôm trying to pick between two different brands (Wilson‚Äôs and Worthington). The Worthington jacket is a little more expensive and I think it might fit better but the Wilson‚Äôs is cheaper and looks it‚Äôs got higher quality. The Wilson‚Äôs jacket is only a little bigger in the measurements than the Worthington jacket and it‚Äôs less expensive, it also looks better in the pictures but the seller does not do returns so if it doesn‚Äôt fit right then I‚Äôm screwed. 

         The Worthington jacket is a bit smaller (by an inch all around in the measurements) which is a plus but the pictures are horrible. They‚Äôre really fuzzy and even though it is genuine leather it kind of looks like pleather in the pictures (but that could just be from the fuzziness, I think it was probably taken on an older android). I asked the seller that‚Äôs selling the Worthington jacket if there were any flaws like wrinkling or anything (the jacket looks like it might be wrinkled in the photos but again, the photos are fuzzy and not well lit) and they said they took it outside and inspected it with their son and found no flaws, they also accept returns.

99," 

Okay so, I‚Äôm not really sure what to do here, and I feel like my friends and family would judge me harshly so I guess I‚Äôm turning to the internet for advice. TL;DR at the bottom but I will say the details are important! I won‚Äôt waste time with a long intro so here's the story: 

I was doing what most single 25 year old guys do on Friday night, eating plain cooked chicken and swiping through Tinder. 

I'm new to a small-ish midwest city for work from a big city down south to work at a software comapny. I have only been here for 4 months but aside from a guy at work I sent the occasional ‚ÄúPackers suck‚Äù meme too I had yet to really meet anyone. 

So there I was, basically just swiping right on every female whose picture didn‚Äôt have a toddler in it and it happened, I got a match. The screen faded to her profile photo and the green ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a match‚Äù shot across the screen. *Wasn‚Äôt used to seeing that*. 

This wasn‚Äôt just any match either, this girl was hot. Her profile was full of photos of her in various crop tops and bikinis, she had shoulder length thick brown hair and golden skin on the fittest body I‚Äôve ever seen on a dating app. This could only mean one thing: It‚Äôs a bot. I closed my phone and tossed it on my coffee table and went back to my chicken. 

**\*BTZZ\***

My phone lit up and buzzed from a new notification, ‚ÄúTinder: Ally Sent you a message!‚Äù I opened to see a ‚ÄúHey :)‚Äù from this beautiful bot. I shrugged to myself, thinking *hey, you never know*, and messaged her back. 

I won‚Äôt get into the nitty gritty but basically we talked all night. She was 23, a student at UW who loved the White Stripes *almost* as much as me. She held a conversation well and was even witty. I was eager to set up a date, her response was wanting to text for awhile. Normally I wouldn‚Äôt entertain this as these are just the attention seekers who never actually show up to dates but she was smoking hot and funny on top of it so I agreed to continue simply texting. Which we did, non stop for a few days. I found myself falling for this, most likely, catfish but I didn‚Äôt care. I was so lonely in this small city connecting with anyone just felt nice. Then it finally happened, she agreed to meet! It sent my heart racing. I Immediately went out and got a haircut. 

Pretty standard set up, we agreed to meet downtown for coffee. I got there a few minutes early. The logical side of me told me not to get excited, this *was going* to be a catfish, or she gained a lot of weight in college and those photos were from highschool. I didn‚Äôt care though. I had to give it a shot. I was sitting there coffee in hand, facing the door when the chime sounded and there she was, just like her picture, all tanned and crop topped. 

***Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit.***

We shared a slightly awkward hello and hug. She ordered her drink and we sat down and began the usual first meeting small talk conversations. I found myself just staring at her lips, plump but not Kylee Jenner plump. Just nice and real. I was getting a little distracted by them, my horny 25 year old brain wandering as it tends to do when she dropped the bomb on me. 

‚ÄúSo, I have to tell you, I haven‚Äôt been fully transparent about something with you.‚Äù Ally said her tone now leaning on the nervous side. 

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù Was all I could mumble out.

‚ÄúThe man behind me, in the black pea coat.‚Äù She gestured her head slightly to the left ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs my boyfriend.‚Äù 

I hadn‚Äôt even noticed him (did I mention the crop top?) but yup, there he was peacoat and all just staring at us from across the coffee shop, with an almost angry look on his face. Another thing I noticed, he looked like me. I mean not like we were twins or anything but, dark hair, scruff, glasses, we even seemed to have the same fit but kind of lanky body type. I looked back to Ally. She tensed up a bit, almost like she could feel his eyes on her. 

‚ÄúThat‚Ä¶ was probably worth mentioning.‚Äù I said. 

‚ÄúI know! I‚Äôm so sorry but, you see, we are looking for a third!‚Äù She smiled. I must have visibly cringed because her smile faded fast. 

‚ÄúSorry, I‚Äôm uh, just not into polyamory.‚Äù I awkwardly stated. 

‚ÄúWell, neither are we, see my boyfriend has a cuckold fetish, and we both picked you to be the person we try it out on. Are you interested?‚Äù She asked looked like a kicked puppy. Was it just me or did she almost seem, afraid? I didn‚Äôt know what to say, I had a small sinking feeling in my chest. I wasn‚Äôt looking for a new girlfriend, I was still sore over losing my college girlfriend due to us going separate ways after graduation. But I‚Äôm not sure how I felt about sharing a girl either. 

‚ÄúI would need some time to think about it I guess.‚Äù I said. She reached out very suddenly and grabbed my forearm which was resting on the table. 

‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù She practically whispered. My eyes flashed to the boyfriend, then back to hers. There was something very desperate in her eyes, his remained the same as they were when I first looked at him. Infact, it appeared that he hadn‚Äôt moved at all. Just a gargoyle, watching us. Something seemed very off. 

‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù I whispered. *Was she being forced to do this?*

‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù She fully whispered this time her grip on my arm growing stronger. *My gut didn‚Äôt feel right, but fuck, she is hot.* 

I have no idea what the hell possessed to me to say this as my initial reaction was being uninterested but there I was, agreeing to her request she got very animated with how excited she was. He again remained the gargoyle. She asked if I would be the one to drive us back to her place because part of the fantasy was that he stalked her on her dates but kept his distance. I agreed and we got into my car and started driving. 

She didn‚Äôt skip a beat on the ride over. Whispering in my ear all the things she wanted to do to me, while her hand rubbed my inner thigh. She started licking my neck the closer we got. There was a hunger to her, my guess was the bedroom had been dead for awhile. I kept checking to see if there was a car with her statue of a boyfriend following us. I never actually saw him but there was always a lot of traffic downtown on weekends. I can‚Äôt say this was ever one of my fantasies, but the more I thought about it the more excited I got. I was about to fuck this stupidly attractive girl who was more into me than any of my previous girlfriends had ever been. 

We pull up to their duplex. It was a pretty nice place for some college kids, though very small. There was a tiny fenced in yard in the back. A window in the bedroom had a view of it perfectly. She told me that's where he would be watching. I was comforted at the thought of him being outside, though if I‚Äôm being honest he was the last thing on my mind at this point. We started to get down to business, that hunger became all the more desperate in her. It was the hottest thing I‚Äôd ever experienced. At one point while she was, um busy a little south of the boarder I looked to the window. He was there, watching. His face didn‚Äôt have any anger this time. It was completely blank. He was watching us for sure, but he didn‚Äôt look present. It was unsettling to say the least. I focused back on my new favorite place for those plump lips to be. She was amazing, though she bit down a couple times. A little harder each time, she would promptly apologize but the third time it happened I could tell it was on purpose. Maybe it was just one of her kinks so I shrugged it off. It definitely left me a little sore though.

Anyway things kept going as they do and we finally started doing the deed. She made me weak, I never felt so amazing with anyone ever. I‚Äôm pretty sure she felt the same due to this next part. As we were going, and it felt we were both getting close to ‚Äúdone‚Äù her eyes rolled back into her head. And I‚Äôm not taking like how the girls in porn roll their eyes back. All I could see were the whites of her eyes. She was moaning and screaming so much, her body vibrating, it was so hot but almost a little much? She was either really good or really bad at faking it, that's when the weird part happened. 

All of a sudden I heard a loud crack. I looked back to the window, her boyfriend had slammed his hand on the window and was just holding it there. Tears rolling down his face. I stopped instantly but didn‚Äôt pull out. She dug her nails into my back and growled ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt stop!‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt as hot as it sounds though, she seemed really upset. But I figured *hey this is what I‚Äôm here for* so I started back up again.  

Took a minute to get it back but we were both there again. Her moans grew louder but, I hear the crack again, I look over more subtlety this time and his hand is in a fist and has sent a crack through the glass. *What a fucking idiot* I thought to myself. No fetish was worth property damage. He was bawling, he could have come in at any time and asked us to stop but he didn‚Äôt. It all felt very weird though. 

She started to scream from reaching her climax and then I heard another voice that still gives me chills when I think about it. 

‚ÄúLet him go!‚Äù It was the boyfriend. His face wrinkled and drenched in tears. He smashed his hand even harder against the glass and it spider-webbed out. Then he stopped. His face completely relaxed, hand removed from the window. It sent a shiver down my spine. I stopped and so did she. She asked if I came with her and I told her yes. I didn‚Äôt. The guy freaked me out too much. She went to pee and I started to get dressed. He stood there, almost in a trance? I closed the curtain. I just couldn‚Äôt look at the dude anymore. His voice was ringing in my head. 

*Let him go.* 

What did he mean him? I‚Äôm the one who had his girlfriend pinned down. Maybe it was just a slip of the tongue. I‚Äôve mixed up words before when stressed out for sure. I wondered if he would come inside and yell at me, he seemed desperate to get me off of her but I suppose he knew what he was asking for and held back. Idk. 

Here is the problem. Ally has messaged me nonstop. I honestly didn‚Äôt think I would hear from her again but on the contrary, she would not leave me alone. She kept begging to know when we could fuck again. I‚Äôve been keeping her bay simply because I‚Äôm not sure I want to see how much more we are going to piss off the boyfriend. I can handle myself but I‚Äôm worried he‚Äôll retaliate against her. But at the same time, these are consenting adults. And I have never felt so good in my life. I can't get the feeling of her body against mine out of my head. It's getting harder and harder to put her requests off. I find myself waking in the middle of night craving her. Needing to be with her again. But this is probably just my dick talking. 

TL:DR- I hooked up with a hottie on tinder who is only in it for her bf's cuck fetish. He acted weird the first time and I'm not sure I should see her again even though I really REALLY want too. 

So reddit, what do I do?",07Dec2019,1

101,My boyfriend and I have been in a long-distance relationship for almost a year now and I have cheated on him once when I was high and I told him right away. He didn't break up with me for some reason and I told myself that I would never do something like that again but recently I have been having some strong cravings for other people. I am a very touchy and sexual person so being in a long distance relationship has been very hard for me. My boyfriend and I have also been having a lot of problems lately and he hasn't been really understanding of a lot of things. He gets upset when I can't talk on the phone and he gets very jealous easily. He gets super worried and paranoid whenever I go out even before I cheated on him. He doesn't get that I have a busy college life and that I want time to myself sometimes. I really feel like I am getting suffocated sometimes and it makes me depressed and overwhelmed. He cares a lot about me but doesn't really let me have a life. I'm thinking about breaking up with him because I feel constricted but I am scared to do it because I know I can always talk to him when I am having a bad day because he will listen and makes sure that I'm doing okay. I am afraid of not being able to find someone like that again who really cares about me so much. I also think I need to have time to figure out what I actually like and want which is why I want to experiment with new people. SO I don't really know what to do. Either stay in this relationship even though I'm miserable sometimes ORRR break up and move on.,07Dec2019,1

104,"Hello, I am looking for some advice on how to become more comfortable with physical touch.

I grew up in a good home but my parents were never very physically loving. They were great in other ways and I always knew I was loved its just they weren't super physically affectionate.  So now I am a 20 year old girl and I  just can't seem to be able to connect to others in the same way I see many of my girl friends do. I mean I do hug my friends but very rarely and I have to know that person very well. Even then, when I am  hugging them I just feel overwhelmed and in my gut I want to get away. I had one short relationship but it didn't last very long because I just couldn't get comfortable with how I was constantly close to that person.

I would appreciate any advice you could give with how I can become comfortable with this. I want to be able to be able to hold someone without my fight or flight response being set off.",07Dec2019,1

Shit I forgot my fathers birthday for like 3 days and just remembered.
Why is this important:

We don‚Äôt talk or text often or at all. Which makes this a big deal since I kinda always made sure to talk to him on this day. To let him know I love him and that I am not in just for the resources since yeah at some point I just was I think. 
We had I would say a relative stressful relationship when I was growing up but he was always there for me perhaps not always in the right way but to the best of his ability and with good intention and for that I am now that I am older quite thankful.
It‚Äôs just that I am still I don‚Äôt know hesitant around him. Look he used to scream when I just scrapped with the knife over my plate by acident when I was a child (even as an adult I absolutely can‚Äôt eat calmly with him at the table and wasent very patient hen I had problems in math which resulted in more yelling,punched me when I wanted to give up learning how to ride a bike without support wheels when I was a child. I still don‚Äôt get complicated math.

I was diagnosed with a malformation in my brain when I was 13 which required over 5 years of surgeries  over 30 surgeries and even I was 16  I told them to stop the treatment since it felt like I was changing for the worst.
That put allot of stress on them I would have died in my thirties if they did not do it do to a guaranteed brain bleed. So of course they wanted to keep me alive and did what they did and proceeded I don‚Äôt want to think wether it was right or wrong  I came  to a conclusion  and if I question it again I just have another breakdown.

So I just realized that it‚Äôs my fathers birthday well wrong  it‚Äôs not today it was 3 days ago today is the day my grandfather died. And yeah back then my father was kinda glad it did not happen on his birthday for obvious reasons.  So yeah 

He is currently already down and suffering from burn out  and some psychological issues (depression)for which  I kinda feel responsible since yeah I kinda told my parents back then I hated them for what they did and do not love them anymore and was just in it for their resources s d that they ruined my mind and body with this surgery crap I kinda was an ass for that I think that was then I was 18 and had my final surgery I am blind on my left eye now and it‚Äôs quite hard for me to keep my mind together and Interpunktion is a mess. 

I am now 23

And yeah I don‚Äôt talk to my father much things get kinda awkward I do care for him I just can‚Äôt express it very well and I think we kinda don‚Äôt know how to talk to each other I often get told how complicated I am and how stressful it was or is to deal with me and I get asked if I find my behavior and attitude  ok for my age when I try to have my point of view Heard- that was always the problem.

All my friends in my current city are older and I get along very well I suppose and I can have great deep philosophical talks and discussions with them and I feel cherished, taken seriously and accepted by them. So yeah I gues my parents are kinda wrong I can get along with others and I am perceived as very mature for my age although I often worry about the opinions and my perception that others have of me and I feel super weird in groups of people and I can‚Äôt stop thinking.

So like I said I forgot my fathers birthday for 3 days although I told myself hey it‚Äôs his birthday this month at the beginning of the month: but I remembered on my own today I am not even sure if my brothers did remembered his.

How should I proceed call him tomorrow? Right now it‚Äôs the middle of the night  wait and do it in person when I get home for Christmas ?

He is already having problems with burnout and depression and I fear  having forgotten his birthday might be hard hit for him.",07Dec2019,1
106,"My (29F) boyfriend (40M) and I are friends with some of the homeless people on the street. One of them, Bear (short for barry) (old M) has dropped hints that he could get off the streets. He mentioned once that his therapist at the VA had said he could get him setup with housing. He has lost contact with the therapist. I forget the therapists name, but it has remained unchanged throughout his various stories.

Another time I asked about housing and he denied being able to get it, but he isn't always mentally all there, often having delusions of having grand money and talking about two brothers with the name Barry like him. 

He also mentioned once that he was MIA. And another time I told him I was going to try to help him by calling the VA and he got twitchy, telling me not to ask them for stuff for ME, which was confusing. I told him I wouldn't call them without him there. 

Is there anything I can do to help him? Is this going to take a lot of energy and time on my part. At the same time, I am on disability and I feel like since I am blessed with free time it would be morally imperative of me to spend the time to get at least one person of the streets if I can.

108,"So I've never been perfect at math. I've been trying insanely hard to be, but for some reason, it just never seems to truly click. I do a lot of robotics work, so, sadly, I've developed a love for it and want to pursue it in college. Well, no schools are going to accept a person with bad math grades, so I put it on myself this senior year to get a good grade. I've been studying an insane amount for tests and working incredibly hard, but my math teacher really, really, isn't helping at all. He refuses to assist his students, tests us on subjects we've learned a day before, and has even gone as far as to have a test on a subject he didn't even finish teaching the day before we had a test on it. At this point in the semester, my grade is at a C-, and I'm doing everything I can to get it up. I've used every resource available to me short of a tutor because I can't afford one. I emailed my teacher and he essentially just told me to study more and refused to offer any help. So, I spent hours in the library going over math problems and trying to memorize all of the stuff and I was hoping, praying that I would do well on this test to boost it. 

We had the test four days ago and just got grades back. And I got 60% on it. So I'm officially fucked with colleges because my overall calc grade is now at a solid D+ and the next opportunity to do well is a final. And, based on my history, I highly doubt it'll be enough to bring up my grade, despite how hard I'm trying.

So I'm screwed. No colleges, much less an engineering-focused college, are going to accept a student with a D in Calculus. My top school is WPI and my dream major is Robotic Engineering, but there's no way on earth that's going to happen now. 

As much as I hate myself for it, I still want to try to do better. Are there any suggestions anyone has for something I can do? I know that I'm pretty much royally screwed, but does anyone have any advice on how I can try to do better?",07Dec2019,1
109,"Context: I have been in the Account Executive role in my company for about a year, and I was previously in similar roles with two other companies. I currently work for a start up, so my work load is larger than I‚Äôve ever experienced; my territory is massive (several states) and I‚Äôm traveling 4~5 days a week. The traveling and work load have been getting to me for quite some time. I feel like I don‚Äôt have a chance to properly coach my team members (they‚Äôre spread throughout several states) because I barely have time to complete my designated tasks. My peers in my same role feel about as run down as I do...but I truly LOVE the company I work for and what they stand for. It‚Äôs been challenging on my personal life, which has suffered tremendously- but I also get to travel places I wouldn‚Äôt typically be able to if I wasn‚Äôt in this role. 


This is where it gets difficult. A few months ago one of my new hires daughters called me saying her mom was in a hospital because she tried hurting herself. I was shocked and so empathetic, when she was home and ready to get back to work- I felt obligated to be extra gentle with her while working together. I would travel with her, and we always have a great time together. She tells me I‚Äôm the best boss she‚Äôs ever had and she‚Äôs thankful for my kindness. When giving her direction (which is minimal because she is great at what she does-) I‚Äôm always more friendly with her. 

Around that same time, someone who I‚Äôve known in the industry for quite some time reached out to me for a job. I knew he was solid at what he was trained in, but he recently burnt a bridge with a partner company so I stuck my head out to get him in good standing and brought him on. I wanted to give the first employee I spoke about in this post a break from traveling because I knew it was emotionally draining for her, so I would invite this new employee with me instead (we would need multiple people traveling regularly.) He became my right hand man, he would go by my house when I was gone to organize work related mail, he would take a trip across the county with 5 hour notice, he would go above and beyond always. When I couldn‚Äôt attend an event or meeting, I would send him instead. He would say ‚ÄúI know how you like things and I won‚Äôt ever let you down!‚Äù He took good care of me, and I took good care of him. He had been having domestic disputes with his partner over the last couple of months that got pretty terrible. On one trip, I opened up about my experiences with an abusive relationship and we really bonded. He called me about a week later crying, he sounded really bad. I invited him to a movie and dinner. I then invited him to spend the night because he seemed really down...We watched movies &amp; I made us breakfast the next day. This ended up happening a couple of times... I know it‚Äôs not my obligation to ‚Äúfix someone‚Äù especially an employee, but it felt right. I felt like I wasn‚Äôt overly crossing boundaries, because I knew him so long- and never spoke about anything work related that was inappropriate. 

A month ago I noticed cut marks and burn marks on his arm. I didn‚Äôt say anything because I knew why he was doing it...he openly had severe anxiety, was battling exiting an unhealthy relationship etc. I didn‚Äôt want to cross anymore boundaries. 2 weeks ago he told me his anxiety was getting so bad he would wake up in the morning with his palms already sweaty. I was with him hosting a work event and he was in a really negative space(not sad, he was annoyed with a coworker.) I told him to take a 15, &amp; needed to improve his mood immediately so we could get through the day. A week ago, I got a call that he was gone. The night it happened, he sent me questions about my schedule but told me we could discuss it the next day if it was too late to chat, and put a heart at the end. I didn‚Äôt reply until the next morning.

His grandmother asked to meet with me because she said he didn‚Äôt ever go out besides constant work trips. She said that there were no signs...but I now know that all of the things I just wrote about were signs. 

It‚Äôs been a week, and I haven‚Äôt been able to sleep. I took 2 days off of work, at this point everyone is back to their normal day to day routines, and I feel like I‚Äôm in a fog. Two days ago another employee of mine called me and she had a severe stroke, just like my mom did a couple of months ago, and is in bad shape. Tonight, the employee that I originally spoke about, who was checked into a hospital months ago, called me three times. When I answered she was hysterical saying she was so tired of hurting etc etc (she was pretty close with him as well)I talked her down for 40 minutes until we ended on an okay note. 


 I‚Äôm not a counselor. I don‚Äôt even feel okay myself at this point, yet I had to call each employee that knew him on the day It happened as per my directors request to tell them. I have to listen to them crying, and console them, while I am torn up inside. Is this a true lesson in leading a team? If so, I may not be cut out for this. 

I‚Äôm currently on a 8 hour train ride for work (which was stopped for 2 hours because of a ‚Äútrespasser strike- look it up), only to drive 3 hours to attend an 11 hour event tomorrow at 9AM. This isn‚Äôt a plea for help from me, and I may have over shared, but I really don‚Äôt think I can be in this type of role any longer. Is this one of those ‚Äúthis too shall pass‚Äù moments, or am I too much of an empath to oversee a team of 20? I‚Äôm younger than most of my employees, and I‚Äôm trying to plan a family all while navigating constant extreme stressors. 

This job however...pays my bills and allows me to live more comfortably than most. I love the money, but I‚Äôm too stressed and too tired and too busy to even answer my families calls anymore. 

Has this happened to anyone else in an elevated role? How did you navigate this? I‚Äôm okay with honest advice, please send it to me. I‚Äôm a little bit lost right now. Thank you.",07Dec2019,1

Bit of a misleading title. Maybe.

I have taken care of people all my life. My mom became sick when I was 12. Died when I was 14. I was left with my 90 year old grandfather. He passed when I was 19. By then I'd had my daughter ( and another one later). In my mid 20's my absentee father showed up with no one else to care for him. He lived with us for over 10 years before he passed. My then I was a single mom. Remarried a few years later to a great guy..... Who became extremely ill about 2 years in and I've been taking care of him every since. (14 years). All while working full time and at times 2-3 jobs at the same time.

I retired in May after 22 years in education. Most of that in Sped. I was born with CP and I understand kids with disabilities and my heart is always with them.

Anyway.. I went out on disability because my poor body just couldn't keep up amymore. I'd put off surgery because the recovery time was longer than summer break and it got to the point I couldn't put it off anymore.

Had surgery over the summer and recovery is kicking my can! I feel weak and tire easily. Pain is my constant friend as I retrain my muscles after a lifetime of misuse trying to realign my body. 

Recently my hubby had a flare up and is extremely sick and needy. My daughter got divorced and needs me. Other daughter needs help with the kids.... You get the idea.

I find myself being resentful. I'm tired of taking care of everyone. Honestly I'm just tired. I love my family but I just feel drained. How can I take care of them when I'm barely taking care of myself?

And yet... I've always been the caregiver... It's now expected. How do I change the only way of life I know?",07Dec2019,1
120,"I have this friend that I‚Äôve been with for about two years now. They are really smart and that‚Äôs how we originally bonded. We both had the common goal to succeed. Yet now I‚Äôm starting to think about their behavior and ponder it. I don‚Äôt know if they are trying to genuinely help me and it‚Äôs coming off the wrong. For example sometimes when I try to explain things, they‚Äôll cut me off and tell me I‚Äôm wrong. They won‚Äôt wait for me to finish sometimes.

122,"Like the title says, I clean houses for a living. I'm a 41 y/o married female. One of my male clients has been making inappropriate comments to me while I am at the house cleaning. It's happened multiple times now and is getting progressively worse. From a business perspective, I only interact with the wife. Her and I communicate via text message to set my cleaning schedule and manage all of the client relationship stuff. I clean their house twice a month for 4-5 hours. I arrive at the house and start cleaning by 8 am. The wife is not there when I clean as she has already left for work. The husband is usually still home when I arrive, and he is usually upstairs getting ready for work. He has always been very friendly to me and will often chat with me on his way out of the house. For the most part, it has always been fairly innocent chat. 

In November 2018, I got hair extensions and this is when he started making comments about my looks. He told me I resembled his ex. Since then he has told me that ""I look fit"", that ""I'm pretty"", that he hopes my husband ""tells me I'm pretty often."" I brushed these comments off as just a guy being a guy. It was never creepy, just not the way I want to be talked to by a client. More recently, things have progressed to the point that I feel he has crossed a line. The first time it happened, he told me about a time that he was out without his wife and was tempted by ""all of the pretty women."" He told me that he wasn't happy with his body and and that he wanted to start going to the gym. He asked me if women in their 40's lose their sex drive. I told him he should talk with his wife. Last week, he told me that I would look ""sexy"" if I got dressed up. 

I have to clean for them next week and have been having major anxiety about being at their house alone with him. I have never felt threatened by him, just very uncomfortable.

I've talked with my husband and he thinks I should quit cleaning for them. Full stop. I mostly agree, but am worried about how it will impact my business. (this client is friends with at least one of my other clients) I am also not sure of how I should quit. Should I tell the wife that her husband is being a creep? Should I tell the husband to back the F off and just keep cleaning their house? Looking for advice on how the brilliant minds :) of Reddit would handle this situation!

When it comes down to it I'm choosing between different poisons. I don't care how bearable the work is because no matter what I will always prefer the time I spend not working. I can't believe the rest of my life will be consumed slaving away for a paycheck. Wage slavery is disgusting and unnatural.

The people who say ""start a business"" are delusional. I don't want to sacrifice the few hours I do get so that I can have the small chance of escaping wage slavery one day. I don't even care about ever becoming a multi-millionaire. I just want to live the one life I have.",07Dec2019,1

129,"Tw: rape, sexual assault

Okay so my (29f) male friends have been confiding in me that they have been assaulted by their male relatives. It breaks my heart and I cannot control my rage against the injustice happening. My heart goes out for them! 

For now keeping them as a priority, the support I have been giving is as follows 

- 1) Telling them it's NOT their fault 
- 2) Telling them that I hope they will get justice someday 
- 3) Listen to them whenever they give vent and validate their emotions
- 4) no advice or solution without asking permission 
- 5) no physical contact without asking permission even if I'm trying to comfort them. Ensuring others do the same. 

I acknowledge that I am not a mental health professional and I should not be trying to be one. It can cause more damage than good. But asking someone to ""go seek a therapist"" may make me come across as impatient which I'm trying to be extra careful not to come across as one. 

Tbh mental health professionals have failed one of them in the past so I'm being extra careful before using those words. 

Now comes to the main question for which I need advice for : how can I support them better ? 

Any advice is welcomed. I just want the best for them and will do anything to ensure that their well being is taken care of. 

Any helplines and organisations references are also welcome.

130,"My best friend, whom I love dearly, called me tonight crying to let me know she was checking herself into the local hospital due to being dangerously suicidal. I've always known she struggled with her mental health and I'm very proud of her for being able to take a step back and get the help she needs. Obviously I know there's nothing I can do to fix everything for her, as much as I may want to. But I also know the hospital probably won't keep her for more than a couple days and I have no idea what the best way to support her moving forward is - making her an ugly cake with a silly phrase on it seems useless despite being on brand for our friendship. 

I don't want her to feel like we're smothering her or overstepping boundaries, but I want her to know that she's adored and supported. Do I go for normalcy? And outpouring of adoration? Space? Is there a best practice for this sort of thing?

I also know she's been struggling with her home - she moved months ago and has been unable to get unpacked so she's been living among clutter and boxes - and I'd love to be able to unpack for her so she can go home to a place a little less chaotic. We're very close and I know she's been embarrassed about her house, but I also know she'd be in a much better headspace in a slightly more put together home (because she's admitted as much and I've seen it in action).

131,"I left for a month of training where I would have to relinquish my phone for the time. I have just gotten it back only to find a triad of pretty terrible news, and though I‚Äôm staying strong and waiting to crumble when I get into the privacy of my own room, I can feel myself choke on my own words, or find myself zoning out and focusing on these thoughts.

1. My career progression has been something of a rollercoaster in the worst ways possible. I said the wrong words to the wrong ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù and was demoted, but the paperwork never went through so I‚Äôm being punished months later after having served extra duty and room restrictions. I may be demoted down two positions now, and I will owe my organization well over a grand if I cannot find a lawyer good enough to defend my case.

2. The day I got my phone back, my then girlfriend had spent the day ignoring me. When I finally asked what‚Äôs wrong, she texted me and said she‚Äôd rather be on her own because she really liked the feeling. I feel deep down that someone else is in the picture. We hit a rough patch before I left, but I played peacekeeper knowing I‚Äôd be gone for a month. Had I known that would have been the last time I would kiss and embrace her, I‚Äôd have made it a goodbye and not a ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you in a month.‚Äù, and I am regretting allowing my anxieties to get the better of me, and not taking actions to curb it sooner. 

3. My father has cancer. My grandparents on his side have had the same problems, so he‚Äôs always watched it closely. Thank god that they caught it early enough to remove it (in his arm and back, which he‚Äôs going through surgeries to get rid of). I suppose this one‚Äôs a double edged blade, but knowing my father has to go through this once and maybe more later is adding to the plethora of things.

Throughout the day, I have been completely zoned out, going about our work on auto-pilot. I am starving, but I have no desire to eat this poor excuse for food any longer, nor do I really have a desire to eat in general. I‚Äôve choked on words, I see her in everything I pass by. I keep thinking that maybe if I could go back home either to my home state or place of work, I could do something to help prevent any of these things. 

Now I am sitting in an open bay filled with other grown men, repeatedly coming to the verge of tears and swallowing them back down before a single tear can be shed. I haven‚Äôt cried in years, but now I can‚Äôt wait to get back to the privacy of my own room so I can crumble for a moment. I won‚Äôt be leaving here for days due to leadership pushing our leave time back.

I plan to start hitting the gym twice a day with my fit friends, forcing myself to eat right, and even seeking therapy so that I can process some of the things happening in life, as well as going through any potential mental issues I have that could be contributing to the destruction of my relationships. 

I just need help coping with things right now. How do I keep my mind busy during downtime? How do I release the pressure valve so to speak in a way that allows me to keep pushing forward without faltering?",07Dec2019,1
132,"\*\*Please read the whole post before passing judgment.\*\*  I love my son to death but he is a miserable person. He suffers from depression and anxiety. I took him to the psychiatrist when he was a teenager, but he refuses to stay on medication or go to any kind of therapy. Aside from being depressed and anxious, he is also very negative, mean, judgmental, hateful, and just nasty. He is very unpleasant to be around. I don't know why he is like this because he was never abused. He had a very loving and positive upbringing. His father died of cancer when he was 15, but my son behaved like this even before his father died so I know that's not the cause. He is 23 years old and lives with me. He has never had a girlfriend and is very angry about it. He goes on a tirade about women every single day saying all women are ""entitled whores"" and ""hypergamous"". He also has an unhealthy obsession with teenagers. He always rants about how it's stupid that the age of consent is so high because girls used to get married at 12. He said girls his age are already ruined from years of being ""sluts"". He said he would ideally prefer to marry a 13-15 year old virgin if he could but that society is unfair and won't allow it. I always ask him ""how could you talk like this? Where is this coming from?"". He insists that society hates straight white men and that he is the product of a degenerate society. I told him on many occasions that he needs to go to therapy and to stay on his medication. He always says no because he doesn't want to be poisoned and brainwashed by the ""gynocracy"". I always try to encourage him to find hobbies, make friends, and get help. But he always says it's a waste of time because he's going to kill himself anyway. Well we had a fight two weeks ago and he called me a ""whore"" because I have a new boyfriend. We fought back and forth and were screaming at each other and he finally said he's going to kill himself. I snapped and said ""Why don't you just do it?!! Everyone in the family is sick of tiptoeing around you! If you're so miserable, maybe you should just kill yourself so you can stop making us miserable!"". I immediately regretted saying it but I didn't apologize because I was so angry in the moment. Two weeks ago I woke up in the morning and saw a piece of paper taped to the fridge written by my son saying ""You'll never see me again BITCH"". He left the house and refused to answer his phone. He doesn't have a driver's license or a car. He doesn't have any money. And he didn't take any clothes with him. I was worried all day thinking he might go kill himself or that he will sleep outside and freeze to death. I was about to call the police but then his grandmother (my mother in law) called me to tell me he went to her house.

James recently got high last summer, but I didn't care. I thought that he just wanted to experience it, and I was fine with that. But then he got high again a couple of months later. My friends and I warned him against it and expressed our disapproval, because it's illegal to smoke and he could have gotten in trouble. But he said that he wasn't addicted, he ""only liked the feeling"" and he wasn't going to do it again.   
However, James just smoked tonight and did something awful. He groped one of my friend's ass ""as a joke"" while he was high in front of his girlfriend.

147,"Male early 20s. 

I've had a seriously anxiety disorder for the last 16 months. I could also have paranoia, but I'm still getting it investigated. Sometimes I feel extremely paranoid/ anxious and other times less so. 

Sometimes I wake up and feel absolutely charged. It feel so energetic and that I can do anything. Recently, I've had this feeling since Wednesday. I was unbelievably confident when I was speaking to people and I can tell that they noticed something about me. 

I could think really fast and creatively, I had so much energy I felt like I could run around the Earth. I barely even need to sleep. The day after I could only sleep for about 3 hours at a time and then I'm awake for around 6 to 8 hours. I feel slower mentally meaning that I can't study because my mind feels slow, but physically I feel great, still confident and so on. I feel like this now. 

Since November started this year, I slowly started to feel like I had less energy and I would watch TV all day. I usually play tennis 3 times a week and go to the gym almost every day, but I couldn't do it properly for the first few weeks in November and then about 2 weeks ago I completely stopped doing anything. It was difficult to get out of bed or make a proper breakfast. I would feel really fatigued. I also started playing video games again which I haven't done since March. I had a video game addiction in the past so I decided to cut them off completely because they were damaging to my academics. 

Now I understand that bipolar has a depression aspect. I rarely ever feel sad andhopeless, but it does happen. I do usually go through periods where I slowly feel more and more fatigued and not wanting to do anything and then I eventually go back into this crazy energetic phase. It cycles around. 

When I'm in the energetic phase then the anxiety doesn't bother me at all. The bad thoughts are there, but it feels like I had this armour around me back in Wednesday when the energetic phase started and then when this energetic phase wears off I feel anxious again. I do feel somewhat anxious now that I haven't been sleeping properly and my thumb has this tremor that was quite bad yesterday. 

I've also heard that this maybe be bipolar or cyclothymia, but could it be something else? I mentioned all this to my psychologist during an initial assessment over the phone yesterday, but I never specifically said bipolar. She never really mentioned bipolar any anything about mood changes at all.

This obviously affected my mental health and I‚Äôve given myself a lot of time and have been working on myself to keep a positive and healthy mind before getting into another relationship. I have a bf (24m) now that treats me like an absolute queen and I don‚Äôt have any reason to not trust him. Now that our relationship is starting to get serious I‚Äôve noticed my mental health demons are slowly creeping back in my mind constantly reminding me that I was cheated on before so why wouldn‚Äôt it happen again. 

HOW do I keep my mind from constantly reminding me that even though this happened to me in the past it doesn‚Äôt mean it has to happen again? I get that this is now an insecurity and it‚Äôs on no one but me. My bf is doing nothing to make me feel this way but now that I‚Äôm falling in love I can‚Äôt help but get this strong feeling it could happen at any time. 

Any advice for keeping your previous relationship traumas from entering your current relationship?",07Dec2019,1

My first problem is, I don‚Äôt even know exactly how to calculate what my old roommate should get back; there are some charges that are 100% her fault, some that are a shared fault, and some that are no one‚Äôs fault. She only paid 1/5th of the entire deposit in the first place. No matter how I do the math, her share is not very much - if anything at all.

But she asked if we are splitting the check 50/50. I don‚Äôt even know what to tell her. I don‚Äôt want to upset her because I‚Äôm afraid she won‚Äôt come cash the check with me. We have to agree on the amount because neither of us has more legal ownership over the money than the other. How can I talk to her tactfully and try to get her to understand and agree?

153,"Hey all, first off, let me start with some context.   


I work in the tech industry, customer support to be precise, and over the past 3 years I've accelerated my knowledge to that of an engineer, and less your standard tech support and closer to Dev, and or Ops. So much so that my Manager approved my promotion to a higher position, where I'll have more free reign to do deep dive into issues, as well as be apart of the development and improvement of our products.  


What has me VERY WORRIED, is two things. First, this is a massive move to me. I've never worked a position like it before, I've always been a self driven individual, I've taught my serf various programming languages and was never satisfied with ""oh it just works"" deciding to do deep dives into every issue I come across as to better improve my self, thus why I'm being moved.  But it scares me, because I'll be held to a much higher standard then I was before, terrified I won't meet the expectations of me. I'm scared beyond belief that I'm going to slip up once, and fail miserably, which ABSOLUTELY SCARES ME. But I want to do this job, I want to do better, to be better. I feel like this is the best spot for me, and yet I'm absolutely terrified of mis-stepping once.   


Second, I recently discovered there's several people who are of the same position as me, and  above me, who, though have 0 decision choice in this, very much don't like that I'm being given this potion, from, what I understand they dislike me because I haven't been at the company as long, and it annoys them that a ""young kid"" as they put it is trying to get to where they are. There is also individuals with whom I've called out for outright lying about how things work, and as they put it, ruined their reputation. (I doubt it....) but these individuals have been on me for awhile....and the idea that people are hoping I fail honestly scares me, because it gives me the impression that they will work to undermine me, and actively sabotage me...Maybe I'm overreacting bit, but this whole thing is a new experience to me and has me absolutely terrified, and yet excited.    


Any advice is greatly appreciated.",07Dec2019,1

If this is the wrong sub then please tell me of another to post this.

I am moving out soon and I have a mountain of junk I want to sell before I leave. I have a variety of Small Gifts, about 30 games, books, toys and junk I want to get rid of and hopefully get a quick buck out of.

The issue is that my parents hold sentimental value to MY stuff that I paid for with MY money. They want me to hoarder my stuff until I have my own children so I can give it to them in 20 YEARS TIME. No. I want to sell my small mountain range of stuff and move on.

The obvious challenges I have right now is that I cannot hold a Garage Sale and I have to sell this stuff with my car covertly.

My dad has always been known to overreact when he gets angry. (3 busted doors and a busted desk, that sort of thing). But recently I‚Äôve been noticing he‚Äôs been getting more and more reactive. 

Just yesterday, we picked up some fast food and were driving back home when a bag fell over at a red light and some fries fell out. He got super angry and for the next 5 minutes starting speeding dangerously fast down a really busy two way street. He almost hit a truck in the process. I was really scared but didn‚Äôt wanna say anything. 

Fast forward to about 30 minutes ago; we were watching the new mandalorian episode on Disney plus as a family. I was cuddling with the cat quietly and I guess my little sister was talking or something? The cat walked over to sit on my dads lap and he grabbed her roughly and threw her to the other end of the couch and  started saying ‚ÄúI warned you not to bother me when I‚Äôm watching stuff, and now this is the consequence‚Äù. 

This made me really upset so I told him that being abusive with the family cat should never be a consequence. He told me that ‚Äúyou being upset about it is the consequence.‚Äù I walked out of the room and said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs ridiculous‚Äù. He called me back in and apologized, like he always does after blowing up. I just accepted it and kept quiet, regardless of what I wanted to say. The family just resumed as if nothing bad even happened. 

I don‚Äôt think he sees the way he over reacts and won‚Äôt fix it anytime soon. I feel like he‚Äôs a ticking time bomb everyday and it really hurts to say that.  I just don‚Äôt know what to do. Please help.",07Dec2019,1
158,"I just started a new job a week ago, and I love it. I've wanted to work with kids since my teens and I've achieved it now after months of waiting to make sure I'm an appropriate candidate. The problem is, I'm 99.99% sure my new coworkers are being hostile towards me.

I can't explain it well, but everything about the environment is hostile. I will walk into a room, leave, then come back, and my coworkers will go completely silent. Barely anyone talks to me, despite me making a conscious effort to talk to them. I walked into a room today and got a sarcastic ""great"" when I told my coworker I would be with them today.

I'm doing this job as an apprenticeship, so I'm brand new and I think I'm learning extremely quickly all things considered, as it's been a week and it feels natural already. I feel like my coworkers are judging me for simple mistakes like not bringing in a bowl of bananas I didn't know was being prepared, or not knowing where things are. My induction was being walked around the rooms, reading policies, and then being thrown into one of the busiest rooms almost immediately afterwards.

In total, I would say there are four people that are friendly and nice, and everyone else just seems angry at me. I would just ignore it, but I'm there 9 hours every day, not including my hour long bus journey to and from work, and frankly I don't get paid near enough to put up with it.

Coworkers. I'm not entirely sure about it.

I'd rather wait until she was available if any real feelings were to develop. She does seem to care about me, or at least a shitty situation I'm in, but I think she'd make a good friend at the very least.

 Working a nice job in customer service currently.

I had a customer come in only minutes ago and I ID'd her for her cigarettes (Because it's store policy) but I told her I also thought she looked young, 20-25. 

She told me she was 38 and that it really made her day that I thought she was so young, I then jokingly asked her how old she thought I was, because people always guess that I'm a lot older than I am.

She said she thought I looked young (17-21) but that she thought I was 27. I laughed and said that no, I was actually 20.

She told me that I didn't look older but that I joke myself really well, maintaining eye contact and acting very mature so it gave her an 'old soul' vibe as she put it.

Now, the advice part. How do I act more my age so people don't automatically assume I'm 25+. I hate it when people tell me I'm 25, it also makes gaining friends hard because they all think I'm older or I don't partake in a lot of the things they do, dating is even hard because half the time I get hit on my 30+ year olds who think I'm older than I am, this has been an issue even when I was younger and it's starting to bother me.

During this time we all experimented together which was fun, however, I started to become unhappy in the situation because of how it started to change things between me and my SO. The third party is a nice enough person, but he began to wear out his welcome with me because: he would stay at our place days on end, my so would use my car to transport him back and forth between our and his place, and interfere with my academic obligations. Most importantly, I began to feel upset about the intimacy between them which was not mutual on my end toward the third party.

After some time to feel out the situation to see if I didnt like him or a poly situation wasn't for me, I decided to let my SO know that I wanted to end what was going on. I when I called the guy to tell him how I felt, he asked if we can still be friends; to which I told him I need space to figure that out. He and my SO had talked about what was going on before I broke the news because they had an inkling that I was unhappy before we all decided to stop being sexually intimate and decided that they still want to be friends.

179,"Last year, I started trying to improve myself last year so I can start college as a better version of myself and had to make a few lifestyle changes in order to make it easier. However, these changes made my parents think that I‚Äôm gay. I‚Äôm 100% straight, but I usually wouldn‚Äôt care if anyone thought that I was gay anyways, however my parents keep making snide comments and treating me differently. 




When I first started improving myself, I focused on growing my hair out and improving the look of the acne on my face. My parents consider long hair to be feminine and so does most of the older black community. I‚Äôve gotten multiple comments from my parents, church members, random people in public (that are always older black people btw), and even my sorta girlfriend‚Äôs mom about how I should cut my hair.  My bathroom counter is also lined with the products I use and rivals the counter tops of every woman I know. My parents don‚Äôt feel too great about that.







Ever since my hair has started growing longer, I‚Äôve had to take a bit longer to take care of it. To remedy this, I use the bathroom when it‚Äôs historically never being used to take care of my hair and skin such as when everyone else goes to bed. I even tried waking up later than everyone else in the morning to make sure that I get the bathroom when everyone else is already ready to go out the door for their daily activities. I‚Äôve noticed my parents shifting their bathroom times to collide with mine, often by literal hours, and then throw a bitch fit about how feminine I am when they don‚Äôt get to use the bathroom. I did a two-week test to confirm my suspicions and absolutely destroyed my sleep schedule in the process to confirm my suspicions and I was right. One time I put in earbuds and set an alarm for 2 AM to get the bathroom to take care of my hair and my dad coincidentally got up at the same time and raised hell outside the door when he couldn‚Äôt use the bathroom. Even more ironically, there is a bathroom in the master bedroom. 






I bought a blow dryer last week to be able to better manage my hair. Blow dryers are often exclusively used by females in the black community. When my parents heard me using it, they went crazy and I‚Äôm 200% sure I heard my dad call me a faggot. 






I also suffer from gynecomastia. It‚Äôs the development of tissue under the nipple during puberty caused by hormone imbalances. The first time I became self-conscious about it was when my dad saw me shirtless while I was doing stuff around the house and said that I was growing women breasts and it was caused by all the products I put in my hair. I tried going to the gym to try and reduce it but all that did was increase the muscle mass in my chest and I learned later that the only cure for gynecomastia is surgically removing the tissue. Didn‚Äôt help that I was playing high school soccer at the time and couldn‚Äôt go shirtless because the one time I did, I got called ‚Äúpepperoni nipples‚Äù lmao. At least it made me go to the gym, now my physique looks pretty nice and I‚Äôm indeed getting surgery to get them removed pretty soon. 






What annoys me most of all is the way they behaved last week. I hung out with the sorta girlfriend I mentioned earlier for nearly the entirety of Thursday last week. I told my dad what I was going to be doing and going and since my mom was at work, I told him to relay the information to her. When I came back home later in the day, my mom was livid. Apparently my dad hadn‚Äôt relayed the info to her and when she called him to find out where I was, he said that he had no idea. I know it was bullshit because I made him repeat what I said back to me when I told him that I had plans and I made sure that he wasn‚Äôt busy with anything. My mom automatically assumed that I was out with a bunch of dudes and said that ‚ÄúI must have been hanging out with a girl because there was no possible way I should have been out that ling hanging out with a bunch of guys‚Äù. I tried to tell her that she was right but she never let me say anything. I think that she said that because a few months ago, her and a few other church ladies went out to dinner and the subject of their sons‚Äô love lives came up and she told me that she didn‚Äôt have anything to say. She then told me to get my act together. Both her and my dad also make it a game to ‚Äújokingly‚Äù ask me when I‚Äôm ever going to get a girlfriend or why I never show up to the house with a girl.








I don‚Äôt know what to do. Every time I‚Äôm around my parents, they make some off hand comment about how only girls have long hair or how only girls own so many products or how no girl will want a guy that‚Äôs as feminine as me or some variation of the three. Any time I show anything that they perceive to be as weakness, they start with the girl jokes. They do stuff to inconvenience me like taking my products off my counter top and jokingly hiding it in other places but other times they do meaner shit like calling me homophobic slurs when they think I can‚Äôt hear them or referring to me by those slurs, also when they think I can‚Äôt hear them or talking shit about me to family members, which has fucked my reputation among my extended family. I used to be the life of our family reunion parties and used to make it a point to call my my favorite relatives at least once a month to catch up but they all started slowly distancing themselves and now I don‚Äôt even go to family reunions anymore because the people who used to love me act like they don‚Äôt know me and I always end up in a corner eating by myself at least within 30 minutes of arrival. I used to be tight with a cousin since we were both kids, but he slowly started avoiding me and when I finally caught him and asked him why he was acting like that, he told me an lie about growing apart but then came back later and told me that it was because his mom said not to talk to me. My parents also have developed a nasty habit of disguising the femininity jabs as jokes when I‚Äôm around my friends and now my friends are starting to joke more and more about how feminine I am. I told them once that I don‚Äôt appreciate it but they took it as a sign of weakness and continued with the feminine jokes. I never had a problem like this until my parents introduced them to it. I honestly have no idea what to do anymore.",07Dec2019,1

181,"A little background. I'm from a poor family and I have an aunt with grown kids that has a bunch of excess money.

So she was helping me with college and sending money. She sometimes I took a few days to call her to say thanks when she did but it pissed her off and she stopped. I really did appreciate the money and call me ungrateful but I did not like being in dept to my aunt deep down.

She steps over my mother and talks down to her alot. She tried it with my brother and now they are on bad terms and my sister who lived with her father's side (different dads) pretty much saw her personality as kinda bs and just got vibes to avoid her. 

Saying thanks to her was made out to be a big deal. It felt less like she was trying to help me out and more like she wanted me to kiss up to her so I felt really reluctant. She very often expressed that we should learn to show gratitude so people would help us out and for some reason that felt wrong to me. I'm all for showing gratitude but I'm not into maintaining a relationship to get stuff from people. I actually do still call her despite the fact she doesn't help with school anymore. I feel less pressure since I don't feel obligated.

184,"Only reason I haven't posted this on r/legaladvice is that I never get responses to my questions there. I typically get better responses here even though this is more of a legal question.

So, this now ex-friend, we will call her M, offered to let me buy her car. We agreed on $2500, I had $1200 I could put down immediately. So, I did. Stupidly.

Now, I was also staying with this friend temporarily. Shit happens with her and I'm at the point I'm fearing for my life. I tell her I want my money back (this is a day later) and I want to be taken to a bus stop ASAP. She refuses, says she can't give the money back because she spent it. I tell her fine, then give me the car. She says since I didn't pay her the full $2500 I don't get her car.

I find my way back home without her, without the car, and without my money. Its been 3 weeks now and I'm still in a battle with her over my money. I have threatened the police on her ass and she says the best she can do is pay me $125 every week until its paid off.
Today was supposed to be payment 1 of the $1200 (after 3 negotiations) and shes ghosted me. Will not respond to my messages. I'm sick of dealing with her lying ass and I want to get the law involved. I tried playing nice but its obvious she doesn't respond to nice.

What I have are many Facebook and text messages of her promising she will pay me the full $1200 back, in segments, first if $250 and now segments of $125. I won't be surprised if she hits me with ""I can pay $20 a week but thats it.""

Anyone have any advice on how to move forward?",07Dec2019,1
185,"Hi all, I need some advice with my current job. I am a full time student and my ""part time"" job as a nanny is able to cover my  expenses. Let me begin by saying... I LOVE the girls I babysit. I have been nannying for this family for two years... Its close to my house and the money is enough. Unfortunately since I have matured and grown I have been able to recognize that I am being taken advantage of daily at this job.  These girls are taken care of... I make them lunch, bathe them, blow dry their hair, take them places, do crafts and buy things for them. I put a lot of energy into making sure they are taken care of, and cleaned up after , and thats the description of a nanny right? Not here. I pick up her groceries, style her hair, take care of her returns, pick up contacts, pictures, birthday gifts, cook her dinners, and fold their laundry and organize and rearrange their house... To name a few extra things. I make $11 an hour for two kids and I don't get paid holidays. Im punctual, I always stay late, and her house is always clean when I leave. She pays me through Venmo, and I always am reminding her of payday. Tonight was real eye opener. I had a drop in my hours and obviously it hurt me financially. I have been very patient and stretching every dollar until my payday (today) I stayed late, and sent her my hours on my way out. An hour and a half later, she texts me telling me that her card on her Venmo expired and I have to wait until tomorrow, because she left her wallet on the way to a Christmas party. I have bills to pay and feel as if there is always an excuse. I really love the girls and the extended family and have been very blessed with this job, but I need advice on what to do from here and how you would handle this situation. Thank you!",07Dec2019,1

192,"My dad has the habit of manspreading but not with his legs wide apart on an empty row of seats. Rather, if we're sitting next to each other in an enclosed place, like a plane, baseball stadium, etc he will move his leg over to get more room but then his leg will be on me and I won't have any room. Other times he crosses one leg over the other and again his foot is in my space. I understand that there's not much room in these situations, but him taking up the little space that I have isn't fair to me, especially because I'm a little claustrophobic. So I nicely ask him to take his foot off me or move his leg over. I've been doing this for decades but still never snap at him even though it's annoying to me and he should know by now. He used to just listen without reacting, but lately he's been scoffing, rolling his eyes, and making a scene when I ask him.

One time recently when I asked him nicely to move his foot he rolled his eyes, scoffed and loudly exclaimed that there isn't much room and then he got up and moved somewhere else and was really irritated. At least that time he could move, but that's not always the case like on planes or sold-out events we sometimes go to. Today it happened again, and he scoffed, rolled his eyes and then referred to me as ""demanding."" This was around people we knew and I was embarrassed but I didn't react since I want to be the bigger person.

Am I being unreasonable? If I am being reasonable, what can I say to him? I haven't said anything at the time it happens so I don't make a bigger scene and haven't said anything in private because I don't want to cause more drama and I have a feeling the conversation won't go well. I'm really fed up now and honestly don't want to go places with him where we need to sit next to each other, which could pretty much be anywhere.

Hey, not sure where else to go with this. Just to precursor this, I have already filed a police report, and am waiting to see how that goes.

So, I run a sneaker reselling page. I am constantly buying / selling rare / hype sneakers that are hard to come by, and high in demand. Along with this hustle comes the underlying risk of fakes / replica sneakers. A local seller messaged me with a stock list, and we got straight to running numbers. Had dealt with the guy very briefly in the past, and had no reason to think he wasn't genuine. He had pretty standard prices, nothing crazy, but we eventually negotiated down to a price we were both happy with. Seller guaranteed all shoes are authentic, and showed me ""receipts"" (turned out to be fake as well

Fast forward a week, I drive 6 hours from Toronto to Montreal to complete the deal. The seller took me inside what appeared to be his home, and allowed me to look over the products before handing over any cash. This is where blame falls on me. Being the overly excited guy I am, I quickly ran through the pairs, double checked a few key ways to legit check, then brought him outside to count out the $12,000 cash without really thinking twice. I mean SURELY this guy isn't scamming me right? He brought me in his house! Let me pet his cat!.... WRONG

On the way back home, had some car troubles and had to be towed and spent the night at a hotel. This is when I first had some concerns about the authenticity of them. I immediately messaged the seller, and he quickly responded, reassuring me that all was well, and that I had nothing to worry about. He urged me to go to a consignment store and pay for legit checks, which i ended up doing (later on in story). So, I went to bed, woke up the next morning, and made my way back home in Toronto.

Upon getting home, I posted the pairs on some facebook groups to get some more opinions and at first, I got no replies. Then slowly, but surely, the ""Fake, because..."" and ""Replica because..."" comments started rolling in. FURTHERMORE, upon disclosing WHO i bought the pairs off of, it turns out he is a known scammer, and is a classic story of ""Good guy, gone bad"" Again, more blame on me, I know I should have done this prior to meetup, but hindsight is always 20/20.

The very next day, I took the pairs to a consignment shop to get some official, paid-for legit checks that I made sure to record live. Comes back that all of the shoes are indeed high quality replicas, and WERE NOT the authentics that I was promised, and under the impression of buying. So, with my knowledge of the seller being a previous scammer, and having recorded evidence the shoes being fake, I filed a police report with the local Montreal police. I was told I would be contacted within 7-10 days.

So there I was, trunk full of fake shoes, -$12,000, heavy heart and stirring anger / sadness. Today I decided to reach out to the seller and give him one last chance to be a decent guy, and avoid the hassle that is surely coming his way. He is insisting the pairs, and that me and the consignment store are both ""f\*cked in the head"". Lovely.

Long story short , I have evidence of:

The meetup happening, the amount, the shoes being fake, him ""guaranteeing"" authenticity, etc.

I have info of:

The address he met me at (supposed home), his name, phone number, place of work, face, and social medias, names of owner of property, family names etc.

I realistically want to know what I can do legally in this position. If you read this far, thank you. Have never been this stressed / down due to financial reasons EVER in my life, and really looking for some guidance. Willing to go the route of small claims, but curious to know if you guys have any other advice. Thanks reddit.

P.S. this is NOT an isolated incident. The seller has scammed people for amounts between $3,000 - $5,000 in the past, none of which are really large enough for proper legal action. I have been in touch with the victims of those scams and collecting as much info as possible.",07Dec2019,1

I am very confused about this matter and I will try to sum it up as briefly as possible.

I am an 18 yr old male in college living with an 18 yr old male (gay) roommate. I am unsure of my sexuality whether I am straight or bisexual. I have been living with this roommate for 2.5 months. I have noticed him asking me to do ‚Äúcomforting‚Äù things for him and I haven‚Äôt rejected (nothing sexual), such as back massages etc. I noticed that he was giving me extra attention, or to put it blandly he had a crush on me. After he got drunk a few times he tried to kiss me and I rejected. I later told him that I‚Äôm very uncomfortable with that. He apologized and nothing happened after that because we got winter break (except the usual hugs). I was not mean or strict or uptight, I kept it casual and super nice. I don‚Äôt know if he really got the memo that I‚Äôm not interested at all. We‚Äôre not very close but we do have deep convos. I don‚Äôt know how to feel. I am slightly worried about sleeping in the same room with him. It could be all in my head but what if he does something bad to me in my sleep or the crush doesn‚Äôt die away. Should I ask for a roommate switch? Should I make it MORE clear how uninterested and uncomfortable I am with this? How do I approach the matter.

210,"So, here‚Äôs my story.

Just earlier tonight (it‚Äôs been about 6 hours), me and my friend were just hanging out, as we often in the center of my town.

The sun had already went down, and it was getting increasingly darker, so we decided to go to a nearby restaurant to get some food, also so we could be somewhere with heating and lighting (New York is a dark, cold place to be).

Then, as we were walking in, we saw a particular crowd of people walk in with us.

I‚Äôm in high school, and these were, for a lack of better terms, the ‚Äúcool kids.‚Äù The group kids I get my weed from, the group of kids that get into fights, and the group of kids that get into frequent and brutal fights to assert ‚Äúbadassness,‚Äù and sometimes, they would flaunt their involvement in gangs, as well as with equally intimidating people. One of these people I was once hanging out with in just the 7th grade brought me face to face with an Uzi-toting Mexican drug dealer, and I don‚Äôt even know if I can say that‚Äôs the worst of it.

But they‚Äôre also the group of kids that have so many loyal, thrilling friends and connections. They‚Äôre the group of kids that live the high life everyday‚Äî partying, sneaking out at night with their huge squads of good friends, having as many friends as someone could have, and having everything any high schooler could possibly ask for. They‚Äôre massively respected, valued, validated, they‚Äôre never lonely, and oftentimes chronically stoned. To them, everyone else is just noise, and they rule the world. And socially, they‚Äôre completely right.

Obviously, these were exactly the type of people I tried to make my way into.

I never really knew which group I belonged to. In early 7th grade, I started hanging out with these kids, doing what they do, going to parties they did, smoking the things they smoke, but I was always kept at arms length for whatever reason. This story is an example of that.

So, me and my friend began to hang out with these kids after we ate. Then, I remembered, I had some weed in my duffel bag, and these kids were out of it.

One of the girls in the group wanted some, so she put some of mine in a bowl and puffed away for a little bit.

Then, out of nowhere, one of the guys in the group discretely stole the weed. When I asked him what he was doing with it, he casually said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not getting it back‚Äù, as if I have no rights to my own shit. I, bewildered, told him it was my weed and I needed it back.

To this, he snapped back ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs on probation, I told you not to smoke with her, I‚Äôm taking this so you‚Äôre not gonna do it again.‚Äù

There are several issues with this. One, I barely knew the girl, and her being on probation was neither in my knowledge nor my problem. Two, he never said not to smoke with her.

I grabbed the weed back quickly, and he fucking lost it for a second. He pushed and hit me away from him and lunged back for the weed, which he didn‚Äôt get. Soon enough, his friend, with absolutely no knowledge of what was going on, began to repeat EXACTLY what he was saying to me, and he joined in on the antagonization. They were both trying to fight me physically, with no regard for logic, fairness, nor anything except seeming ‚Äúhood‚Äù and ‚Äútough.‚Äù I hit back at him only verbally, trying to tell them how stupid this was and how I needed the remainder of the weed back, and I wasn‚Äôt going to go away.

I got what I needed, and started to withdraw with my friend on our bikes, but I never had the thought on my mind to run away. I knew this people, and I knew the only way to prevent future incidents is to stand up for yourself firmly, whether you avoid the fight or not.

I circled further and further away from them on the street while still exchanging words. They told me I was a pussy for not fighting them. I responded by saying that I could beat him easy if I wanted to, but he wasn‚Äôt worth my time, bruises, nor effort. Basically, I wasn‚Äôt a pussy, but rather contemptful, was what I tried to get at.

Then, as I got was just about ready to leave, the main guy got hotheaded and chased straight after me at Usain Bolt speed while I struggled to get away from him on my bike into an alleyway. Then, his other friend came over and started running.

As I went back out from the alleyway, I had to swerve both of them trying to knock me over as I rode my bike as fast as I could, and one of them kicked the spokes, popping the chain out of place, so it became me coasting slightly downhill with my speed decreasing.

Then, to our relief, two big guys smoking cigarettes on their front porch told the other guys off, from the comfort of their porch, telling them that they didn‚Äôt want to make them ‚Äúcome down there.‚Äù

Once I passed the porch guys, my friend, and the now-departed adversaries, I almost broke down a little. Not because I had almost been in a fight nor because I was scared and overwhelmed of the situation, that was far from true. It was because these kids represented the kind of lifestyle, friends, and anything any kid ever wished for, and I‚Äôd never be part of it, and it had something to intrinsically do with me. I, for whatever reason, don‚Äôt deserve the perfect kind of lifestyle they live, and and I don‚Äôt deserve the kind of loyalty and respect they have for each other. They see me as a constant outsider, which is why they treat me like this.

I never let people push me around, I‚Äôve been in plenty of fights, but I never wanted to be in those fights. These are people I considered my friends, and at times good friends, and they switch on me so quickly and crudely, which ends up in me needing to fight them. And almost every single time, they arrive with their big squads of people, armed with knives as well, if they anticipated the fight. Me though? It was just me, myself, I. Every. Single.

I wish I knew why I never saw acceptance. I wish I knew why I was considered a constant outsider. Sure, I can just not care about them and forget they exist, taking the high road, but the high road is evidently a very lonely place to be.

I am an 18 year old male in my first year of community college. There is this girl who is a year younger than me that I really like. She is going to a college out of town. That college is pretty good for the major that I plan on pursuing but there is another college that I could attend that is slightly better for my major. I am planning on transferring to the community college near the school that she is going to go to and transfer to that college after.

I have a problem with what other people think of me. I‚Äôm almost 21 and have struggled In social settings since I can remember. Today at work, (flipping burgers because it pays well $15/hr)  I was constantly worried about what these people that are a lot more successful than I am. What do they think of people like me, who am I?  I know I‚Äôm smart but there is just something in my brain that doesn‚Äôt connect. It‚Äôs felt like hitting a permanent wall that I can‚Äôt get across.  

I have had a fucked up child-hood. Foster care at 2 almost adopted at 4. What happened there is the man that would adopt me and my brother had a brain aneurysm and could no longer take us. Back into foster care until 6 years of age. I am blessed to have the family now but the result of being through 15 different homes in that span obviously took its tolls, especially with it happening in my most critical years of growing up. 

I‚Äôm not giving up, or at least I‚Äôm on my last leg. I want to succeed more than anything but my brain is fuzzed up. Maybe it‚Äôs easily doable and I‚Äôm not dedicating enough energy to it. This isn‚Äôt a cry for help, I‚Äôve been worse, I just wanted to open up and see if anyone would read this and offer advice. I‚Äôve always wanted a support system but damn is it hard to build at my age.",07Dec2019,1
221,"This is going to be a bit chaotic, but I‚Äôll split it into parts. 

To begin, I have an alcoholic father who was diagnosed with cancer about 10 years ago and has major PTSD from the war and various police work. He‚Äôs been majorly struggling since he was diagnosed with cancer (he‚Äôs beaten it now though). I‚Äôm only 16, but i‚Äôve had to mature very quickly because of my situation. I‚Äôm not going to go into detail about the things i‚Äôve had to do. 

Somewhere along this timeline, I think about a hear ago, I was diagnosed with anorexia.  I got to a very dangerously low weight and it was recommended that I was put into the hospital, but I stayed at home and healed myself. I find that I am very against external help, as I refuse to go to therapy in any form.   Since about this time, it‚Äôs been very hard for me to eat in front of other people.  I ate lunch in the bathroom at school for a while, and actually just started eating at the lunch table with my friends again. Well, I thought they were my friends, but we‚Äôll get into that later. 

Let‚Äôs fast forward to about 2 weeks ago- my dad went into the hospital to detox for what seems like the 1000th time, and relapsed a few days after discharge. Fast forward to last Monday- he came over (he lives in an apartment now because my family and I couldn‚Äôt handle him drinking here, we didn‚Äôt feel safe) and we had a really good day. Then, about two hours after he got back to his apartment, my mom tells me to try and call my dad and convince him to go back to his apartment because he had begun to drive here (he didn‚Äôt have any mal intentions, but it‚Äôs scary to be around him when he‚Äôs intoxicated).  This was about a month after he finally got his license back after a long suspension from a DWI. So he drives here, mills around and plows on his tractor for a while, then parks it right in front of my mom‚Äôs car. Then, he parks his truck in front of my sister‚Äôs car, so we‚Äôre blocked in. He then went to sleep in his truck. This whole time, my family and I were absolutely freaking out. We didn‚Äôt know what was going to happen to him or someone else, as we couldn‚Äôt stop him from using so much machinery.  We wanted to call the police, but knew that he would get his license taken away again, and it‚Äôs very important for him to have it so that he can get to AA meetings and doctors appointments. At some point, my mom decides to call the police and they come escort him from our house.  His friend took him in for the night. The next morning, we had a good talk all together, and he‚Äôs been doing good since then. But, my mom and I are extremely mentally, emotionally and physically drained. I have always gotten my school work done on time, and I don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve done any this week.

Ok, so now we‚Äôre going to talk about school. I have a close group of 3 girl friends, then about 8 or so guy friends that are in our friend group. I‚Äôve always kind of felt like i‚Äôm only in the group because i‚Äôm so close to my 3 girl friends. Also, I left school for half a year because of my eating disorder.  
In November, one of my guy friends had his bday party- this was the first party that i‚Äôve ever been to that had drinking and smoking. Everyone there participated except for me- i‚Äôm really not interested because of all i‚Äôve been through with my dad. So, I find out today that another one of my guy friends, who has the same birthday as me, is inviting every person in my friend group to his bday party except for me. I understand that it may be because I don‚Äôt want to drink, but seriously, every single person in our group except for me? Do guys even think about how that would make someone else feel? I already felt like absolute shit because of what I talked about earlier and more, and this was just the icing on the cake. Also, all of my absolute best friends, those 3 girls, don‚Äôt say anything? Like, do they just not care about me? I feel so alone and like nobody likes me. I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

Nobody at school really knows about my situation at home. I already feel like such an outcast. I‚Äôm a little awkward and don‚Äôt talk to the boys as much as my friends. I just feel so lost and unwanted. I‚Äôm not sure what to do.  Please, if you have any insight, leave me a comment.",07Dec2019,1

224,"I'm 19 and a sophomore in college. I have a 26 year old flatmate who I used to love very much. She's really cool, and a fun person to be with but I've been having issues with her since the begining. She talks a lot, and I mean a LOT, and after a year of loneliness in my dorm freshman year, I welcomed it. But, it became a problem (I usually like to be quiet and left alone). She also used to make me cook for her, and never even attempts to clean the apartment or throw out the trash. 

And I'm okay with all that. However, the temperature in the house is a big issue. She comes from a very tropical and hot place like me, but I've been in the cold for a year so I don't mind it. In summer, we started off at 80 F (even that seemed to be cold for her) to 76 F and frankly I can't handle the heat. But I gave her time to adjust. I bought a personal fan, wore shorts around the house and slept on top of the sheets too. I've tried to reason with her many times, that I've done everything I can and I'm still hot, and I suggested she try wearing socks and a light jacket in the house till she gets used to the cold. But no. Straight up no.

I offered to keep it at 73 F, even though I prefer 71 F,  but she fought me over it, and I had to give up. After a while, I started getting headaches due to the heat, had enough and I wrote her a long text message, and not gonna lie it was a bit harsh but I was so angry! Then, we had a big argument where she called me very mean things, one of which was that I'm a hormonal, pmsing teenager, and I sounded very selfish in that message like many teenagers at this age do, and that the whole world has to revolve around me. That honestly makes me so mad because I've always been independent and never let personal emotions/ problems get in the way of making any important decisions.

It's been over a month since the argument and the temperature is at 74 F (like she wanted), and we're not talking to each other. At this point, it's not even about the temperature I feel (even though I'm still uncomfortable), I just want to know if I overreacted with the text I sent her, and how do I let go of this anger towards her uncompromising nature? 

Also, she bought a personal heater now but the temperature is still at 74. How should I approach her to change it now?

PS. I'm sorry if it's too long, but this has mentally disturbed me for a while now. I appreciate any help!",07Dec2019,1
226,"I was sitting in my car on a drive home to celebrate Thanksgiving with my family in TN. While I was sitting in bumper to bumper traffic on I-65 S just south of Louisville, a semi-truck in front of me started rolling backwards. I popped my car in neutral and rolled back as far as I could without hitting the car behind me and held down the horn praying this guy would stop before he hit my car.

 Unfortunately for me, he backed right into me (I have no clue why he was even backing up.) then he promptly pulled forward and started to drive away without recognizing that he hit my car. I turned on my hazards, (I was not able to get onto the shoulder as at this point as we‚Äôre still in a traffic jam.) and looked next to me to see two of the nicest dudes I have ever encountered on a Interstate. They rolled their window down, and asked if he just hit my car. I told them best I could in my anxious-angry-panic that he did, and these guys worked there way up traffic and forced him off the road in their car. Now at this point I was on the phone with a 911 operator and was describing everything that happened as I thought this guy was just not going to stop. 

  I can not be thankful enough for these guys for stopping him. However, they unfortunately never stopped and I could not get their information.  The truck driver came out, I informed him that I had already been on the phone with the police. It took 2 hours for an officer to show up, and by that point him and I had already traded information. The LEO filed a report gave us our information, and sent us on our way. 

  Now this is where I get worried, and have questions. When I viewed the report online he lied in his story and said that I hit him and that he felt it. Which is a lie. While swapping information he admitted to me he just didn‚Äôt feel it hit my car and just started driving.  Now the damage done to my car is not horrible, it just broke a carbon fiber front piece and scratched the front bumper from his Underride guard, but it‚Äôs nothing I can afford to pay for as a student.

   What are my best options? How likely am I to get screwed over in this? Can the 911 call be used as evidence against this so I can get my car fixed?

But I'm struggling lately with some new kids with serious issues with authority. I give them instructions (usually to quiet down or stop being rude to other kids, but often for more aggressive and potentially dangerous behavior) and they just wholesale ignore me. I give them appropriate warnings, offer them alternatives to their behaviors, and ultimately threaten negative consequences.

I can tutor, I'm good at mathematics, reading, writing, and science, but I have tried to establish a presence in my neighboorhood and outside, but no one is interested - I've asked my parent to ask their friends and acquaintances - I've asked, friends, relatives, everyone about these things, and no one is interested. 

So I turned to what I thought would be my saving grace - freelance work! So I turned to [freelancer.com](https://freelancer.com) and other sites - but there's one issue. No one is stupid enough to hire an inexperienced young teenager. I may know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript well, be an excellent writer, anything! But no one wants to hire a beginner. I know it takes time, but I think after a year of trying for different projects it's getting ridiculous. I long for some sort of financial independence. I am a musician, programmer, and (beginner) writer, I've tried all sorts of different things - but again and again, it ends up nowhere. And, yes I have worked on games and they almost never get finished - I have had some success with asking friends if they want things like background music on their videos, but that's pretty much it. 

I have tried SO MANY other things besides freelance work, I have looked at so many other opportunities and they have all failed miserably. I'm quite honestly getting pissed - no, I won't take 'wait until you're old enough' because I want money, and I want to work on getting some cash to help out my family and save some for myself. 

Anyone, please, help, literally anything.",07Dec2019,1
253,"My best friend (Bill) and I have been friends for as long as I can remember. We grew up in the same small town and both played in the band. He is one year older than I am so he went off to college this past year while I‚Äôm still in high school. We are, or were really close before this entire situation spiraled out of control. 

Bill had been in a relationship with a girl, let‚Äôs call her Liz, for a few months. They broke up this fall because Bill went off to college and they didn‚Äôt want to mess with long distance. She is still in high school with me and we have a lot in common. We both sing in the choir and have a lot of the same interests. Long story short we started talking and we both developed feelings for each other.

I knew that this would cause some sort of reaction out of Bill, so I called him up and asked him if what we were doing was ok. He said that he had no problem with it. 

A few hours later Liz calls me crying saying Bill told her that he can‚Äôt stand the thought of Liz being with me. I called up Bill and asked him for his honest opinion, and he told me that he can‚Äôt control my life but that he felt weird about all of it. I fired back that I really want to see where Liz and I go. He hasn‚Äôt responded since. 

I‚Äôm so lost right now and don‚Äôt know what to do. Bill‚Äôs friendship means everything to me, but I also really do have an interest in Liz. I could really some advice on what I should do next. Pls help!",07Dec2019,1
254,"This is gonna be a LONG post but to make a long story short: my grandmas daughter (my aunt) is literally killing her.

I‚Äôll just say my name is M. My aunts name is B. B and I were born the same year and we grew up together since my mom was a teen mother. B has always been a bad person, even when we were just kids. She‚Äôd break things, steal, and then blame everyone else for it. B is the youngest of my grandmas kids. My grandma has my mom (39) my uncle (30) my aunt (26) and B (21), then there‚Äôs me, also 21. My grandma is 55. I basically lived with my granny because my mom worked three jobs most of my life. My granny has worked nights since before I was born and still does. 

B and I were always ‚Äúfriends‚Äù up until senior year. But even before then, I started to hate her. She was a mess. When we were around age 12, she started having sex. The first guy she snuck claimed he was 25, but looking back he obviously wasn‚Äôt. He had gray facial hair and just looked... old. She continued this behavior, constantly pulling me into it and getting us in trouble. I wasn‚Äôt an angel myself, but to be fair, at that age I was a really weird kid. I was highly obsessed with anime and I had a Facebook page where my name was Neliel (from Bleach). For the most part, I tried to stay under my other aunt because she was a bookworm. But B always wanted to do bad things. B started drinking and smoking when we were in 7th grade. She constantly defied her mother/my granny. I didn‚Äôt care too much, until her actions harmed me. 

I was only 13 (or possibly still 12) and she invited a bunch of high schoolers over (17+) Now mind you while all of this is happening, my aunt was and still is a bookworm and plays computer games. She never heard a thing and at that age she couldn‚Äôt stand being around us. My uncle was never home. So she disappears outside with one of the guys, telling me to relax and have fun. I tried. But it didn‚Äôt feel right. I decided to go outside and lay on the trampoline to get away from everyone. 2 of the guys followed me. 

I was so ruined. I hated her and till this day she pretends like it never happened. My mom and my grandma got into a fight, and my grandma use to think that I was always the bad influence. Or any of our friends for that matter. But it was never B fault. B continued doing these things, getting arrested, smoking, skipping school, underage drinking, sneaking older men in, etc literally everything bad you could think of. Fast forward to senior year of high school. The past is the past. Our friend that had lived on and off with my granny for the past 5 yrs, D, and I are more than aware of how troublesome B is. My poor granny still in denial. B has a 1yr old kid now, never ever saw the father. B disappears for weeks, leaving me, D, and grandma with the baby. And since we had school during the day, granny would have to stay up even though she has to work at night. 

Graduation is about a month away now, I had been accepted into a ton of colleges and received about 15k in scholarships. B had missed so much school over the yrs, she was still technically a sophomore. She had 5+ classes to take in credit recovery. I was 17, she was 18. Our school counselor told her all she had to do was come to school those last couple weeks before graduation and she‚Äôs graduate. Ngl this annoyed me a bit, I had been an AP student since 9th grade and worked my ass off so that I could graduate with honors and in the top 10%. She literally just breezed by. Easy way to graduate right! But instead of showing up to school, she disappeared to another city for 2weeks. When we had graduation practice, she showed up but was confused when the counselor pulled her to the side. She was angry and so mad at the world. I went on to graduate and went to a school out of state.

My friend D tells me that B is telling everyone how bad of a person I am, and how i told everyone she was jealous of me. At that time, I had never even thought that because to be frank, I thought she was pathetic and wouldn‚Äôt even waste my time talking about her. She was a dropout with a 2yr old no job or anything going for herself. I forgot to mention but i had a hard time keeping relationships because somehow... she fucked everyone I dated on accident. These kind of things continue happening and she still does the same ole same ole. I got engaged my sophomore yr of college. She was livid. She shared so many shady posts on fb and even posted something along the lines of ‚Äúppl love to act brand new.‚Äù I deleted her. My granny tells me she started dating some 35 yr old who has 3 kids by different women that he doesn‚Äôt take care of. D, also has a kid now, but is also engaged and moved to the city for a better life for her baby. Life is good. I visit my grandma the following summer and I hadn‚Äôt seen her since I graduated HS. She looked liked she was aging, but boy was I in for a surprise.

Fast forwarding to now, I went to my home state for the first time in 2 yrs. I‚Äôm married, just turned 21, and graduating college next semester with 2 degrees. Im moving out of country next year. I‚Äôm happy. Until I got home. My grandma is only 55, and the last time I saw her she was 53. She looked 65. Her face was so wrinkled and her lips were thinning, her bags were horrible, my god she just looked so old. My grandma is the youngest of 4, with my great aunt actually being 65 and she looked younger than my granny. B had another kid with that old man who doesn‚Äôt even take care of the first ones, and is now living with B in my granny‚Äôs house, not paying any bills whatsoever. My granny works at a department store and doesn‚Äôt make a lot. And not only is she paying her own bills, she‚Äôs taking care of FOUR ppl. B still disappears and leaves the kids with my granny. My granny cried, I had never seen her cry before. She said she knows that B doesn‚Äôt love or care about her and is using, but she doesn‚Äôt have the heart to do anything about it. She‚Äôs too sweet. She cried and told me she was sorry for not believing me when we were younger. My heart broke into a million pieces. My poor granny. She only did what she thought was right and I told her it wasn‚Äôt her fault. I told her I loved her so much and she just cried.

Everyone in the family is aware of the situation, but no one has a clue on what to do. My granny‚Äôs mental health is deteriorating, and she‚Äôs always in pain somewhere in her body because she never rests. Because of her current situation, she works month on end with no day off. She declared bankruptcy earlier this year because the hospital sued her (apparently she signed agreeing to pay for her surgery in x amount each month but like I said her mental health is deteriorating... she had no memory of signing said papers. And it‚Äôs not like she has the money either). B and her joke of a fianc√© knows all of this, they fucking live with her. But instead of giving her some money to help, or at least clean up ( my husband and I did majority of the cleaning because for some reason my granny was cleaning everything.. literally) they just sit on their got damn asses all day. They smoke, drink, leave the kids at home, bring all kinds of ppl over (my granny has been robbed several times since we were younger because of the company B brings around) and dirty the place up. 

Also to mention, B told her old man fianc√© and his family that my granny abused her and locked her inside when we were younger. That she was a good kid and the reason she didn‚Äôt graduate was because our granny would make her stay home to watch her baby. My granny never did any of those things. Yes she disciplined us and took our phones etc because we were BAD. Especially B. She was horrible. But everything my granny did was to protect us and I‚Äôm so thankful for that. I wouldn‚Äôt be the person I am today without my granny. I would probably be exactly like B. To make matters worse, The old man fianc√© and his family spread rumors all over town about my granny, creating even more stress.


No one knows what to do. Is there anything we can do? My granny is literally dying because she‚Äôs overworked and over stressed. My heart hurts so much thinking of how bad she looked and just how bad things are right now for her. My granny use to be the garden lady of our little town, giving away free fruits and veggies. Now, you can‚Äôt even tell a garden use to exist. My other aunt and I both live out of state but try our best to help her out as much as possible. Her sisters as well. But nothing is giving. My mom is moving back to our home state in hopes to help but I know that‚Äôs not enough.

What can we do? Is there anything we can do about this situation? I literally want to cry every day now because I‚Äôm so worried about my grandma. She shouldn‚Äôt have to suffer like this.

She drinks way too much and says that it helps her feel less depressed but I‚Äôve just noticed that it quite literally makes her more sad every time she does it. Anyways, she is friends with this couple and apparently, they asked her for a threesome back in the summer to which she said no. She‚Äôs still friends with them though and goes to see them on a regular basis. Now since I just moved to her city, I am currently trying to find a new job. So tonight I go with her dad to pick her up from work after not really getting to do anything all day. I was super excited to see her but she barely spoke to us once she got in the car and instead went on her phone and asks her dad if he can drive us to the house of which her friends who asked her for a threesome live. Now I know I should trust my girlfriend, but since these people constantly get her black out drunk and have asked her for a threesome before, this makes me really uncomfortable. So we pull up to their house and I tell my girlfriend that if she wants to go, she can hang out with them, but that I just want to go back home and so I did. Now she thinks I‚Äôm mad at her...but I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm just wary. Should I bring this up to her? I don‚Äôt want her to think I don‚Äôt trust her and I also don‚Äôt want her to get defensive because she usually does. I just do not trust these people.

I almost refunded the game but I saw something special in it. A week later my friend and I start playing it together and we really liked it, the "" Main Menu and soundtrack was the Para Bellum theme, a really nice Italian themed operation that changed to a depressing England theme like two weeks later, anyways I played with my friend until somewhere by the end of November, where he quit and played ONLY terrorist hunt ( you vs ai bots ) for the next 3 months until the end of February. I played multiplayer solo and playing terrorist hunt with him daily but I was burnt out, I lost that hype and happiness to play r6 siege. By the end of February we switched to bo4 which I hated but a few months later I came back to R6 Siege and I really liked it, it was as if I almost and if not returned that hype feeling of playing r6 siege, played it till midway September then got sick of it again, I noticed as if I will never return to those Autumn days of being a noob and playing on Old Hereford ( map which they removed ) and listen to para bellum... played it on and off for the past 2-3 months, and now I just dont know how to love this game anymore, that's why I came here.

262,"So I have a girlfriend, very happily in love, baby on the way. So I bumped into a girl on a game and got curious as to what she looks like. Added her on Snapchat and exchanged selfies (totally innocent imo). She thinks I'm super hot and is being flirty, however, I've spent a good 3 hours chatting to her because she's in great need with self harm and other personal problems. I've helped her overcome this for today.. I never mentioned I have girlfriend and I'm now in an awkward position.. 

I feel like if I tell her she's going to self harm, maybe more than before. I feel like if I don't tell her, I'm leading her on and it looks kind of dodgy from my girlfriend's perspective, so I'd be keeping it a secret. Someone's going to get hurt and it could have some major consequences. Just looking for advice.

TLDR; happily in a relationship with baby on way.

264,"This is going to be a bit of a long one. 

To start, I am diagnosed with ADHD. My parents do not believe in medication, so I am not on it. This is a primary factor in alot of my issues. It is not an excuse, but I think it is important to mention.

I am currently 16, a would-be junior in highschool. My state offers a dual enrollment program, where you can take college classes and recieve highschool credit as well. I am full time enrolled at a local university, and this semester failed a class for the first time. Try as I might, I cannot seem to 
stop procrastination on assignments or focus in class. The class I failed was psychology, and I failed because I never checked the gradebook: there were assignments I didn't know about and didn't complete. Prior to checking it yesterday (the end of the semester) I thought I had a low B at the worst. 

So there is the failing grades in school, and on top of that I am a terrible driver. I crashed my car for the 5th time tonight, this time hitting a deer. This is the most severe of the incidents so far, most of them have been small things in parking lots. I zone out alot while driving, and cannot focus unless I am going incredibly fast. I saw the first deer cross the road, slammed on the brakes, and a second ran in front of me before I could stop (my brake pads are worn from terrible driving habits). I already owe my parents loads of money to fix previous damage, and I recently quit my job.

I quit a job working 40 hours a week because I was going to fail out of school if I didn't, so I currently have no money, and loads of debt. Due to all these consequences of my actions, I'm terribly depressed and struggle to even get out of bed in the mornings. I constantly feel like shit, hate myself, and when I try to do better something always goes wrong that starts the spiral again.

I cannot persist in anything I love: working out, playing guitar, and even in friendships I always seem to burn out after a couple of days. My relationships with people are terrible because I can't seem to keep in contact unless I'm in an especially good mood.

My family thinks I am lazy and unmotivated, but I feel as though just functioning normally is so draining I don't have time for anything else. I just don't feel like a healthy or functional human being pretty much ever, and I need solutions to this. Medication isn't an option, so what can I do to make better decisions and be happier?",07Dec2019,1
265,"So, I've been a lurker on Reddit for a few years now and I finally made an account just to ask this one question since I can't find an answer anywhere else on the internet. This is kind of a non-essential question in comparison with other people's, but it is important to me. 

So a bit of backstory. I'll try to keep this fairly short.

My parents have always been very motivated to make sure my sister and I could do things for ourselves and think for ourselves. Basically, I've grown up for most of my life being pretty independent and independent-minded. Fast forward to high school and the real world. I'm a biological female. So you can imagine that in the current society that I live in (US), this type of mindset is not always encouraged. Even my parents' cultures (Mom is Filipino, Dad is Mexican) are very patriarchal outside of my immediate family, so this discouraging attitude is even more prevalent. I was homeschooled for nearly all of my pre-college years so finding out that people expected me to stand around while the guys helped move tables and chairs to clean up was a rude awakening. In my house, everyone pitched in to help clean and carry stuff, but confusion quickly shifted to insult when I realized that all of my female peers were treated the same way. I began to realize that there were certain tasks that males were expected to do for me and help me with, just because of our genders. Now, I don't think there's anything wrong if someone needs help, and one can argue that perhaps girls are not as physically strong as males, in general. But, it really rubbed me the wrong way when I would refuse help, or offer to help, and be denied and overruled, just because I was a girl. It wasn't so much the fact that people wanted to help, but that I felt that nobody was listening to me when I said my piece. I wasn't used to people brushing over what I had to say, and being treated like I didn't know what was best for myself since I came from such an independently-minded household.

Fast forward to college. I clearly now have a complex about how others treat me. I know, when I stop and think about it, that people do not always offer to help just because they see me as inferior, or incapable of taking care of myself. But some do, and it's hard for me to let others help me, because I know that people do exist who will always see me as inferior and incapable, because of my gender. I would rather do my work and theirs as well, just to prove to everyone that I CAN do it. My friends at least, when I'm with them I try to compromise more, and I want to respect their independence and agency as much as I want that respect from them. So, usually I try and either split the bill when out with them or share a physical load or something. I want to keep that mutuality and equality in place, but sometimes I do get a little frustrated internally when I think about how normal it would be for one of my guy friends to pay for a meal or help move my things into the dorm, while if I did it I would need to defend my reasoning to each and every person who I told this to, and embarrass my friend in front of his friends to boot since I would probably be the only girl in their vicinity to do that.

However, I am currently planning for my 22nd birthday party, and I am going out with my two guy friends for a whole weekend day. I don't really need material presents, but one thing I do really want is to pay for them throughout the day, all our activities, and all our meals. Just to show how much I appreciate them as friends. Quality time, acts of service, and gift-giving are my top 3 love languages, so it's something I would really like to do, just for one day if I can. I also have the financial means to do it. **But my question is, how do I go about ensuring that I pay for the bill, without being too insulting?** **Or without making it too awkward?** I have no doubt that some waiters may offer the bill to one of them out of habit as well, and though the two of them are pretty open-minded, I don't want to just instantly emasculate them too blatantly if I can avoid it, since I know both of them come from cultures that are also pretty patriarchal.",07Dec2019,1

My question is, should I key the friend in on the potential heat and maybe give her a chance to resign before something bad happens, at the risk of exposing myself a little? I‚Äôm well established in the job, and there would be some risk in giving the heads up, but my conscience ruffles a little at seeing someone heading towards a cliff unaware.

271,"Hi! First time posting and I need some heavy advice.
So, I have this friend. She recently got a job at a daycare center, and has been working there for a few weeks. However, she is involved with a lot of activities that is strictly prohibited for childcare workers to be involved in and boasts about it on social media (smoking, drugs, drinking, selling pornography, etc). I feel guilty because she works with young children and the parents nor the facility have any idea she does all of this (understandably, it's not allowed lol). I dont know whether I should live with it and mind my own while feeling guilty for not telling her employer, or if I should go with my gut and make them aware so she doesn't put children at risk.

I am afraid if I report her she will lose her job and wont be able to pay rent. She also wants to become a full time teacher in the future and I am afraid losing this job for drugs will make her permanently unemployable to her dream career.

But because I am getting older, the underweight situation is causing me a lot of problems. Throughout the second half of 2019, I have been ill almost every other week to the point where I am not able to do my work. This causes anxiety which further declines my health.  
I have been asking my parents to allow me to take a year off for almost 2 years now(I have the resources to take care of myself) and my father's only response is that everyone has some health issues and that I am blowing things out of proportion and that I should not worry about falling sick.  
All these problems and today my mom suggests that I should buy a house and it costs 6x my current annual income. At a stage of my life, where I need absolute freedom to explore both my career and life and take care of the ever-declining health, she wants to lock me in a house loan.

We kept talking but eventually I was in tears because I felt like her sympathy had run out and she was just angry at me I was trying to tell her what was wrong but she couldn‚Äôt understand me. She ended up slamming my door and yelling at me. About 30 mins later she came back and was still really rude and I asked her to apologise but she wouldn‚Äôt and that her even more angry. I also heard her yelling at my dad before.  Idk if she‚Äôs angry directly at me or because we‚Äôre having people over later and she wants the house to be clean. On top of all of this I also cut myself pretty badly and I‚Äôm honestly so astounded she would yell at me. Please help,07Dec2019,1

283,"I‚Äôm a nursing student. (29F)
I started dating one of the nurses(47M)on the floor I was precepting on. Things have been constant and steady for around 8 weeks or so. I met his 2 children, his parents and we had become intimate. 

2 weeks ago he hit me with ‚Äúwe need to talk‚Äù and he ultimately ended things. I was taken back, stunned and really hurt because I was starting to fall for him and I genuinely felt at home and safe with him. He said he just wants to be friends, but I‚Äôm not having that. I told him that I‚Äôll be kind and civil to him if I ever see him, but unfortunately I cannot be just a friend with him when I had given myself physically and emotionally. He understood. We texted for a few days after and I just couldn‚Äôt handle the hurt and decided to block his Instagram, FB and delete his number.

So let‚Äôs catchup and bring you to this week. Specifically this past Tuesday. I took a picture of a gorgeous sunset and texted it to him, knowing he would love it. Sure enough, he responded instantly over the moon about the photo. He texted me all evening. The next day I wake up to a good morning text... wasn‚Äôt expecting that. Anywho, he goes on to say that he‚Äôs been thinking about me and that he was sorry for everything. We text all morning, afternoon and evening on Wednesday. He calls me and we‚Äôre on the phone for 30 minutes. Just small talk. Updating me on his kids, asking how my school is and when my graduation date is. 

I am thrown for a damn loop at this point because he has been actively flirting with me since Tuesday via text and phone calls. I hear from him this morning, wishes me good luck on my exam and calls me too. The last I heard from him today was around 435pm. I haven‚Äôt heard a peep and I had sent him several messages and haven‚Äôt gotten any response back. 30 minutes ago I reactive my Facebook and the first thing I do cause I‚Äôm nosey is being up male nurses‚Äô page. My heart drops and I just start shaking. On Sunday he updated his profile photo to a picture of him and his ex. To make it even more interesting, Tuesday night(the day I reached out) he changed his profile photo to a picture that I had taken of trail I had been on that weekend and sent to him. He also changed his cover photo to another picture that I had taken and sent to him over a month ago.

I‚Äôm being played for a damn fool aren‚Äôt I? 
I haven‚Äôt heard one thing from him since this afternoon and all I can do is assume the worst. I noticed that when I have called him that his phone will sometimes ring once and then go to vmail. I didn‚Äôt think much of it until tonight and connected the dots that he has my number on DND if he‚Äôs with this woman. I‚Äôm just heartbroken and I just feel so used because I met his 2 kids, who absolutely LOVE ME and i adore them. I was also introduced to his mom and dad as well. Everything was going smoothly, so I thought.

Background: college student working part time in Canada 

I got a job at a convenience store about 2 months ago (have worked fast food jobs prior). However, when I was hired, I mentioned I wanted to work min 20 hours per week. I‚Äôve mentioned it twice more to my supervisor. I‚Äôve only been getting 10 hours biweekly for my shift. I‚Äôve asked my supervisor and was told it‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt have enough hours for me. I barely make 300/biweekly which isn‚Äôt nearly as much as I‚Äôd like to be able to save, pay bills, pay debts, etc. 

I was thinking of finding a new job with more hours. However, I have a surgery scheduled in early February. It‚Äôs not a major surgery, I would need about a week off from work and school.

My question is: is it worth it for me to find a new job right now and then ask for the time off for my surgery or should I tough it out at my current job until I am recovered from my surgery and then apply for new positions?

289," 

It is late at night and I have been thinking about my ex for a long time today. It is amazing how all of a sudden I was feeling ok and now I‚Äôm having this breakdown again. I now know that what I thought was wrong, I now know that I still love her and that it goes so deep inside myself that I am holding onto her. I know that I should get over her, but I am being unable. She was the best connection and the best love I have ever felt, and even though I‚Äôve tried to date other girls, I haven‚Äôt met anyone who comes close. I am not saying I am trying to find someone similar, I am just trying to find someone who I can connect with and enjoy her presence with the same intensity I did when I was starting to go out with her. I am really tempted to contact you in some way, to try my best to get you back. Honestly, I am hesitant of this because:

&amp;#x200B;

* I fear you will not feel the same way and that I could break even more what is already damaged.
* I fear that you will feel the same way and whatever consequence happens will end up hurting us more.
* I fear to interrupt your healing process.
* I fear to change your current idea of me and so you would hate me in some way.
* I feel that I shouldn‚Äôt.
* I don‚Äôt want to harass you, even though I have done it in the past. Even if you haven‚Äôt noticed.

It‚Äôs been 3 and a half months since we broke up. I have had some good moments and I‚Äôve had some terrible ones. I am just seeking the mental and emotional stability I had when I was with you. I miss you, I miss your presence, I miss the moments we spent together, I miss your voice, your reactions, your cute faces, I miss sex with you specifically, I miss having trust in someone the way I had it with you, I miss your family, your friend‚Äôs reunions even though I never knew anyone, I miss driving with you by my side and driving back home from your place at 1:00 am on a Saturday, I miss our random and spontaneous times we went for ice cream out of nowhere on a day we weren‚Äôt even supposed to see each other. I miss YOU! But I feel that for the same reason I should let you go and move on. I can‚Äôt keep hurting you selfishly. I understand that my family can cause a lot of problems in our relationship. But one of the things that hurt me the most is that, since you decided to dump me, I know you think we aren‚Äôt worth fighting for anymore. And thus I need to respect you. But believe me, nothing else in my life, not even the death of my father, has hurt me in a more intense way than you leaving me. I don‚Äôt know when or what did I do specifically to lose your trust, but when I find out, there will be nothing I regret in life but that. I even got into a fistfight recently because I was trying to defend you from the insults of an asshole. I lost the fight but I don‚Äôt regret it.

Now, I noticed that I am just crying like a little bitch and squealing when I should be strong and try to move on. I hope this little breakdown I had today is quick and that I can live normally after this. I hope I can someday see you again and really, even if all my friends and family think that it wouldn‚Äôt work, I deep inside me hope that I can be your friend someday in the future. That I can reintegrate your presence in my life even if it is just as friends. I love you, and I always will in some way, even if I end up with someone else.",07Dec2019,1

I think my neighbors just adopted a new dog. We live in apartments where my bedroom shares a (thin) wall with my neighbor's living room. 

All day today (literally - I have been home sick) I have heard a dog from the other side of the wall barking and whining. I love dogs and this doesn't really upset me, and that is not what I'm worried about.

It doesn't seem like my neighbors have been home all day and I'm worried that the dog needs help. I knocked on their door multiple times just now (the lights are on), and have gotten nothing other than the dog slamming itself against the door and whining through the crack. They left the blinds to the bedroom window open and I can see the dog in there. He/she jumps on the bed when he/she hears me walk past their door (like I said - really thin walls).

As I'm sitting in my bedroom now, I can hear the dog scratching at the door, jumping on the couch and running around their entire apartment. It doesn't seem okay...

I just want to make sure this dog is okay and maybe quiet it down a bit since it is past midnight and I have to work tomorrow morning... what should I do? Can I do anything?

318,"So in 2017 I dated this girl who we‚Äôll call Raven. She was my first deep romantic entanglement and a lot happened really quickly. For starters she got kicked out of her house after our first date for missing her curfew(her stepmom wasn‚Äôt the nicest person) and had to move into my house because she had no other family around, having moved from the east to the west. During that time that she lived with me I learned a lot  and went through a considerable amount of growth. She‚Äôs what you‚Äôd consider an energy vampire, someone who feeds on others energy; and a low tier one at that. In the first 5 months I was with her I would feel very drained and exhausted when trying to help her deal with her issues (which she had a lot of), and since she had no family and gave no effort to make friends the person whose energy she‚Äôd be draining the most was me. Now that was her at her worst, but on days she was happy she had this bright, uplifting presence to her and I was genuinely happy to be around her. in a sense our relationship felt like Rick and michonne from TWD (both figuratively and semi-literally if that makes any sense). But the emotional turmoil I went through when she was down in the dumps, which was quite often, became too much to bear and I decided to end the relationship; but since she had nowhere else to go because she was too stubborn to patch things up with her ‚Äústepmom‚Äù, she continued to live with me and we decided to spend some time as friends since we didn‚Äôt really have that much time to establish that part of our relationship. We were best friends for about a year and a half and it was nice, we even made our own complicated handshake that we‚Äôd do every day. The both of us cared for each other on a VERY deep level, especially her since I was her primary source of support and we would‚Äôve done anything for each other. But there was a lack of communication from her end, because a month or two after our break up her feelings for me resurfaced but didn‚Äôt want to tell me under the guise that I‚Äôd ‚Äúsee her as weak‚Äù if she did, which I wouldn‚Äôt have; in all actuality I would‚Äôve happily taken her back if she had just told me. She also had a tendency to be emotionally abusive towards me, and would ask on multiple occasions why I was her friend whenever she would have a breakdown, which becomes a much more complicated question to answer since you have to figure out EXACTLY what to say so that you don‚Äôt make the situation worse. Anyways cut to October of 2018 she goes through a psychotic episode and needed to seek psychiatric help. I took her to a number of facilities and every facility we went to they said she needs to be put in inpatient behavioral therapy, but when I would leave so that they could speak to her privately, she would say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need help‚Äù and instead we settled on an outpatient group home. While she was there she met this really shady dude who we‚Äôll call Jamal. He was a very controlling and manipulative person, like Manson tier, as well as a heavy meth user with a concerning amount of needle marks that you would never expect to see on a 24 year old. He was also incredibly delusional, saying things like he‚Äôs the second coming of Jesus Christ and that he has the power of the universe in his hands, and raven was gullible enough to believe that, which honestly surprised me. He could probably tell that raven was in a n extremely vulnerable place and would prey on her insecurities, telling her what she‚Äôd want to hear so that she‚Äôd be fawning over him like a little puppy. Raven and I had planned to go to a concert that we‚Äôd been really wanting to go to, VIP meet and greet and everything, but she told me she was gonna go on an ‚Äúadventure‚Äù with Jamal for an undetermined amount of time, which translated to her living in a tent with him down in some podunk town out in desert county, which I, along with a good friend, talked her out of doing. But she kept trying to talk to him and keep in touch with him saying how she was trying to be a good friend to him. I told her on 4-5 different occasions that he was a psychotic predator who wasn‚Äôt looking out for her best interests and only wanted to use her for his own self gratification. Well apparently that didn‚Äôt work, because one day I wake up to see her with 2-3 packed bags saying that ‚Äúshe needs help‚Äù and that she‚Äôs ‚Äúgoing to get treatment‚Äù, which turned to be a lie. What she actually did was run off with Jamal, smoked meth with him and fucked him. She was gone for a week and a half and I couldn‚Äôt get a hold of her at all. I was worried sick and then she finally calls me and says that she wants to see me, and since I didn‚Äôt know what actually happened at the time I agree to it and long story short, we got back together. While we were back together she finally tells me where she was during that week and a half. I had never felt so betrayed in my life and actually bought her a bus ticket to her mom back east because I couldn‚Äôt have her there with me anymore. But after about a year, i don‚Äôt feel angry anymore and i‚Äôve accepted what happened. Aside from those last two months I was with her, it wasn‚Äôt a total shitstorm. We had more good times together than bad and we had this very special bond between us. On multiple occasions she would express to me how grateful she was for everything I did for her; one excerpt from a letter she wrote me for my birthday read ‚Äúthank you for always being there for me. I feel like I‚Äôve become a better person for having known you. if it wasn‚Äôt for you I probably would‚Äôve grown to hate everyone, but you showed me that there are still good people in this world. You are the greatest person I‚Äôve ever met and I‚Äôm glad that you‚Äôre a part of my life‚Äù I still catch myself having feelings for her, sometime even imagining that she‚Äôs still here with me. I was wanting to marry her eventually and even have kids with her, and being a parent is one of my biggest fears; but in that moment I wasn‚Äôt afraid at all, I was genuinely excited to experience all of that with her. In a way I still love her and care about her. I even thought about calling her on her birthday, which is in about a month. However I‚Äôm scared to reopen that door with her, while at the same time I want to gain some closure from all this by finding out why she did what she did. Since she was having a psychotic episode when all this happened, she wasn‚Äôt thinking clearly or rationally and made incredibly impulsive decisions that blew up in her face. I have no doubt in my mind that she feels a tremendous amount of remorse and guilt for what she did, because she abundantly showed those emotions after telling me all this as well as her seeing my reaction to all of it; which wasn‚Äôt pretty. since a considerable amount of time has passed, she might have a better understanding on why she lied to me and chose to betray me, which offers an opportunity for closure. I don‚Äôt know what I should do. Part of me wants to reach out to her, to have that conversation with her and close up those wounds to show her that there‚Äôs no hard feelings between us, which there arent; but another part of me says I should just forget about her and move on with my life, to treat my experience with her like a bad dream, even though it wasn‚Äôt all bad, just 40% of it. What do you think? 

TL;DR: I was emotionally and romantically involved with someone for two years. She betrayed me. A year has passed and I‚Äôm considering calling her on her birthday to show her that I‚Äôm not angry with her anymore but am worried what might become of that.",07Dec2019,1
320,"Fifteen years ago, I found myself needing a major change in my life and decided to move to a small town where my my mother‚Äôs huge family lives.

My biggest concern was the local school who‚Äôs mascot is the Rebels. There are confederate flags flying from nearly every home and the few small businesses in town. They are in the elementary school and even painted on the front doors of the high school. 

 Living here has me throwing my hands in the air and rarely talking to anyone about it unless they start the conversation. I usually end the conversation severely frustrated and ready to move! I have broken through to a few people but overall it‚Äôs been like talking to a brick wall. I was just happy that I didn‚Äôt have children because I couldn‚Äôt imagine sending them to that school.

I honestly would have given up and moved away, but I met a wonderful man and fell in love. He lived with and cared for his elderly parents and aunt though. While they can do most activities by themselves they have all come to depend on him and they are truly wonderful people that I love like my own at this point. We married, tacked an apartment on to the house to give us some privacy and in our own little world we were happy. 

Then five months ago, I received a phone call that changed everything. A cousin had given birth to a little boy and wasn‚Äôt able to take care of him because of a drug addiction. He was due to leave the hospital in the morning and she wanted me and my husband to take him instead of putting him into the foster care system. We had two hours to decide and less than twelve hours to get what we needed to bring him home. 

I had long given up on having children but we had toyed with the idea of adoption before and we decided to take him. He‚Äôs five months old now and doing great. The adoption process will be complete before spring and he is the love of our lives!

But now I‚Äôm faced with a dilemma. My in-laws would be  devastated if we move but there is no way my child is going to the local school where the confederate flag ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt mean anything‚Äù and ‚Äúisn‚Äôt bad unless you were taught it is was bad‚Äù. 

I don‚Äôt want to homeschool him when the time comes. I think the public school system can be a wonderful place for children to not only get an education but to work on crucial social skills as well. This is such a small town that traditional methods outside school are limited. There isn‚Äôt so much as a daycare. I‚Äôm at a loss at this point. 

Should I break their hearts and move? Take on the system to make some changes? (This was attempted a while back and failed btw). Or do I try to get him in another school district and make the 40 minute each way drive every day?  Maybe there‚Äôs another option that I haven‚Äôt thought of yet?

326,"So bit of backstory,

In the end of june i met a very nice but shy girl during a hackathon for school and she shared alot of interests with my best friend so i introduced her to him and 5-6 weeks later they had a relationship but after that i barely saw him online anymore.

we almost never played anymore games together, so one day i messaged him ""hey, when are we going to play the new cod?"" he said ""can't im going to gf this weekend"" and i said ""dude, bros before hos"" and later when he arrived she read his phone and read that i called her a ""ho"" because she doesn't know the meaning of ""bros before hos"".

Since then he came more often online but only if his gf could play with us but everytime i'd die or i'd ""steal"" a kill in game she always goes full toxic mode on me and flames me for every minor thing that happens and whenever i say anything back she'll say to my friend ""OP is being mean again, can we private call?"" then they just disappear.

I know its not my place for me to tell him that she's a super negative toxic person towards everyone except him but i also can't sit by and watch. I really don't want to lose him as a friend.

His birthday is tomorrow and he invited me but i don't think i'll stay long if she's there.

So if anyone could give me some advice how to handel this i'd be really greatful",07Dec2019,1
327,"so i think ‚Äúretroactive jealousy‚Äù and get really anxious and completely overthink my gfs sexual past. so annoying and it‚Äôs not a new topic, but i just wanted advice and hoped this would help calm me down as it sends me into literal panic attacks sometimes. she‚Äôs 19, says she has a body count of 15. in high school she was sexually assaulted by a manager at work, and i think went to a group therapy thing to talk about it. she said she only slept with a few guys she was seriously dating in high school, but after this really emotionally abusive guy cheated on her, she was kind of just hooking up with people with no interest in seriously dating. i think she met one guy before me that she thought she really liked her first semester in college, but he also was mentally abusive and made her feel like shit, then she was just hooking up again. then she met me and all that changed! but i get DEEP in my head about her seeing those guys. when i first was seeing her i‚Äôd hear way too detailed stories about times she‚Äôs hooked up with people, and it just made me insecure i guess? 

but here‚Äôs the thing, i always thought it was just her hooking up randomly and having fun of whatever, but she told me that she usually felt pressured when she was with other guys, boyfriends included, and that it was never good because she never really wanted to just felt like she had to, but now she‚Äôs with me and says i‚Äôm the only one she‚Äôs really felt comfortable with and that she never like dirty talked before etc. but she does with me, stuff like that. and my anxiety tells me not to believe her. it reminds me of all the stories i‚Äôve heard of her hooking up and makes me say ‚Äúnah i feel like she really liked it and is lying to me‚Äù, and i talk to her when i‚Äôm feeling like that and she usually calmly reassures me she wouldn‚Äôt lie to me, tho sometimes she does get upset after i bring it up so much which is totally understandable. the last girl i seriously dated lied to me aboutca hookup with a friend of mine, SWEARING she didn‚Äôt do this and didn‚Äôt do that, all to find out she was lying because she was afraid it would hurt my feelings. like she was willing to PRESS CHARGES on this guy because she was afraid of how i‚Äôd take it. so that‚Äôs probably also partly why it‚Äôs hard to trust my current gf.

that was a lot of fucking information lol and there‚Äôs more honestly but that‚Äôs the gist, and this honestly was just an anxious rant through this panic attack rn. so how can i fix it? how can i calm my anxiety and trust this girl and get over all this? it‚Äôs kind of a high number, but she says she fet pressured so why do i still get so bothered and how to stop?",07Dec2019,1

329,"Ok. So I'm at my wit's end here. My SO (24f) and I (29m) have been together for over 10 years now. We have lived together for 7, and have a 2 to son. My mother is 69 and disabled. She has to use a walker and needs help with most everyday tasks. About 4 years ago she lost her house, and my brother (34) and her moved in with my SO and I. Over the years I have tried to play moderator while my mom ""looks"" for a house. They have been driving my SO crazy. She is old fashioned and tries to run our house like she owns it. The house is not big or in great condition. I've been slowly repairing and upgrading along the way, but she constantly complains about how I'm doing it, colors we choose, etc. My brother is pretty much useless. I get off work, come home, and get busy. He finally has a job after 6+years of unemployment, comes home, and stays on his computer until he has to crash. Now, family is everything to me. I love them dearly. I had a decent childhood, and always felt loved, but my mom has changed. Always acts like she is so disappointed in me and has gotten so bitter and so petty. She admitted she would have aborted me had she had the option. Constantly reminds me of how much I have f***ed up my life. Despises my SO. Wouldn't talk to me for a month when we found out my SO was pregnant. Swore to have nothing to do with the child. And now my SO and I are finally at the point where we can get married and she has informed me that she refuses to attend and that I am making the biggest mistake of my life. The things she said pushed me over the edge. I almost kicked them out then and there. 
The problem I'm having a hard time with is that she can't handle rent on her own and my brother is talking like he's not going to help her. I don't want to just kick them out with nowhere to go, but I can't handle them living with me anymore. And I feel guilty. I have read parent horror stories that make mine sound like a fairy tale, but I just can't do this anymore. What would you do? Kick them out and say good luck? Or suck it up? I want to focus on my family now, not hers, but I'm pretty much out of options...

331,"Oh boy this gonna be a bit long, I‚Äôll try to keep it short and to the point. So for some backstory, I‚Äôm in the army (as well as my bf and his soon to be ex wife, which I‚Äôll refer to ex from now on). If you also can‚Äôt already tell I‚Äôm the other woman in this story. I met him when he was still in Korea, I was a PV2, new and fresh out of AIT and he was a SPC (I‚Äôll refer to him as C) at the time and we literally started out as friends. We rarely talked, we had nothing to do with each other until I had a one night stand with one of my coworkers (yes I know for you military peeps out there, I know what I did and I learned from my mistake, plus at the time I had a bf back in the states and also recently lost my virginity this year, hence the raging hormones). The next day I struggled with coping with the fact I had cheated on my bf at the time and went to C to try to talk to him about emotions cuz that‚Äôs what girls do. I began to cry before the words even came out, he told me to go to the empty conference room to calm down. What I didn‚Äôt know at the time was that the guy I had a ONS w/ bragged to C (like lowkey confessing) that he slept with me while I was in that room. 
Then suddenly C and I began to talk more after that day, he never asked me what happened or what caused me to cry out of respect (or so I thought). Cut to us hanging out more, me going to his room, us cuddling with each other (no sex was involved), we began to tell one another more about ourselves, and him venting to me about his ex and how much of a controlling bitch she was. He would vent to me how she would get upset at him playing video games, not worshipping her like a goddess, waiting on her hand and foot, spending insane amounts of money on her and how crazy she was for always threatening divorce if he didn‚Äôt give her a kid, etc. Keep in mind I never once told him I had a ONS with said coworker. We got to know each other very well, we had many things in common like personality wise, hobbies, music taste, etc. Then one day he asked me over a social media app about what exactly happened that day I cried. I kinda played dumb bc I was afraid of him finding out and not wanting to hang out anymore and being disgusted with me. He asked again but this time he asked straight up, ‚Äú did you have sex with ‚Äòsaid coworker‚Äô?‚Äù I then told him to never ask me that again and to leave me alone. Obviously that didn‚Äôt help and then I ended up talking to him the next day after almost a full day of no contact. I went to his room late on a Friday to try to talk to him. He answered, let me in and then proceeded to ask me why didn‚Äôt I tell him the truth and blah blah, the gist of it was why didn‚Äôt I say the truth and that he kind knew from the beginning cuz said coworker told him and wanted to confirm it himself. In the end all is forgiven and we cuddle that night (again, still no sex). 
A few days later we‚Äôre hanging out in his room just talking and then he confesses that he‚Äôs begun to have feelings for me, and pretty much said that he loves me, loves my personality, all the things opposite of his ex.  I didn‚Äôt know how to react and I was flattered/confused that he said it so suddenly like we still don‚Äôt know each other that well enough to say the word ‚Äúlove‚Äù. Over the course of two days I would teasingly blow kisses at him and he said if I did it again he‚Äôd kiss me until one night when I was in his room I did it again and yknow some hanky panky went down (unexpectedly tbh). I was then moved from one unit to another cuz office reasons and also cuz C was about to be promoted soon and an nco can‚Äôt mingle with junior enlisted. So, I was moved but that still didn‚Äôt stop me from going to see him. At this point in time I had already broken up with my bf back in the states for other reasons and became (basically) the mistress to C. He and his ex were already falling out and he was also getting ready to leave Korea as well to go back to the states. Blah blah blah we spent more time together and then cut to when C leaves Korea and to deal with his ex. 
Another few more months go by and C texts me one day to talk about something that had to do with his ex. He ended up confessing to me that he messed around with her when he got back to the states, they both drank and had sex and had just recently found out that she‚Äôs preggo with his kid (he‚Äôs trying to get a paternity test done).  He told me how he found out: he went over to her apartment to drop off some stuff and then she broke the news to him. They both got into an argument, she got physical with him and tried to hit him/ stop him from leaving the apartment; he didn‚Äôt want to get into an altercation so that‚Äôs why he was trying to leave, but she ended up hurting herself somehow. He takes her to the hospital, nurses ask what happened under the guise that they weren‚Äôt gonna tell the cops, she told them but they called them anyways. C went to got arrested and went to jail and this whole thing is still happening even now. He told me that he‚Äôs still gonna be there for the kid (if it‚Äôs his), at first I was super pissed and hung up on him after he told me everything, cried and screamed. Literally took me no less than 30 minutes to call him back to tell him I‚Äôd stay with him. 
FINALLY. Now,
Here‚Äôs where I get to the mixed feelings part. I love C. Dearly. And I still want him in my life, as does he. But the fact that he says he‚Äôs gonna take care of his crazy ex‚Äôs kid, in all honesty it‚Äôs great that he‚Äôs taking responsibility for his actions and I love him more for that but then there‚Äôs this deep dark part of me is screaming and somehow jealous of the ex/and kid and angry with him??? I‚Äôm frustrated with myself for feeling like this. Thing is I want to stay with him and also take care of his kid too and love it like my own if he were to allow it. If the roles were reversed I‚Äôm sure he would‚Äôve left immediately. I don‚Äôt want to be petty/immature about this whole situation and I want to be a mature adult about all this (I‚Äôm 19 and C is 24). But this inner self of mine is so angry about it all and I don‚Äôt know what to do with this anger, I‚Äôm sure I should tell him but I‚Äôm hesitant that he‚Äôs gonna get mad at me and ask why even bother to stay if I have these feelings?

I‚Äôm so sorry that this was super long. I had to cut out a lot of smaller details to just get to the point. :p but if you guys have questions I‚Äôll try to answer.",07Dec2019,1
332,"(Back story for present) For the last 7 years my life has been up and down, I was bullied at a young age and got PTSD from physical abuse from my father. I was a very shy person up until I was 13 where I believed I matured. I've turned into a very selfless and empathetic person, not once was I selfish about my own feelings. I was sick on multiple occasions forcing me too repeat Year 9. I moved onto my last proper highschool and spent most of my time there. I probably bloomed there seeing how I grew different, a better and more mature person. However, the second term of this year. I got sick once again, I missed 7 months of school and NOT one single person contacted me from school asking about my health or how I was doing, I was hurt and this was not the first time I felt betrayed, happened too my last highschool. 

As of right now, I have enrolled too a school that lets me do everything online in my own pace. But, I've been alone this entire time and feel like I have a huge hole in my chest. About two weeks ago, I noticed the most obvious thing that not one person cared, the people that I would no longer call my friends now, that I helped. And bare in mind, I am quite the tall person so it would be easy too spot me. Right now. I cannot trust anyone no more, I feel like if I do again, I would just get hurt and broken. This is more of a rant but, advice would be helpful in my situation.

333,"So, recently my heart wanted to love someone, and I haven't slept well for weeks just becausrle of that feeling. Whenever it happened before, I just thought that I wasn't worth that kind of love or that I should not focus on that. I don't consider myself to be a good boyfriend as well. 

But this time I can't stop thinking about it. I don't have anyone particularly that I like, but I want to. On the other hand, I am afraid of being rejected and feeling hurt. When I had crushes, I just thought that I was out of their league and didn't even try to do anything. 

That fear of being rejected was also affected by one occasion: my former crush has asked me if I liked her. Well, as I at that time didn't have crush on her, I just said that she kinda misunderstood, and she was relieved, because she couldn't imagine herself being with me, so that was kind of a rejection from her as well.

336,"My mom invited me to go to the shoppinf centee with her roughly a week ago. Having nothing else to do i accepted. It was a 30 minute car ride and on the way i was having stomache aches. They were painful but bearable and i didn't want to cut the time with my mum short so i ignored it.

As we walked into a store to buy a game the stomach ache suddenly became extremely painful and i became very naseus. I had to lean on the counter to be able to stand up. Afterwarda we sat on a bench and i couldn't speak properly for roughly 10-15 minutes. Since then i have been having the same stomach pains and nausea at random times.

I asked my dad if we could go to the doctors and he said yes. He never told me the time we were going and when i asked him about it he said they were full. We finally got an appointment scheduled for next monday and i was wondering if i could do anything to nullify or stop the pains.

My dad thought it was because of the heat (i live in australia) but i haven't been sweating and i have taken some cold showers and they have done nothing. 

The symptoms i am having are nasea, stomach pains, suddenly being very tired and feeling drained, lack of an appetite and pains all around my stomache. 

Thank you in advance.",07Dec2019,1
337,"For a couple of years now, i have used discord. I met some good friends there and it's been a nice time. But recently, in a server where most of it started for me, things changed. A girl has gotten the owner role and it seems she just hates me for no reason. Whenever i'm online, she's like a shark that smells blood, ready to insult me in any way she thinks is appropriate. Most people side with her, but i think that's because of her role. I can't think of anything i have done that would've upset a whole server of 50+ people. It's true that I've been inactive for a while, but i doubt that's it. It's just not fun there anymore.

341,"So I have been with this girl for 1 year +. Recently she said I have no ambition compared to her 2nd ex bf. So I quarreled with her almost daily for 2 weeks and she keeps on wanting to break up. I have been there for her and handled some of this stuffs with her before too. 

So after comparing me, saying I should opening up more to her as she felt a distance. At the same time, she was at a wedding meeting and she stayed but one hour to talked to this guy as she wants to be a teacher and he open a tuition center and came to ask me if I was comfortable with it and for her to be away on the weekend teaching tuitions. They are supposedly going to emcee for the wedding. She started to talk privately with him quite a bit too. I said I was uncomfortable with the situation. We had aligned at the start of relationship that we shouldn't get close to the other genders to that extent. However she said it's better to be friends so the event will be a more successful one. She still deliberately keep talking to him as an ego thing as they got nothing going so, why should she stop talking and make it feel that I am right. When I made my point I am uncomfortable after she asked me to opened up, I am pretty pissed. I am pretty sure there's nothing going on there. She's the emcee and bridesmaid for this wedding just to add on. So one day my relative passed away, she told me she have to help the bride pre-planning to 12am before she can come to my side. Everyday she have different things planned with different friends too. All these happened in the 2 weeks of quarreling. I just feel that she compared me, asked me to open up, got close to this guy and prioritizing her other friends first. I keep quarreling with her because I was seeking validation.

So with these, she doesn't want to fix stuffs and to break up, this is our first time with such issues. She said I am the one she loved the most. But she did so to fix stuffs for the other exes. She told me she doesn't wanna fix stuffs with me cos they don't wanna settle down even though she wanted to settle down. But she doesn't wanna fix things with me when we both wanna settle down, I am confused by this. She quarreled with her 2nd ex bf a lot too, and he did wanted to settle down cos they were planning on getting a flat, but back then she wanted to work things out with him. With her 3rd ex bf, she said she doesn't love him at all, but gave him plenty of chances to fix things, she even thought of having kid with him to try to make things better. So now for me right, she said I am the one she loves the most, but she doesn't wanna fix things with me and just wanna break up, when it's the very first big fight we are in, So I need advices, thanks.",07Dec2019,1

The other day my boyfriend and I were discussing movies or something and Scarlett Johansson came up. Although we both agree she is very attractive, we differ in the opinion of her roles. I said I didn‚Äôt like her because of the fact that she tries to take roles not meant for her‚ÄîI.e. Ghost in the shell, playing an Asian woman‚Äîor what was supposed to be an Asian woman. (She also tried to play a trans person). He had a good point that ‚Äúwhat if she was the best actress that auditioned, thus she deserved the role for her acting ability‚Äù. I am not sure how to respond to that because I understand where he‚Äôs coming from. He also said it‚Äôs not Johansson‚Äôs fault for getting chosen, that it‚Äôs mostly the casting people. Now this I wasn‚Äôt really buying‚Äîbecause if you are already auditioning for a role, you are automatically putting yourself above the others that are ‚Äúmeant‚Äù for the role aka putting yourself before other Asian actors. I told him, that she takes away Asian representation in this way and that there could have easily been an Asian actor that was talented enough in acting ability to play that role. He said it‚Äôs just a job and that‚Äôs their job‚Äîto act like something they are not. While I agree that it‚Äôs their job, I feel like actors have a responsibility to chose roles more fitting to at least their race. I said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs like saying being the president is also just a job then...‚Äù obviously this was not the right statement but I wasn‚Äôt trying to make the point that just because that‚Äôs your job doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt care about the consequences of certain actions in your job. I wanted to also add,‚Äù that‚Äôs like saying I can play a black woman‚Äù ( I am not a black woman) because my acting ability is so great. That would be erasure of that narrative as a black woman in that story. He also implied that it is kind of a directors take or change to do whatever they‚Äôd like with the story included that. 

All in all, I found myself not being able to communicate what I was really trying to say. And overall, I just feel uncomfortable with this one disagreement we have.

She didn‚Äôt attend meetings very often this semester, but recently she returned and it‚Äôs the same old shit.

We used to be good friends, but her behavior wore me down.  She had no coping skills and turned to me to be an emotional crutch for her constant breakdowns and crises. She always talked about herself and needed advice and validation, but never reciprocated. I watched her do this to countless people, like a black hole, thriving off of the attention her meltdowns received her.

348,"TLDR: I think I need to cut my ""family"" off. This is the hardest thing to do now because I know they (especially my emotionally weak mother) will suffer because of my decision, yet I really feel I just need to do it. It feels like the only sane and non-toxic thing to do for me. Need advice on how to make this less painful for everyone included.

In all truth, we were nothing like the picture of even a less ideal ""family"". All I really remember from living with then was just emotional trauma and toxic personalities, lots of arguing, deceit, secrets, and resentment. Been living away from them for the last 15+ years. Yet, they are not at all bad people, none are addicts or alcoholics, it just feels like everyone is a victim of the circumstances to be born in a dysfunctional family .

I got out of there as soon as I got my first job. I never suffered physical abuse but mentally it was always a lot of drama and emotional instability. 

My mother is in her late 60s, she was always emotionally very unstable, with a lot of drama an tears and overall suffering about everything and nothing, but especially about the fact that her son is not there for her. I thought after first few years since I was gone she will kinda accept it but she never really did. She is never being directly abusive, but the way she acts always makes me want to distance even more. It's ironic because all she probably wants is a true connection, but I dont feel that can be made true so late in our lives.

With my father I never really had a connection and we don't even talk to each other now, although I know he's sorry for how it turned out to be, but he didnt know better. I don't see the point in trying to make that connection now.

My siblings are both older than me, they both kinda try to live their lives but they are not married or in a relationship. One still lives with the parents, the other one ""ran away"" just like me and doesn't visit, but keeps themselves busy with work so they have a valid excuse not to visit.

I did keep in touch via texts mostly with mother and she and the other sibling came to occasional visits to my house. Those visits add absolutely zero value to this relationship. I always said they are welcome to visit but I was forever reluctant to visit them because I cannot keep forcing myself to do something I really don't want to do. Still, once a year, at Christmas eve it is a kind of obligation for the ""family"" to gather, even though the whole scene is totally forced and fake, at least from my perspective. It's only for a few hours and everybody goes about their business after that. It is always just an obligation for me, I really dont want to be there, in  fact I'm there only physically, and mentally I count the seconds to get back home. We don't even have normal conversations anyway, so even minutes seem like hours to me. Because of it I feel  kinda like some convict for those few hours of being there.

I don't hate my family but I wish they (especially mother) would accept and respect my whishes.

Now for the first time I made other plans for Christmas and I won't be spending that time with them. I already told that to my older sibling, and they offered zero support and hinted I will be responsible if my mother goes to a nervous breakdown because of this.

I know this may not be enough detail, but I don't want to make too long of a post. I just need advice on how to make this less painful for everyone involved. Should I really cut them off or try to force myself to build some kind of a relationship?",07Dec2019,1
349,"Hello, this is a continuation of my previous post where I pissed off my friend for being too honest and accidentally letting slip to a girl he's interested in that he drinks and smokes when I had no reason to believe she didn't know and didn't expect her to react so...poorly

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/e6iu3f/pissed\_off\_my\_friend\_for\_being\_completely\_honest/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/e6iu3f/pissed_off_my_friend_for_being_completely_honest/) 

Anyways, I...need help with the fallout really badly. This situation has effectively devolved into high school drama among grown adults. Absolutely stupid IMO but that's what it is

I will still refer to my ""friend"" in the previous story as ""bro"", but the additional friends now involved as just friend 1 and 2

Friend 1 has been close to bro and I for years and is no doubt the most cool headed of the 3 of us

Friend 2 has known bro, friend 1, and I for less time, but either way we all still love the guy and he's still part of our inner circle. He's the youngest of us but, ironically, might be both the most mature of us but the most ""conspiracy theory"" of us too. This will be relevant later

So Bro is of course still pissed after 3 days (maybe less? Time zone difference while I'm on vacation). Okay, kinda shitty but whatever

3 days later. The guy refuses to talk to me

Alright, we've been here before anytime we have beef. Bro has refused to talk to me and muted me on our Discord server in the past, but at least has left messages open so we can talk it out like men

But now Bro has also gone the extra step of blocking me on all social media including Discord. Alright, fine, be immature about it bro.

I wanted to fix this, I really did because bro's had my back in tough spots and vice versa, while he's a douchebag sometimes, at least I could count on him and any beef we had before we squashed and kept it between us. But if you're just going to retreat and close communication fine

Last night though, I managed to at least talk to 2 mutual friends. They are not aware of the whole situation and only know bro's perspective

From them I gathered that Bro basically told everyone whom we are close with that I'm a backstabbing scumbag. I'm certain they all have their own opinions, but so far I have not managed to get responses from them

We talk for over an hour. I explain my side of the story including how Bro basically didn't want to listen to the whole story in his fit of anger and hung up on me

Friend 1 comments: ""hey man, I know this is a shitty situation, but while bro is definitely overreacting, you sound like you're also overreacting and victimizing yourself""

Sure, I suppose I am a bit. Regardless of how or why, I fully admit I WAS the one who spilled the beans and broke our deal, reasons be damned and accident or not I did it

Either way though, friend 1 tells me ""look man, you're both important to me, but I'm NOT going to broker some meet up because he won't talk to you, figure this shit out between you 2""

I do not like his chosen position and I do not think it is helpful. However I understand why he has chosen this position

Friend 2 comments: ""Hey, I have to wonder man, this is all because of some woman that you barely know and he's known for like a few months. Is it really worth destroying your years of friendship over?""

Good question. I personally don't think so

Friend 1: ""Hey man, I'll be honest too, if a girl got this offended over something like this, I'd say she's not even worth it. She's interfering with your friendship whether she wanted to or not. I would just give up on her""

Friend 2: ""Yeah I don't think its worth it""

Alright, cool, this is all nice to hear I guess, but doesn't change the fact that Bro has me blocked on all forms of communication and I can't tell him any of this. Not to mention, I'm kinda pissed at bro already for not letting me explain myself fully and acting like a douchebag in the first place

So now here I am. Bro has decided for the first time we've ever had beef to spread it to other people, and now these people understandably do not want to get involved, but I can't help but feel like my whole world is against me now

How should I handle this? Originally, I wanted to talk to bro and sort it out like grown men. However I cannot do this because of being blocked across every form of communication and even back in America, Bro lives like 5 states away so it's not like I can walk up to his house and talk it out. Currently I am debating trying to get our mutual friends more involved and have them help me get a message out, but at the same time I do not know if it's wise to try to get them any more involved than they already are",07Dec2019,1
350,"I \[M/22\] have been in a relationship with my girlfriend for a few years and I have known her friend for just as long. A few months ago, I started having a crush on her. Her friend differed from my gf as she was constantly willing to try new things and had more self-confidence which I value a lot and just recognized then. Along with that, she seems more relatable and more fun to hang around with. Over the months of me getting closer to her and finding more things I like about her, my gf has been insecure about her friend and I being a better fit in a relationship than herself. I stalled to now because the school semester is just ending as my gf and I had classes together (I would not want to make it awkward between us in class). I have been wondering what to do at the end of the semester since I have had these feelings for her friend. The choices I seemingly had was admitting my feelings to my gf, telling her friend, or both, or simply just never telling anyone.

While thinking through this, I have started to lose feelings for her. I recognize that this could just be an instance of ""the grass is greener on the other side"" and her friend would never date me as she is very close to my gf. My feelings about her are not completely gone but I think I am able to get over it.

I am thinking about telling my gf about it because I have been dishonest when comforting her about me not having feelings for her friend. \[I do not want to tell her friend as she probably has no clue and should not be involved in my relationship problems.\] I am wondering if I should ever admit it to my gf and if so what is the best way to tell her.",07Dec2019,1

357,"A dear friend of mine for most of my life, J, passed away last year after a long illness. J and her husband, S, have been like second parents to me. They gave me money, took care of me when I was sick, and always opened their home to me without condition. S and I have spoken on the phone virtually every day since J's death, and my husband and I invited S to spend the holidays with us last year. S was clearly at sea, and he wound up staying with us nearly a month, which included all the vacation time my husband had off. S did many useful projects around the house, as he's a retired engineer and hates to sit idle. Though we were grateful for his help, by the time he left, my husband and I were exhausted. S talks relentlessly and so fast you can barely understand him. He's also of a very different political persuasion than we are, and we struggled valiantly to keep our teeth together whenever he parroted what he heard on certain network TV shows and radio programs about our current political situation. My husband is not a people person and typically dislikes house guests, particularly since most of the people who want to visit us seem more interested in the tropical area we live in than our company. However, we survived S's visit and felt happy that he didn't spend his first holiday without J alone. Later in the year, S even paid for my plane ticket so I could go to his property in a remote western state (where he and J had planned to move from their home in the midwest and where they spent summers) so I could help scatter J's ashes (and meet his new girlfriend, whom he wasted no time finding online). Now it's the holidays again, and S has all his plans together to spend them with us in what he calls ""a new tradition."" In addition, he announced that right after the holidays, he'll be flying his girlfriend down to go to a large commercial theme park in our vicinity and that they would ""get a room"" near the park for a couple of days, but they would spend the bulk of their time at our house. However, my husband flatly rejects this plan. He says he gave up his privacy and time off last year and refuses to do it again. I myself don't relish spending another few weeks with S, but because it is my nature to be codependent, I would be inclined to host S and suffer in silence. Yesterday I told S a lie, which I am very bad at doing: that my husband's parents are wanting to spend the holidays with us, and could S come after they leave? Perhaps S could go spend the holidays out west with his girlfriend and then they could come here together for their trip to the theme park? This morning S told me his girlfriend had invited him to spend the holidays with her, but he said that flights were too expensive, and that since she would be working through the holidays anyway, why should he go there when she would soon be coming here? I was so shocked that he would say such a thing to his girlfriend, especially since his bank account contains seven figures, that I left it at that and am now at a loss about to do. I realise that I've dug myself into a hole trying to make both my husband and S happy, and as a result, I'm making myself miserable. In addition, I still feel the loss of J very intensely, and though the girlfriend seems very nice, I'm not altogether comfortable folding her into my world just yet.

359,"I know that I'm not the person that would actively go out and deliberately try to hurt someone by saying something offensive or anything like that, but I do know that my mind is a bit unfiltered at times, and sometimes I find a bit too much humor in shock value. I end up saying and doing weird, quirky things, and they end up getting underneath everyone's skin. Most of the time, I really don't even end up thinking things through before I say or do the things, and it's not until way later that I can look back on the whole situation, and know exactly where I messed up. At that point, though, it's too late.

I've lost so many friends because of the way I come across, and just looking back at some of the things I did without fully thinking about it, it sickens me that certain things came out of my thoughts, and that I ended up causing them to feel a substantial amount of discomfort. Usually it's stuff like shock humor or offensive jokes, or just crude things in general, and I hate how sudden it comes out and that it takes a while for me to know what I did.

As much as I want to approach them and apologize for the things I have said and whatnot, there's really no way for me to appropriately contact them without digging. Plus, I feel like, at that point, they're better off without having to deal with me, and that maybe I should just not be around them (but it sucks that they have the memory to begin with, and that they might be worrying if I'm gonna show up again). They should just be around friends that would NOT do what I have. I want to do that, but just in case they're holding onto something I might've said or did, I don't want that to linger with them.

We often speaks and writes with him and when able to visit him or plan for him to visit us. But almost a year ago he started to tell us about some views that concerned us and raised some red flags. 


He had suddenly gotten a lot of racist view and was like ""*The muslims, coloured people are trying to take over white culture! They are slowly taking over countries and want the whites to go extinct.*"" Or stuff like ""*Trans people are an actually disease do to industry putting estrogen in our food, especially GMO food.*"" 


We asked where he heard these things and he showed a lot of those propaganda videos, fake news videos etc. etc. We were flabbergasted since he his one of most awesome persons we know and this was changed so suddenly. He never held views like that before and we have known him for over 10 years at this point. 


He didn't force his views on us but we tried to show him more reliable sources to show him how wrong they are and to tell him not everyone on YouTube or the internet for that matter is reliable. I tried to teach how you have to check at multiple sources. His new view? *Jews are responsible for the riots in Hong Kong, because they sit on the money.*


Our other friend who has known him since childhood are also deeply concerned and we have no idea what to do. We could really need some advice with how to help him realise how crazy he sounds or point us to a sub where we can get the advice/help we need.

362,"I am a boy of 15 years, ravaged by the hormonal winds of puberty, and completely head over heels for Lindsey Jordan of the indie band Snail Mail. I find myself watching every video of the live performances of the band, and I have probably seen all of her interviews. I find that at first this was just a motivating admiration crush, because I saw videos of her playing at 16 and heard she released an album at that age, and I thought ""wow! She's so cool! I should do that!"". Since then I've made it my goal to release a full album before I turn 16. I have recorded a demo EP and I am making a lot of progress learning music theory and how to record on analog equipment (cassette, 4-track, all the good stuff) and my music is sounding pretty cool (not to toot my own horn) and my room looks like a mess of music producing garbage now. But since I have no friends, and all the attempts I make to start a band fail (no one likes my type of music, too many fuckin metalheads man) I find myself daydreaming of playing with her in a garage band, and watching the early videos of snail mail and imagining myself there. It makes me really sad and I stay up at night or when I should be doing homework just playing her songs and singing with my guitar or watching live videos and looking for the places where she smiles so I can get a c r u m b of dopamine. I don't know what to do. It's gotten so bad that my family noticed and they make fun of how ""the snail woman is his girlfriend"". I keep waiting until I can see her perform live so I can tell her about how she motivated me to make music and I can give her my tape. I know this sounds dumb, but it gets hard when your hormones are like this, and it hurts to realize that real life is something entirely different.",07Dec2019,1

I read one of her msg because it was an ‚Äúok‚Äù answer text She delete me on thanksgiving day. I asked her why and she said because we didn‚Äôt talk on daily basis and that I looked exactly like her ex in appearance. 

Made plans to meet up with her after the break, I try meeting up with her on Monday the day before I got food poisoned and couldn‚Äôt get up from bed. I texted her that and told her I will meet her the next day I tried meeting up with her even though, I was sick but not as much as the day before. Texted her when I got there if she was there. She said she was at home, texted her hours later she said she was on class. Texted her 2 hours later she said she was in a review section until 10pm. Told her if she got anything to do after that and she said she got stuff to do with her friend. I got mad because at least she should had told me she would had a busy day so I wouldn‚Äôt be at campus all day. 

Then she told me started texting me inconsistent stuff and it kind of contradicted to the stuff she previously told me about why she deleted me.  At the end I starting thinking on what to do because I started to get stressed out and when I get too stress I get mad and then I become toxic. I calmed down then texted her that I wouldn‚Äôt talk to her anymore because I can‚Äôt keep up with mind games. I know deleting me was something she came up to put me as a test beside other test I didn‚Äôt mention. Anyways, I told her that since I‚Äôm graduating next semester I got projects that I got to do and that meeting her on daily basis won‚Äôt be possible and that I wasn‚Äôt going to talk to her because the stuff she put me thorough had me stress out and I want to avoid that. After explaining everything I told her as soon as I see the notification that she read my msg I would what I  do to her when people start stressing me out(block them). She read it and said she would ready later and reply. I told her I didn‚Äôt need a reply I just wanted her to read all of that.
At 4am I saw the notification and she send a msg right away, ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt read it yet.‚Äù I knew she did so in an hour. I delete everything and blocked her.

They constantly compare me to my cousin, and my brother. They say things like: ""You should learn like \[brother\], he has better grades."", and ""I like your cousin better, she at least behaves"".

I wanted to confront my parents about this, but usually they say that, they're busy, or that i need to go and learn. When they want to listen to me, they just stare, and when they do that, i just have a feeling that they will hurt or punish me.

It's my first post here and my question is serious, so few jokes are fine but I'm in desperate need for a real answer.

To put some context, I (French, 26M) am really annoyed by a German guy (24M) in the hostel I stay in New Zealand.

The thing is that I'm the receptionist of the hostel and he's working here 2 hours per day on the morning doing the cleaning to stay for free. He's also in my fucking dorm and since I'm doing the reception I can't really move.

When I'm not working and talking with other people (even if it's in french) he will still come and try to get attention from everyone and try to change the topic of the discussion, the thing is : his english is not that good, so I struggle to understand him, A LOT, which is annoying. 
And sadly even when I do understand him he's not interesting in my opinion...

Even the german girl working with us find him annoying to be fair, so I'm not the issue.

He's also joking a lot sending really bad, annoying and even rude punchlines and poking my fucking shoulder when he need attention.

He plans to stay for the whole month and it will makes me crazy, so I want to be a nice person and let him understand that he's annoying without going full French and be rude toward him (even if he is toward me).

375," I  live with my parents still, and last year I quit my job in November and went on a soul searching journey after spending 4 years saving up...I  have depression and ADHD and some social anxiety but i snap out of that  easily and take control. currently, I'm finally on meds for ADHD and depression.... but I still get really lonely...really lonely and I don't feel like I can help myself anymore or fix this person i am anymore. I am afraid to admit it but I think it's true, I don't love myself hardly at all and the only time I do. Is when a girl likes or cares about me...  Aside from that, I don't feel like I belong on earth really. I couldn't keep friends because I'm kind of a loner and the women I have dated severely hurt my self-esteem because of how many times they've betrayed me and also because....they never stay longer than 3 months. I'm, not a total lazy idiot though... I just lost the fight it feels like, and i don't know how to recover since I'm tired of my personality and my life. I can keep a job, i  can pay bills, I cook an work out and diet. I learned to repair my car and build computers and fix them, I just don't pay rent...I am smart and resourceful  I have qualities and im kind....but I feel lost.... and I'm tired of talking about it and trying to figure out wtf is wrong with me and why I  just don't give a shit about my future so much or if I die. Seriously I  don't understand it and im trying to change and do the best I can.

I  hate being lonely, I fucking hate it... I would rather feel pain and anger than be lonely. I isolate myself when I get lonely... I hate begging or fighting for attention. I also hate where I live so I don't go out and try to socialize because I hate where i live and the activities and i have driven nearly everywhere trying to find something. But I went driving tonight to look at all the people and to try to understand how it felt again? I  feel invisible and disconnected to everyone...I pretend to act like I'm human but I feel dejected like im watching people but not really there like depersonalization...I feel like I need to get away. I havent been on a plane in 11 years since I never knew where I wanted to go and nothing was appealing until recently.

But I face a challenge, my mum. See I‚Äôm the only family she has and she makes extra effort to emphasis that point so much so that she has restricted my life up till this point. She has also made it very clear how emotional she‚Äôll get if I leave. And I love my mum so I definitely don‚Äôt want her to be on that place. But she is also very toxic, especially towards my dreams and the to the identity I‚Äôm trying to form and become. She also try‚Äôs to force her beliefs n life morals onto me which I disagree with, passionately. But I don‚Äôt voice my disagreement because she just wouldn‚Äôt understand... she‚Äôs one minded, never open to other options. Anyways so that‚Äôs some of the reasons I really want to leave. But I also really care and I mean it, if I were to leave she would be devastated and I don‚Äôt want her to be like that cause I do love her and appreciate all she‚Äôs done n recognise the sacrifices she‚Äôs made. But if I stay with any longer I feel like I‚Äôll slowly suffocate and become her lil boy. 

I‚Äôve decided if I were to leave her n say fuck how she feels it‚Äôs important that I also find myself, i decided I would ghost ghost, no contacts because she would literally drag me back into her laps.

381,"- [ ] I‚Äôm Male 182cm tall (just under 6ft)  lanky slim body  framed and pale with a receding hairline so yea I‚Äôm fucked when it comes to looks. I‚Äôm a kissless virgin.And I  noticed over time I get stared at like iv got 3 heads and treated poorly by most and it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm ugly. I don‚Äôt leave the house and havnt for 4 years  except for 6 hours a week to work at a football  stadium as somebody there to help. I used to enjoy it and it made me excited to go out and do something with my day for once , but other times it‚Äôs very difficult. I always get picked for the shitty jobs (part of being ugly) and there‚Äôs times I blatantly get stared at because I‚Äôm ugly. Last week some young guy walked past me stared at me walking past it was obvious what he was thinking. Another higher up authority young guy there always stares at me a lot  and I assume it because I‚Äôm ugly and I think it is, he does it every shift and he‚Äôs nothing special either but when he‚Äôs fatally talked to me he‚Äôs seemed nice and friendly with me. and I get a lot of girls sometimes who stare me down because I‚Äôm tall and slim it happens so often too it‚Äôs made me develop an eating disorder. I don‚Äôt ever wanna leave the house for it. Just last week I was at work at that stadium job around a lot of people  and a girl and her dad was standing drinking and the girl looked at me with a blank glare (I only stared back because I thought she needed help with something as that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm there for) and she looked back up to her dad with a disgusted look on her face and said ‚Äòewwwwww god no‚Äô (I lipread her) it was ok for her as she had tons of makeup on like it was a mask covering her face tho but was quick to judge? I mean cmon I leave the house for the first time in 3 months and then that happened? Doesn‚Äôt bode well tbh. Also the there‚Äôs a guy who‚Äôs a higher up authority on my part  I work and he‚Äôs younger than me and all he does is stare at me like I have 3 heads and looks me down because I‚Äôm skinny.

I spend every birthday and Xmas alone and it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm ugly, whoever said personality matters more eh? And I‚Äôm tired of trying to help someone when it‚Äôs a women and they‚Äôre always snotty and dismissive I take it personally. Thats the most painful thing, when a women will be cold towards me even when iv not done or said anything wrong but will open up to the attractive guys even if he‚Äôs being a complete douche. 5 years ago I worked in a bar and had confidence and a good life good friends and a gorgeous girl had a crush on me but she will be the only girl who will ever like me, it will never happen again.

For me this music thing is only business, but now it has started to affect my family. My dad informed me that my 10 year-old brother is getting more and more aggressive, talking about wanting to buy a gun and robbing people. 
Since I contribute to the process of making this type of music which has influenced him, I feel a strong sense of guilt. Since I‚Äôm his biggest role-model, I have a great responsibility for him. 

My father asked me to talk to him, and persuade him that the music is all for show, and that the gang lifestyle isn‚Äôt as glamorous as shitheads like me portray it in the music. No my dad did not call me a shithead, I call myself that because I feel that I have failed my brother. 

Anyways, I assume and hope that this is a phase for him, but either way I can‚Äôt just sit back and hope that it‚Äôs soon over. Next week I‚Äôm going to visit them and have a talk with my little brother. How should I approach this and have a productive face 2 face talk with him?

My first thought was maybe matching bracelets for me and her? She wouldnt like anything like a pamper or spa day or anything like that. 

Any idea's are welcome if you'd be kind enough to suggest something! Thank you in advance :)",07Dec2019,1

He's been helping me alot with my mental health issues and my physical health hes the kindest person I've ever met and ive never felt like this before. I can't look him in the eyes and if I do I get really embarrassed and get really shaky. Last time I asked him out I didn't say it like ""will u go out of me"" I worded it really weird and he didn't understand me (this was in March or April) I've never been someone to say alot about people and share my emotions but I feel like to show him my feels I'll need to por my heart out to him.",07Dec2019,1
398,"Where do I start with this, I've been through a lot this year I really can't wait for it to end

For the first time in my life I found actual friends, friends I thought I could live and trust, they made me feel happy as I never fit in with them but they made me feel this sense of belonging

I'm a lot younger than all of them, effeminate, not into sports and music, I don't drink or do drugs like they do, but they still accepted me in spite of that

My mother even noticed I became a happier person, she noticed I started to laugh and not complain about my loneliness to her 

It really made her happy

All of a sudden everything started to change we had a group called 'THE FAMILY' on WhatsApp, that's the main chat app over here, next thing I know everyone stops chatting on it and I find out that another group chat was create on imessage, them knowing fully well that I'm the only one using an android device

They start to exclude me from everything and anything, they hang out, go to each others houses without me paintball and all

Something funny happens on their new gc, they post their chats on their WhatsApp status for everyone to see, everyone who knows us as friends will know I'm not a part anymore

It became to embarrassing, that I left them totally, their whatsapp group chat and all, we don't talk anymore at all if they aren't the first to say hey I don't, no smiles, nothing, after the while thing settled cause it lead to some small fights none of them message me or ring me up, people I called family

Only for me to find out it was all planned

That broke me to be honest, never knew things like this happened outside the television screen

How can a group of people plan bad against someone they called their brother and none of their consciences could hit them

How?

I've been asking myself if I could really do that to them

I feel so worthless, like all what we've been through together has been flushed down the toilet, everything are people really like this?

I feel like ice started developing bigotry towards their tribe since I'm the only one of a different culture because of this  (we are all of the sane race and nationality)

I feel I'm going back into depression, it's been long I've cried but I'm doing it right now

399,"I'm going to make this short as possible. If i give all the details, it'll be a book, so please ask if you have questions. 

I (28f) work with my bf (37m) at a customer service heavy job and it makes me resent him while I'm there. He has a bad attitude when it comes to them, he feels they always wrong him, even if it's something small like not saying hello back to him or not letting him assist them. He always takes it personally even though he claims he doesn't. 

I always hear about it, so if it doesn't bother you, why does it get back to me? Well he usually says something like that he doesn't really care about what happened or that effects the tips he makes etc. Basically bullshit. It's seriously every work day, the whole day. No 'hey sweetie, how are you?' Or ' what do you want to do this weekend?'. It's always 'You wont believe the group of people i just had blah blah blah'. 

I can't stand it. He says he's just venting or making jokes but most of it is offensive or down right racist. When he says all this stuff to me, it negatively effects me. It slowly degrades my mood till i snap at him. I try to sympathize, but i wont lie. If he creates a problem, i tell him. If he's being the asshole or flat out not showing any understanding or sympathy for a situation, i tell him. And he takes offense! He feels like im taking their side or whatever. 

Idk. It's taking a toll on my mental health at work and hurting our relationship on work hours. At home, things are great as long as he doesn't bring up work. He treats me great and always takes care of me. But I don't want to work with him anymore. It's ruining my opinion of him while we are there. 

We've had many talks about this and I'm convinced i just need to change shifts. I'll never see him, but at least i can be happy at work? Idk. Fuck!

405," Hi guys, I need some awesome help please.... I'm desperate

I had a family member around who was having hard time, they stayed for 3 or so days. They stayed in our spare bedroom. Problem is, as it turns out, they were living of sulfur and raw garlic the whole time, and no I don't know why (it's like one of those situations from mums groups?). We did offer food. They wanted space, we gave space. We were not at home long because of work and overtime, they don't have a job. As the days went on, there was an extremely strong smell of raw garlic throughout the whole house. We did mention it, but what can you do. 'You smell'?....they are having a hard time in their personal life. After they left, we set to work with opening every single window and door in the house to create the world's best wind tunnel and this was so effective for all but one room. The guest room. Now, we are re-decorating and ALL of our clothes were in this room and many other random items from rooms we have needed to clear. And massive teddy bears. To put this bluntly, this room f'king reeks. Not just the room, every single thing in the room. The bed, the mattress, duvet cover, our friggin box of all duvet covers, pillows, covers. Every single item of clothing. A few enormous teddys (like those you win at carnivals). A treadmill, boxes under bed with various items. Just a lot of stuff piled on top of each-other and under the bed.

Things I've tried:

Air purifier with HEPA filter which I use for my pet rats in the living room (it's pricey and effective, but this is a new challenge for it),

A bowl of soda bicarbonate,

A bowl of vinegar.

Just.. air from outside using the window.

We have so far piled a lot of clothes that have been touched, and they stink, from around the house and they are currently in little piles queued up in front of the washing machine. This is an approx 5 loads of washing. These aren't even from the spare bedroom. I have already said we are keeping an eye on our bills because we can't afford to spend right now. If I keep going with the washing machine, it's going to cost a fortune and most likely, a new washing machine. If I start putting everything in that room with the washing machine, we are going to be in real problems with our money. I didn't expect this when I agreed for them to stay. We are exhausted from all the work and overtime this week. This is just not something you expect when you agree for a family member to stay around. Please can anyone offer any ideas to rid the raw garlic...and sulfur smell from this room? I will be forever grateful. Thank you.",07Dec2019,1

408,"A couple months ago my partner and I moved in to a unit together.
There are 6 units, they are in a U formation with a shared laundry room in the middle. 
Everyone‚Äôs washing machines are in there and the power to them is controlled by a switch in our own units.
Our unit shares one wall with the laundry.
Not long after moving in we were kept awake from 11pm onwards by a beeping noise coming through the wall from the laundry.
I let myself into the laundry and saw it was our immediate neighbours machine beeping over and over, it wasn‚Äôt washing so it seemed it was signalling the cycle had ended.
I turned the power button on the machine off.
It happened again late the next night.

So when I got home the next day I wrote a note, I tried to make it sound friendly so hopefully it didn‚Äôt come across passive aggressive...

‚ÄúHello :)
Our unit appears to share a wall with your washing machine, so when it is left on over night the beeping comes straight into our bedroom.
If you wouldn‚Äôt mind turning the power off after use in the evenings, that would be great!
Thanks :)
____&amp;___, unit 5‚Äù

The next day it didn‚Äôt happen so we hoped for the best.

For the last month she has left it on overnight and also during the day (my partner has been off work sick recently)
A few times I‚Äôve gone in and turned the machine off for my own sanity, but I shouldn‚Äôt have to (Also I have to get my keys out and unlock the laundry door etc so it‚Äôs not super quick to do)

I can‚Äôt think of why our neighbour would do this unless she really dislikes us for some reason?
I haven‚Äôt even met her properly though because I‚Äôve never seen her outside her unit.

And if it‚Äôs about laziness, the main power switch is in her unit so she could just turn it off there..

The groundskeeper/handyman that also lives here mentioned that she knows that it ‚Äòannoys us yet leaves it on‚Äô - but he is very dramatic/gossipy so I think he‚Äôs just saying that without actually knowing that‚Äôs the case.

Have I missed something?

409,"Trying to get back into the dating scene (I'm male), but I'm having a really difficult time doing that. 

I'm running into a problem where everyone that I end up talking to online doesn't respond after the end of the night. Most of the time, the conversation just stops after some text from me and they never respond, other times I say good night to them and i never hear back from them after that. I usually don't text back the next morning and wait to hear back from them, because I worry about looking weird and bothering the person if they have already moved on.

I'm not really good at holding conversations too well, but I try my hardest to keep them going when talking to someone and making it interesting, while also showing them that I'm interested in hearing what they have to say about themselves. A good amount of people dont mind talking to me about that, until afterwards when I try to keep the conversation going and they just dont say much or say nothing at all.

412,"I used to weigh around 70kgs but in the past 3 years I‚Äôve put about 40kgs on. At the end of September I bought an Apple Watch to help me track my weight loss. For about 2 months before I got it I was walking at least 30 minutes everyday but I hadn‚Äôt immediately noticed any weight loss. Fast forward to the end of October and I looked physically slimmer both in my stomach and in my face and I was getting comments about it saying I was looking better. However the scale has not moved since November LAST year (before I started exercising). And now since November I‚Äôve started to look puffier and even bigger (my weight has only gone up by 1-3 kgs to around 112kgs) even though I am eating considerably less. I still eat fast food probably 2 times a week however I no longer eat ice cream, chocolate and lollies everyday like I used to. Seriously I could not go a day without buying a block of chocolate and eating a McFlurry before bed. My portion sizes are smaller as well and instead of going back for seconds or thirds I am easily satiated by one serving. Overall I am eating a whole lot less.

I continue to go to the gym every night and do treadmill walking (about 7kms and hour) for about 60 minutes. I can really only do light/ moderate cardio (so no running) because I injured my knee at the beginning of the year and it is now impaired.

418,"So I‚Äôve been with my girlfriend for a little over a year now, but so much drama has ensued over the past year. When I first started talking to her, I didn‚Äôt know she had been with a guy (who is my work lead and asshole boss) ((fwb)) who basically raped her and kept sleeping with her due to her depression and inability to stand up for herself, and even kept photos of her ‚Äòjust in case‚Äô. I found about all of this a couple of months into the dating part of the relationship when he found out about us and started obsessing over her. He called/texted/hanged out with her all the time for about a month and even tried to propose to her and take her on vacation. 

She said no to all of this but had to take a break from both sides until finally she broke down to me that she hated what he did to her and wanted to be rid of him. A couple of weeks later of us figuring things out we decided to make ourselves official and have been going about things like any normal relationship.

The recent problems I feel have been coming up have been due to my views on our relationship. I feel as if she is just ‚Äúusing me‚Äù, I guess, because she enjoys the way I‚Äôve treated her over her other ex‚Äôs. I always put a 100% into my relationship but it feels like I‚Äôm just getting 70% from her. She says she loves me and has never felt like this for someone. Also that I am her most influential person in her life, and that I have completely changed her way of thinking (she does smile a lot more from when I first met her), but at what point is that true, and how realistic is all of this?

My question comes from the fact that I‚Äôve been trying to get over the fact that my asshole boss, whom I‚Äôve hated for a long time, was the guy who did all of this to her. Like what is a man supposed to feel when your worst enemy was her first intimate experience? She says she‚Äôs gotten over him, but I feel like it‚Äôs distanced me from her and I always feel paranoid with no reason. I‚Äôve had a couple of cheated on past relationships so I figure that‚Äôs where it comes from but I‚Äôm not too sure anymore.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

419,"Hi, I‚Äôm a college student living in Korea, and I‚Äôve been experiencing some weird supernatural things lately. 

I was planning to go to Europe as an exchange student of 5 months in January next year. Already got the admission letter and accommodation and everything. 

The process was pretty rocky, honestly. Due to some misunderstandings I wasted hours of time and hundreds of dollars, and had to argue with my parents a few times. A few more similar issues happened, and believe me, the whole thing was absolutely chaotic.

These happenings really confused and upset me because I usually never make these kinds of mistakes. I‚Äôm a careful person. I joked about this to my friends saying that ‚Äòthe universe is conspiring against me‚Äô. Turns out this joke was way more significant than I thought.

Today I was walking to a caf√© to meet a friend when a random girl my age suddenly grabbed my arm from behind. When I turned around to look, I noticed that she was looking pretty shaken- she was visibly trembling and looked upset. Then she proceeded to tell me that ‚Äòher spiritual eye is open‚Äô, to which I promptly noped out. I tend to attract a lot of Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses. To my surprise, when I tried to walk away she kept clinging to me almost desperately. What she said next honestly left me pale. 

She told me that &lt;If I cross over the skies or the seas in the near future, there will be a terrible consequence.&gt; I was dumbfounded and asked her what was the consequence, and she said she didn‚Äôt know. All she could tell me was that at the exact moment I walked past her, her vision went completely dark for a second and she collapsed to her knees, overcome with a incredibly strong premonition of bad things happening to me if I went abroad. Before I could ask anything more, she just told me to be very careful and walked away.

You might be wondering why I‚Äôm overacting over a single encounter with a street prophet. The thing is, this is not the first time this happened to me. I had almost the exact same experience a few months ago.

This wasn‚Äôt my first attempt at an exchange program, actually. I had applied for another university back a few months ago, to which I would have left July this year, if things hadn‚Äôt gone south. Like today, I had been experiencing some sense of uneasiness, and a random person had approached me in the streets and told me that I‚Äôm not supposed to go abroad yet, and that God had prepared better things for me in Korea. I‚Äôm Christian and after some consideration and prayer, this made me give up on the opportunity and stay in Korea- which was one of the great decisions of my life, honestly. 

With all honesty, I‚Äôm shaken up and scared. Hearing almost the exact same prophecy(?) in same situations, from complete strangers is freaking me out. Do you think I should follow this supernatural sign and give up this opportunity, or persist in my original plans?

Any advice will be appreciated, religious or non-religious.

My father passed away very abruptly due to a brain tumour recently. 

Now, I haven‚Äôt been close to my dad for over 10 years due to how he treated me when I was younger but the moment I heard he was dying I went to see him. In that 10 year period he managed to find a girlfriend who has a child herself and had been living with her for roughly the past 2-3 years.

I‚Äôm a bit biased but her actions have really made me suspicious of her authenticity. From telling my dad what to say in a private phone conversation between him and I. To refusing to communicate in regards to getting my siblings toys from there dads to keep at home as memories and flat out telling me how it‚Äôs none of my concern when my siblings and I couldn‚Äôt  visit our dying father because she refused to communicate again. 

As my dads condition got worse so did the communication as he was no longer fit to communicate. This was further exacerbated by my dads side of the family only communicating with his GF and not me; his eldest and of age son. Which left me out of the loop a lot and by extension my siblings who are all under 15 years old.

Eventually my dads health took a dive and in 2 days he was gone. The funeral came and went and I heard from relatives that my dad has sat down with my uncle and done a will. A month passes after the funeral and I still haven‚Äôt had word regarding the will. 

I honestly don‚Äôt care about receiving any sort of assets. I didn‚Äôt like the guy, but I didn‚Äôt hate him and at the end of the day he was my dad. 

it feels wrong for me to take anything after being out of his life for so long. but I feel I need to pursue this for my sisters who did love him and did see him regularly the thought of a GF getting his stuff over his own children just boggles my mind and since no one bothered to contact me regarding the will I feel I need to pursue it. 

I just don‚Äôt know if I should.  I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs right morally and I don‚Äôt know if it will even achieve anything. I‚Äôm just so tired of all the fighting over a mans deathbed.",07Dec2019,1

What the fuck? You want your daughter to drop out of school at the very end to join the military, literally just fucking scum. How can I help her if they say no?

428,"i‚Äôve been mentally unstable for 3 years and let me tell you why.

In the summer of 2016 my dad got diagnosed with anxiety and depression after he got made redundant at his old job. And after that everything went so downhill.

He tried to commit suicide by cutting his wrists in his car and he always says ‚Äúit was a cry for help‚Äù but i know it wasn‚Äôt, he wanted to die.

And ever since then he‚Äôs been very angry constantly, arguing with my mum.  Everyone thinks he needs to see a doctor again as he thinks that he‚Äôs being fixed by god. 

My friends know all about it, but they never ask me if i‚Äôm okay when something happens at home. They always moan at me for being moody and shit and they don‚Äôt even think about me",07Dec2019,1
429,"So there is this guy that I‚Äôve been talking in discord for the last month, more exactly we‚Äôre in a common group. The guy friends that I talk to in this group also have a bigger group (server) consisting of only boys and not girls. Now, the guy that I mentioned above almost stays in our server all the time to talk,play and  he is not giving too much attention to the other group of friends(big group with boys). Here comes the misunderstanding: one of my friends slipped that some boys have said that the guy I‚Äôve been talking to is being a total di*khead because he is only spending time with that girlfriend of his. To clear some misunderstandings, no we‚Äôre not in a relationship but we spend time together because we play video games (it‚Äôs not only us two, with other people) and I don‚Äôt like him and I‚Äôm pretty sure he doesn‚Äôt too, we‚Äôre just friends. Now this thing, even if it‚Äôs not a really grand problem, it‚Äôs really bothering me because I have a shitty personality that all minor comments or negative impressions/thoughts you can have about me, affect me really badly. I only know the boys from name and have never talked to them so now I think that they have a really bad impression about me and I don‚Äôt like this. I‚Äôm also overthinking about what other things they have been thinking about me and it‚Äôs making me feel very low. It sucks and I can‚Äôt solve it so spending more time with this guy will make things worse, so I‚Äôve decided to distance myself for a while. I don‚Äôt want to be that person who divides their group and makes them fight. I want some opinions about the situation or what I can do.

430,"Long story short, I left company card info on a small note paper at my desk when I had meant to destroy it after completing a transaction. I got pulled into a late meeting yesterday which made me late leaving work, so I rushed off, and then at 10pm last night I just remembered it's sitting there on my desk. 

I'm supposed to have keys to my office but they keep forgetting to cut them for me - so I have no way to get in there. The office will be locked all weekend, but the thought of that info lying there is making me freak out. I can't remember if I left it in view or if it's tucked in/under my notebook.

I have a coworker who is very kind and empathetic and lives close to work - I'm thinking of asking to borrow her keys quickly so I can go in, destroy the paper, and have done with it. Only issue is she is nosy so what if she tells my boss? I could be flayed alive for leaving this around. And I feel like a horrible person for texting her on the weekend. I know it's a white lie, but I was thinking of telling her I left my wallet in the office and need to check?

435,"I've been with my bf for over a year. He has two groups of friends. The first group I feel liked and included. The second group I feel disliked and excluded.

His first group of friends invited me to join a campaign that's been going on for like 3 years. I learned the world and the people involved, and I'm having a lot of fun. My bf goes to the second group of friends place to play games every week and I'm not invited. Like actually not invited, not just that I don't go, they don't want me there. 

So I talked to my bf about it and told him how I feel like they don't like me. Every time I bring it up he tries to convince me they do. My argument is, ""then why don't they want me to play with them?"" I asked to join their games and he talked to them, they said I can join. Well, two campaigns have started since then and I'm still not invited. Once again I talk to my bf about it. He said it's because I'm only joining if he's running the campaign, which I don't see happening for a long time. I said, ""it doesn't feel fair and I feel unwanted, they don't like me."" to which he replied, ""yes they like you."" I'm not convinced.

They've invited the two of us to a new year's party, but I don't feel comfortable going. I want them to get to know me better, but after a year of this I don't particularly want to be friends with them. They can be mean to each other, and one gave me a snarky remark in my own home, which really put me off. 

I feel like a whiny child and I don't know what to do, I want to be included, but I also don't want it to be forced. If they don't like me, I want to know so that I can let my bf have fun and not question anymore. I like definitive answers, whether I like the outcome or not, at least I'm assured in the end.

He broke up with me because he said he couldn't feel anything, he felt like he was broken because he couldn't develop strong feelings towards me and he didn't feel like he could develop strong feelings towards anyone, all he wants to do is cry and drink and sleep.

Obviously I'm hurt, but I also care about this man outside of a romantic context. I'm worried about him. He said he didn't want me to hate him or break off contact with him, but he also said he doesn't want me to hold out hope at all and that if he suspects I am holding out hope then he will do the ""right thing"" and remove himself from my life so I can move on.

I already talked to him about therapy, but he doesn't want that. I am considering offering him the same thing I offer all my friends: a shoulder to cry on and an ear to vent to. I won't guide the conversation, but I do want him to vent about being hurt by that girl and feeling so bad that he feels like he's broken. Maybe he'll be more open to that idea? He already cried in front of me during our breakup, so I think there are so emotional walls that have come down between us already.

I don't know whether to talk to him through text, call, or in person.

Any advice on how I can help this man?",07Dec2019,1

442,"So this my first post here, IDC if I have identifiable info. But anyways, me and let's say Jane were best friends since 3rd grade. I'm 20 now as she is too, so like 10 years of a very close freinship; we were more like family. I struggle with manic depression BP 1 and earlier this year I had a severe manic episode and ended up hospitalized. When I came out I was still not stable. In my mania I blocked her out anger stemming from an argument about my on and off relationship at the time. I then posted on Snapchat a story saying I was done with snakes and fake people not directly identifying her or anyone. Somehow it got back to her through some random girl from HS and this random girl decided to call me very hurtful things referencing my apperence and proceeded to say my friend cut me off. I was beyond anger and said some awful things back through her Instagram dm. She deleted what she wrote and screenshotted the responded message and sent that to my friend. This is where it gets really messy. So my friend messeges me through Instagram (still have her number blocked) and proceeds to tell me I'm way off my rocker and how dare I talk to women like that. We get into a very serious argument over text after she blocks me through Instagram and take some very deep personal jabs at each other. So I basically tell her to f off and that I hated her and proceed to block her for a final time. 

She then messeges my MOTHER saying that if I come anywhere near her or harass her at all she will place a personal restraining order on me. I was even more manic and furious at this point. She doubles down and says she is screenshotting our messages for evidence. I tell her I'm not scared and to f off again. 

This is it, our friendship is over and I can move on...wrong. later that night she post on FB a screenshot of some of the messages I sent her, calling her name's and whatnot ; making sure to not include what she said to me the past hour and so on. In addition, the screenshoted responded message from the random HS girl with her @ cropped out!  So it looks like I'm the only person saying nasty terrible things that still haunt me to this day. The post gets 50 + hate comments asking for my location IRL and she @'s my Instagram and other social media. 

I deactivate everything, and am horrified because I look like the biggest piece of trash in the world. I quit school because of the embarrassment and also because of dealing with my diagnosis and proceed to loose all of my other close friends in that friend group. 

Now fast forward to today. I get an email titled I miss you and please come back. Saying she has tried everything to get ahold of me and everyone has and to please call and text her. I learn that my mother had been secretly in contact with her since JUNE then in AUGUST and in NOVEMBER. All messages about how she misses me and wants to get over everything because life isn't the same without me. 

I don't know what to do, I am lost because this entire time I thought she hated my guts and didn't ever really care for me. So these past 9 months I have been isolated from the world, no friends, in the darkest depression of my entire life. I miss her too and I don't know what to do or how to go about this situation.

At first i tried to ignore her which made her even more angry. Then i started getting mad back at her and cussing and telling her to stop talking to me. After that she would go to other co workers and mock me and make fun of me where she knew i could hear it. One time another coworker told her she needs to stop yelling at me and that her advice was wrong but that didnt stop her.

Eventually I told the manager that I couldnt work with her and he seperated us. That worked for awhile but then this lady began to come over to my work station on her breaks and yell at me and move around the tools i was using just to bother me. 

I had to stop going to that job and i feel like a loser but the job itself was demanding enough without constantly being belittled and talked to like a child, I was constantly fighting back the urge to smash my tools over this ladys head and would have had to spend 50 hours a week around her if I stayed and I just couldnt handle it.

My mom seems to think it is that period of the month.But could that cause THAT big of a mood swing?

I really do care about people and i am also feeling like shit myself.

Should I message her friend and try to see whats wrong?Or just give her some space and let her work it out alone?Again,I did nothing wrong that maybe she could be mad at me for.But if i am not guilty,i am receiving all the hate that comes out of it.

He asked me what was I doing? And I told him just some homework. I asked what about him? He told me ‚ÄúUh something‚Äù this just turned the table. I‚Äôm so confused on why he told me this. I knew what he was doing since this happened so many times before. I was shocked I thought that he shouldn‚Äôt be telling me this cuz like I thought he didn‚Äôt wanna be sexual with me anymore but I guess he changed his mind. Then the next day we are texting like normal and he asked what am I doing? I told him ‚Äújust something‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt actually doing it I wanted to see what he would say. He asked ‚ÄúDo you want to see my cock?‚Äù OH MY GOD! I thought we were done with this! I mean I‚Äôm not complaining I‚Äôm just confused. I know I should be asking him what he wants but I want to see what you guys think. Is this sexting if we‚Äôre sending nudes back and fourth? I‚Äôm not sending anything he is tho. So what is this? I guess he changed his mind about sexting me again. He‚Äôs being so nice to me ever since we started talking again.",07Dec2019,1

‚ÄúHi,

Just to let you know i have competed the application form for you and it will be taken to the employer ‚Ä™on Friday this week‚Ä¨. Best of luck with your interviews tomorrow
 
Kind regards‚Äù

When I attended it a guy who works with her came over to me with the application form and asked me if it was my handwriting and I said no and he gave me a blank one to fill out. Why did she fill it out then I don‚Äôt understand",07Dec2019,1
464,"My sister is a bit of a trainwreck... it pains me to say that but I feel like if my close-knit family members don't intervene it's going to come crashing down. 

My sister is a single 32yo working her ass off all the time.  She does not work productively but rather does bits of work throughout all hours of the day.  She essentially is married to her work and its all she talks about although we don't really care about Susan from HR or John from contracts... She has constant racing thoughts, to the point where a 45 min phone call is only her talking nearly nonsensically. In my opinion (non-medical) she started to show signs of bipolar or major depression earlier in her 20s, but was prescribed adderall and xanax for adhd and depression - I think this was incorrect and lazy on her family doc. 

She's worked for 4 companies in 5 years and every job ends the same way - her thinking all her coworkers don't know anything, the company is terrible to work for, and she's better off somewhere else.  Delusions of supremacy imo. 

Aside from the work debacle, she is awful with finances despite making 80-110k over the years. She always has urges to buy a quick coffee or snack and barely eat/drink any of it.  She can't hold roommates or maintain a steady location (6 different roommates and 8 different apartments over 10 years).  She always thinks the other person is in the wrong on everything - this was not something that she exhibited until her early mid-20s. 

Last bits... She disrespects my parents all of the time (we are loving and my dad is the sweetest guy you'll meet). She lost ALL her friends over the years. She keeps moving to different cities trying to escape and reset.  She is irritable beyond belief.  She is extremely moody, sleeps terribly or in long stints, and is abnormally wired OR slurs her speech. 

**Advice request**:  How do we talk to someone across the country who exhibits a lot of signs of mental illness but can't take advice or listen well?  I think she needs to see a psychotherapist to figure out whats going on before she leaves her most recent company and moves to another random city. 

Thank you.",07Dec2019,1
466,"Hi everyone...I'm not American but European (NOT UK NOR GERMANY), so maybe my job market may be a little different...but I'm interested in every answer!

I posted a very long post last week, but now I tried to make it shorter

I'm a very confused and indecisive person (currently studying business), as I have plenty of things that I'm interested in, but unfortunately I cannot try all of them, and can't decide the one I wanna do...I can only choose one or two...and maybe I won't be actually good to the one I choose

My TRUE dream is to work in the media/showbiz someway (not as an accountant, payroll or smth like that) inspiring people with communication and information trough movies and The internet...I got some ""messages"" to convey...but I need to find a stable job first and Idk if I could really fit in that super competitive and unstable world



#Here is something about me

Skills and Cons


&gt; ‚Ä¢ _Observing people and Listening, to people's problems, understanding when something is wrong and what someone thinks quite easily, linking behaviours to experiences and ""environment""_



&gt; ‚Ä¢ _Overthinking and Relying on Data and experiences to make the best choices...I actually like relying on Data and Statistics_



&gt; ‚Ä¢ _Planning (also event planning) and finding and elaborate strategies (even business ones) before action



&gt; ‚Ä¢ _Curiosity: Asking tons of questions...I like Q&amp;As and surveys_



&gt; _LOVE Talking and Debating (or be a part of a debate), expecially about social topics (suicide, unemployement, economics, enviornment) and mass media; I would talk for hours_

&gt; ‚Ä¢ _Sensitive and emphatetic, and I'd like to make people emphatize with all the overlooked and depressed people, or at least, I would like to made them feel not alone_


&gt; _‚Ä¢ Storyteller at heart, I'd love to tell something trough movies and cartoons, nowdays one expecially, analyzing and how they tell people awesome and relatable stories inspiring (I don't want to draw, but to write)_


&gt; ‚Ä¢ _Creative and Immaginative person_ 

&gt; _‚Ä¢ Aesthetic sense, as I always try to beautify things and people, trying to find the best and most appealing qualities!_

&gt; _‚Ä¢ Using Photography (Including food styling and room design) and Film/Videos, my favourite form of art! I find beauty and the essence of things with them_

&gt; ‚Ä¢ _Big picture person, Finding the ""hidden connections"" behind things completely unrelated to each other_


&gt; _‚Ä¢ Open Minded and innovative_


&gt; _‚Ä¢ Future ""forecasting"", I usualy make lots of predictions that turn out true, after studying and observing situations_


&gt; _‚Ä¢ Diplomacy: I always try to listen and understand both parts_ 

&gt; _‚Ä¢ Passion about the things I love and love to do...If I'm doing something I enjoy I could work for it even during the whole night without stopping_

&gt; _‚Ä¢ Deep and phylosophical thinking_

~

#Now some that are definitely CONs


‚Ä¢ Laziness

‚Ä¢ Not very good with manual work...I'm VERY clumsy

‚Ä¢ I hate routine and ""old fashined"" jobs!

‚Ä¢ Squishy and I don't love to get my hands too dirty

‚Ä¢ Fragile and anxious. I don't like being around too many people, expecially tough/macho or cynical/careless people; I hate fights

‚Ä¢ Giving up and pessimism: I am almost unable to do a things I hate and I tend to get depressed and demotivated really easily when I fail multiple times...I can work on this tho

#Finally

‚Ä¢ Caring a lot about my Wealth and money, and about having a job that can pay me well on the long run...so I need a good job where I can use those """"skills"""" I listed above, trying to work on the Cons

Oh...also

‚Ä¢ Not very good at theoretical Math and at super complex calculations and formulas

I'm good with excercises and analysis, but I don't think I'll enjoy a job where I would use hig level Math everyday...like very HIG level; I like more to write and to combine words with numers than using just letters and numbers


So, as I said I've got many things I like, but I'm currently studying business, but I don't know if I have to change or not; 

#Here are some ot the things I considered:


„Äã Computer Science: I love videogames (game design and world building/characters) and Apps...are there other ways I can work in the industry or give my contribute? 


„Äã Physics/Astronomy: I love Space I tought about studying physics to understand it more along with understanding how our whole universe works!

„Äã Biotecgnology/Biochem: expecially for Food/perfume chemistry, I'd love to make one or to understand what's behind them.

„Äã Management Engineering or Biomedical one...mostly for the money tho, and because it's easier (Management) than other engineerings (In MY country...idk in other ones)

„Äã Medicine: it really come close to neuroscience, and there are also part of it I'd like to explore, like biology, medical physics, legal medicine, statistic medicine...I know I'm squishy, but at least there, I can work on that

„Äã Psychology: I think this doesn't need a presentation...I love observing and understanding people

„Äã Communication/Mass Media: I tought about going to a film school, but my Counry doesn't have them and I'm noy interested in Film STUDIES...going to an international one looks impossible, so with Communication being a wider field 

„Äã Switching to Economics

„Äã Statistics

„Äã Design: I love animation, but I don't love to draw thousands of pages, more like: writing a show...but this could teach me something

~

Basing on what the things I told about me, 

‚Ä¢ Which of theese do you think I should scrap or rely to an hobby? 

‚Ä¢ Which one do you think suits my being most? 

‚Ä¢ What job overall I may be more suited for? 

‚Ä¢ Could I be suited to work in mass media/showbiz given all those informations?

I was Thinking about...


#Neuroeconomics/marketing

I love society, statistics data and Psychology...I'd love to use psychology but reach many more people out there....understand, cure them on a bigger picture! But idk about THIS Path

But maybe there is a path Not involving psychology I could fit in more...psychology is not very lucrative where I live, even with a Master

The best thing is to learn from people knowing about the ""careers-world"" and how the market works, what I'm not suited for and where I could do an actually good job...that's why I'm asking...Please tell me a specific area if you can, not the ""thinker"" jobs, ""doer"" jobs...Telling me 2 or 3 specific fields (like Psych,Med,Engineering etc) can help...even more if it's just one or a specific job!


Thanks a lot! (And please, don't be harsh...)",07Dec2019,1

I really dont think anything of the girl,she can be considared good looking i guess but i dont think i ever showed her a singal that im interested,but im also way too inexpierienced since i never had any relationship before to know how someone gets a [message.](https://message.Im)

I had an appointement today to ask questions but she just canceled it out last momment,I asked when is it ok to do it,or can you do it by phone?She said tommorow after 15 mins,then i noticed her replies just take like a few mins and she always ends with pulling the last word.She also used a winky face and a smiley face in her tectthe day before which i didnt really though anyhting off, but i really dont get it,is she somehow singaling me that she doesnt want to hang out with me anymore and just get over with it and make the application,i mean i just want my questions answered why does it have to be so akward?Did she use the winky face or smiley face to somehow hookbite me into applying by thinking she is interested and i should try to please her?I dont have great social skills and im terrible or just to scared to pick up singals cause i may get the wrong picture.

What do you think,any opinions?Am i ignorant,i really dont want to be taken advantage off,she doesnt seem like she geniunly cares much or wants to help,or maybe its my ingorant side and she actually try-Omg SHE ACTUALLY JUST SEND ME  NOW A FLIRTEMOEGY  AGAIN WHAT IM I SUPPOSED TO RESPOND WITH",07Dec2019,1

Sometimes I'll say something about someone like persay, ""Hey, you're really short haha"" in a sarcastic way but sometimes I tease them too much. Just think of a joke just told 100 times over and over again. And I'll only realise that I was a dick soon after the whole situation blows over and regret. But if I pull it up to apologise to that friend, I'm scared that maybe I'll make things awkward like who knows, maybe they didn't think it was serious but instead I was making it seem like a serious issue. 

I also have the same issue with when someone gets upset or not. Sometimes I'll tease them to the point where they'll tell me to stop but I just can't read if they're serious or not and just continue on. It ends up with them being upset after the 5th or 6th time I teased them over something.

It's not an excuse to say that I don't understand because I really don't. And I really want to change that because I don't want to be known as a dick of a friend to other people who likes to tease people. I don't want to lose friends. 

I just have a rough time understanding when is the right time to do what and how much can I do the thing ig. Idk how else to explain it.

477,"So there‚Äôs this problem I‚Äôve been having and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm a 25M just trying to look for some peace right now and it has been working for a bit but now it‚Äôs gone. 
I‚Äôve been doing well for about 2 maybe 3 weeks now, could be more I don‚Äôt even remember; working more hours to keep busy, hanging out online with my friends, spending more time with my family and so on. I would say I have been keeping my mind from drifting else where. (I have depression and anxiety) my life hasn‚Äôt been controlled by these two factors for majority of my life, but this year seems to have taken it to a whole new level for me. About a month ago I went and did what I thought I would never of had the strength to do; I removed everything I had; all remains, of my ex. We broke up a very long time ago; I can‚Äôt even remember how long or when, but that relationship hasn‚Äôt been a good one for me. I‚Äôve had good and bad moments but I‚Äôve always looked for the better and ignored the bad. This was my first relationship ever btw. 
Anyways I thought I had moved on, and for a split second I did. She wasn‚Äôt on my mind, I haven‚Äôt done anything that would bring me back to her. I‚Äôve kept my distance. But recently I thought about her again. I think I still love her, and I know I shouldn‚Äôt since I found out she used me on multiple occasions but why can‚Äôt I let go? Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I don‚Äôt constantly check up on her social media anymore nor have the urge to try to see her or contact her but I feel like there is a missing piece of me. My chest feels like it‚Äôs empty.

479,"Hey. My parents used to be poor but my dad was a computer geek. So I grown up to be a computer geek too. When I was young, every single game I played amazed me no matter the graphics or story. I could find small things to enjoy myself and I loved gaming. 6 years ago I finally bought a gaming pc with gtx970 in it. I could play every game at ultra settings at that time and I loved it. But as time passed (Im 18 now), I started to get bored a lot faster to the point I don't remember I finished a game in like 2 years. I start playing, I like the game but I can't finish them. Generally I quit at the last quarter where I've achieved characters peak skill level. The only game I still play and enjoy is League. I think it is because I've learned it when I didn't get bored so easy and my goal is to promote to a better league so i dont get bored because I still have some things to achieve.

In the other hand, I can't stand learning new games with the exception of Paradox games. I've played overwatch for 100ish hours and I don't want to play it anymore because I'm not that great and I generally suck at competitive. ""Then don't play competitive"" you say, but like I said, I get bored when I dont have anything to achieve. I quit Forza Horizon 4 after all seasons ended and there were nothing I could achieve, I quit Outer Words, I quit Jedi Fallen Order, I quit Cuphead, I quit Hyperlight Drifter, I quit No Mans Sky, I quit The Long Dark and the list goes on and these are decent games for a big portion of gaming community. As far as I remember, the last games I finished was Metro Exodus and Metal Gear Solid V (didn't play second chapter since it was the same).

Are there any advice you can give me? Any games you can suggest? I still love gaming but I get bored so quickly that I started to think im spending money for nothing. Are games started to become boring or am I going through a adulting process? HELP!",07Dec2019,1

487,"I won't bore you with too many details. We are 23M/24F, met on tinder, hit it off insanely well, and immediately rolled into an emotionally intimate, exclusive thing that was never a REAL relationship with labels and stuff but the feelings were there. For me at least. I don't know if I can believe that anything he said to me was real or not anymore so idk. 

Basically he dumped me like trash after 3.5 months because he wasn't ready to date again (had HUGE ex drama, I know I'm a complete idiot but I thought he really wanted to be with me and he told me that a lot). We have a hard time letting go of each other and eventually he just disappears, I confront him for ghosting and he tells me he wants space and I say, okay. 

We broke up around end of June/early July. He has a girlfriend now and I'm honestly just dead inside. I never told him I loved him when we were together, so I called and told him after I discovered he had a new girl. This wasn't done with any expectations, I was just hoping that maybe I could move on if I told him this thing that is truthfully a very big and painful deal to me. He was kind about it and said some stuff that was kinda confusing but maybe it's all bullshit. Doesn't matter anyway. Haven't spoken since then because obviously that's bad for me and I'm not trying to fuck up his happy new thing even if it kills me inside and I cry about it a lot. 

I understand now that I was just a stupid little rebound who fell in love SUPER hard. Again, I'm an idiot. I'm having a very hard time moving on. As dumb as it is, I thought I'd met the one. I literally couldn't have dreamed of a better fit for me or a man that I like more. It feels like I lost my soulmate.

Some of my friends/family judge me for believing I love him, but I have been in love before, and I know that it's real. However, it super sucks since he very clearly does not love me. 

Obviously, soulmates are not real. But it's just the ""feeling"" I have yanno?

Things I have done so far: -in therapy -on meds (depression and anxiety that I already had but I didn't start until after this stuff) -blacklisted his number so I can't see our texts -unfollowed his social media (but haven't blocked) -have been back on tinder and having casual sex/spending quality time with other guys -more energy put into my job -got a kitten which helped a lot for me emotionally

But I'm honestly still miserable. Every guy I meet, they're just not him. I feel like I have a big black hole full of nothing inside me all the time. I know I had a life before him, and there is life after him, but he made everything so much better and brighter. It's like I know what I'm missing now, and I have to be without it. 

On top of that, my self esteem is in the dirt. Every day I ask myself why I wasn't girlfriend material. Why I was good enough to like so much, to be with, and to have sex with but not to date. What does she have that I don't? How do I recover from this?

After that, I have to convince people to sign a contract in which they donate monthly or yearly a certainly amount of money to the company. The average wage is 60‚Ç¨ per contract.

This job is vital for me, first of all because **I TRULY NEED THAT MONEY**. I have a disastruos family situation, I have mental health problems and have to pay weekly a doctor and monthly another one plus the meds, I need to save money to get back to art school. And if I work hard, I'd be able to afford all of these.
Second, I'm so shy and introvert that it negatively affects my everyday life and I'm sure this job can help me. Everyone told me things like ""Oh! I was like you on my first days, and look how I am now!"" and maybe it's stupid, but I really want to say these exactly words to someone else in the future.
Third, like I said before I have a bad mental health that leads me to feel over-fatigued over nothing or be constantly late or take lots of days off which in an average working environment is unacceptable, but here is different, work time is flexible enough to make me comfortable and all I have to do is literally just talk to people and sign papers. It doesn't even feel like work, I have fun with co-workers and the jokes.
I don't have any options. I don't think I will ever find other super-easy jobs that I like and that pay well, especially where I live. 

Problem is, I suck. I should introduce myself to hundreds and hundreds of people, but I just can't, I think I said hi to less to 50 people in these days, and that's bad.  I just can't catch people's attention, nobody follows me to the stand. Beginners like me are supposed to explain the flyer to at least 2-3 people every hour to know we're doing a great job, and my number is 2 in two days. You might think that it's normal at the beginning but today was a coworker first day and she already signed a contract. My boss said that if I don't put more effort in what I do she doesn't want to invest money and time in me anymore.

So reddit, what can I do to improve my marketing skills? How do you overcome your shyness? How do you catch people's attention without bothering them or making them nervous? A coworker said you have to be so confident and fast that people don't have time to think, but how can I do that? I need any kind of advice to become the world most super persuasive person.

491,"My lower lip is kind of dry and I have a habit of biting it when it gets this way. I need to buy some new lip balm because the chapstick I have now is getting close to it's expiration date and it's getting a little gross. I'm not sure if it's bad already, but the texture feels unusual, so I don't like it. I have a face lotion that's for dry skin and I use it mostly for spot treatment because overall my skin tends to be very nice and I don't want to clog my pores with creams if it's unnecessary. I sometimes put a little on my lip if it's getting chapped and it helps, but I'm worried that might be a bad idea because it says for external use only. But the label only mentions getting it in your eyes. Usually when they say something is for external use only they also tell you what to do if you ingest it. I'm only using the tiniest amount possible, so it's not like I'm swallowing spoonfuls of it. I try not to like my lips after putting it on also. Do you think this is fine? It's Pond's brand dry skin cream if that's relevant. It doesn't taste bad, but I know that's not exactly a sign that it's safe to consume.",07Dec2019,1

493,"Sorry if this is a bit ranty too, but theres just so many things with this guy. Ok so I've been working for the Government for about a year, my job involves doing government stuff for the Government. It's not an easy job and you have to constantly think about what you're doing.

There's this guy who was hired a couple months after me and he's just pathetic. His knowledge is equivalent to somebody who has been in the job for a month. He will ask a fellow agent a question, pretend he understands, and then proceed to ask other agents until somebody gives in and walks him through it start to finish. I'm always his first target since he sits in the cubicle behind me.

He's also in some enhanced learning program and is receiving one on one coaching from management, the amount of resources they're dumping into trying to turn this guy into something viable is absurd. I'm 95% sure this is a racial diversity hiring thing since there's no way he passed the screening I had to go through. Nobody speaks openly about him but I get the impression everybody hates him as much as I do, but we still waste our time with him. He put a person on hold once so he could answer his cell phone...on a secure floor, so not just unprofessional but a massive security violation. He only got written up when it's supposed to be immediate dismissal and removal from the facility.

Now onto the gross stuff. He eats like a pig at his desk. We have muffled cubicle walls and I can constantly hear him smacking away like an animal. His desk is covered in bits of food and dirty napkins. He's also constantly hacking and coughing on everything without covering his mouth. The washroom stuff is worse, he doesn't wash his hands if he doesn't think somebody else is in there.  The worst thing is the toilet seats, I can't prove it's him, but ever since he started there's constantly feces and ass hairs covering the seats.

I'm just torn what to do, he wastes so many people's time and impacts their work performance and he's eventually going to make somebody I'll if he hasn't already. But because I'm still newish myself I don't exactly want to rock the boat. I'm hoping they will simply opt to not renew his contract when it expires in a few months. I know mine has already been extended by a couple years since I'm heavily favoured by management (another reason I don't want to cause trouble), they haven't renewed his yet. I want to believe they will do the right thing and can him, but I have a feeling they will settle with mediocrity for the sake of diversity.",07Dec2019,1

My boss has been very kind and all of my coworkers are great people, but i know this anxiety is being triggered by the simple act of being *at* the job and it‚Äôs only a matter of time before i have a total meltdown - with tears, breathlessness, and panicked flailing and everything.

I‚Äôve resolved to quit and get help before any of this happens, but how do i explain something like that to my (definitely almost a senior citizen) boss? The office has less than 20 people in it and they‚Äôve all been very kind and welcoming, I feel like I‚Äôm about to disappoint them all.

On top of that, my contract stipulates that I need to render at least two weeks of work after formally resigning or else the company can sue me for damages (to avoid people from just running off with no regard for everyone else).

I took two or three long hits and started tripping.  At first I was super happy and relaxed and talking a lot and super fast and then everything turns to a blur and it feels like I went to hell from what I do remember. I remember that scenes from my life were being played over and over again and each time it played I got sadder and my body was in more pain and feeling numb and it was like I was trapped in my head and i just had the craziest thoughts. When the loops kept playing over and over again I just got tired of fighting and I thought the only way to end it was to die. For a second I thought I actually did die and go to hell and I was sitting there asking ‚Äúif he killed me?‚Äù And ‚Äúwhere did he dump my body‚Äù and I just lost total sense of reality and didn‚Äôt know what was real when I wasn‚Äôt like out of it the room was spinning and I didn‚Äôt know if it was real or not I was just so confused. I‚Äôm assuming I was just spaced out and staring into nothing. The trip finally ended when he pulled me out of his car because I threw up like the exorcist.

498,"Last night, my girlfriend and I went to a party with a couple that lives in my building. I got hammered, they were at least tipsy, and we went back to their apartment to hang out. The girl and I mutually know a person who identifies as nonbinary and we were talking about how we had never known anyone else who used those pronouns. The conversation kind of evolved until I was talking all about a MTF trans friend I have who Im really worried about. I was talking about how she doesnt take it seriously and uses tons of slurs to talk about other lgbt people. The guy I was hanging out with thought I was trying to say trans people werent legitimate and thought my example was supposed to be a representation of ALL trans people. He said something like ""lets agree to disagree, I actually respect trans people"".

This really upset me because I obviously dont want people thinking I have a crappy opinion on trans people. I kept the conversation going about my friend, but this guy still thought I was just talking about trans people. I was careful to not say anything that could come off as ""edgy"" or intolerant but at some point in the discussion he just lost it. He stands up and goes ""GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY APARTMENT"". I was pretty surprised and thought he was joking, but he was 100% serious. I walked over to him and tried to calm him down and he shoved me out of his apartment and slammed the door. His girlfriend was shocked. My girlfriend was shocked as well. The girlfriend came out to apologize and we talked for a little while. It was weird because nobody except the guy thought I said anything wrong as far as I know.

I was hired on for a 1 year position in a rural (and typically undesirable) location followed by a guarantee of a permanent position in the city after. I was happy to take the offer and love working for this organization.

I have found that I really like the rural location and my work in that place. I know the company needs someone to work in this location and they have a very difficult time finding people who will go. This is why they used the permanent position after one year as incentive. I would be willing to stay in the rural location as a permanent employee. This puts me in a good negotiating position. My 1 year is ending soon and I want to negotiate the new permanent position contract. I am happy with my pay and benefits (health, dental ect).

506,"Ok so in my school (which btw is an all girls school in England) I have a small squad with my three best friends. For the sake of this we‚Äôll call them Debby, Tia and Georgia. We all have other friends outside our squad except Debby. Most people don‚Äôt like her because she has a tendency to be bossy and comes off as stuck up and rude. I think that because she is an only child who is always in charge at any club she goes to that she is this way. 

Anyway me, Tia and Georgia are friends with Debby because we genuinely like her and we know that deep down she is a very nice person at least until recently. She has been pissing everyone off recently but I don‚Äôt really get pissed off with her because I am the least close to her and we don‚Äôt have any classes together. 

Apparently in class she likes to put everyone down and brag about her outstanding English and history grades. Also she apparently likes to take over activities even when someone else has been put in charge and gets upset when she doesn‚Äôt get her way. 

My friends Tia and Georgia get really annoyed with her and bitch about her behind her back to me and our other friends. They even use a code name so that they can bitch about her even when she is there. This really bothers me and I have told them that it‚Äôs wrong to talk about people rudely behind their backs but Georgia always says ‚Äúit‚Äôs better that I get it off my chest so that I don‚Äôt end up having an argument with her‚Äù (which has happened in the past) and Tia always says ‚Äúwell no one likes her and she needs to change we should kick her out of our squad‚Äù and I always say HOW IS SHE SUPPOSED TO CHANGE WHEN SHE DOESNT KNOW WHAT IS BAD ABOUT HERSELF. 

I saw Debby earlier today and she looked really upset but she wouldn‚Äôt tell anyone what‚Äôs wrong. So I thought maybe it would be better to tell her what‚Äôs going on and what Tia and Georgia have said about her. I think she will eventually find out and it‚Äôs better sooner than later. However doing so would make me a hypocrite and betray Tia and Georgia‚Äôs trust. I don‚Äôt want to break up our little circle.

509,"I don‚Äôt know how to approach this and don‚Äôt feel comfortable asking anyone I know, so I thought I‚Äôd see if any good advice surfaces on here... 

My son lives primarily with his dad (not because I got in trouble or anything like that, I‚Äôm a good person, it‚Äôs a long story about how it ended up like this). I have him twice during the week and every other weekend. He is at the age now where the court considers him mature enough to choose whose house he primarily lives at. 

His dad isn‚Äôt very involved. He spends the majority of his time playing video games and streaming behind closed doors, doesn‚Äôt have a job, isn‚Äôt there for a lot of the extra curricular stuff, and generally from what I‚Äôve gathered from my son isn‚Äôt fully present for my son. My son‚Äôs ‚Äústepmom‚Äù (dads gf) is the one who does everything and is the one I primarily communicate with since it is usually many hours or the next day before I hear from him, and only after I‚Äôve texted him several times (side note: he said to my husband and I during a conversation that he usually sees his texts from everyone but doesn‚Äôt respond unless he wants to, which I don‚Äôt think he realized what he was admitting to us). But he will respond immediately if it is important to him, go figure. I show up to everything whenever I can, I provide rides, I take our son out hiking and to do other recreational activities, he‚Äôs comfortable talking to me about things, I‚Äôm involved in his Boy Scout troop- everything I do I do for him. I also work full-time, have a college degree (ex does not), and I consider myself a good role model.

Anyway, I truly believe that he sees this whole co-parenting thing whilst he has primary custody as a power thing. I don‚Äôt think he 100% cares about what‚Äôs right for our son, as long as he has the upper hand. I took him to court a few years ago in attempt for full custody, but all I got was a better written parenting plan.  My dilemma is that I KNOW he would be better living with me. I‚Äôd even move into his school district to insure he wouldn‚Äôt have to switch schools if he did live with me.

For background: Pre Dec 2015, I couldn't care less about men and only wanted to lose weight in my first year of uni. I went on the r/amiugly subreddit, to ask if I was ugly. I was bombarded by men calling my beautiful, for the first time in my life, and wanting pics. I took them. Explicit or otherwise. This lead to a downward spiral of me thinking these explicit photos and videos were the only way to snag a man, to make him want to stay. Sex became similar as well.

Well, I am now dating a man, for a while for the first time. Ive known him a while before I began dating him. Our history has been plagued with me sending this man photo and video after another. He cares about me and says he likes me for more than that. However, this people pleasing behaviour has gone out of control, and I have been starting to feel resentful that I send him these things, and I dont even get a ""hey beautiful"" text from him ever.

I so badly want to stop sending these pics. I feel like its become engrained in me, I feel like my brain is wired to send them , very early on in the dating process. I've only snagged one decent guy from this tactic who wants to date me. I have had enough. I am worth more. I am also SICK AND TIRED of trying to please this man, or anyone in my life for that matter. I feel angry.

I want to be treated like a princess, for once. For once not have to ask a man if we are dating, or if we can be gf/bf. I want to be like the other girls. I feel like this starts with tackling this pic problem.

Abusing her in front of her friends, insulting her for feeding stray dogs, and excessively scolding her for making him wait for a couple of minutes is some of the bullshit he's pulled recently.

Her self-esteem's in the fucking gutter, and she's apologizing for things she shouldn't even be sorry for.

To put things into perspective, they've been together for a month, and have always quarreled together over the most trivial of things.

I also always kinda shift the blame of things onto other people even when it wasn't my fault like if it was one of my friends I'll shift it to someone I don't like or don't know.  

I hate on people who just aren't as smart as me or as alert (I know this sounds egotistical but I know I'm smarter and I'm more aware than the people around me) If someone asks a question that was just answered or something insanely dumb and I know their serious, I'll say something in my head or rarely something out loud, and I've been pretty good at fixing this I just say to myself that they're making sure or they don't understand as a second thought but I still have the original ""That person is so fucking dumb"" thought

Finally I also hate on some people even after knowing them for years, i.e. I have a friend (lets call him Tucker) absolutely nothings wrong with him he has ADHD and is dyslexic, I KNOW absolutely nothing is wrong with that and he even gets me and my friends things whenever we ask, but I always shit on him when he's not around just because he made a mistake or said something stupid before

528,"Hello, i'm not sure if this is the right place to put this kinda stuff, if it isn't sorry, but here it goes. Im a 20 year old guy currently in college studying engineering while working part time to help pay for it.

 Today at work me and one of my coworkers were talking about this other girl we work with that apparently likes me. I had asked her ""why do you think she like me?"" and she responded with ""Why wouldn't she, your handsome, you go to school, you have job, a nice car, whats not to like?"" I was genuinely shocked to hear her say something like that. I struggle with low self esteem and my whole life never really felt like the kinda person that anyone would actually desire in any kind way, so of course I struggle with receiving compliments. But this one, I believed it. For the first time I thought maybe just maybe i was more attractive than I thought I was.

So, when I get off from work I decided to share with my mom what my coworker said and she responds with ""yeah, but you still live with your parents."" Hearing her say that made me immediately question the sincerity of the compliment I recieved earlier. Because she's the only person to ever say something like that to me that wasn't family (I never believe compliments from family), im only making a little over $11 dollars/hr, Im still very much financially depended on my parents, I have a car but I only pay a portion of the insurance on it while my father pays for everything else and its she didn't say anything at all about my personality.

I really don't what to think of all this. Why would my coworker say something like that? Im nothing special at all. Im a social awkward homebody who's life consists of school, work and video games (would start going to the gym if I wasn't such a coward). I have no social life and the ""friends"" I had in high school I don't really speak to anymore. Was it really genuine or was it just lip service?",07Dec2019,1

So naturally I have upstairs neighbors. I've lived in apartments my entire life, so I'm pretty used to normal noise with people who live above me.
However, whoever lives up there has constant sex. This is college after all and I'm aware that people are gonna be having sex... but the bed is constantly squeaking EXTREMELY loud. It wakes me up frequently and is super distracting when I'm trying to do work for school. For reference, the floor/ceiling is also solid concrete. The only other noises I hear are occasional footsteps but like I said, that doesn't bother me much. The walls and floors aren't super thin either. 
Would I be out of line to go upstairs and ask them if there's any way to secure their bed? Or maybe leave a note on their door? There's no RA or anything like that, but I also don't want to come off as passive aggressive. Or should I just kinda leave it alone?

542,"For some context, my father and I have always had a turbulent relationship as I became older, and I had always been closer to my mother. My father and I are both very stubborn and strong-minded people, and it always resulted in friction and arguments over a lot of personal issues. Compound this with a large cultural difference between us, and an entirely different background (I was raised and educated in the English education system, and English is my first language and I culturally identify as English, whereas my father was raised and educated in India and will always identify as such), and you have the recipe for constant arguments and falling-outs between him and I, as we fail to truly understand each other and the misunderstandings and differences in view compound and get worse as time goes on.

I am in Year 13 (the final year of the English education system, where you decide what you'd like to do at University and which ones you apply for), and lately, all of our arguments stem from my choices until now, what I'm going to do later after school, and then after University itself. This academic year (and last year) have been the most challenging years that I've ever had to face, and I've been constantly working at it and stressed in an attempt to do well in these two years, yet I am constantly called lazy and stupid by my father because I do not make (near) perfect grades in my school courses (even though, for the record, I make very good grades that are very much above the average). I am also quite indecisive (evidenced by the fact that I have changed my mind quite a bit as to what I'd like to study at university.) and I do not like to make firm plans for the future, and this contrasts completely with my father's outlook, as he believes in firm and rigid future planning, and is shocked that I do not have a future career in mind already.

I would like to study History at university - History is something that has *always* interested me and one of my best subjects at school, and is something I could see myself willingly doing at university for three years. He has never liked the idea of me doing History at university and has always opposed it, believing that it's a useless degree among other things, and that I will be unable to do well at university. He also believes that any university that isn't Oxford or Cambridge isn't worth attending, and always pushes me (when I'm already at near breaking point with stress and anxiety over my courses) to do better so that I can apply to and attend Oxford, which is not something I wish to do (I hate the elitist nature of these institutions and I hear that it is very stressful to remain in those universities as they're very competitive). I have said this to him many times, and he believes that I am weak and that I give up easily and that I do not ""take the bull by the horns"". Once again, this has been a frequent and tiring point of contention, as we go around in circles and none of us drop our views on the matter.

Lately, we've also had to deal with mock exams in school. Our school heaped on many internal deadlines and tests in the weeks running up to the mock exams, and barely gave us any time to properly revise for these mock exams. I had to sit six full length papers in two days, as well as apply to universities, and I still have more coming. I told my dad about how ridiculously busy this time of the year was, and how unfair it truly was to us that the school was cramming in exam after exam with insufficient time to truly prepare for any of them, and that I was exhausted and mentally spent. He called me weak and said that I was fully responsible for this predicament, and told me to go away and revise nonetheless, and this is when I snapped. 

I told him that he was being unrealistic, and that he had always failed to understand my perspectives and that I was a different person to him - calling him out of touch. I told him I was feeling constantly pressured and I was frankly sick of his input, and that I was tired of being insulted and being misunderstood. I told him that my friends' parents were far more understanding and less dogmatic and unreasonable, and that he should stop talking to me if he had nothing positive, realistic or constructive to say. That's exactly what he did, and we haven't spoken now for about 5 days (this is a while, especially as we still live in the same house).

My mother has tried to mediate between us, and has tried to tell me off for what I am doing and saying, telling me things like ""parents will always support you and love you"" - to this I replied ""It doesn't feel like that from my point of view"", and she has tried to prompt me to apologise and speak to him first. Frankly I am sick of doing this - I have always been prodded into apologising and conceding and giving way to him, which no doubt feeds into his perception that I am a weak person. I told my mother that *he* needs to apologise to me for once, but she doesn't see my own grievances and issues as real - and neither does my father.

I am genuinely not sure what to do anymore. I leave for University in less than a year with or without their support, and I need to know if I'm right as I believe I am, or if they're right and I'm being unreasonable in this circumstance. What can I do about this? How do I solve this situation? I am tired of fighting and the last thing I could do with in addition to my school stress is this familial bullshit at home.",07Dec2019,1
544,"So the situation is, there are 3 of us in the household.  The dynamic is grandmother (63f), mother (40f) and daughter (18f) so 3 generations living in the copasity of roommates as in we live our own lives and share household bills. The oldest of the three of us has evolved into hating Christmas with a negative outlook on almost everything. We have tried to get out of her what she would like or need as we want to get her gifts that she would use. We do not want to give her gifts just to give her gifts, we want it to be useful and meaningful.
Her response everytime we try to figure out what she needs or could use is that she hates Christmas and goes on about gratitude and no one is ever happy with what they have. This is not just a Christmas time attitude but an all the time attitude. So for context if anything we buy or do either for ourselves or for the house that is to improve or better anything we are met with this type of attitude. Keep in mind this is not often and purchases are small dollar amounts under $50-$100 so no unreasonable spending.
I am looking for suggestions on what we could do for her for Christmas. I am kind of at a loss because whatever we have done in the past (any time of the year) I feel has been met with disappointment.  I feel like she may be one of those people that can't be pleased no matter what. 
I'm looking for suggestions or ideas of what we could do for her that will show her we are grateful for her and brighten her outlook on the holidays or maybe just everything in general. I need some outside the box thinking as I am at a loss at this point as the only thing that seems at this point that would satisfy her would be to just cancel any and all acknowledgement of the holiday.",07Dec2019,1
545,"Any advice please

This is gonna be a LONG post but to make a long story short: my grandmas daughter (my aunt) is literally killing her.

I‚Äôll just say my name is M. My aunts name is B. B and I were born the same year and we grew up together since my mom was a teen mother. B has always been a bad person, even when we were just kids. She‚Äôd break things, steal, and then blame everyone else for it. B is the youngest of my grandmas kids. My grandma has my mom (39) my uncle (30) my aunt (26) and B (21), then there‚Äôs me, also 21. My grandma is 55. I basically lived with my granny because my mom worked three jobs most of my life. My granny has worked nights since before I was born and still does. 

B and I were always ‚Äúfriends‚Äù up until senior year. But even before then, I started to hate her. She was a mess. When we were around age 12, she started having sex. The first guy she snuck claimed he was 25, but looking back he obviously wasn‚Äôt. He had gray facial hair and just looked... old. She continued this behavior, constantly pulling me into it and getting us in trouble. I wasn‚Äôt an angel myself, but to be fair, at that age I was a really weird kid. I was highly obsessed with anime and I had a Facebook page where my name was Neliel (from Bleach). For the most part, I tried to stay under my other aunt because she was a bookworm. But B always wanted to do bad things. B started drinking and smoking when we were in 7th grade. She constantly defied her mother/my granny. I didn‚Äôt care too much, until her actions harmed me. 

I was only 13 (or possibly still 12) and she invited a bunch of high schoolers over (17+) Now mind you while all of this is happening, my aunt was and still is a bookworm and plays computer games. She never heard a thing and at that age she couldn‚Äôt stand being around us. My uncle was never home. So she disappears outside with one of the guys, telling me to relax and have fun. I tried. But it didn‚Äôt feel right. I decided to go outside and lay on the trampoline to get away from everyone. 2 of the guys followed me. 

I was so ruined. I hated her and till this day she pretends like it never happened. My mom and my grandma got into a fight, and my grandma use to think that I was always the bad influence. Or any of our friends for that matter. But it was never B fault. B continued doing these things, getting arrested, smoking, skipping school, underage drinking, sneaking older men in, etc literally everything bad you could think of. Fast forward to senior year of high school. The past is the past. Our friend that had lived on and off with my granny for the past 5 yrs, D, and I are more than aware of how troublesome B is. My poor granny still in denial. B has a 1yr old kid now, never ever saw the father. B disappears for weeks, leaving me, D, and grandma with the baby. And since we had school during the day, granny would have to stay up even though she has to work at night. 

Graduation is about a month away now, I had been accepted into a ton of colleges and received about 15k in scholarships. B had missed so much school over the yrs, she was still technically a sophomore. She had 5+ classes to take in credit recovery. I was 17, she was 18. Our school counselor told her all she had to do was come to school those last couple weeks before graduation and she‚Äôs graduate. Ngl this annoyed me a bit, I had been an AP student since 9th grade and worked my ass off so that I could graduate with honors and in the top 10%. She literally just breezed by. Easy way to graduate right! But instead of showing up to school, she disappeared to another city for 2weeks. When we had graduation practice, she showed up but was confused when the counselor pulled her to the side. She was angry and so mad at the world. I went on to graduate and went to a school out of state.

My friend D tells me that B is telling everyone how bad of a person I am, and how i told everyone she was jealous of me. At that time, I had never even thought that because to be frank, I thought she was pathetic and wouldn‚Äôt even waste my time talking about her. She was a dropout with a 2yr old no job or anything going for herself. I forgot to mention but i had a hard time keeping relationships because somehow... she fucked everyone I dated on accident. These kind of things continue happening and she still does the same ole same ole. I got engaged my sophomore yr of college. She was livid. She shared so many shady posts on fb and even posted something along the lines of ‚Äúppl love to act brand new.‚Äù I deleted her. My granny tells me she started dating some 35 yr old who has 3 kids by different women that he doesn‚Äôt take care of. D, also has a kid now, but is also engaged and moved to the city for a better life for her baby. Life is good. I visit my grandma the following summer and I hadn‚Äôt seen her since I graduated HS. She looked liked she was aging, but boy was I in for a surprise.

Fast forwarding to now, I went to my home state for the first time in 2 yrs. I‚Äôm married, just turned 21, and graduating college next semester with 2 degrees. Im moving out of country next year. I‚Äôm happy. Until I got home. My grandma is only 55, and the last time I saw her she was 53. She looked 65. Her face was so wrinkled and her lips were thinning, her bags were horrible, my god she just looked so old. My grandma is the youngest of 4, with my great aunt actually being 65 and she looked younger than my granny. B had another kid with that old man who doesn‚Äôt even take care of the first ones, and is now living with B in my granny‚Äôs house, not paying any bills whatsoever. My granny works at a department store and doesn‚Äôt make a lot. And not only is she paying her own bills, she‚Äôs taking care of FOUR ppl. B still disappears and leaves the kids with my granny. My granny cried, I had never seen her cry before. She said she knows that B doesn‚Äôt love or care about her and is using, but she doesn‚Äôt have the heart to do anything about it. She‚Äôs too sweet. She cried and told me she was sorry for not believing me when we were younger. My heart broke into a million pieces. My poor granny. She only did what she thought was right and I told her it wasn‚Äôt her fault. I told her I loved her so much and she just cried.

Everyone in the family is aware of the situation, but no one has a clue on what to do. My granny‚Äôs mental health is deteriorating, and she‚Äôs always in pain somewhere in her body because she never rests. Because of her current situation, she works month on end with no day off. She declared bankruptcy earlier this year because the hospital sued her (apparently she signed agreeing to pay for her surgery in x amount each month but like I said her mental health is deteriorating... she had no memory of signing said papers. And it‚Äôs not like she has the money either). B and her joke of a fianc√© knows all of this, they fucking live with her. But instead of giving her some money to help, or at least clean up ( my husband and I did majority of the cleaning because for some reason my granny was cleaning everything.. literally) they just sit on their got damn asses all day. They smoke, drink, leave the kids at home, bring all kinds of ppl over (my granny has been robbed several times since we were younger because of the company B brings around) and dirty the place up. 

Also to mention, B told her old man fianc√© and his family that my granny abused her and locked her inside when we were younger. That she was a good kid and the reason she didn‚Äôt graduate was because our granny would make her stay home to watch her baby. My granny never did any of those things. Yes she disciplined us and took our phones etc because we were BAD. Especially B. She was horrible. But everything my granny did was to protect us and I‚Äôm so thankful for that. I wouldn‚Äôt be the person I am today without my granny. I would probably be exactly like B. To make matters worse, The old man fianc√© and his family spread rumors all over town about my granny, creating even more stress.


No one knows what to do. Is there anything we can do? My granny is literally dying because she‚Äôs overworked and over stressed. My heart hurts so much thinking of how bad she looked and just how bad things are right now for her. My granny use to be the garden lady of our little town, giving away free fruits and veggies. Now, you can‚Äôt even tell a garden use to exist. My other aunt and I both live out of state but try our best to help her out as much as possible. Her sisters as well. But nothing is giving. My mom is moving back to our home state in hopes to help but I know that‚Äôs not enough.

What can we do? Is there anything we can do about this situation? I literally want to cry every day now because I‚Äôm so worried about my grandma. She shouldn‚Äôt have to suffer like this. Everyone tells my granny she shouldn‚Äôt put up with and to put her out, but she just can‚Äôt especially since it‚Äôs 2 of her grand babies involved.

546,"Hey guys,

I‚Äôm really down on luck right now, and I don‚Äôt know what to do.

I was raised by my grandparents, mostly my grandma; and while I love her, she‚Äôs always been kind of... weirdly judgmental.

I want/need to get a CNA license. I have had a strong interest in the medical field for as long as I can remember- but my grandma is very against higher education. 

I tried to argue my case for college, but I care about her opinion way too much, I guess. I couldn‚Äôt stand the thought of her being disappointed in me.

So, I‚Äôve tried just working my way up in various things, but I‚Äôm just not great at the entry level jobs around. They‚Äôre all either labor or customer service- I‚Äôm way too tiny for labor, and not bubbly enough for customer service.

I did okay in one customer service job for a bit, but became so depressed with it from constantly faking ‚Äúbubbly-ness‚Äù that I was let go.

Now I‚Äôm completely broke and no one seems to want to hire me. I‚Äôve been trying for months. 

I know I can pretty easily get my CNA, school and tests are the only thing I excel at. And even if I hate it or suck at it, it‚Äôd guarantee me a job for at least a bit.

My grandma is still against it, though. I keep trying to tell myself it doesn‚Äôt matter, just do it anyway, I‚Äôm an adult now, etc. 

But it‚Äôs a huge mental block. I can‚Äôt push myself to do it, I just breakdown whenever I try to. And I‚Äôm not just worried about how broke I am, but also what kind of life I‚Äôll have if I can‚Äôt ever defy her.

I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice. I know I probably sound really pathetic, admittedly my bigger problems are low self esteem and learned helplessness- but I think maybe pushing myself to do something *I* want to do would help a lot with those. A good first step anyway.

Thank you so much.",07Dec2019,1

564,"So I'm still a bit confused by what gaslighting is. It's a fairly new word to my vocabulary and it seems to have a lot of gray areas. I found out earlier this year that someone can gaslight you unintentionally. I was accused of this.

So, I was having a conversation with a friend. She kept telling me I don't understand, which I replied I did. She kept insisting that I didn't. So eventually I said that I might not understand but I'm trying to. She started saying that trying to understand and understanding are not the same. I agreed. She started saying that we have different definitions of what understanding is. I told her that her definition is the correct one. I also told her that having this conversation over text while she was having a panic attack and I had been awake for close to 30hours straight might not be the best way to have this conversation.

She kept insisting that I didn't understand and I never will be cause I believe that the definition of understanding is trying to understand. The only reason I conceded to her that I might not understand was because she was adamant that I didn't understand. So I wasn't going to argue and besides maybe I really am missing a piece here.

I told her that I didn't want to argue and I think that we are fighting each other instead of working together to solve the problem at hand. I asked her to work with me instead of against me so we can solve this issue.

She kept on insisting that I won't get it because of our definitions of understanding. I told her that I had already accepted that understanding does not equal trying to understand and her definition was the right one (this is already too confusing to follow along). She wouldn't move past that and kept telling me that. I told her that maybe I was just misunderstanding things because I had been awake for over a day at that point (work was very weird and I basically worked an entire day straight which never happens). She told me that was not her problem and I should have thought about talking to her about this before we started. 

At that point I told her that this felt like borderline gaslighting. She got extremely emotional when I told her that and began really telling me I am impossible to speak to. I then said look, maybe we are both gaslighting each other, maybe texting each other is t the best form of communication for a topic like this. She didn't acknowledge that and continued on with how awful I am for saying she was gaslighting me.

I just am wondering, from what I have said, does this sound like gaslighting?",07Dec2019,1

So this morning I go on a messenger group chat, and say next year shall we do secret Santa so you only have to buy for one person and a maximum price of ¬£10. And my two friends that still live at home and spend a lot of money, said they still want to give to everyone and I really thought they'd understand I'm hinting at the fact that a lot of people can't afford it and you're socially pressure them into buying presents. 

Also last night one of my friends that still lives at home said to my friend who expecting a babies and her partner, that  they should try saving money even if it's just 20p, I just thought it was a really nasty things to say as they both work a lot and because their situation they don't have much to show for it.

My friend and I were working together the other day and we were having fun, joking around and laughing and then my grandparents came in so I went to make them a sandwich. 

My grandma has had multiple surgeries on her eye so now she can really only squint out of it. After they left my friend starting mocking my grandma and making fun of her squint in front of me and other customers. I told him it wasn‚Äôt funny and to stop but he thought it was and started laughing. He also took my keys and hid them so in response I hid his phone on him. 

After all the customers left we went in back and he got mad at me because I wouldn‚Äôt tell him where his phone was because he still had my keys and wouldn‚Äôt give them to me. He then gave me the silent treatment and wouldn‚Äôt help me with a long line of customers later and sat in our lobby talking to his friends and watching me.

When he was ready to leave he told me to give him his phone and I said no because he had my keys.

However, recently I noticed that A is facing some serious personal issue since they're not as chipper as they usually are, although in front of their other friends, they maintain a rather solid ""poker face."" A is still able to joke and act tough as if nothing is bothering them. Even some of their friends seemed unaware of the problems A's facing. This has been going on for the past week or two.

581,"I'm not sure what to title this but I've been having trouble trying to fix this myself. This is kind of a long story and I did some pretty bad things whether intentional or not.

Sometime in September I broke up with my girlfriend of about a year, who I'm going to call Jamie, and as soon as I did a girl who I'm going to call Kay started talking to me and we hit it off. We didn't make it official and we were still just getting to know each other, so since I wasn't in a relationship a friend of three years confessed to having a huge crush on me. I softly rejected him, but rumors started about me playing Kay and the boy I'm going to call Joe. On top of that my ex boyfriend from two years ago started spreading a rumor that I was his ""secret girlfriend."" Due to all the drama surrounding me, Kay pretty much dropped me and my reputation at school is now the ""whore."" My friend of five years, who I'm calling Acorn, and I grew apart because of this as I apparently really hurt Jamie when broke up with her, and he liked her. Apparently in his mind I was playing with her feelings and so he told that to everyone in the group which made them all rather dislike me. Time passes and a completely new situation occurs.

I had I fight with my mother that got physical, she started it and I just continued it, I don't want to get too in depth with it but it happened early in the morning during a school day making me miss my first class. My sister went that morning and told everyone an exaggerated story about how at that moment I was at home beating my poor, sick mother into a bloody pulp unprovoked. Which was not true, that added on to the hatred most had for me, and further increased the amount the group disliked me. Acorn later messaged me and it went roughly as follows:

Acorn: did you hear what your sister said about you? 
Me: Yeah.
Acorn: Any thoughts about it?
Me: Other than the fact she left out some major details just to make everyone to dislike me more which pisses me off.
Acorn: You know, after Jamie breaking up with you in February over you being abusive and your sister and mother saying you're abusive, it really adds up.

Jamie cheated on me for about ten days and broke up with me the day before Valentine's saying I was abusive. She then immediately started dating and soon fucked the girl she cheated on me with. On the abuse claim, I did playfully hit but it was rare and never left bruises, so I'm just going to guess she made that claim to justify breaking up with me to go with that other girl. My sister told Acorn that my mom said I was abusive, then the story she told about the fight added on to that.

I don't know how to fix this friendship, but it was something that meant everything to me. I don't know what to do and I need help. It's been making me really depressed and I've been thinking a lot about suicide even though I know it's a dumb thing to want to kill myself over.

My friend‚Äôs dad is also an asshole alcoholic that is in better state than her mother. No one is willing to help my friends mother except her.

To deal with this, my friend smokes and drinks constantly. She is very clever and failing school. We are both only 15. 

By the way, her mother has been to rehab 3 times

I (23M), my dad (43M), my sisters (20F &amp;16F), and my grandmother (64F) all live together in one house. My dad, one sister, and I split the bills amongst ourselves with my grandmother paying insurance on the house itself. Overall, our combined incomes add up to roughly $2000 a month. We don't live hand to mouth, but we're not exactly rich either. In fact, I end up footing the bills for emergencies because I have the most savings out of everyone in the house. I don't mind this at all. In fact, I'm glad to give back to my loved ones; however, I'm thinking of moving out on my own soon. I love them and everything, but I have to answer some questions for myself. It's not that I don't think they will accept me. I just think I need some distance from everyone to figure myself out, but I can't just leave without knowing if they can make it without my help. At the same time, I can't live with my own uncertainties. Any advice, Reddit?",07Dec2019,1
590,"Im in college rn and basically the second I got there, I said that I was gonna completely shift from who I was from high school. I developed a vision for my life and got on a varsity team. Unfortunately this has not translated at all into my confidence in talking with women. 

To paint a picture for you guys, I was definitely the awkward kid in hs. I‚Äôve never once had a female friend, so I have no idea how to talk to them. I‚Äôve heard a predominately school of thought where girls will say ‚ÄúJust treat me like a male friend..‚Äù This never works out because the way they think, act, and respond is incongruous with my male friends. This makes me put this veil on my personality and dumb it down a lot. I won‚Äôt make jokes or talk about hobbies. Just the generalities of college life, like aspirations and so on. I do make a conscious effort to listen and repeat back things they‚Äòve told me to show that I care about what I‚Äôm being told. But it never expands beyond that.

So my question now Reddit is this. How can I talk to Women? I‚Äôm very worried that the late maturity of this skill will be detrimental to me in the future. I want to know what it feels like to love someone in a relationship context. Any other more personal questions you have about me or that nature of the question itself I can answer below as well btw.",07Dec2019,1

We‚Äôve actually hooked up a couple times, a week after meeting btw. 

Okay, so there are days when I would invite her to go do something like have dinner, watch a movie, go to the bar etc and she would always say ‚Äònext time‚Äô or set a date, or just come up with an excuse not to go out. But When the day actually comes on an agreed date and I ask if she‚Äôs still up for it, she says she doesn‚Äôt feel up for it anymore ( bummer) 

But here‚Äôs where the wierd kicks in. 

Whenever I proceed to still enjoy my evening with other friends on the days she cancelled on me, she would send me messages like ‚Äòwish you were here‚Äô or ‚Äò I should‚Äôve just gone with you‚Äô. And on days when she goes out with her friends, she would say things like‚Äô this would be more fun if you were here‚Äô. 

So you can clearly see my confusion here !

I‚Äôm basically asking here, what does this all mean? Is she into me, or is she not. Am I just a source of attention for her, or is there more to this than what‚Äôs on the surface?

593,"I graduated high school in the spring and for the first time in my life I'm dealing with problems I've never had to deal with before, and to make it worse, I'm dealing with them on my own. I've grown a lot as a person in the last year and matured a lot but all of my friends from high school haven't at all. I'm the only one that has a plan for my life; the rest of them seem perfectly content not having a job or going to college and just hanging out every day. The more I spent time with them the more I realized they were jerks. I slowly started cutting them out of my life because whenever I was around them I realized how toxic they were. They'd have an attitude towards total strangers who had done nothing to them and would blow everything out of proportion and I found myself getting so embarrassed to be associated with them.

Over the last few months I've made a few friends that are going to college and that live in a bigger town a few hours away that I feel like I truly connect with. In fact, in a year I'm going to move to that town to go to college. Hopefully I'll get to spend time with all of them but we're all pretty busy with work and school. Right now I'm just at a place in my life where I have no friends where I'm at. It's given me a lot of time to work on myself, and I really don't mind doing stuff alone, but the last few weeks have been so lonely.

I sill live with my parents so I'm not totally alone, but I hardly have a social life at all anymore.

Specifically, i have a friend, let's call him Josh. He's recently had a major conflict regarding school. He's always been a perfectionist with grades and he sets expectations for himself to be strong and smart. He is both of those things in my opinion but he is currently failing an AP Physics class. ""No matter how much time and effort i put into it, somehow my grade drops more"" he said. I've been in that situation. Obviously to a lesser degree with an Honors Biology class. I got out with luck and a C-. But he doesnt think he can do anything. He's saying that he is accepting the failure and going to somehow make it up over summer or something. I know he's incredibly saddened over it. It's a devastating feeling. I wanted so so badly to comfort him and tell him that he can do it.  But i couldnt. I just let him vent and reason with himself while I listened.

605,"    Hello all, 
     I live with 3 other girls and lately there has been a lot of arguments over house chores. One particular roommate, who we will call Fran, has been getting most of the brunt of it. About a week ago She cleaned and then the other roommate, Meryl, got mad because she moved her cooler and it turned into a whole blowout fight (I supported Fran the whole time because after she cleaned the whole apartment I thought it was ridiculous that Meryl had the audacity to say something about her moving a cooler that was in our common area). However, Fran has a history of not being the cleanest person and she ‚Äúcleaned‚Äù dishes and put them away but they were still covered in food. It was truly disgusting. This happened on multiple occasions. My third roommate, Hester, messaged her about it telling her she needs to clean the dishes better (we had a bug problem last year so we are very nervous about it coming back). This turned into a huge fight between those two. Everything is fine now but now I have my own issue with Fran and I don‚Äôt know how to address it without causing more tension. 
     My mom just bought me this really nice pans set for an early Christmas present on Black Friday. I am very laid back and I never mind if my roommate use any of my stuff and these pans were no different. Well the past 3 days I have come home from work and Fran has left food that she cooked still on the stove in the pans I just bought. I didn‚Äôt say anything and just clean it and put it away. (It‚Äôs only one pan so I really didn‚Äôt mind). Well today yet again she left a pot full of old food on the counter and I left it because I figured if I was constantly cleaning up after her she would never think she has to do it. But then I noticed that she had used metal tongs on my pan. I looked at the bottom and it is all scratched up. I want to say something in the nicest way possible because she is already on high alert with all the other stuff I don‚Äôt want her to feel like I‚Äôm picking on her but seeing how she treated my pans really upset me. 

TL;DR: roommate used metal tongs on my pans and scratches up the bottom. I want to tell her in a nice way to please not do that, but she is very sensitive after multiple criticisms of her cleanliness. Please help me form a message :)",07Dec2019,1
606,"Okay so I'm hoping someone reads this and comments because I have been feeling sooo alone when it comes to this topic. 

So here's the story: I've had this girl be my friend for almost 12 years. We met in middle school and have been friends ever since. About a year ago, we had a bit of a talking out. I was upset that she ALWAYS talked about her issues and never asked me about any of mine, like I was just convenient for her. When I say that, I'm not egotistical at all. I tend to keep everything hidden: my abusive ex bf, my depression, my anxiety, my thoughts of suicide (not suicidal anymore). But I've always felt like when we texted/talked, the conversation was 90% her. 

Anyways this is what I think started everything. 

In October, there was this comic con convention in town and she wanted to meet this subpar actor. I told her that if she wants to meet him then I'll make the effort to hang out with her and see him. (because I'm such a giving friend and I hate that about myself) Anyways she asked me to pay for the meet and greet WITH MY CREDIT CARD and that she'll pay me back. I was being dodgy like ummm suuureee. But my work days are so hectic that even if I wanted to, I don't have the time to. 

So she asked me once if I got the tickets, literally slipped my mind, again, working in marketing takes up my whole life. She said not to worry about it because she got paid that day so I said okay.

Fast forward to a week or so before the comic con. Texted her asking if we were still going. She was being shady, saying that she can't talk about it right now but that we were. Okay?? The last day she goes into detail. Long story short, she is a ""therapist"" for autistic children and one of the older autistic boys kicked her in the leg AND SHES ON WORKERS COMP FOR A BRUISE. Then she tells me that, after saying we were going, that she doesn't know if her mom will let her go. She's 23 years old and has a bruise on her leg.... I asked her why she wasn't being honest with me, why lie. I'm an understanding friend. Then she hits me with an okay text. 

Fast forward, it was my birthday in November. My best friend and I didn't get a birthday text. I know some people might read this and be like lol you're upset over a birthday text? Yes I am, my birthday is important to me and everyone special to me rememberes except for someone who has told me I was like a sister to them. 

I also texted her happy Thanksgiving and didn't get a response. üòÇ

Idk. I'm just confused. Is this friendship over l? Should I try to text her? I feel like it's always me reaching out to her in this case and I'm tired of that. Idk. Send help",07Dec2019,1

12 years ago, I(16M) had a best friend(16F). It was purely platonic, she trusted me with everything and vice versa. We would often get drunk and sleep together but we did nothing sexual. Until one night when we got too drunk. That night was blurry but I remembered clearly that I stripped and groped her. After that, I blacked out. When it was morning, she was nowhere to be found. I wanted to call her and let her know what I did, but I didn't. I was a coward. It was until during the late afternoon when she texts me and confronted me. I told her everything I remembered. She said she wanted nothing to do with me and she will contact me if she can get over what I did to her.

I hate myself. I hate what I did to her. I hate that I destroyed this relationship. Ever since then, I never got drunk nor did I sought after friendship with other girls. Throughout the years the guilt keeps tearing me apart, I am now at the point where I believe that I do not deserve any happiness. I'm actively sabotaging my life. Broke up a couple of relationships because they were too good for me, pushed my friends away from me because I would taint them, quitting my job with decent pay because I shouldn't got that promotion. I even stopped taking care of myself, I grown fat and grew my hair out.

So my boyfriend (23) and I (26) have been together for like five years now, we've had a very I dunno interesting relationship, we've deal with things, gone through shit but stayed together. We have a really healthy relationship now.  


Anyways, my boyfriend has this best friend, her name is Toni, (24) they've been friends for about I dunno maybe two years at this point, and she was around when our relationship was at one of the worst points, and has literally seen and heard all of it, if that makes sense.   
So my of course her and my boyfriend like have a really strong bond due to some of the shit him and I were dealing with.  
So they hang out almost every single day, he takes time off work to go spend time with her, since she just start in hair school and ""felt like she would have less time to hang out with him"".. Clearly not the case since she still manages to come over every single night.  
So Monday, my boyfriend left work early to go spend the day with Toni and dropped some acid (( Something I've been interested in doing but given some of my pas traumas have never had the courage to do )) anyways, he always talks about how tripping with someone you just bond differently with me, so naturally I get jealous. I express how I feel like he's spending too much time with her and he said ""Okay fine, after we trip on Monday I'll tell her to fuck off for a week."" It's now Saturday and she has still been coming over every single day, stealing all his time and attention... She had the audacity to joke last night to my boyfriend that ""She forgets that he has a girlfriend"" and when he told her that he needed to take some time away from her she was like ""Oh what so now I have to miss you?"" Granted most of this was all said in a drunken joking manner but it still really hurt my feeling.  


Like this is becoming too much for me to deal with honestly, and I don't want to be that insane controlling girlfriend because that's not what it's about, but it's getting to the point that I'm having nightmare that's he's cheating on me with her, which like I'm hoping is not the case but I'm exhausted.  


I don't know what do to, and I talk to my boyfriend about it and he ya know is stuck in the middle of me and his friend just constantly dumping on him about how ""She's unhappy she can't hang out with him. "" and how ""I'm unhappy I have no alone time with him.  


Anyone been in a situation like this before? Should I put my foot down and tell him it's her or me? Should I just make a friend of the opposite gender and make him feel as jealous as I do (Kidding sort of), Do I confront her about the situation?

This means that I haven‚Äôt been able to get to the gym, haven‚Äôt had much time to cook and I feel like using the little free time at home to just do bare minimum chores or just take a walk etc. Whenever I can feel my jeans feeling tighter etc, it makes me feel irritated and I feel like I want to have some work life balance so I can go back to going to gym etc. but then I‚Äôm also convinced that if that is the life I choose, I most definitely can‚Äôt work in interesting teams or grow in my career.

I do not know what to choose and not regret my decision. PLEASE HELP !",07Dec2019,1

623,"TLDR: I think I need to cut my ""family"" off. This is the hardest thing to do now because I know they (especially my emotionally weak mother) will suffer because of my decision, yet I really feel I just need to do it. It feels like the only sane and non-toxic thing to do for me. Need advice on how to make this less painful for everyone included.

In all truth, we were nothing like the picture of even a less ideal ""family"". All I really remember from living with then was just emotional trauma and toxic personalities, lots of arguing, deceit, secrets, and resentment. Been living away from them for the last 15+ years. Yet, they are not at all bad people, none are addicts or alcoholics, it just feels like everyone is a victim of the circumstances to be born in a dysfunctional family .

I got out of there as soon as I got my first job. I never suffered physical abuse but mentally it was always a lot of drama and emotional instability. 

My mother is in her late 60s, she was always emotionally very unstable, with a lot of drama an tears and overall suffering about everything and nothing, but especially about the fact that her son is not there for her. I thought after first few years since I was gone she will kinda accept it but she never really did. She is never being directly abusive, but the way she acts always makes me want to distance even more. It's ironic because all she probably wants is a true connection, but I dont feel that can be made true so late in our lives.

With my father I never really had a connection and we don't even talk to each other now, although I know he's sorry for how it turned out to be, but he didnt know better. I don't see the point in trying to make that connection now.

My siblings are both older than me, they both kinda try to live their lives but they are not married or in a relationship. One still lives with the parents, the other one ""ran away"" just like me and doesn't visit, but keeps themselves busy with work so they have a valid excuse not to visit.

I did keep in touch via texts mostly with mother and she and the other sibling came to occasional visits to my house. Those visits add absolutely zero value to this relationship. I always said they are welcome to visit but I was forever reluctant to visit them because I cannot keep forcing myself to do something I really don't want to do. Still, once a year, at Christmas eve it is a kind of obligation for the ""family"" to gather, even though the whole scene is totally forced and fake, at least from my perspective. It's only for a few hours and everybody goes about their business after that. It is always just an obligation for me, I really dont want to be there, in  fact I'm there only physically, and mentally I count the seconds to get back home. We don't even have normal conversations anyway, so even minutes seem like hours to me. Because of it I feel  kinda like some convict for those few hours of being there.

I don't hate my family but I wish they (especially mother) would accept and respect my whishes.

Now for the first time I made other plans for Christmas and I won't be spending that time with them. I already told that to my older sibling, and they offered zero support and hinted I will be responsible if my mother goes to a nervous breakdown because of this.

I know this may not be enough detail, but I don't want to make too long of a post. I just need advice on how to make this less painful for everyone involved. Should I really cut them off or try to force myself to build some kind of a relationship?",07Dec2019,1
624,"I will out-rightly say that although, I've been recently having suicidal thoughts, I could never in my life put myself to do it mainly because I know how hard I've worked in my life, through school and work to get to where I am right now. It's just always in the back of my head now, and I hear myself thinking I wish I could just end life.

Looking back at 2019, I feel like I have just been so miserable, lonely, stressed, sad,...etc. I don't have many friends, and this is something I've tried through university (joined clubs, tried bumble friends, stayed connected with co-ops). These are all short term solutions to long term problems after those students leave co-op and what not. In addition to this, it seems like I'm going to be forever alone looking at all the relationships around me. I'm graduating next year, and have nothing to celebrate and no one to celebrate with. Usually people have great friiends, s/o, family but I literally have nothing to look forward to for graduation. All my friends seem to be in relationships right now. And when I try to ""rant"" to my friend, all she can text now is ""I don't know what to say I have no advice."" When I talk to my sibling, they think I'm just being miserable and putting that guilt on them impeding them from enjoying their life...just a lack of empathy and the idea that I have no right to be sad given how my grades, program, progress in life so far. Finally, I'm currently subletting away from home, and it's been a shitty ass living situation I regret signing on everyday. I just hate my living situation, and although I'm here for only two more weeks, it just sucks that 4 months have gone by that have been awful.

The other problem is my narcisitic, annoying, and unsupportive parents. I work so hard all my life to get the top grades, and it seems like its never enough. I'm in a great program about to graduate next year, and its not enough. I've have good co-ops and it's not enough. I EVEN SECURED A FUCKIN FULL TIME JOB a year before i even graduate and it's still not enough to my dad because it won't be paying me enough (even though I check online and it averages fine). It sucks because I'll be living at home for at least the next 3 years with the parents feeling miserable and hopeless. I don't have money to both pay my loans and move out, so that's not an option. I'm thankful for the job and being able to save up for the future considering the COL these days, but right now in this moment of time, I have no hope in a better future and have nothing to look forward to.

I'm trying to make the most of my co-op term right now, seeing that I like work, but am upset about the next year and what to expect. At this point, I don't want my parents to come to my graduation, nor do I have friends to celebrate with so I don't even know why I'd go being the loser by myself.

It just seems like there's no hope at the end of the tunnel I'm going through and this year has just been challenge after challenge and I've cried way too much thinking back due to loneliness, school stress, hatred for my parents and everything else. I've tried so hard to look on the bright side this year and it still always disappoints me still. My last year is definitely going to be a tough one, and part of me just wishes I could take an L and just go out and adventure off, but its hard when you've not money or friends or time (due to fkn school) to adventure off with.

How do I find hope again in my life and try thinking positively for 2020 to improve my mental health?",07Dec2019,1
625,"
So I really just need to vent mainly because I have nobody that I know that I can tell this whole story too because well you‚Äôll see.And full disclosure I do know I did this to myself and I am in the wrong on a lot of things.I hope somebody reads this because I need help bad.

I went to school with this man(now 26)We will call him Franklin.
3 years ago we messaged for a couple of months and made plans to meet up but I was with my baby daddy.(My baby daddy are not really together anymore but we live together right now because we have two toddlers and it‚Äôs complicated)I completely stopped talking to Franklin when I got pregnant with my first kid but he would message me ‚Äúhey‚Äù now and then and ask why I stopped talking to him.After I had my first son he even messaged me and said ‚Äújust wanted to say congratulations on the baby‚ÄùI never responded.He messaged me a few times in between then but I still did not respond.Fast forward to March of this year,I randomly for no reason messaged him and asked how he had been and he responded..We started messaging here and there.We talked sexual a little bit and in July he came over and we had sex on my couchI didn‚Äôt fall for him or anything but a couple weeeks later he came over and we did it again.I got very attached after that but I already knew it was just sex especially for him and especially considering he knew my living situation.We have had sex 8 times since July now.
A couple of times my dog interrupted us but Franklin didn‚Äôt seem to mind.(She is very codependent)Time before last my 2 year old woke up right before he came over and I made Franklin wait on the couch for at least 30 minutes while I got my kid to sleep and he was really sweet about it...Last night he came over pretty drunk (like the last 2 times)and about halfway through we heard footsteps.He said is that your son or your dog and I could tell it was both.I got up and my son just wanted a drink...I got him a drink and he went right back to sleep and the dog too.I go back into the guest room(where we usually have sex) and I started to apologize and he was DRESSED.My heart sank right then.He said‚Äùsorry this is just too much for me tonight‚ÄùI just kept apologizing as he walked out of the room and he told me he would message me as he walked out the front door.I was in shock.We only had sex every couple weeks or so but I would think about him very often and message him every now and then.He is emotionally distant and I can tell he has some issues.The absolute worst part about this is that I‚Äôm 11 weeks pregnant and according to my conception date it was the day we had sex for about the 5th time and I was on top but got off right before he came.I had sex with my baby daddy a few days later who I thought also pulled out....Okay well this gets worse this morning I messaged Franklin and said‚ÄùHey why have you only been wanting to come over while heavily intoxicated lately.Not complaining just wondering‚ÄùHE BLOCKED ME ON FACEBOOK AND TWO OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS AFTER THAT and I have no way to contact him personally.
So I guess I have a couple of questions 
1)How do I get over Franklin because I am devastated and 2)Wtf am I going to do if this is his kid???",07Dec2019,1
626,"Ok guys I need advice (21F). I met this guy 6 months ago in the club,  he slid into my dms, we started talking but he said he is not a relationship guy. We still kept talking and because of us me and my friend group started hanging out with him and his friends. At the end of every party we end up together. I was honestly okay with that, it was kind of friends with benefits type situation. But sometimes I feel so stupid, for example last Monday we were at a party, and at the end we hooked up, great. Tuesday we were all out together and he didn't even look at me, so I asked him what was wrong. He said everything is fine and that he has to go home to sleep. I knew he was lying and probably wanted to go with some other girl.  I know I'm not his girlfriend but you can't be with me one day and just straight up ignore me the other. I don't know what to do now because we're in the same friend group. How should I behave when I see him next week? and btw this is not the first time this happend, i was always fine with it and played it cool after, but I don't think I can handle this anymore.

That I'm wrong for thinking it's a good idea to move in with my boyfriend because it will save me from paying rent.  None of my friends like him and think that he is an aggressive a******. Yet hes the 1st person who has ever made me truly happy and has brought me joy. He treats me well. He doesn't raise his voice at me and respects me. Yet they think I will be manipulated and/or abused by this person if I move in with him. He has never hurt me but yet my friends really hate him. They think he is weird and shady.  My boyfriend has dyslexia and is super introverted.  They have yet to give him a chance to really get to know who he is as a person they immediately dismissed him because of my past relationship. Prior to this relationship about a year ago I was dating a guy that abused me. Now that they see me in this relationship and see that I'm moving in with someone very fast they think I'm a distressed puppy and that I'll be hurt again as before. (Ps my family really likes him.

632,"Pros for the college I am currently attending:

I have the freedom to do whatever I want. I can party and come home drunk at three in the morning, I can do my laundry whenever I feel like it, etc. It‚Äôs a better party school, and I already have a lot of social links to get into parties. It has one of the best programs in the nation for my major. There is a cost for me to park on campus, but parking is easy and I can easily get to the bus to get to classes. I have made and gotten close to new friends, and I like that there are new faces all over campus. I am a really big fan of our basketball and football teams. Also, I wouldn‚Äôt be losing any credits or needing to add on more years from transferring.

Cons for the college I am currently attending:

I am not familiar with the area, I am introverted, and I often end up just being a homebody. I‚Äôll go anywhere with my friends, but I have trouble exploring the area on my own. I also have difficulty making friends. I don‚Äôt get to see my family as much because I have a long drive to them. My closest friends, the ones I have grown up with, are all back at home. If I stay here, I will be living in an apartment and needing to continue with paying rent. I don‚Äôt really have any friends that I would be comfortable having as a roommate. I also struggle with eating here because I am a broke college student who never has food and barely knows how to cook. The campus here also doesn‚Äôt look the best. The buildings are meant to look somewhat like castles but they look more like prisons to me, and there is a lot of space between all the buildings.

Pros for the college I am considering transferring to:

I am familiar with the area and completely comfortable with going anywhere and everywhere, whether it is by myself or with friends. I have close friends there, and there are tons of people on campus that I already know. I would be able to live with my family and always have someone to come home to. I would not have to worry about paying rent and living on my own. It would be less expensive for me to stay there with them because I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about meal and housing costs. Also, the campus buildings are prettier and closer together. 

Cons for the college I am considering transferring to:

I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do what I wanted to do all the time. I would always have to watch what I do and say if I were living at home. The party life isn‚Äôt great, and I would have to start over when it comes to getting into the social links there. The other school isn‚Äôt Ivy League or anything, but it still has a better program for my major there. I was informed that parking and getting to classes there are a bitch. I would also have to drive about a half hour everyday to go to classes because I would be living at home. I would know way too many people there, especially from high school. That sucks even more because everybody would already know everything about me. I like the sports teams there, but I like the school I am currently going to more. The schools are rivals, so I would not be able to get caught whatsoever talking positively about the school I am currently going to. I would not be able to wear my college gear that I have already bought, and I would have to get new college gear. I would also be losing credits and probably needing a 5th year if I go to school there.",07Dec2019,1

634,"I was depressed during my teens and this has leaked into my early 20s. I am now 23. 

Causes of my depression include: Anxiety which was heightened by my regular marijuana smoking, being infatuated with a girl during puberty which ended with me feeling broken (it was all in my head), botched circumcision and overall low self esteem and low confidence. 

I spoke to my therapist and we have come to the conclusion that I had a bit of a breakdown. After everything I have listed went by, I went through a phase of not feeling a thing. I went from feeling a huge amount of emotion to nothing at all, emotionally numb. I‚Äôm still recovering from this but there‚Äôs still a long way to go. 

One of the main things on my mind a lot is the fact during those years, I wasted a lot of time. I didn‚Äôt have the relationships most people have during their youth, I was very alone and isolated. What disturbs me the most is my inexperience with women. The furthest I have gone with a women is kissing, nothing sexual. I am a 23 year old male virgin and I feel deeply ashamed about this pretty much every day. 

It actually stops me from being better. I have this voice in my head, telling me I am unworthy because of this fault of mine. I don‚Äôt know how long it will take to lose, most likely a while as I want to connect with a women properly before it gets physical but the utter shame I feel due to this situation sits in the centre of my mind, determined not to leave me.",07Dec2019,1
635,"All right, so I have this friend whom I've known for several years, whose behaviour has really been getting on my nerves as of late. I have been tolerant, but this weekend I just couldn't handle it anymore.  We have this thing that we do with our friends, where we sometimes meet up on the weekend and do something together at a friends house, like watch a movie or play videogames. And right now we are running a pseudo-marathon of a movie series that all of us seem to enjoy at least moderately. Since most of the people in our group of friends have seen the movies before, we have been kind of easy going with our ""Shut Up and Watch the Film (I'll call it SHUWF)"" -rule, allowing ourselves to comment on certain aspects or facts about the movies. But this guy has been especially dismissive of the SHUWF-rule. It has been minor annoyances, such as him just saying random words at random times that may or may not have a connection to the movie we're watching, or him just poking us in the neck, small things like that. I realise that he seems to want attention. And I wonder how I could provide him with that. 

But this weekend it just went too far. He was doing the usual stuff, saying random words etc. and also watching his phone half the time, sometimes with very loud volume. But the thing that really drew me over the edge was that he sometimes even screamed these random words off the top of his lungs during some parts of the movie. We planned on watching at least two movies, but after the first one I had realised that watching a movie in the same room as this guy at this point in time just wasn't enjoyable, so I left early. 

Dont get me wrong, I love this guy, he's really nice and fun to be around, and I realise that this post may come off as passive-agressive, but that is not my intent. I just want to know how to deal with his behaviour, and how I may prevent it. One thing that I have yet to mention is that most of our group seems to be okay with his behaviour, and sometimes even joining in on, for example, poking at eachother.

I have a baby face and I‚Äôm a long distance runner. I‚Äôm often told I look way younger. I‚Äôm an introvert and I‚Äôm quiet. I‚Äôm not scared.

It doesn‚Äôt happen super often but I notice there is definitely a difference in respect and treatment when you compare me and my dad when dealing with vendors and customers in this business. 

I feel like some people look at me like I‚Äôm a harmless person that can be pushed around. People seem to try to push boundaries with me. When I stand up for myself people are often super dismissive of me or they almost laugh it off. It isn‚Äôt until it‚Äôs very readily apparently I‚Äôm going to eject them from my business or give them a beating do they take me serious and start being respectful of me. Every time I put my foot down or stand up for myself the same thing always happens.

Delivery truck driver in his fifties starts poking me and I tell him to stop. He laughs at me and keeps poking me. I grab him slam him up against the wall and explain to him he needs to keep his fucking hands off me.

644,"So I \[F20\] went out on a first date with a guy \[22\] I'd met off of tinder yesterday. We had been texting back and forth for a while and decided to meet up. We went for dinner and to a few bars. I'd said he could stay at my place since it was closer to his work, where he was headed in the morning, than travelling back home. However, before we met up I said that I don't have sex on the first date due to being led on in the past and he said he was fine with this.

We went out and were having a really good time, at least in my opinion. The conversation flowed just as well in person as it did via text and I think(?) he was attracted to me.

We went back to my place and watched a movie. We started making out and he started to take things further than I was comfortable with. I told him to stop and reminded him I don't have sex on the first date. He stopped and we just ended up cuddling for the rest of the night. His hands would wander slightly over my ass and my breasts but I didn't really mind.

We woke up early the next morning and started making out heavily. I was kind of enjoying it and was maybe comfortable with going further with him the next time we met. He then pulled up my shirt and started sucking on one of my nipples, which I began to feel uncomfortable with and told him to stop. He did and was fine with doing so and we lay there talking and cuddling until he left.

Once he left I asked him if he wanted to go on a second date and he said no because he felt that he was staying at my place so that we could have sex, even though I told him that wouldn't happen. He said he was put off me due to the fact that I didn't have sex with him, even though I'd stated otherwise.

I've been upset and been feeling guilty in thinking that maybe I did lead him on and that I should have just let him go home after the date instead of taking him to my place. I really liked this guy and I feel like I've ruined my chances. Can someone tell me if I did the wrong thing?",07Dec2019,1
646,"Yesterday, my best friend and I got into an argument. It started at school when he asked if I was going to this social event the school was hosting, to which I said, ‚Äúyes‚Äù. He asked if I could be his ride there, and I also said ‚Äúyes‚Äù.

However when I got home, I wasn‚Äôt feeling my best and decided not to. I told my friend and he got EXTREMELY mad at me, telling me that I was untrustworthy and that I was breaking a promise. I tried explaining to him that this won‚Äôt be the last social event the school hosts and that he can find a different ride. But he told me and demanded me to ask other people to give him a ride, since his cell didn‚Äôt work (I had texted him via Hangouts, which not a lot of people have). 

So I tried asking multiple people, and meanwhile my friend was being very rude to me the entire time, saying that I was annoying, that he hated me, and that I should go to hell.

Eventually once I found him a ride, all he could say was ‚Äúsorry I got so pissed, I have trust issues‚Äù. Even though he really, really hurt me, and I honestly don‚Äôt feel like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù is enough to fix what he did because I don‚Äôt think he meant it. 

He ended up having a great time at the party, while I was balling my eyes out because I couldn‚Äôt believe he would say that awful stuff to me. Did I deserve it? Who‚Äôs really in the wrong? Should I forgive my friend?",07Dec2019,1
647,"I was born with a genetic mutation called Ichthyosis. Its a grotesque skin disease that covers areas of your body and can progress as you get older. Its rare but in my late 30's it has went to my face. I remember first noticing it as far back as age 4 when people would point it out and say how dry my legs were. As I got older into my childhood my legs looked like fish scales and so bad that scrubbing them would cause injuries and expose a layer of flesh that needs to be protected by the layers of skin a normal human would have. Kids made fun of me. I stopped wearing shorts ever since then. I am 36 and haven't worn shorts since I was 13 unless swimming, which is extremely rare in my case because I am embarrassed to show my body. Its horrid. The condition inevitably caused my legs to not grow hair ever again, then my arms got it in my highschool days. It got worse as I reached my 20s and have been wearing long sleeve shirts since then. Also at age 21 I started balding. Losing the whole top of my scalp of hair, looking like an old man in my late 20's around the time I stopped attracting women. Have been single and without friends since because its ugly. I always wear a hat now... But as of this year its to the point where my eyebrows are fading, my eye lashes are falling out by the day. The dry skin sticks to the seems of my eyes, my eye lids, and in my eye brows. It itches very bad and the hair then loosens and falls out. I am so screwed. I am also living from check to check, in a fucking hole in the wall where I can't afford anything outside of my bills. I don't know what to do. I look like shit. My face looks empty, wrinkly, ugly and flaky. When I go out, my face starts shedding and looking like I just rubbed a white eraser all over my face. This has been the main cause of depression and stress throughout my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do cosmetically or anything that won't make it look so apparent that I am masking my face?

648,"As the title says, I have no friends. I‚Äôve tried making friends with people at my school but we always seem to have a falling out. I had another group of friends outside of school for a while but internal drama separated everyone. 

My last group of ‚Äúfriends‚Äù I‚Äôve known since I was a kid. We would and still play Xbox all together and for a while it was fun. But once we all got into high school (they go to a private school), they changed. They started to only gossip about things going on in their school and were more aggressive. If I made fun of one of them, they would take it to heart and say either something offensive or racist. As time went on, things just got worse. Sometimes now two or three of them will team up and try to get to me with non stop insults but I‚Äôd say I hold my own (despite being horrible at insults).

649,"hi all, my boyfriend and I are both 19 years old, and he has an awesome job that he loves at an apartment complex doing maintenance. The company that he works for is having a (semiformal?) Christmas party, and its at the founder of the company's house. It is a +1 event and my boyfriend is expected to attend, so I am accompanying him to this. He will only know a small group of people at the party, the people he immediately works with and the owner. I have met his coworkers once. The attire for this according to the invitation is ""Holiday Best"", so I'm guessing its semiformal ish. There is also a white elephant gift exchange happening. 
So basically what I'm asking is what should I expect at an event like this, what should I do, how should I talk, etc... as I said were both 19 so this corporate party stuff is very new to both of us, and we will probably be the youngest people there. I've really never been to a formal event like this, and honestly I never even go to parties with people my own age, so I'm afraid that I won't know how to talk to people/act etc. anyone have any advice for me? thanks",07Dec2019,1

652,"I‚Äôve previously posted here on Reddit about my issues moving to Switzerland and the various difficulties I have had with trying to adjust.

Another problem has come to the fore since then: my accent. To clarify, this is my English accent when I am speaking English and not when speaking German.

I am a native speaker of British English with a regional accent. The regional accent itself is not that strong and is considered ‚Äòposh‚Äô, i.e. quite standard but still obviously from the area that I grew up in. I make an effort not to use slang or dialect when I am talking, and although my accent is slow, I try to talk even slower than usual. I have worked with a lot of non-native speakers of English in the past and they have said my accent is easier to understand than most British people they know. My English skills in terms of my written English have been praised in most of my workplaces thus far.

Recently, my manager has been mocking my accent in meetings, along with another colleague. By this, I mean that he is making an unflattering impression of how I pronounce certain words. My manager has also suggested that I get English lessons during a team meeting. The manager makes comments that British people are hooligans and repeatedly asks about Brexit and whether I am still able to travel to other countries. There have been a number of other comments made about English food being crap, colonialism, etc. Most of our department has apparently left due to the level of personal and professional criticism we are expected to take.

Some of the comments are easier to brush off than others - the ones about my accent I find particularly hurtful - in particular because it is encouraging other employees to make comments too. I can speak some German but never feel comfortable doing so in front of my manager because of how my English is mocked. Indeed, my manager has also made disparaging comments to me about another native English speaker‚Äôs German abilities.

Recently, my manager made me cry in a meeting as he picked apart a piece of work that I had done. The work was not in fact wrong as I later found out - just contained a number of facts about our engineering plant design that did not meet with the manager‚Äôs expectations.

I am thinking of resigning as it is really getting out of hand. Is it worth a visit to HR first? My notice period lasts three months, so I am unsure of how to plan my exit strategy.

Tl;dr: Manager mocks my accent when working abroad, other issues about the work itself",07Dec2019,1

655,"So I run a very small online business from home, it‚Äôs just me, a one woman band, working to make a little money to help support my husband and our young children. Whilst small, I have a steady stream of orders come through each week which make it worthwhile, and I really do enjoy it so much. 

My product is personalised and each piece made-to-order with a turnaround time of 2 weeks.

On November 30, I received an email from Stripe [the payment processor for my website] saying that my account with them was no longer verified and I needed to upload my ID to becoming authorised again.  Not a problem, I remember having to do this at the beginning 2 years ago when I started up, there were no issues and my ID was accepted instantly.

Now, for some reason nobody at Stripe can explain, they cannot accept my [still valid] ID and payments that were due to come out have been put on hold ‚Äúuntil a valid ID is provided‚Äù apparently. For those not familiar with Stripe, basically customers pay via Stripe and those payments are processed and received on my end 5-7 days later. 

I have tried every avenue of Stripe support to get this sorted, but I‚Äôm not getting anywhere and nobody at Stripe seems willing to help or get back to me. 

I have accepted the fact that I‚Äôm likely not to receive these payments and Stripe will eventually refund the customers, therefore I don‚Äôt really want to fulfil these orders if I‚Äôm not going to receive the payments for them. 

Husband thinks I should explain the situation, manually refund each customer, and ask them to pay again via PayPal or bank transfer if they still wish to go ahead with their order. Problem is, I don‚Äôt know how to explain this without sounding dodgy?! As a customer, I think I would find this a little suspicious but I don‚Äôt know, maybe I‚Äôm overthinking it?

For now I‚Äôve put my website in maintenance mode to avoid any more orders coming through while I try and figure out what to do. 

Any advice would be really appreciated!",07Dec2019,1

657,"I am a 20 y/o Non-binary sophomore in college. I recently went home for Thanksgiving and it was just an all-around awful experience. I know most Thanksgiving experiences are, but this was so much worse than it was last year. I feel like I'm just being overdramatic about what's going on but maybe some of you guys have some insight that I don't. For reference, I pay for all of my school and have never asked my parents to help pay my tuition. They bought me a laptop at the beginning of college but whenever I offer to pay them back for it (like they used to bug me about all the time) they refuse.

The first thing that happened was me informing my parents of my decision not to study abroad. They were over dramatically against this decision and told me that I had to study abroad. The reason I am planning on not going abroad is that I need to be able to work, and if I go somewhere outside of the country, that's just not a possibility for me. My parents argued that they would help pay for me going abroad and I didn't need to worry about that. Thing is, they had to ask me for money to pay for the mortgage back in September. I don't feel comfortable relying on them to pay for that. I also feel like they were completely disrespecting my decision by trying to tell me what I ""have"" to do. I especially don't want them to have to pay for me when I have three younger siblings who need the money much more than I do.

The second thing was my mother yelling about me about having my phone with me at night. I keep my phone with me because if I don't, I tend to be up until all hours of the night unable to sleep because I'm thinking too much (I don't want to say that I have any specific mental disorders right now because I haven't yet been diagnosed, I'm working on it). When I said to my mother that respectfully I am an adult and this is something I should be able to make my own decision about both my mom and my dad belittled me for saying ""I'm an adult."" And they made fun of me like I was some sort of 10-year-old kid saying I was big. Then my mom told me that ""an adult would respect the rules of the house."" I understand what she is saying, but if my uncle was visiting, I don't think she would tell him that phones weren't allowed in the bedroom with him. 

Both of them also bothered me about my grades, which I haven't shown them, seeing as how I am the one who is paying my tuition. I also don't want to deal with the pushback I'll get from it because I'm not a perfect straight-A student.

My family also wants me to stay at home and commute to and from my work on campus during our winter session. This is ABSOLUTELY the opposite of what I want to do for a number of reasons being that, I'm working nights and don't want to drive home after and also because being at home was such an unpleasant experience.

I guess what I'm asking is what should I do? Am I being an entitled asshole because I want to get the respect other adults get from my parents? Is it bad that I don't want to stay at home?",07Dec2019,1

Roommate (did not know at the time) has been dating his girlfriend for 2 yrs, they are generally always together except for maybe half a night on the weekend.

Fast forward to last year:
Me and two others wanted him as our fourth for an apartment (didn't know about his girlfriend beforehand). His girlfriend came over and slept every night this past year (at least 6 nights a week), she would take a shower every night and very rarely eat our food. More recently she has begun staying here without him sometimes (once a week?). I hadn't noticed this since I'm usually in class from ~9:30-6pm, but I am now noticing it as finals are approaching because my classes are over. I feel like a majority of the time I tolerate her instead of like her, I'd feel very uncomfortable if I was alone at the apartment and she was there. Apartment is a 4x4 for size. Other roommates think it's kind of weird, but they both think general idea that she sleeps over way too much. I am also going to be living with him for 6 more months.

669,"I'm currently 19 (F) about to start my next semester of college (Spring 2020). I've been having family issues for about a year now. It started with my dad and ex step-mom last year in October splitting up (she cheated on him so they we're already done for) so me and my dad had to move out. She acted like she was my mom figure in my life and now me and her don't talk anymore.

Now, fast forward to July of this year. My step-dad is a psychopath with severe anger issues. My mom is manipulating, and controlling. She always defends him over me and always picks him first. One morning on the way to work, he gets angry at me for no reason and tells me to pack my stuff and move out. (Some context here is that I live with my mom and dad; I go to each of their houses one week at a time). My mom doesn't do anything to really defend me, so I now live full time with my dad. I barely talk to my mom anymore and her whole side of the family had disowned me and made it clear they don't like me for some reason.

Currently, I live with my dad and do my college work online and stay at home. His side of the family doesn't have anything to do with me and they always act strange and odd around me. I suspect it's because they're holding a grudge because I look like my mom and allowed her to control and manipulate me when I was a child. Recently, my dad hasn't really had anything to do with me. He comes home drunk every night and goes to bed.

My dad almost passed away at the beginning of this year due to stress, and heart and blood pressure problems. He worries me with his constant drinking. There have been times before were he's told me his body (his legs mainly) go numb and he can't walk. It's scary.

I also have a lot of problems going on here at his house. We never have food to eat, we have a flea infestation, and I've lost 10 pounds since moving here. I don't feel like I have anything going on here. My friends don't want to hang out with anymore because they're busy (which I understand) but my best friend keeps making plans with me and backs out last minute. I never leave the house, I have no one to teach me how to drive, I want a job but no means of getting there.

My boyfriend (LDR relationship) has offered to let me move in with him. I feel like this might be a good choice for me? I'm not sure how to start this process. I have to transfer colleges and move all of my stuff. He's coming to visit me next weekend (or so we believe) I still have to tell my dad but I'm scared my dad won't allow him to come over.

To sum things up: Should I move in with my LDR boyfriend?

So I came in and said she said she‚Äôs taking the room and the receptionist deregards me completely and ask so how did you like the room is it the one? And it was like they were old time friends. I realized people treated me with less respect. That another hire from my location came to train in this location she was white and automatically was like no go for everyone. That we noticed how they would help each other and just leave us to do our own work when they should be teaching instead when we had a question they made us feel like idiots and on my last day I came in and ran across an issue. A women wanted to use a card that wasn‚Äôt on file but was in the system but it won‚Äôt show the name or anything just number and exp date it‚Äôs illegal to charge a card without authorization as it‚Äôs considered fraud. But the thing is she didn‚Äôt let me know she had the card in hand that I told her get the person on the phone and make him say the exp date cuz anyone can say that‚Äôs me cuz the card is not on file! So she accused me of racism but I‚Äôm just trying to do my job I don‚Äôt know you. Even if you live here I want to follow rules if that‚Äôs what‚Äôs required well I‚Äôm sorry and the girl who was ignoring me when I asked her what to do in this situation where I cant confirm whose card is it just took the phone and had the person say it was them didn‚Äôt ask for exp date and hung up and asked why was that so hard. Um I was getting accused of being racist? And turns out she had the card the entire time had I know I would of put it on file so next time it‚Äôs there and no one goes through what i did but instead I‚Äôm getting told I was being rude discriminating and that‚Äôs a tenant and usually if the card is on file go ahead and just tell her to call like okay stfu cuz I know if i had done that and turns out it was fraud whose going to get in trouble? Me just for taking their word because they are tenants but whatever. When I was told that when I got stressed was because I had run across and issue and the person was ignoring me and then later called the managers and complained about me not knowing how to do shit and being told by the managers you know the owner and I came because she complained about you not knowing the system when she was with holding info from me purposely giving me the wrong info and then later getting a call from my manager asking me why was I contacting the owner and not a manager ? Because he later complained about me interrupting his Interviews and I had no reason to call him. Like I‚Äôm sorry but no managers have given me their numbers and when I asked them no we give you a call but end up never calling. And when feeling under stressed and asking for a managers number the coworker saying they don‚Äôt have it when they do and being told yes they have all managers number every employee has our numbers.. so we are the exclusion? Cuz the woman who was going to work with me also didn‚Äôt have it. I was then told I wasn‚Äôt performing as expected so I said okay I tried my best and explained how it was like she didn‚Äôt try helping me at all ignoring me and I asked her about an eviction she just ignored me and left to go what I assume was check on it? And I told them it was only cuz I needed help nope like always the staff is never blamed because they are the flock of blue feathers stick together and it‚Äôs like okay I‚Äôm sorry but when I get stressed I can‚Äôt relax and then it‚Äôs like I have no ones number and she refuses to give me any number so who I call. Which for some reason didn‚Äôt think he would get mad at me and turns out he said he was scared that I wasn‚Äôt a good fit because he really expected more of me
So I was like okay well what now? All this for nothing? Am I getting fired? And she‚Äôs like no your going to train in your location and I was thinking that meant by the end of the shift they would of come up with my schedule or something. Nope. My shift ends and I go to talk to them and they say just go home well give you a call. Well today is the 3rd day and no call. I want to give it time as I know making a schedule isn‚Äôt just as easy to put up in a day but I also don‚Äôt want to keep waiting and turns out I don‚Äôt get a call. And wasted a week I could of been working instead I waited because they said they weren‚Äôt firing me but turns out they did low key.

687,"Sorry, this will probably be long because backstory is needed. 
8 years ago I met a guy (L) and liked him from the start. We've been friends since. I never knew how to get closer to him, but always wanted to be with him.
A year after meeting him, I met my now best friend.
The next year they were dating. I was devastated, but kept it to myself. I had to be the supportive best friend to her, even as she was living my dream. 
They broke up mutually a few months later because he was working out of town. 
Shortly after that, she got with another guy and quickly got pregnant. She was on and off with him, dating a few other guys in between, but eventually got back with the father and has been with him for a few years now. They just got their own place together, shes committed to him. 
About a year ago L started messaging me, and never stopped. It started one day, and every day since I've gotten a goodmorning and a goodnight. A few months in, I started to get the feeling that he liked me. Just to be courteous, I talked to my friend to make sure she would be ok with it. She gave me the go ahead and said it would help her get over him, because apparantly he's her ""what if"". 
L and I started dating, and it's been wonderful. The best relationship I've ever been in, honestly. We get along so well, and hes supportive, encouraging, and trusting. I avoid talking about him in front of my friend to be courteous while she gets past it. 
Things have been great for a few months, and then my friend said she wanted to talk to me about it. She messaged me saying she felt betrayed, and like I didnt consider her feelings. 
I go to her place and she essentially gave me an ultimatum. If I continue dating him, she wont be able to be a part of my life, because she doesnt want to be around her ""what if"". She told me that if I stay with him she will inevitably drift away from me. 
I dont know what to do here. So far I've basically been pretending that conversation didnt happen.  Still talking to her about random stuff and whatnot, being a friend. Continuing to date my boyfriend. But I worry that soon she's going to start asking about me leaving him or not. And I dont know how to respond to that without losing her as a friend. I've wanted to be with this guy for forever, and now that I am, it's better than I could have imagined. I can't throw that away just because she still feels she has claim over him despite having her own little family. But I dont want to lose her as a friend because other than this issue, and one major but unrelated one back in high school, shes been a really good friend to me. Her son calls me auntie and I love him like hes blood. Shes not just my best friend, shes family.

I have two older brothers and they are both around twenty. I‚Äôm 16 and my mom is 41. She‚Äôs claiming she‚Äôs pregnant and that she wants to keep the baby. I hate the baby‚Äôs father and I honestly wish she‚Äôd miscarry. It‚Äôs mostly because she has poor health and I have no clue if her body could take it.

693,"My dog is a rescue, I have had him for almost 3 years and he is about 7 the vet thinks. I got him when me and my LTR bought our ‚Äúforever home‚Äù. (Big house, big yard). He was clearly beaten by his previous owners and is scared of men in general. 

My LTR ended things suddenly and we (me and dog) had to move, but I couldn‚Äôt find an apartment in my home town or surrounding area that would accept dogs, even tho he only weighs like, 21 pounds. I ended up moving in with my sister, her husband- and her family while I look for a place to buy come spring. I love my dog way to much to even consider rehoming and they were kind enough to take us both in. 

My sister is extremely allergic to dogs so I keep him in my room most of the time to help reduce her allergies. He is used to being in my old house bedroom while I was away at work anyways so it isn‚Äôt a big deal- but my niece (3) kind of loves him and kind of hates him. I think she likes that she is bigger than something in the house and likes to yell at him or boss him around. I have caught her yelling at and even a few times hitting him. I of course disciplined her and tried to teach her but... she‚Äôs 3. 

I was at work all day yesterday and then my sister called me right as I was getting out. She had sent my niece into my room to look for something in the closet and I don‚Äôt know how much time transpired but in the end, the baby left my room wailing and crying saying my dog bit her. She has a slight scratch on her forehead but no puncture wound and was not bleeding but was terrified. I of course, assume she was either on top of him or hitting him if he even did bite.. (he has never even so much as growled or even barked in 3 years), so this is really hard to believe for me but I also understand this is my sisters kid and no matter what I get it. 

In my head tho, it‚Äôs not the dogs fault or the toddlers fault... this is because my sister allowed the baby near the dog alone in the first place. I have told her countless times that even tho my dog is gentle and sweet- it does not mean that he is not still a dog. I have tried to explain to the baby that she should not be in the dogs face or be rough with him but again- she‚Äôs only 3. And I of course have tried to teach my dog to be gentle but... he‚Äôs a dog so. 

When my sisters husband found out, he of course was really pissed- I don‚Äôt blame him. I at first was worried that they would try and make me get rid of the dog (which I won‚Äôt do) or kick us both out. Because I have put my foot down about not ‚Äúgetting rid of the dog‚Äù, they have decided to think about what‚Äôs next for me, but kicking us out is on the table. I‚Äôve since put a baby lock on the door knob of the bedroom to keep the baby away from going into my room when I am not around/at work/ even when I‚Äôm home. The ‚Äúbite‚Äù left nothing more than a slight scratch so no one knows what really happened. Is there anything else I can do to ensure that the baby won‚Äôt get bit, or traumatize my dog?",07Dec2019,1

695,"A few years ago I (26) had one class with this girl in college for one semester. I thought she was funny so I‚Äôd laugh at her jokes and we‚Äôd talk from time to time.
We didn‚Äôt really keep in touch, just react to each other‚Äôs Instagram stories until beginning of this year where we were talking more and more. She knows I am gay so she isn‚Äôt interested in me but I noticed all she likes to do is complain about her love life, and doesn‚Äôt want to take my advice or listen to how my life is going. I don‚Äôt mind if she wants to take my advice or not but it got to a point where she was too intense. She will ask how I‚Äôm doing, won‚Äôt respond to what I have to say about myself, and will just go straight into her drama.
She is very intense and I feel she only wants to talk about herself and doesn‚Äôt care about anything else.

Basically since April I haven‚Äôt responded to her and I feel so bad that I ghosted her but she hasn‚Äôt seemed to get the message. I still get daily messages or memes sent to me.

So my longtime girlfriend and I exchanged gifts and it was very nice. We agreed to only get each other books this year which was nice.

I feel awful for saying this though but the books she got me are in no way linked to my personality or my interests except one which I feel was like a concession on her part. We differ a little on our belief systems and politics but not very much and all the books she got me were I feel aimed at ""converting"" me or pushing me in and could be viewed as passive aggressive.

713,"As the title says. I want to escape my mother. I'm not being abused physically, but mentally its draining me. Wasn't sure whether to post on r/insaneparents or not because I dont know if this is normal since it's always been like this.
Here's the dilemma: 
I'm a 14 year old girl. I follow the rules. Get decent grades. I'm average. Never dated anyone. I'm respectful, mature, I cook and clean. I'm an artist and I love art. But what I dont understand is that, while I do everything right, every little thing I do wrong is thrown back at my face.
Backstory time...my mother never gives me any privacy whatsoever. No locks on doors. Phone is monitored 24/7. If I'm caught with it in my room I'm punished. I have been threatened to be beaten multiple times. (I have not been physically punished since 7-8). I am always told that I ""owe"" her because she brought me into this world. Actual quote she told me today just a few hours ago:
""You owe me, because I am your parent. You are so disrespectful and dont take care of anything I give you. You always ask for new things and what do i get? I get nothing in return. Maybe you should find a job and pay for your own things.""
Now let me tell you what i did to cause that sentence.  I was in my room taking a nap. I admit my room was a little messy but that's because it's that fun time of the month and I didnt really feel like picking it up at that moment. She came into my room, not knocking, shook me awake, and started yelling. I was just taking a nap what the fuck do I do? So I yelled back. Huge mistake. Here's how it went down:
Me: ""Why do you always come in here and scream at me?""
Mom: ""I'm not screaming! I dont have to give you an explanation anyways! I'm your mom! You owe ME,  because I'm your parent! You are so disrespectful and dont take care of anything I give you."" Etc. Etc.
Funny thing is I DO buy my own clothes and shoes. She bought me clothes for the first time in 2 years over black friday. A sweater and jeans. Said it was my christmas gift. (She knows I need clothes yet doesnt give then to me despite that.) While on the other hand my brother is given a hefty allowance and gets to spend on whatever he wants. Hell, he just got a $150 suit! I've never owned anything that expensive in my life!
 I dont understand what I am doing to be treated like an indentured slave. I live. I owe. I get to be free after I pay. That's it! 
And when I confront her about me wanting to be a comic artist, she laughed! ""Pick a real career."" I tell her I really want to be an artist but she has all these rules and restrictions on how I cant have any relationships, cursing, etc. in my story..!
Next day I find all my art in the trash. But it wasn't my mom that threw it away. I did. I've given up on everything, I have nothing that belongs to me, I have nothing. I dont get it. What do I do? I just want to live a normal life and have fun like everyone else... I'm just a 14 year old kid that craves something other than laying on my bed all day and cleaning. I need help..",07Dec2019,1

717,"So to make it quick, i have been liking this girl since 4 months ago in the beginning of high school, that's also when i first met her. We've been going out a lot (almost everyday in the morning and evening) these 3 weeks because schools were closed due to an earthquake. Since then my friends from my past class before entering high school and her friends have been hanging out, played volleyball, etc. and i just liked her a lot.

Three days ago we had a birthday (they were my twin friends, a boy and a girl) and everything was going fine when we were at a paintball area. Then we went in a restaurant to eat pizza. My best friend and my crush were secretly texting each other on snapchat and i was curious about it, but he didn't tell me.

The next day we hung out again, it was me, my best friend, my crush and another girl. My best friend was teasing my crush about the boy twin, so i asked her why was he doing this. Sadly she told me she liked the boy twin and i immediately got very sad. It was obvious i was a little mad about that, but rather kept it to myself. My best friend asked me did you get mad and then i said of course how wouldn't I and told him i'll probably quit on my crush and end it.

718,"i can't even believe i have to entertain this bullshit, but my dad just came into my room complaining that the last time my bf dropped me off at home, he drove into our neighbours driveway so that he could back out and turn around. i know there are many other ways to turn around, but my bf's car is a manual and he said that by going up the driveway, he doesn't have to use gas and can just let his car roll back easy. i told my dad this and he does a smug smile and says ""that's bullshit"" and then proceeds to say that it's illegal and that if the neighbours complain, then we'd be in trouble. then he wouldn't let me say anything else and just said that the next time he either backs into our driveway or he does a 3 point turn. 

i'm so goddamned annoyed right now because i can't say anything back anymore but i literally don't know how he pulled this bullshit out of his goddamn ass and why it would even affect us? even if the neighbours did complain, which only a fucking karen would about something this minor as using a driveway for 3 seconds to back out, it has nothing to do with us, it would my bf who gets reprimanded so i don't see why he's even fucking worried. he just needs to walk into my room, throw a huge shit on my mood for something so goddamn insignificant and stupid, i wanna tell him to fuck off with his bullshit because literally what the fuck is he even talking about. 

but ok let me ask reddit. would you get in trouble for using a driveway to back out and turn around? or is my dad just being an asshole and trying to piss on my mood with his bullshit that he can't even prove. i hate that i just have to take it and shut my mouth when i know he's just spewing bullshit. i'm about to just tell my bf not to drive in front of my house anymore because my dad is an asshole for no reason.",07Dec2019,1
719,"This online friend who I've known for a good 3 years now is about to finish and graduate University next year in 2020. 

Within 2019 I have started to express interest in traveling to his country and staying with him for about 2 weeks.

I was excited at the prospect of him showing me around his culture and just generally hanging out with him for the duration of my visit. 

However, due to his university putting a 1 week limit on visits, and me currently not having enough money to afford the flight, we decided that it would be better to save the trip for another time. 

Now, I know that he is planning on graduating Uni next year in June or July of 2020, and if all goes well for him, he'd be getting his own job right after, and either moving back in with his parents, or moving into his own place. 

Now, for me, I want him to be happy and have a good job and all of that stuff. 

However, as I sit here today, I'm worried sick about what's going to happen.

 If he ends up moving in with his family, there's no way I'd be able to actually stay with him, but If he gets his own place and his own job, and I were to visit him, than I'd be sitting in his house, alone, without him, for the duration of his work hours, instead of spending the time with him to explore his culture like I want to do. 

He has even said to me that any plans to visit him after he's graduated Uni would likely be very inconvenient for him, and I understand. 

However, this visit is still something that I really want to do. 

I just wish that there was a more convenient time for me to make this trip. 

If I do it before he leaves Uni, I'm limited to one week, which is way too little time for me when I'm paying 500$ or more for the flight.

But if I wait until after he graduates Uni he will most likely be too busy with his own life to hang out with me and show me around his culture. 

So I'm currently stuck in an endless loop in my brain worried that my trip with him is never going to come to fruition, and I feel like that isn't a prospect I can't just accept.
 
This person means a lot to me and I want to make this trip happen. 

And even though I don't know where either of us will be in a year, The possibility of my trip not coming to fruition frightens me to a redicious degree.",07Dec2019,1
720,"So from the start I look like a total horrible student, and you‚Äôre absolutely right. There‚Äôs no excuse for cheating at all. Here is my story.

I have never cheated on any of my college tests prior to this situation, MUCH LESS any final. But in my situation, I was so afraid and unsure. It is my freshman year, and this was a freshman level algebra course. Despite having the flu, I studied a lot the two nights before this final and was prepared. I took all my finals between throwing up and having a hard time, but this was my very last one and I was finally feeling slightly better. Arrived early and we were all placed in the testing center 15 minutes before the test. 

For context, I am pregnant and still in the early stages. I started getting serious cramps a bit before entering the testing center and they only progressed further. Truthfully, I was terrified of miscarrying. It is SO dumb of me, but I was not thinking rationally. There are no phones allowed in the testing center. I texted my mom who was meant to pick me up since it was my last final, and told her I was having cramps. She told me she was still on her way. The last thing I was worried about was my final when I was freaking out over suspiciously painful cramps. The first thing I thought of when my teacher came around to put in the passwords was finishing the test as soon as possible to leave. I even considered leaving before the final, but I knew this was my only chance to take it, as I live 5 hours from the college and would not be returning for months once I left.

Panic set in and I felt like I couldn‚Äôt afford to do all the work in time to make sure I was ok. I prioritized the baby inside of me and felt like I needed to cheat in order to finish quickly and leave. I was pretty obvious about having my phone in my lap. A professor (not mine) came around and failed my test immediately, calling me out in front of everyone. In a ridiculous way, I was almost relieved that i was caught because I was able to leave on the first question and possibly get help. But she took my ID and wrote my name down and told my professor, so I‚Äôm sure she reported me to the dean. I will be ok with a 0 because I did not practice academic integrity and I obviously violated serious rules no matter the circumstance. I am just so upset and ashamed that I didn‚Äôt think of a better way to get out of that final without putting my academic record on the line like an idiot. I was not in the right mindset for that final

I aced every other final without cheating and this is the only class I have failed. I am hoping my scholarship won‚Äôt get taken away or that I won‚Äôt be expelled because this is a first time offense and the situation cannot possibly be replicated. However, no one knows why I did what I did, and I have NO idea what will happen. I‚Äôm terrified. I‚Äôm sure they don‚Äôt care what I was thinking or why I did it, but I really wish I had a way to explain myself. Seeing the frustration and disappointment of the professors was the biggest life lesson ever.

I am too ashamed to tell my friends that I did something this stupid, but they do know I was failed and will possibly be reported. 

As far as we know now, the baby is fine. The doctor said to go to the ER if I bled, which I luckily didn‚Äôt. It was a terrifying experience. But baby is safe. So now I‚Äôm just so worried about what might happen to me next semester.

721,"TLDR: Does any one know of last minute charity programs or have any advice on what to do for 5 kids this close to chrismas? 

Hi all! I have 3 little ones (4, 6 and 7). I am a disabled veteran and my boyfriend works 50-60hrs a week. At the beginning of November he was hurt at work and got his hours cut significantly. We were relying on his income and some settlement money I am owed (that was ""guaranteed"" to be here before Thanksgiving) for Christmas. Now his income is barely covering bills and I've been told my settlement got pushed out to the beginning of next year. 

To top all of this off, my sister recently became homeless so I have taken guardianship of her 2 kids (11 and 13).

I have reached out to all the places I can think of that do toy donations but they have all said their cutoff dates have passed. 

Does anyone know of any other charities that would help in this situation? Should I just explain to the kids that we aren't doing xmas this year and maybe we can do a make up xmas when my settlement does come through? Any other advice it welcome, I am just stuck and have no idea what to do!!

722,"Every now and then I just get an intense surge of paranoia over anything and everything. It's been increading more and more recently. A few hours ago I was walking down my corridor and caught sight of my attic door on the ceiling and basically crumpled to the floor in fear, thinking 'what if someone is up there'. I know now that's dumb and illogical, sometimes I even think how dumb it is as it's happening but it's almost like i'm on autopilot. I also have this urge to check under the bed every night incase someone has snuck into my room (this fear is mostly dulled by the fact that I still live at home with my parents, since i'm only 17). The fear comes in a sudden wave almost. This is really impacting my life- going to school is getting harder and harder as I worry about being left alone in a classroom with someone. I can't stand public places, and more recently, rural places.... I used to adore where I live, my little haven in the countryside, but now I can hardly walk anywhere out of sight incase I get kidnapped or attacked.

725,"So I recently organized a date with a girl I met through a friend of a friend and it happens to be tomorrow. We've been texting for a while and seem to really hit it off but this is our first actual date. The plan is a double date tomorrow with her roommate and her bf and we'd go skating, visit the Christmas Market and then go out for a nice dinner afterwards. As of yesterday I made sure I had enough money (~$200 for skate rentals, both our meals, maybe a snack at the Christmas Market).

Skip to today when I realized I completely fucked up by forgetting I had an authorized student loan payment and now had less than $10 in my account. Bad planning on my part, really kicking myself for not remembering that earlier. 

My main dilemma is whether or not I should be honest and say I don't have money for our double date anymore or say I feel sick or something and push it to next weekend when I'll actually have money and will be able to have a proper first date (payday is this week). 

If it wasn't a double date I feel like it would be easier because I could change plans and cook or something but she's already arranged everything with her friends and I don't want to make a bad first impression (which would be the case even if she offered to pay for everything). I've posted a few video games and other things on kijiji to sell but no luck yet and I don't really have anyone I could borrow from to pay back next week (brother just night a car and parents are under some financial stress). I also tried calling the bank and the student loan office on a last ditch effort but not much can be considered on the weekend.

726,"So here's the deal. I'm vaccinated, fully. My girlfriend on the other hand has only had three in her entire life, due to them giving her near fatal seizures each time. Now I've never doubted vaccines, I've gotten them my entire life, and I'm fine aside from ADHD. The two of us don't fight about it, and our relationship couldn't be better after over a year, but I decided to humor her and her family and do some research, and I don't know what to think now. All my life I've been told they're needed and anti vaxxers are insane, but apparently there's some valid points. Like the question ""Where's all the autistic 70 year olds?"" and no I don't mean general autism, like you see kids these days uncontrollably screaming and kicking and not being able to ""function"" properly, while you don't see any elderly or middle aged people like that. There's also the fact that some dude that was CURING OUTBREAKS WITH VITAMINS got arrested because he stood against vaccines, due to having a WORKING alternative. Or maybe how there is (proven) human cells from ABORTED BABIES in quite a few of them because it's a ""necessary component""

 I would like to mention how every one of her 9 siblings also had bad reactions when getting vaccinated, most not as severe but her 1 year old sister is complex and any vaccine of any type has a 97% chance of killing her within hours.

I guess my question is should I keep researching and possibly become hated by my family, or keep looking into this? There's proven evidence against them, and a lot of claims by the medical industry have been found false before, like the one that the mercury in multi dose flu shot vials is harmless because it leaves the body so fast, when in actuality, it was actually going straight to the brain, metabolizing, THEN leaving, just faster than normal. (This type of mercury is STILL in the multi-dose vials today) I guess I'm just horrified of the very real possibility that I'll cross a line and nobody will take me seriously if I start trying to get the word out. If you have any ideas on how to talk about it without sounding insane PLEASE HELP. I have no idea how to bring it up.

Almost two months ago a good friend of mine (I'm calling her Mindy) introduced me to one of her best friends, and dated VERY briefly. I'll call this guy Bradley so the story is easier to follow.

I was going through a hard time when I met him, super vulnerable because of a decaying friendship/FWB situation with another guy I had cared about for a very long time. I met Bradley and we hit it off, and Mindy knew we liked each other so she pushed things along until he asked me out.

This barely lasted two weeks and Bradley turned out to be an asshole. He took advantage of me and I later learned that he talked a lot of shit about me to Mindy. Then he and Mindy fucked and formed this ""secrecy pact"" which lasted about a week until Mindy broke down and told me, after which she continued sleeping with him.

After this Mindy tried to confront him but ""fell in love with him"" I guess, and every day since then has consisted of me constantly supporting her while she struggles to let go of a clearly toxic relationship with this guy. To make everything very clear, I stopped talking to him and I forgave her for what she did immediately. It doesn't mean it didn't hurt, but to avoid causing her more pain I didn't really show much of my own feelings and instead decided to be the ""positive one"" in hopes of making things better.

For a long time they stopped communicating, and Mindy and I tried to heal by going to the gym together, eating better, practicing mutual self-love, etc. I am ready to move on with my life, not just from Bradley but I am trying to live happier in general. But she keeps going back to him and every single time she involves me. She sends me screenshots of every text he sends her. She asks me what to do and I tell her not to talk to him but she lies and then does it anyway, dragging the situation along even more.

I am done. I've tried to help her but she has no sense for how they both hurt me in the first place and I feel like I've given all the support in this friendship while no one is looking out for me. To be fair, I don't show a lot of my pain, but she's seen me cry about it and she knows I don't want to talk about Bradley anymore so I don't understand why she keeps torturing me with the whole thing.

I don't respond anymore when she brings it up but then she gets irritated so I don't know what to do. I'm also afraid that since they're talking now she's going to bring him around more and I know for a fact that I never want to see him again.

She told me for the first time that one day he locked her in his room and made her watch him masturbate. Later that week he showed her his playboys. She was intrigued by all of this and many times used me as an experience. Kissed me, touched me. I remember one of this encounters she and i had. I didn't cared much for it, i think i even responded to it. But i didn't know what really meant. I was a child. She was a child. It was/is really hard to admit this to ourselves. 

And my experience with him was exactly how it is in the title. One day i was watching videos in his room and and he had just gotten out of the shower and had the towel wrapped around his waist. He opened it and said ""have you ever seen this?"" I remember everything from that day. Then i got up and ran home. And never spoke about this to anyone. And aftet all of that i really got into porn.

I (17m) am not sure if I was molested / touched as a kid, or if i‚Äôm just being dramatic. 
When I was somewhere between 8-10 (my memory is trash) my father and I went to my uncles house. We get there, I listen to the adults talk for a minute before my dad says I can talk to my cousin in his room. At the time I hadn‚Äôt see him in at least a year, as we never drove over there often. So I walk to his room upstairs, and he‚Äôs sitting on his bed watching tv or something. I remember he was showing me some of his toys (he was 7-9 years old I think) and asked me to go into his closet with him. Why not? He closed the door when we walked in and he sat on the floor. He told me to sit down, said he wanted to try something. Sure, I sit down in front of him. Next thing I remember is him kissing me, and I just sat there not knowing what the hell to do. It wasn‚Äôt just a simple kiss either, god. He shoved his tongue in my mouth after a minute, trying to (I assume?) french kiss me. And I let him. I know I was a dumbass for letting him do that to me, but I didn‚Äôt know what to do besides let him finish. He stopped when my father called for me to get in the car. We walked out of the closet without saying anything, he sat back on his bed and I got in the car to leave. I never mentioned it to anyone. I forgot about it for a few years and it popped up in my brain last week, and I‚Äôm not sure how to feel. I mean, we were both kids and maybe he didn‚Äôt know just what he was doing. Probably saw his mom with someone and wanted to try it with me? And he didn‚Äôt even touch me besides the kissing, at least I don‚Äôt think he did. I‚Äôm probably being dramatic over stupid shit that happened years ago but I want to get it off my chest and see if others think I should tell someone.

739," I'm a 20-year-old uni student. Right now I work as a casual in a retail store. The store is pretty unique in that it has a massive turnover and a lot of staff for a brand store so the work/management is a little different to a regular retail store. Right now I'm getting on average 25 hours a week, sometimes 30, which includes 1-2 shifts a week that I pick up but who knows what that'll look like once the holiday period is over.

I'm wanting to travel in a year or so and therefore I'm trying to work as much as possible (starting next semester after I finish an internship) and save up as much money as I can throughout 2020. I really love pretty much everything about my job right now (which is rare for a retail job) and so I do want to keep working at my store  


Therefore I figure I have 3 options;

‚Ä¢ Continue working as a casual and just try to work as many shifts as possible  
‚Ä¢ Continue working as a casual but also try to find a part-time job that has a bit higher pay (I do have experience in 'professional' roles, a few internships, and also have some industry connections through my parents and other networks so this isn't far fetched)  
‚Ä¢ Become full-time at my store

In my store, full-time employees (who are not managers, same job title and technically the same superiority as casuals), have a lot more responsibility. They basically manage the day to day floor operations whilst the managers of each department handle higher-level operations. This means that I would gain experience managing a team and I would have a much higher level of responsibility that could look attractive on a resume as a management role rather than just a basic retail role which I figure is a big positive. However, obviously I lose a lot of flexibility which I'm a bit worried about because I go to lots of uni events and trips, and take a bit of a pay cut so I'd not be earning much more than I do now. I'd also still be at uni (but pretty much all my work can be done from home) which is something to factor in.

Man: I recognize you from somewhere!
Me: Well you‚Äôve probably seen me at another meetup, and I also go to (local anime convention) every year. 
Man: No no, that‚Äôs not it. I know! You work at ‚Äúcoffee shop‚Äù!
Me: Um...no I don‚Äôt. (He‚Äôs right, but that‚Äôs not his business)
Man: Yeah you do! Remember last Monday I came in and you refilled my coffee and we chatted about movies. (I normally do dishes, but refill coffee if we‚Äôre slow)
Me: Don‚Äôt being up real life into this. That‚Äôs weird.

So I walk away and talk to a few friends, trying to forget about it. 

Two days later, I‚Äôm at work, and my boss calls me over and says we need to talk. He sits me down and tells me he was chatting with a customer this morning, and said customer mentions they bumped into me this weekend. He also mentions that the customer snapped a picture of me. My boss showed me his phone and it was a picture of me at the BDSM meetup, onesie, pacifier, harness, and all that good stuff.

Me: HOW DID YOU GET THAT PHOTO!?

Boss: Customer showed it to me on his phone, and I requested he email it to me. This is disturbing, OP. Why are you dressed like this while interacting with our customers?

Me: That was at a private, adults only event! He had no business taking a photo of me. Now delete that picture immediately! (I‚Äôm assuming the customer pulled the tape off his phone to snap the photo secretly. I definitely wasn‚Äôt aware a picture was being taken. The whole tape thing is kinda hard to enforce.)

Boss: I can‚Äôt do that, OP. Our image as a store is very important to us. The customer complained about seeing this, and I will have to report it to our district manager. And I‚Äôm worried about your mental health, to be honest, with the way you‚Äôre dressed here.

I tried actually grabbing the phone out of his hand, but of course he pulled back. I didn‚Äôt really feel like explain my daddy kink to my manager, so at that point I walked out, since my shift was nearly over. But what can I do now? My boss still has that embarrassing photo of me on his phone, and he‚Äôs going to send it to our DM. I‚Äôm pretty sure neither of them know that the BDSM/kink community exists. Is there anything I can do to protect myself here?

Yeah, I get being dressed up like that looks weird out of context, but I was at a private event. I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôll have to sit down with my manager at DM to explain my daddy kink and how it doesn‚Äôt interfere with my work.

Also: I messaged the group organizer on fetlife with a description of the man who took my photo, and she said she‚Äôll look out for him at future events.

Tl/dr: A customer bumped into me at a fetish meetup,  snuck a photo of me, and showed my boss. Boss is concerned about the way I‚Äôm ‚Äúinteracting‚Äù with customers outside of work and plans on bringing in our district manager on this issue.",07Dec2019,1

743,"As the title says. I want to escape my mother. I'm not being abused physically, but mentally its draining me. Wasn't sure whether to post on r/insaneparents or not because I dont know if this is normal since it's always been like this.
Here's the dilemma: 
I'm a 14 year old girl. I follow the rules. Get decent grades. I'm average. Never dated anyone. I'm respectful, mature, I cook and clean. I'm an artist and I love art. But what I dont understand is that, while I do everything right, every little thing I do wrong is thrown back at my face.
Backstory time...my mother never gives me any privacy whatsoever. No locks on doors. Phone is monitored 24/7. If I'm caught with it in my room I'm punished. I have been threatened to be beaten multiple times. (I have not been physically punished since 7-8). I am always told that I ""owe"" her because she brought me into this world. Actual quote she told me today just a few hours ago:
""You owe me, because I am your parent. You are so disrespectful and dont take care of anything I give you. You always ask for new things and what do i get? I get nothing in return. Maybe you should find a job and pay for your own things.""
Now let me tell you what i did to cause that sentence.  I was in my room taking a nap. I admit my room was a little messy but that's because it's that fun time of the month and I didnt really feel like picking it up at that moment. She came into my room, not knocking, shook me awake, and started yelling. I was just taking a nap what the fuck do I do? So I yelled back. Huge mistake. Here's how it went down:
Me: ""Why do you always come in here and scream at me?""
Mom: ""I'm not screaming! I dont have to give you an explanation anyways! I'm your mom! You owe ME,  because I'm your parent! You are so disrespectful and dont take care of anything I give you."" Etc. Etc.
Funny thing is I DO buy my own clothes and shoes. She bought me clothes for the first time in 2 years over black friday. A sweater and jeans. Said it was my christmas gift. (She knows I need clothes yet doesnt give then to me despite that.) While on the other hand my brother is given a hefty allowance and gets to spend on whatever he wants. Hell, he just got a $150 suit! I've never owned anything that expensive in my life!
 I dont understand what I am doing to be treated like an indentured slave. I live. I owe. I get to be free after I pay. That's it! 
And when I confront her about me wanting to be a comic artist, she laughed! ""Pick a real career."" I tell her I really want to be an artist but she has all these rules and restrictions on how I cant have any relationships, cursing, etc. in my story..!
Next day I find all my art in the trash. But it wasn't my mom that threw it away. I did. I've given up on everything, I have nothing that belongs to me, I have nothing. I dont get it. What do I do? I just want to live a normal life and have fun like everyone else... I'm just a 14 year old kid that craves something other than laying on my bed all day and cleaning. I need help..",07Dec2019,1

A year after we broke up, my family moved to another country, and we kept in touch (and still do) Basically, like we stayed friends and shit, but would talk like 2-3 times a month. We started talking more and now it‚Äôs everyday. He added me to his discord server and I play Overwatch and other games with friends of ours and I‚Äôm close with all of them. Now here‚Äôs the thing, I already have a crush on someone else. (m16) He‚Äôs the type of guy who‚Äôs generally nice to everyone but he treats me differently (in a good way) as in flirting with me, teasing me, etc. So basically while I was on call with a bunch of people in the group I told them abt the guy (not that I liked him, I just mentioned his existence) and ever since then, my ex has been acting the same way.

Fast forward 1 month to today. 2 days ago, we decided to prank the group that we got back together again and were flirting with each other, making every little thing we say sound wrong, etc, and Idk how to explain it but I feel like I‚Äôm starting to like him again, but I still like my crush from my current skl.

751,"This is a bit long so bare with me.  So im a 29 year old female. ive had a very tough life to the point where i wouldnt be surprised in the slightest if someone told me i was cursed. Ill give you some info on somethings i have dealt/dealing with.  
   
I cannot  work ( a story for another time), i do not get money from state or anything ( havent tried and do not plan to), i have some health issues, have major depression, anxiety, and PTSD from things that have happened in my life. Pretty much i have gone through more in my life so far than many people go through in their entire life. I wouldn't wish my enemies that pain, hurt, and struggle i have to deal with. Hell if i had money things still wouldnt get better. Okay well some things would but money can't solve everything.   


I have insomnia and i do not remember the last time i have had a good nights sleep, ive been on many insomnia meds over the years and my body gets use to them quickly. The doctor said "" there is nothing left to try"" when i asked to try a new sleep med because the last ones i had stopped working. That was a few years ago.  I have permanent 24/7 headaches/migraines that do not go away and doctors do not know why but they refuse to do a brain scan due to ?? Been dealing with horrible headache pain since 2013. Sometimes they get so bad i can barely function.   


I have no friends anymore, i got tired of being treated like shit adn taken advantage of and dropped everyone. Which is probably a good thing to be honest.  I enjoy helping people and people know that, so i was taken advantage of easily.  
I have no family except my father and he spends all his time treating me like shit trying to get me to kill myself, its been like this my entire life. Hes an cruel man that is an abusive psycho path. His threats are endless. My last ex was very abusive and almost killed me a few times, but hell im still here.  
  My mom actually killed me as a baby but i was saved by doctors. Im not sure how long i was dead. I happened to die while she was at a forced dr appointment. Forced by who or how? I am not sure.   
Before anyone says anything... No, i do not go to therapy, it doesn't work for me and always backfires. For instance, apparently its my fault that i was molested for years starting in preschool. Yeah you read that right. 

I think because i died...I'm taking up space in the world that was meant for someone else. Basically... I wasnt suppose to be here but i was saved and have lived a horrible life due to it. Yes that is a crazy belief but if you knew all i have went through , you would understand why I think that. I guess trying to find a reason in all the bad luck.  
I think because im not suppose to be here; i am tested daily to see if ill finally give in and grow a pair to hang myself. I am not religious by any means for reasons i feel arent important to talk about.  


I wasnt able to go to college, another long story. Hell i got a lot of long stories.   
And it is impossible to go to college( poor and cannot get aid or loans), and because i cant work it wouldnt matter anyway if i had a degree cuz it would be useless.  
My boyfriend works two jobs, mainly because he had to get a new car and the payment is high. But it kills me not being able to bring money into the house. I have sold off most of my things over the years. I dont really have anything left. I do make money time to time making things to sell or what not when I can but its rare. I was able to make a little bit of money recently on a few sales and was able to do the reddit secret santa thing this year. First time.  I was hoping id be able to make someone smile with a gift for christmas. My boyfriend was not upset that i did this. I actually made myself upset because i felt even though i didnt make a lot of money, that i still could have put it towards a bill. My boyfriend said "" It's your money and you rarely make money and i love you even more knowing that the little money you did get, you decided to use to give a stranger a gift in hopes of giving someone a smile. Never change who you are. This is one of the reasons i love you."" He is a great guy and loves me but i know he could do so much better!  


The last few months things have been pretty clear to me, i have no purpose.  
I am literally a waste of space and i have nothing to contribute to the world. I have no purpose and its just making me realize theres no reason to be here.   
Ive given up on my dreams as they are unreachable. All of them unless of course i win the lottery. With that being said i should probably buy a ticket huh? As i said before though. money still wouldnt solve everything.

What is the point of living if all you do is exist? Hell all the trash humans create on earth and im just alive making more trash not being able to contribute to help with anything. Not having a car thats reliable and hell dangerous to drive even. I can't even volunteer places because i don't have the means to get from point A to point B. Living around nothing doesnt help. I like to make people happy but hell, i cant even give or donate because i don't have the means to do so. I am not able to do the most simplest thing. Its heartbreaking. I cant even donate blood because i cant get to a donation place. Something so simple, so simple and i cannot even achieve that. There are no busses where i am , and i couldnt afford that anyway. I'm thankful i am able to have a cell phone and a roof over my head. But i have no purpose, there is no reason for me to be alive. There truly isnt. I guess im posting to see if anyone else sees this too.  


And as i sit here, acknowledging that i have no purpose and am just  a waste,  i ask myself, "" When is enough enough? When is it time to give up? Do i just sit here and try to move forward knowing things wont get better?   
When is it time to say goodbye and give up?"" I ask these questions daily.   
 Oh and before you bring up optimism. I use to be very optimistic trying to move forward in my life, until a life altering event happened few years back.   
Sorry for typos.   


**TLDR: I have no purpose in life and I am just taking up space. Is it time to give up or should i keep holding on in hopes that things may get better. When is it time to give up?**",07Dec2019,1
752,"(First post btw)

So I'm a 16 year old dude in 6th form and it seems like I'm making zero progress with girls. 
It's not even like I'm some kind of incel who scares girls away or something, I'm 6:1 and relatively good looking, i work out and take care of myself generally, (I'm a bit overweight). I have a good friend group at school and am liked by pretty much everyone. Most of my friends are the more popular people in school and their all getting girlfriends while i've never even been close to going on a date.
I've been to parties and talked to girls but that's pretty much always the end of it. I consider trying to exchange socials or asking them out if I've got their insta or something similar, but it always seems like a weird thing to do. 
One morning after a party I got told by two of my friends about two girls who wanted my snapchat, (one of which said I was cute). So one of them said nvm when my friend told them I didn't have snapchat and the other who said I was cute I ended up giving my insta to and we had a really short dm convo and that was it. 

As you can tell I'm quite socially awkward so any advice would be much appreciated.",07Dec2019,1
753,"So, I've regrettably run into this kind of people various times during my life, and I can't really understand, I've just got so many doubts and questions about it, but I can't really get to a point. To make it short, these people are usually partners or very close friends (if that's the word) of the other sex, and they are constantly angry or annoyed with you over petty  unremarkable daily things a normal person wouldn't even consider for more than one minute. And when these things don't even come up, well they just get there through psychological tricks, made up arguments and dramas. Usually also they act pretty passive-aggressive, and can't really open up and have some communication, they'd rather lock their minds up, even though probably (my assumption) there's not really anything to secure inside, because it's really all made up. Do these people realise? Are they aware of what they're doing? Do they suffer from mental issues or psychological traumas? What's the process that bring them to this? To add something more, it's always really your fault, always. If you do A, they complain because you did A, so the time after that you go with B (as they suggested, after begging for some answers and explanations), but hey guess what, B is wrong just as well. At the end of the day, it really feels like you've done everything you could to try to get on the right path, but no, you should definitely not put some hope into that, because it's pointless and self-harming on the long run. You just get exhausted, both psychologically and physically even, and your own life stops because you can't focus on anything else, you're constantly struggling on the same old hazy stuff. The expression emotional vampires gives a good image, I think. 

So, in the end, what's the source of all of this? Why? And what can one do? How to deal with this?",07Dec2019,1
754,"When I was about 5 years old I remember hearing noises at night. My family and I lived in a 2 room house. In one room we had our table, refrigerator, and a bucket to do the restroom. In the other room, we had our two beds and a tv. If we wanted to shower, we had to go to my grandma's house that was in front of ours. Since I was little I have always had trouble sleeping and would wake up in the middle of the night. When I was little I had no idea what it meant until I grew older and realized that the noises I would hear at night were my parents having sex. It went on for a lot of years. I never told them because I was scared. Every time at night I would wake up in the middle of the night and wished that I didn't. When I was in 7th grade we ended up moving to a better place. But those nights of hearing that, have haunted me until now. I know this may sound weird but I think that I discovered masturbating at 5 years old. I didn't know what I was doing, all I knew is that it felt good. I had been doing it for a while until I realized what it was and stopped. When I was in 8th grade I had my first bf. I was so excited and happy. Our relationship pretty much consisted of sexting. I feel so bad for having gone along with it, but it was all I knew growing up and I just wish I could have never done it. In 7th grade I let a guy touch my butt since it was my last day at that school which I regret having done as well. I am 22 years old and it is a little hard for me to get close to any guy. I have talked to some guys but some automatically start being perverted, so I ended up cutting them from the conversation. I Think of myself as someone who is not worth anyone's love and that is one of the biggest reasons why I don't open myself up to any guy or have dated one at all. I recently met a guy but I decided not to go out with him. I am about to finish college, but all my life I have been secluded from the world. I had a job in the summer but left it because of school.

I want to do so many things with my life but I do not know if I am capable. Sometimes I can't focus and when I try to learn new things they do not stick to my head. I know everyone has their own set of worries but I just feel like I am not worthy of anything in this life. I want to work again but I just lose all confidence and feel like I will mess up.

755,"Hi All,
Not sure where to post (still a relatively new user of Reddit). 
But here is the story that I need advice on. My dog (border collie/jack russell) got into a fight at doggy daycare. According to the workers, they put her in ""time out"" but then put her back in. I have on her paperwork that she sometimes has bad days and aggression does happen. I never received a phone call until I found out about the fight. My thought process is, if a dog is being a little aggressive that day, is to call the pet parent. Because if they called the first time, I would have told them to keep her out of daycamp. When I picked her up, I paid $118 for the other dog's vet bill. 
Follow up a day later, the daycamp called me saying that the dog had to be rushed to the ER and needed emergency surgery that now I owe over $2000. 
I do feel bad for the other dog, I have two dogs, and I hate when one of them is pain. So I completely get what that pet owner is going through.
But do I have any options in fighting this or any options at all. 
I really don't have the money. I live in CA and a disabled veteran. So I am already on a super tight budget. 
Thank you!",07Dec2019,1

My mom and Mrs. J used to be super tight. They were best friends and always did everything together. James and I are apart of the school's marching band. It's a really big band so if you're into marching you might know it, I'm not gonna say it though. Anyway, during on of our after school practices,  my mom and Mrs. J got into an argument. I don't know the details, but I do know Mrs. J accused my mom of being a bad mom, that all the bad things happening to my siblings and me are all her fault. My mother was depressed for days. It got so bad, my mom asked me if she needed to get a divorce with my father. Honestly, so much was happening when this happened and I have depression, so this pressure broke. After a while, my mom and Mrs. J started talking again but they're not as close as before and it's getting harder for me to see James. He's my best friend, we consider each other family. Our mom's still have some tension, and every time James and I make plans to hang out and just be teens, my mom comes up with some excuse to keep me home so she doesn't have to see Mrs. J.

James and I are so sick of not seeing each other. We just wanna be teens instead wondering when we can hang out without feeling wrong. It feels wrong hanging with him when I know our parents don't wanna see each other. No, our parents don't stay and babysit us when we're together. They just don't wanna drive to our homes and say hi, because we think it's rude to say hi to the host.

Basically, our mom fight is messing with my friendship with James by not letting us hang out. The last time we hung out was like 4 months ago and we don't know what to do.

766,"this is a throwaway account because i want to explain the situation, get feedback and then leave it alone.

I am 20, in my third year of college and i live at home. The reason i consider moving out now is because of my parents. I don‚Äôt really have a relationship with my dad because he has been in and out my entire life. He‚Äôs an alcoholic, drug addict and a liar. Truthfully I want nothing to do with him, i emotionally detached myself from him awhile ago. He pretty much just uses the people around him and plays victim 24/7. He does not contribute financially, any money he makes he keeps. If he needs to go somewhere it is someone else (me or my mom) taking him. 

My mom for the most part is great, she has been our mom and dad all of our lives. She works very hard to provide for my sister and I &amp; she has become a much better parent emotionally in the last year. The kind of marriage my parents have is very toxic and endless. My mom gets fed up, they argue, he leaves and then a few months later they reconcile. This last time i thought would be the last time because my dad arrived to my grandmas death bed high/drunk and embarrassed us. At the funeral he didn‚Äôt even talk to me or ask how i‚Äôm doing nothing, admittedly afterwards with the will etc he was there for my mom in some ways. But regardless he pissed my sister and i off with my grandmas death, he was drinking and driving and i asked my mom to make him leave and she did. This past summer my mom gave in and felt bad because his mother is ‚Äúsick‚Äù and she wants us to have a dad. After a really huge argument between us i decided to just suck it up and accept it. My dad got a job and he‚Äôs been alright BUT this is what always happens, he straightens up and then everything falls a part eventually, i am tired. Each week my mom becomes more angry towards my dad. My sister and i genuinely hate being home. As soon as he gets here i retreat to my room because it‚Äôs so uncomfortable living here. Most days they don‚Äôt speak with each other unless it‚Äôs something mean. 

To them they do this for my sister and I but we have repeatedly told them to get a divorce. So maybe it‚Äôs love or guilt. My sister and older brother (late 30s) and i all agree that my mom needs to let him go because he makes her a worse person. My sister reached out but my mom ignored her. I‚Äôm not sure if i want to address it or just let it go but i don‚Äôt want to live like this. I know I am in school and i would be struggling if i move out but i feel like it‚Äôs worth it. I am truly afraid that if i give my mom an ultimatum ‚Äúchoose your kids or him for the last time‚Äù she‚Äôll choose him. The relationship i have with my mom has improved over the years and i appreciate where we are not but i am angry. How could a strong woman like herself take care of a grown man? How do you show this to your two girls? I am angry with her but i guess i have to respect her decision and I would rather just move out. I understand the reason people stay in these relationships is deep rooted but we have begged my mom to just let us be without a dad because we do BETTER without him. My mom is so much better to be around when he is gone and we can relax while we‚Äôre home.

Suicide backstory:
When I was 8y/o (3rd grade), I met a boy about a year younger than me (He skipped a grade) . Let‚Äôs call him, D.. So D. encouraged me to think suicidal thoughts and hate my family.

772,"I've got a good friend whom I've known for most of my life, and we don't see each other normally so we have to rely on calls and texts and that sort of thing. Recently, he has picked up vaping, which I honestly don't see a problem with. I recognize it isn't technically as harmful as smoking and it doesn't come with any of the nasty side affects (smell, for example) of smoking so I have sort of been operating under a ""his loss"" mentality. What I mean by that is I don't care if he vapes, although I don't personally believe in it. I don't know if it is going to screw him up later in life because there are conflicting viewpoints on the harmfulness of vaping, but it doesn't affect me, so I have no reason to bully him about something he likes.

However...

He is now insisting on bringing the vape with him the next time we hang out. He says that it doesn't affect me, that he would be doing it subtly (in the bathroom or while we're walking), and that at the end of the day it's his choice. I put my foot down at this, as I don't care what he does on his own time, but I did ask that I not be associated with his behavior in any way, which he is now attempting to violate on the grounds that ""he's addicted"". That sounds like a flimsy excuse to me, but I wanted some advice. Am I being an unfair jerk by insisting that I don't want to be around him if he's vaping? I understand his argument, and I truly do not know what it is like to be addicted to this stuff, but that just sounds like I'm making excuses for myself. I don't have an objective reason for not wanting him to vape around me, it is more on the moral/personal side of things, so is he not respecting that or am I being ignorant? Who is in the wrong? Me by forcing him to withdraw from his vape temporarily, or him by forcing me to be associated with his new habit? I know this is reddit so I probably need not ask, but don't hold back. If you think I am in the wrong, then let me know. Thank you (:

TL;DR, my friend is vaping, I don't want him to do it around me when we hang out, he insists upon it, who is in the wrong?",07Dec2019,1

774,"So I‚Äôm here asking for advice because I want unbiased opinions. 

I have had this immense crush on a guy for almost seven months. It was immediate. The first time I saw him I literally said ‚Äúwow!‚Äù so loud other people turned and looked at me. At first I just thought he was cute, but as months went by, I got to know him by watching him teach. (He‚Äôs the lead instructor at my son‚Äôs dojo.) I grew to like his personality as much as his appearance.

Fast forward seven months and I can‚Äôt get this guy out of my head. I see him 2-3 times a week and it‚Äôs something I actually look forward to. One day, I start noticing I think he notices me too. He makes very direct eye contact with me when he sees me, and it‚Äôs different than other people he greets. He smiles and maintains the eye contact, and it‚Äôs  a little more than I perceive as just friendly. He looks interested. This carries on and he starts making comments about my geek shirts. Starts trying to make small talk. I‚Äôm like ‚Äúomg! Maybe he likes me!‚Äù 

I‚Äôm hesitant to move on it because I don‚Äôt want to make things awkward at the dojo if I‚Äôm wrong ( I‚Äôm real shy/awkward af and SUPER like him so maybe I‚Äôm misreading this?) This all continues for a while. I wonder why he‚Äôs not moving on it, but think maybe he‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm a customer and he can‚Äôt. 

I decide to move and finally friend him on FB. He immediately accepts. He likes and loves 75% of what I post. I bit the bullet and message him. I say ‚ÄúHey! I‚Äôve been meaning to message you! You seem like as big a dork as me, thought maybe we could chat. It seems like we have a lot in common‚Äù he immediately responds ‚ÄúYes! I‚Äôve been meaning to do the same!‚Äù 

Great right!? Omg! Progress!!

A few days of chatting reveal he‚Äôs literally the coolest person I‚Äôve ever met and we have so much in common, even weird one offs, that I am over the moon for him now. He‚Äôs very short in messages, but he always responds. Sometimes though, there are hints of ‚ÄúI just want to be friends.‚Äù in what he says that confuse me a little. During the messages back and forth, he invites me to hang out with him during a Christmas party at the dojo for the kids. Parents are not typically there. It‚Äôs a parents night out thing, but he invites me to hang out. The way he phrased it though was almost jocose, so I‚Äôm not sure if he‚Äôs being serious. I kind of joke about it and move on.

I still can‚Äôt figure out if he‚Äôs just being friendly, or if he‚Äôs interested. So, to clear it up, I ask him to lunch and offer to pay. He says he‚Äôd love to, but wants to pay. (YAY!!!) Then he invites me out with his friends. Great!!! I say yes. We exchange phone numbers. I text him. He responds in a similar way as he did on messenger, short. Then he kinda disappears. (?!??) We never go out. 

Thanksgiving comes and  he texts me Happy Thanksgiving. I respond but keep it short. I text him the day after and ask how his Thanksgiving went. He never responded. He‚Äôs still engaging on FB loving and liking all my stuff, but never texts me again. 

I assume he‚Äôs lost interest and or I misread him, so I sadly move on. 

Monday comes at the dojo and he acts super happy to see me, and comes and sits with me and talks to me and my daughter for the entire 45 minutes. He‚Äôs never done this with anyone else or me, never anything close to this. Does not happen. He chats the whole time. I‚Äôm SO HAPPY. Next day, same thing. Sits and chats with me an my daughters he entire time. Loves and likes all my FB stuff. 

Tuesday while we‚Äôre talking, he again invites me to hang with him during the Christmas party. I agree this time and we continue to chat. (Party is 12/13) But texting and messaging doesn‚Äôt happen anymore unless I initiate it, and the lunch thing never came back up.

Also, recently, his brother, wife, and two best friends (all work at the dojo) friend request me. The brothers wife is part owner, but she‚Äôs not friends with other customers. Not even other instructors. 

Is this guy being friendly or is he interested? I‚Äôve never had such a hard time reading someone and I‚Äôm losing my mind. I have damn near a year invested and reallllyyy want to get to know him...but he‚Äôs kinda geeky and awkward and sending mixed signals too. So it‚Äôs incredibly hard.

HALP. Do I ask him to lunch again? Is the lack of texting a lack of interest?? What‚Äôs happening here!? He engages in person and FB but not on the phone, and we still haven‚Äôt budged past seeing each other at the dojo...

Thanks for reading all this!!I know it‚Äôs a lot but I‚Äôm at a loss and need to know how to proceed without straight asking. Again, I don‚Äôt want awkward. I am at that dojo a lot.",07Dec2019,1

777,"Hi all, just a warning you this will probably be a long post. I‚Äôve been dating my girlfriend for a little over 5 years now, and I plan on asking her to marry me. Relationship wise, everything is amazing. We are absolutely perfect for each other. My girlfriend has been overweight her whole life, not obese (anymore. Far from it now), but she does have some meat on her bones. When she was a teenager she used to be HEAVY, but she lost about 70 pounds in high school. I think she looks amazing no matter what, but she‚Äôs fairly insecure about her body. She has some loose skin on her tummy and arms, and it makes her look like she has a few extra pounds than she does. So even though she‚Äôs lost so much weight she still looks in the mirror and sees a fat girl. I think shes absolutely stunning no matter what, and I‚Äôm not blind, I see she does have a bit of chub still, but that‚Äôs not a problem to me at all. I‚Äôd love her no matter what. But she‚Äôs NOT fat, just a little chubby. She wants to loose more weight, and of course I support her because I want her to be happy, even though I don‚Äôt have a preference either way. But she really is only loosing a pound or two every few weeks. I try telling her that it‚Äôs normal, but when she doesn‚Äôt loose it every week I can just tell how bad she feels... at dinner she eats maybe, half of a serving of dinner? And she only eats dinner and maybe a coffee during the day. On the other hand I‚Äôm a very skinny guy! I eat like a pig but I never ever gain weight, and I feel so bad that I can eat whatever I want but she can‚Äôt.. so of course I eat healthy with her, go to the gym with her and all that. We go on hikes and jogs and swimming at the pool. I push her because I know that‚Äôs what she wants. But when I have an ice cream, or have a little treat, or even a damn meal during the day (which I don‚Äôt skip meals like she does) I always feel so bad. And I try so hard to get her to eat during the day and she said she does, and will give me a fake list of food she‚Äôs eaten. I want her to loose weight because that‚Äôs what she wants, but I want her to loose it healthily. 
Anyways, then something happened the other night and I just feel so terrible about it. I was trying to explain to her that I love her no matter her size, BUT I made the mistake of telling her that I don‚Äôt want her to be skinny. What I was meaning by that, was that I personally didn‚Äôt WANT her to be skinny, I was happy with however she was, I wasn‚Äôt up every night praying that my girlfriend drops 20 pounds. I want my girlfriend to be healthy and 25 pounds overweight is much more healthy then starving herself every night. 
Anyways, you know when you say something and you instantly know that it hurt her. Like it triggered something inside of her that she had been thinking about for a long time. It was that. And I know my girlfriend well. Anyways she starts crying so of course I comfort her and try and calm her down. She‚Äôs good for the night but then later she confesses to me that she thinks I‚Äôm only with her because I have a fat fetish... what!? 
Okay, I do have a confession to make, I have a preference for chubby girls, NOT fat girls. I like chub because like I said, I‚Äôm very skinny. Like, sickly skinny. And I never was able to gain weight. And when I see some meat on a bone I see someone who‚Äôs healthy, which I could never achieve. And I‚Äôm a cuddler, and let‚Äôs be honest, cuddling with some who‚Äôs a bit chubby is just the best. But by NO means do I have a sexual fetish for fat girls. There is a point where being overweight just isn‚Äôt healthy, and like most people I just am not attracted to obesity. I mean, I wouldn‚Äôt not date someone because of their weight, but I‚Äôm not sitting here wanking to a morbidly obese body. 
She‚Äôs seen my exgirlfriends and almost every single one has had a little chub, but that‚Äôs not because I seek them out. I‚Äôm just not shallow, yknow? I fall in love with the person not their body. And it just so happens that the majority of the girls I‚Äôve been with have had a little chub. 
But she sees it as me being with her because she‚Äôs chubby, and that makes her feel FAT. In her words, ‚Äúit‚Äôs the only reason why you‚Äôd be with me‚Äù
She sees me as being out of her league (and let me just tell you I am NOT! My girlfriend is absolutely gorgeous. She may be a bit overweight, but she could turn heads, she‚Äôs stunning.) 

I love my girlfriend so damn much, I know she‚Äôs probably thought this for a while, and it shatters my heart knowing she feels like this. I just don‚Äôt know what to do about any of this. This is the love of my life, and I love her no matter what she looks like. I love her, I love cuddling her. Although I do have a bit of a preference for her chubbiness, in no way shape or form would I be upset if she lost weight because I want her to feel beautiful. I know she‚Äôll be just as cuddly after she looses what she‚Äôs comfortable with as before. 

How do I make my girlfriend feel better about herself?",07Dec2019,1
778,"So I'm a junior in high school and the topic of college has come up a lot in my conversations with my parents. To provide context, we're first generation immigrants and both my parents are factory workers. They make about 70k a year. I try my hardest at school and I have a 4.0 unweighted and I'm taking the most AP classes I can right now. I got a 5 on my AP test last year so I'm setting a high bar for myself this year. My PSAT score last year was a 1380 and I'm waiting for this year's results to come out but I'm hoping my range to be somewhere in the 1400. I will be taking the SAT twice to reach my goal of being in the 1500. I take part in a lot of extracurriculars and this and that. Basically, if I send in a really good essay, imho, I have a chance at going to Michigan despite it's low acceptance rate. I really want to go there but I know that if I do, there's a lot of uncertainties when it comes to finances.

Since we're still in the process of becoming citizens, I don't know if I can get FAFSA. Even though UofM has a Go Blue guarantee which offers free tuition to accepted students whose family income is under 65k and assets under a certain amount, I don't qualify for it because of the first clause. Finally, I don't know how much the SAT can give me. And despite all that, my parents still want to pay for my full tuition which I am so grateful for.

So here's the problem; my parents have been suggesting going to a community college first and then transferring to UofM. I know that it saves money, but the excuse I've been telling them is that since I want to go to med schools and they are super competitive, I don't know how they would look at an applicant from a community college. I'm sorry for being biased against community college, but I am just so opposed to the idea of going to one myself.

Tl;dr can you convince me that going to community college won't hurt my chances into getting into a good med school? With my given situation, which choice do you think would be best/practical?",07Dec2019,1

782,"When I say that it‚Äôs a friend I mean it for real, I don‚Äôt mean it as in me.

Obligatory mobile formatting.

I have an online friend, who I met back in 2016. She doesn‚Äôt get a lot of freedom- her parents are protective, but from what I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs not controlling or toxic or abusive or anything. Mostly internet/phone/etc related. 

Now despite this she‚Äôs always been pretty cheerful, and I know that she has anxiety. Now I met her on this website and I used to be online a lot, gradually my interest faded and 2018-2019 I mostly only pop in several times every couple of months. I know, I haven‚Äôt been the best friend recently.

Now, I logged on today and apparently she‚Äôs been having a hard time. Some things she‚Äôs said (slightly edited for privacy)

&gt; ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired of trying to make everything better. I‚Äôm so tired of fighting, and it‚Äôs so rare that anything actually works out and it‚Äôs a wonder I‚Äôm still alive. At this point nothing feels like it‚Äôs going to change and I‚Äôm so used to getting pushed out of the way, and that I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever feel otherwise. I‚Äôm just too tired to keep trying at this rate.‚Äù

I‚Äôm just so lonely and I don‚Äôt care at this point I just want **someone** to hold me and let me lean on them for just a minute, even just a second. I can only be supportive for so long without any support for myself

So yeah. I told her things like ‚Äúchase those bots of passion,‚Äù ‚Äúhave faith,‚Äù etc. I offered to play one of the online games she likes with her, or if she wants to talk that I‚Äôm here for her. I‚Äôve gone through similar emotions so I was able to tell her somethings that I felt were true. 

But it almost seems like there‚Äôs no light at the end of the tunnel in a way. She‚Äôs expressed how she feels lonely. It started at least 3 days ago, as far as expressing it online goes, but it certainly could‚Äôve been going on for longer.

i'm a 19, almost 20 y/o female, LGBT and closeted. my mother is EXTREMELY LGBTphobic (religious conservative). i've been doing everything i possibly can to cover my tracks and keep from being outed, but i don't know how much longer that's going to last.

i attend a private christian (conservative) college out of state on a scholarship. i don't have a job, have never had a ""real"" job (babysat in high school, have some volunteer work history), but i've been applying to multiple places at and near my school. i don't have any money of my own saved up; i'm reliant on my mother for all finances and spending money. i also have no car.

my mother is unpredictable and she might not completely lose her shit with me, but she very well might. in case she does eventually find out, i feel that it's in my best interest to be prepared for the worst case scenario. so my worst case scenario is: i am disowned and kicked out of my mom's finances without notice or time to prepare, with no job or savings, no car, and a semester's worth of student debt on my ass. i have friends back home who would be willing to let me stay with them and probably some extended family as well, so thankfully i'm not at risk of homelessness. but if this does happen, what do i do from there? i still want to finish school, but what are my options, what resources would be available for someone in my position, and how long might it take to get myself back on track? any advice would be incredibly appreciated.",07Dec2019,1

788," Can ANYONE justify this to me?? I'm having a small/medium personal crisis. I've been listening to and enjoying Eckhart Tolle lately. But after curiousity led me to Google how much he's worth, and finding out he has over 50 million dollars, I wondered what he does with all that money, and why he doesn't give more or why he has a $90+ per 6 month online ""TV"" product. Wouldn't someone truely Spiritual who preaches letting go of attachment, and greed, and having compassion, give free talks or affordable talks? Why would he be catering to the middle class. And besides YouTube or a book exclude the masses? The relatively poor need it just as much if not more than those with disposable income. (As in more than enough money for everything you need to be comfortable and more, which I as well as the majority do not have the luxury of enjoying). Then last night trying to get to the bottom of it I saw someone else expressing the same concerns and the trend of Western teachers in general becoming millionaires and continuing to build their wealth like every other business man. But they're Not Business men. They're supposed to be spiritual teachers. It's contradictory and hypocritical as hell and I cannot trust someone who would do that. For example one of his 5 day retreats charged $1297 per PERSON, 500 PEOPLE attending... That's $648,500... NOT INCLUDING housing or food which you can book THROUGH THEIR COMPANY FOR A FEE... HOW could it cost well over half a million dollars to pay the people setting this up, and for the location/travel? Obviously he's got 50 million dollars for this reason. Essentially charging as much as he can because the wealthy will pay handsomely for the ultimate ""worldly possession"" ""enlightenment"". I'm basically crushed and at a loss. I cannot justify it. There's no evidence online that he does anything to help anyone with this intense wealth. When questions are asked he basically side steps it saying ""I don't really think about it"". OF COURSE YOU DON'T RIGHT BECAUSE THOUGHT IS AN ILLUSION, YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE THOUGHTS, SO OF COURSE YOU WOULD SAY THAT AND NO ONE CAN SAY ANYTHING BACK. üòî Is there any truth. I feel like the world is completely full of misleading people and information.
His teachings can help temporarily, as long as you're ingesting more ""advice"" from a spiritual teacher. But none last, none seem to make lasting change. I'm fairly concerned that these are mainly mind tricks or beliefs that bring temporarily relief and altered States of consciousness but at the end of the day, is it really how they say it is? Is it really working? Are they really ""enlightenmented"" AND very interested in becoming rich as hell?...",07Dec2019,1

790,"First of all , this is my first post here and i hope i don't break any rules and thank you for reading this (btw English is not my first language, sorry if my writing is really bad)

Just for context i'm 20 yo (not a minor anymore in my country) and i'm going quite frequently to a local game store (a place for buying or playing table top games) where i'm amways having a good time

The thing is, one day i'm entering the store and i'm seeing some girl who is 18yo and i vaguely know her from my highschool from 2 years ago. We talked about games for about 30 minutes before she had to leave to do something important.

Then, the owner of the store (a friend who is 30) explained to me that the girl was much more closed (socially speaking) before i came and that she seemed to really be happy to be talking to me and that she is apparently 100% into me. Since then she came 3 times at the store while i was here to talk to me for multiple hours. Each time the owner explains to me that she probably really likes me.

The last thing is that when i knew her from highschool, she dated really weird and problematic persons and there was a lot of weird rumors about her having schyzophrenia and a second personnality (let's be honest it's probably bullshit) and also being someone egoistic and ""bad""  and well, that's scaring me(can't find a better word in english)

I'm completly inexperienced in girls and well, i'm super scared. I hope to have some advices on the situation. Should i get more involved with her ? Reject her ? Or maybe something else

For a quite some time i was dating 1 girl that is just amazing.We had a lot of good times together and simply we have opened to each other fully.I really do love her and i have had told her that but her answer was ""I love you too,but it\`s not the same way,i\`m very sorry"". That was over a year ago.Because she is that good,i thought to myself ""no way i\`m gonna give up on her like that"" I kept it cool and we kept on going out,i made sure that from time to time she acknowledges that i still had feelings for her,i started working on myself intensively in ever aspect hoping for the best.We did not talk about ""relationship"" between us to other people but many close to her could notice what i was doing and were simply amazed by me and the extend that i was willing to go just to make her happy,good,safe etc.I hope that you are getting picture of what was happening.I simply tried my best and i think i did everything that a boy could do to a girl to make her happy and special.

A week ago we had a talk about this whole situation and my feelings that i have for her.She told me ""look,i understand you and i appreciate your love and everything you do for me so much,i see the effort that you put into making me happy..Never,ever had i opened to someone outside my closest family like i did to you.I do love you but it\`s simply not the same as yours kind and i\`m very sorry about it,i can\`t change it,it\`s simply what is it.""

I explained to her that i was aware of that but that i\`m hoping i can change her mind somehow..She was firm that that was not going to ever happen...(that part just killed me inside and i broke down.Hugged her,said sorry and left with no other words) She understood that,that was a big hit for me,so we kinda stopped contacting till hopefully i get better.

I\`m destroyed and i feel let down,depressed...We are going to the same school and i see her everyday and its just pain.People around me are wondering what is happening with me and why am i so withdrawn,silent etc.And i have no desire not energy to explain this all to them...My heart wants to go close to her but i know its gonna be the exact same situation and she knows it as well.Still i have huge respect for that angel and still i got her back if anything ever happens.

So, side note: Both, me and my crush were kind of in a situationship, we didn‚Äôt have a label. That same week, me and my crush‚Äôs friend started talking, and eventually had sex. His friend told him about the situation, and boom! My crush knew about it, and decided to tell one of my friends about it, for I don‚Äôt know what reason.

803,"Long story short, I'm a mess. Currently in the process of diagnosing aspergers, dissociative identity disorder, and also bipolar disorder. I'm already diagnosed with severe depression and social anxiety. I'm in learning support in my school 24/7 due to being known as creepy as hell due to suddenly dropping out of school (I was forced back a year later and I'm not in classes, so...) and am also in the process of applying to a mental health school.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried a lot. I got rats - they hate me because I'm too scared of them (it was originally ferrets, then I saw rats in a pet store and due to my aspergers... yeah, I got them the next day). I considered a cat and decided recently it's gonna do literally nothing and the right breed are expensive as hell.

&amp;#x200B;

For around a six months I've had an idea of getting a dog. Now... My family don't have the \*best\* history with dogs. I'm 15, and we've had 6-7 of them (once for literally 2 days). I've kept quiet about it because I know it probably won't happen. However, I'm getting desperate. I asked my mom 2 months ago when things started to dip. Flat out no. In fact, exact words were, ""I don't want it pissing on my rug."" so that gives you a good idea of how she acts.

&amp;#x200B;

I get it. Kind of. I found a solution to where it could work but I'm not sure if I should propose it to her because I don't want to be yelled at and lectured.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I'm in a 1.5x2m bedroom (don't ask - it also doesn't help at all with my claustrophobia, especially since I spend all my time outside school inside of it). My little sister has our old shared room (estimating 5.5x4m but the size of my room - it's huge with a single bed). She never uses it. Never even sleeps in it because she sleeps in my mom's bed 5/7 days a week. Mom insists she needs a queen bed because she spreads out in her sleep (that's down to spoiling. if she can share a queen bed with my mom, she can sleep in a single fucking bed.)

&amp;#x200B;

I've asked to be moved there before. I'm sure if I begged and asked my social worker, she'd agree. If I were to get a dog, my mind would definitely stop being so fucking messed up. I'd have something to think about. It'd help my social anxiety because I'm very willing to walk it daily (for that extra sprinkle on top of not thinking about negative fuckery) and look after it entirely, as well as paying for it's food out of my food budget.

This isn't a physical issue and I had the exact same problem with my ex aswell; the foreplay is going great and we're both super into it but as soon as it comes to actually having sex and strapping up I just go limp and struggle to get my erection back. This issue has made me avoid having casual sex with people I don't properly know because I'm worried about losing my erection in front of them. 

I imagine this is likely linked to an anxiety issue (I do struggle with anxiety daily) and also putting on condoms kills the mood for me cause they're so not sexy like at all.

My girlfriend (fortunately) is super awesome and is totally willing to work through it with me and has asked about things she could do differently that would help with it and said that it's no rush for her, I just told her it's absolutely nothing to do with her doing anything wrong (because it's not) and that it's mainly a mental issue that I have to work on because I don't want her to feel like it's her fault.

812,"I graduated from uni a few months ago with a degree in accounting. I was actually really good at it - I got top marks all the time, which was nice. Then I got a graduate job at an accountancy firm and as it turns out in practice I'm quite bad at it - I'm slow, making stupid mistakes, and generally I don't enjoy it. The company is good to me and my manager and colleagues are first class but I'm horrendously stressed and miserable. I can't sleep well most nights, and I'm going to work exhausted, taking way more time than I should to do quite simple tasks. So it's a viscous cycle - the work isn't very rewarding either, and I couldn't imagine doing this for 40 more years. To make matters even worse, at our Christmas party last night I spewed on myself in the toilets and had to be escorted out by one of the managers. So basically I might be sacked anyway come Monday...  

  

If I'm not sacked, I feel like I might just quit anyway - I don't like the job, I'm bad at it, it's affecting my health, and after the spewing incident I feel like I can't even show my face there anymore. What I would do instead is probably something unskilled on the minimum wage like in a factory or a shop. I feel like this might be completely throwing my future away, but I think I would be happier. Longer term I have no idea what I might do. Also worth mentioning that on the minimum wage I couldn't live where I do now and I would probably move back to my parents' (at 26, so I'll be basically a ""loser"" with a minimum wage job and living with my parents still). They live somewhere quite cheap so I could probably get my own place there after a while.  

  

Basically, I might be sacked because of my own stupidity, and even if I'm not I feel like I have to decide my whole future in the next day.

I'm in a bit of a stump because I'm wrapping up (pun not intended) getting my Christmas gifts for the family but am really stuck on what to get my mom. I was thinking of getting her one of the new polaroid cameras and a letter in it saying can't wait to capture more moments with you this Spring. I've lived away from home for nearly 4 years now and am moving back this Spring. The other thing I wanted to get her is Alan Carr's guide to quit smoking or whatever it's exactly called.

I joined the subreddit r/stopsmoking and it was a really useful tool for me to quit smoking almost 6 months ago. I was able to quit cold turkey, didn't read the book or anything, just woke up and went from smoking a pack a day for 6 years to nothing.  My Mom on the other hand has struggled with quitting for forever. But she has been smoking for over 30 years now, and has been diagnosed with COPD. She continues to smoke, and when I went home and saw her and my uncle, both who have COPD continue to smoke it was very upsetting and solidified my mental state on never picking up a cigarette again.

I was born and raised in Tennessee. A small town, specifically. I was a ""Christian"" but not devout and never went to church. I just tried not being a dick, and it usually worked out. It wasn't until I was in my early twenties (I'm 25 now) that I started questioning religion and now nothing seems to make sense. However, there's still a problem. I live in a small town in TN.

Everyone and their mother is Christian, which is fine, but I fit in less and less every day. Every other day it seems I encounter someone asking me if I've found Jesus and stuff, and I don't like it. My friends are mostly Christian, my coworkers are Christian, and this girl I've been seeing is Christian. I don't want to just out and say ""Hey, I'm an atheist.""

How should I fake Christianity? Like, what verses should I read to learn enough to fake it? What are some everyday things that would paint me as a ""Christian""? How would be best to respond when someone asks, ""So are you a Christian?"" and tells me all about how they believe Jesus is their savior, etc.? I just genuinely never know how to respond and freeze up and it alienates people.

I've tried google, and I've tried bing, but everything I've found was just a page on creating a religion or writing about religions, or something about True Religion Jeans? (Whatever those are)

I would sincerely appreciate any input on this topic. I'm more than willing to work hard and study the bible, if it helps, I just don't know WHAT to study.

821,"I (M20) am stuck with a toxic and abusive father. My mom, brother (23) and I have been ""caged in"" essentially. We have no right to say anything when he is wrong, we can't go anywhere alone, and he threatens us, it's either his way or don't even engage. Yesterday my brother and I came home from college to hear my parents arguing. It's not new for him to get physical and into personal space when he's in that mindset. My brother and I tried to break it up and he and I came to the conclusion that my mom should leave (as in go back to her home town, just for a few months). This is not the first time that this has been brought up, my father himself says he'll take her back home and wants a divorce, arguments like these have happened numerous times throughout my life. This was the first time that my mom was ready to leave, my brother and I know our mom has been house ridden almost her whole life. Just like us, she can't go anywhere alone, has very minimal contact with friends and family, and is not an equal to my father. For the first time I realized that even though my father always threatens her with a divorce, he wouldn't let her actually go. The way he was pleading with her to stay and think things through...my father realized that she actually wanted to leave and he started backpedaling, saying things like ""you're ok"", we'll figure it out, etc. He can't fathom any of us leaving ever. He started going crazy, yelling and banging on tables, threatening us, at one point he grabbed a knife, luckily my brother held him back. Still the same night, my father tries to convince my mother to stay and it's gotten to a point where I can see that he's unhinged, he starts muttering to himself and starts yelling ""I'll kill myself"" and all these horrible things, trying to manipulate us into feeling like he is the victim and not us. I don't know what to do, I don't want him to do anything crazy or hurt himself, but I don't think I can live like this anymore. My mom has endured this kind of behavior for over 25 years. My brother and I have grown up in this toxic household. I am too scared to call the police because I'm scared how my father will react, and I don't want him to lose his job. I need to leave and I have to save my mom and brother, we both have money saved up we can rent an apartment and move out. My brother works and will be able to provide for us until I graduate next semester and start working a full-time job. My dad travels every Monday thru Thursday...I want to leave when he is not home because I genuinely believe that is the only way we escape from him. My mom doesn't want to leave like that, even through all the abuse, she's afraid he'll do something crazy to himself, especially if he's out of state where we can't physically control him from doing something crazy. I don't want to get the police involved but my father needs help, mentally. If we leave he's going to go batshit crazy...but we've suffered so much and I have no one to talk to or get guidance from. The last thing any of us wanted to was see this family torn apart like this, but I am prepared to shoulder the burden if my mom,brother, and I can finally be free. I just finished the semester yesterday and no classes to bother me, so if there was ever a perfect time to leave it would have to be now. What do I do?",07Dec2019,1
823,"Hello! Throwaway because I'm afraid they might find this post.

I'm in the state of California and need advice. I'm currently house-sitting for someone I've known for a long time but we aren't too close with each other. I had done house sitting and taken care of their dogs plenty of times before so when they asked if I could house sit for three days I didn't think too much about it and agreed. Everything was fine until I noticed their Mac desktop had a green light by the camera meaning that the camera app was either on or recording. I thought that this was weird because the location of the camera doesn't even display the whole living room just the room I'll be staying at. I ignored it until the more I think about it the more unconformable I got. The person I'm house-sitting has two children and the desktop that has the green light belongs to the daughter. She's very sweet and kind so I thought maybe she left the PhotoBooth camera on by accident. Then I realized that in order to have the camera on while the desktop screen is pitch black is to turn the brightness of the desktop all the way down. Why would she need to do that if she could just turn the desktop to sleep (which would turn off the camera and the green light would disappear)?

what should I do? How should I handle this? What should I say?",07Dec2019,1
824,"I dont think adults really listen to people younger than them when dealing with serious issues. In my personal experience 90% of the time they just laugh at me or assume me or other people my age just want attention. I dont parade my issues around and want people to feel sorry for me. If anything nobody at my school knows, and it's really hard for anyone to tell because I don't want other people I dont know to be in a sad atmosphere. From time to time someone can tell I'm sad but I just say I'm tired which is partly true. I have had a therapist before that actually listened to me but he's not able to speak to me anymore because he moved. It's nearly impossible for me to get help now because I've tried before, got denied, and my family found out and they put me through hell for telling. I've made a post on here before but haven't gotten many replies and I wonder if it's because my post came across as attention seeking, I dont need a bunch if upvotes I just want some advice. Maybe the internet isn't the best place to ask for advice but trying to get advice in person can be even more rigorous but I need to talk to someone face to face.",07Dec2019,1

828,"Hey there, hope everyone's having a good day.
There's something that's been bothering me these past few months and I dont know what to do. This is my first story-like post, so sorry if it's weird. Lemme start at the beginning. Warning: this is long.
Cole=The guy
Maisy=My BFF
Gretchen=A girl very interested in Nick(not me)

So, there's this guy(shocker) that I knew pretty well back in high school. He was goofy, cute, caring, humble, and had the same interests as me(same music taste, interested in the same major, etc). Let's call him Cole. I started to crush on him back in may, but I pushed it to the back of my mind because I knew all of my crushes ended badly.
So then not long after that, I graduated and eventually told my bff about these feelings I had for Cole. Maisy and I usually told each other everything and she was always so positive and sweet about everything. She encouraged me to go with it, and that's when it began.
It started out innocently enough, I started to text and hang out with him more, getting to know him better. It was a really sweet friendship that I was hoping would develop into something more.
Cole's a high school senior and I'm in college, so we texted a lot. I eventually had some friends over for swing dancing and he came with, being my dance partner.
That's when I told him I liked him.
At the time, he told me he liked me too. I became more attracted to Nick, and I even visited multiple marching band(I used to be in the band) events to see him(I know, embarrassing to think about now). 
At the events, I saw him with this other girl, Gretchen. Gretchen was veeeeery clingy. She followed Cole everywhere and touched him regularly. I felt awful but soon found out that Cole felt uncomfortable around her. He was also having issues with getting over his ex(broke up in may, this was october), and tried to get her to be his date for the dance. With all this drama surrounding him, I tried desperately to help him out and give advice. 
Cole told me he hated being under all this pressure of being a senior and his strict parents. I gave him a good pep talk and a hug. 
One night, me and my friends wanted to go to a swing dancing lesson and I invited him. Cole wasn't feeling well after breaking it off with Gretchen and of course as the idiot I was, I tried really hard to get him to come with because I really wanted to dance with him. Bad idea. He felt pressured and cancelled at the last second, I felt terrible. After that night, our relationship wasn't the same. He texted a lot less and didn't seem to be himself. We stopped talking for a while.
I found out from Maisy later when she and Cole had spoken about me, that Cole had only been trying to make me happy, so he didn't have genuine feelings for me nor did he want to date anyone anymore. This completely broke me. My ex boyfriend did the exact same thing. 
Another night, he finally comes with us to dance and as expected he dances with one of my friends(new girl) the entire time. They barely knew each other before, but they immediately clicked. My jealousy lead me to tears.
I broke things off. I didn't want to be involved with the drama anymore(because I'm in college for God's sake)I was annoyed that Maisy was telling me how he really felt and not Cole himself. It still hurts so much to see him being best friends with that new girl when we were like that merely months ago. I wish I had my friendship back, I wish I could start over with Cole. Hell, I wish I was the new girl.
I can't bring myself to talk to him because I'm filled with so much regret and embarrassment. I'm scared that he will just pretend to be happy to me and never open up, because I scared him off. Please help.",07Dec2019,1
829,"Hi guys, so I‚Äôve been a hopeless romantic for pretty much my whole life. I‚Äôm a freshman in Highschool, and I‚Äôve been seeing all these couples in my school that look really happy, and I‚Äôve also been watching the office and watching Jim and Pam‚Äôs relationship grow. Their relationship makes me want to have a relationship like them. I‚Äôm tired of boys, and sometimes girls being jerks and players. I just want someone who will be loyal, kind, loving, and respectful of me. I‚Äôm a very giving person and rarely get anything back from the people I give to. I just want someone to love me as much as I love them, but it‚Äôs been hard for me to fall in love with anyone that‚Äôs around my age(15-16). So then I end up hoping that the right person will come around but I feel like I‚Äôve lost all hope. But even then I keep hoping that I‚Äôll find that person. I‚Äôm a person that‚Äôs full of love and kindness, and I feel like I have no one to share it with. Is it weird for me to think this way at 15? Or is it completely normal?",07Dec2019,1
