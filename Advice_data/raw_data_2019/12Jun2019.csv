0,"okay well there’s a person I’ve been talking to recently, and I really enjoy his company! we only text as of late. 

but he said earlier today that he wanted to stop talking to me everyday (idk why he didn’t just leave me on read and respond another time instead of just announcing it lol). I asked if it was something I said because he’s ghosted me before over miscommunication and stuff on my end. he said nah, then left me on read again. I haven’t said anything back, and don’t plan on it until he says something to me-to adhere to his wish p much.

the thing I need advice on is like, how do I stop caring-or at the very least, stop caring as much-about him? I’ve been ghosted before, not talked to my closest friends for months and then they pop up again and yeah I MISS them, but I can go about my life just fine. I’m not sure why he’s the odd one out! 

do y’all have any tips or advice on how to make this easier? any reasoning on why I can care less for others but not for him would also be super helpful; idk if it’s a common thing or not.
much love many thanksssss",12Jun2019,3
1,"So I was working drive through the other day at my work and this seemingly pleasant elderly gentleman came through ordered his food and started on about how he was looking for someone with computer knowledge. I've been ""tinkering"" since about 10 and I was really hesitant to acknowledge I even know what an twootterbook was. (I seriously hate social media)

He said he was looking for someone to do some social media marketing. Well I have zero experience in this field and informed him of such and told him I don't even do facegram. He pulled out this piece of paper with some qr codes and some rather innocent looking labels music related. He said he makes music and that he doesn't even know if he's any good at it and said people have called him tone deaf but he wants someone to put his music up on social media and if it takes off he promises me all the riches in the world yadadada. 

He pulls out $10 and shoves it in my hand and says to just do what I can while telling me he's 69 and on social security. I tried to refuse the money and figured I'd make up a cool pseudonym or something and throw it up around YouTube or something for free but he wouldn't back down. I eventually accepted the money and the strange paper. 

As I went to go put it in my car he flagged me down in the parking lot told me it cost money to download some of the songs and gave me like 2 or 3 more dollars.

Here's where I need advice. On the surface he seems like harmless old man trying to ""get his music out there"" and if that's the case I'd like to help him but wouldn't know where to begin getting something more noticed on the internet beyond paying to have it go viral. 

However as a big fan of the show Mr. Robot. I'm extremely hesitant on scanning strange qr codes and the whole thing was just so surreal.

Anyone want a picture of the QR codes to test them out for me if you have a burner phone and verify them? What would you do if some older dude approached you at your fast food job with this?",12Jun2019,1
2,"Hi, I don’t know how to get this off my chest because I simply don’t have a support system in real life so here I am on a throw away account asking for help. I’ve always struggled socially and it’s gotten a lot worse in my adult years. I’m only 23 and I’ve already lost most of my family (due to not only death but simply cutting them off for various reasons) and I have close to no friends now. All of the friends I have, are online buddies I’ve met through video games. I do love and appreciate them, but I have no one in “real” life, that I can physically see and spend time with. It’s hard to “hang out” with online friends, even if you get along really well it’s not exactly the same as having someone you can go and see in person. 

Everyone else in my life has shown me that for better or for worse we shouldn’t stay in each other’s lives. I can’t remember having a genuine relationship with someone for longer than a month or two. Eventually, we either drift apart mutually or I realize that there’s something off about them or that we simply don’t click. I’m not a picky person and I’m not judgmental, but I have a strong set of morals and I don’t get along well with people that do harmful things to themselves or others (drugs, cheating on their partners, etc) and unfortunately those are very common occurrences in my experience. No matter what I do, I can’t find anyone that I feel completely connected with. I truly just want to find a good friend that I can trust. I’ve been hurt so many times and I think that my past might be hindering my ability to put faith in people even more. 

I feel like there’s no point in living. I’ve tried so much to make new friends, anywhere I can, but I can’t seem to keep them. It might sound like I’m possibly overbearing or maybe like I’m the type to ask for a lot out of a person but I’m not. I don’t expect anything out of anyone, I just don’t want to be around people that aren’t exactly safe to trust if that makes any sense. I don’t know why I can’t find the kind of people I’m looking for.. I don’t know why I drop friend ships and people drop me so fast. I don’t know what to do. I’m so disconnected...",12Jun2019,1
3,"I feel like I’m easily influenced by the people I interact with, things I see on TV, music I listen to, and video games I play. 

I’m not really sure how to put this into words, but I’m hoping someone out there went through or is going through the same thing...

Here’s an example... over the weekend, I went from having apps for everything on my phone and being all about smart devices, social media, and being “connected”. On Sunday, I was browsing Reddit and looking through subreddits r/anticonsumption and r/privacy that made me hate that lifestyle. I deleted all of the apps and decided to completely disconnect. By the end of the day yesterday, I completely changed my mind about disconnecting a reset my phone and downloaded all of the apps again. I’m already starting to feel the urge to delete them all again and change my privacy settings. 

Moderation is not my friend. I go to extremes with everything, but I don’t stick with anything. 

I’m 27, single, and I make a decent living and work 45+ hours per week. 

Does this speak to anyone on here? How can I stop this cycle? It happens on a daily/weekly basis.",12Jun2019,1
4,"Over the course of several years, I’ve had general unease and occasional panic attacks from the thought that the entire Universe could be spinning really fast, like infinitely fast. Like a cosmic fairground ride you can’t get off. The thought can arise at any time and ruin any focus or concentration. 

Every person I’ve spoken to so far seems to not be bothered by the prospect of a crazy fast spinning universe, saying that it doesn’t affect them. This is true, because even if it were spinning, we can’t feel or detect it.

I wouldn’t have a problem with it, but it’s the idea of not being able escape which truly causes the panic. Recently I’ve come to the conclusion that my only escape is death, because at least then I cease to exist and my perception of the Universe comes to a permanent end. However, the feeling still remains because even my atoms will stay in the Universe with no chance of escape. 

Apologies if this is the wrong sub for this, but I’m clutching at any kind of help anyone can give. This thing has damaged my life in more ways than I can count so any comfort or advice is welcome. Thanks",12Jun2019,0
5,"Throwaway account, blah blah. My ex was a toxic cheater who constantly argued with me even after we broke up, we were still friends for months after, but for no reason they became completely ignorant and petty against me. Even blocking me for a few days because I ""wasn't talking to them""..I was asleep when this happened. I want to help them get better, and I can't seem to be decently happy without him.

6,"Just a couple of key things to point out: 
- we’ve been on a few dates 
- he talks about his friends and includes their names 
- talks about the drama that occurs in his circle of friends and the girlfriends of his friends  
- he was trying to show me something, and whilst he was scrolling I saw that he had 3 screenshots of my Instagram posts (I have no idea why) 
- he pays for everything without fail (not that this matters but it’s just what happens) 
- he took me suit shopping with him",12Jun2019,3

So I did tell him that I knew and stopped him from doing it and friendzoned him. But I feel he’s started to like me more after that. 

He’s more open with his feelings and liking me and stuff sometimes it’s really weird and makes me uncomfortable and I feel really bad.

He’s pretty clingy on text and texts me everyday and stuff and if I don’t respond will ask me stuff and when I try to leave the conversation he keeps being like don’t leave or I’m sad, u don’t care.

I don’t want him to think I don’t care but (not trying to sound cocky) he needs to get over it and I feel like keep talking to him is not gonna help with anything and at this point how can we be friends.

I don’t know what to do and I feel really bad but at the same time this is not good for either of us

10,"hi. i didn't feel like correcting everything or using proper grammar, so, sorry.  


i have a problem with being honest and open and vulnerable. I am a typical guy in a lot of ways, i look at porn (on reddit and then on sites, i have stopped doing this because i got caught by my gf and felt really badly), i basically realized how toxic porn was and how it was taking away from my life and my relationship so i stopped and started a nofap streak to clear my mind, change my mind and habits and be a better person and partner. That was a few months ago, a few weeks ago i started going on my instagram to see sexual content and girls but technically not 'porn' i guess even though i knew what i was doing. My partner knows i have trouble with being completely open and honest, she doesnt have a problem with it even if its something blunt and will actually hurt my feelings. She values honesty over that. I've decided to be honest and open but its really hard for me still. Questions such as who's the best sex you've had? have now come up with me being completely honest, or which ex is more attractive than me? who's vagina was the nicest and would you rather have it over mine? Have you masturbated to this person, or this person? questions like these, which are warranted because all of my hiding and lying basically deals with sexual stuff and girls and porn. I honestly don't want to be this way, i don't want to lie and have trouble just being honest because some of the truth is hurtful obviously, like admitting an ex had a nicer vagina or is prettier, but idk what to do. Me being honest about everything has gotten us on a break, she told me she wanted one yesterday so that's that. I feel like my honesty has gotten her to hate me more, to make things way worse and to basically make me lose her. Im 28, so ive been through relationships and really honestly value this one but ive never shown it correctly. I've just been selfish and self centered and just received, barely ever gived. Idk why I came here, i thought maybe something would help. thanks.",12Jun2019,1

The thing is i'm really looking forward to this party because me and some friends are gonna get together and drink before it, the only problem is that my parent REALLY don't want me to drink and they think i won't, they  talked to me and told me they trusted me and that i should be responsible, the thing is i can't lie to them we have such a great relationship and i would feel terrible, even if they didn't find out.

12,I'll keep it short but I recently started a new job and I've only been there for about 4 months and alot of the job duties turned out to be only half true really. SO there's been a few times already that I have been asked to come in and provide 24 hours support instead of staying a home where I'm a 20 minutes drive to work so that if something was to go wrong I would be there how would you handle this situation? Im also salary and this is not going to get me OT.  For example today I've already worked 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. where we had a power outage and lost our servers they want me to come in from 6p to about 6a so that if these power goes out again I can help restart the servers. They called me right as i got home.,12Jun2019,1
13,"I (19M) got back home from college a few weeks from college. I live in the middle of nowhere and don't have a license, if I want to go into town, I either have to get a ride or ride my bike for half an hour. I'm also pretty introverted and don't really text people that much. All this means is that for most of the week I'm alone. I play videogames and watch anime, occasionally clean, do basic chores, etc. in order to pass the time, but I still have a lot of time to think about stuff, particularly Her.(18F)

I've posted about this before, which just makes me feel worse, tl;dr: I had a crush on her years ago, asked her out, she said no because she liked someone else, and I mostly got over it, I only talk to her on occasion because we're in the school shows, but I still had a little part of me that would bring the feelings back once or twice. I wouldn't act on them because I didn't feel too strongly about it. 

That all changed April of last year (again, part of why I feel like a psychopath), I'm a senior and my sister tells me I should ask Her to prom. At that point, I knew I'd be going with a friend, I'd be off to college come August and there wasn't anyone I felt strongly about, and I hadn't really talked to Her (who we'll call K) that much so I didn't really consider that until my sister said something. Something in my head just clicked and it sounded right. I couldn't stop thinking about it. About K. There was something poetic about it, I had a crush on her my freshman year, and the fact my sister even suggested it threw me for a loop. Why her? Why K?

I decided to ask someone else, a friend who I hadn't talked to in a while, but I knew I would have a good time with. I write this whole poem filled with memes and videogame references. The friend said no but we ended up reconnecting, which was nice. By then, time was running out, I was getting desperate, and my sister tells me that K would say yes. So I ask K, I didn't do anything creative, and she says yes. We get in contact with each other and start planning. I decided to get know her better and we started talking more. The only thing I was afraid of was feelings coming back, which eventually, of course, they did. I decided to not address them, get through prom and let them just go away. I figured it would be best to not bring it up, lest things got awkward, and that I'll meet someone in college and move on. I end up falling out of contact with her, the usual I want to talk to you but I don't know what to talk about, and everything goes well. I still think about her every now and then, but otherwise I'm good.

That is until this past April, funnily enough. I went home to watch the high school show because my sister and a few friends are in it. I see K after the show and congratulate her, this was also closing night and her last show. For some reason she was acting awkward, which I thought was unusual for her. Now a few weeks earlier my sister texted me if I was still talking to this girl I had met. I said no because she wanted to focus on school. The random timing of the question threw me and I kept asking myself why would she ask that. This plus K's behavior made me add two and two to make fish, and I couldn't stop thinking about it.

At this point I was attempting to talk to another girl at college and all of this made me confused and I asked a couple friends as to who should I pursue. They gave opposite responses so I did nothing but think about my options (thank you social anxiety). During finals week I decided that I would just give the girl from college my number. She ended up texting me and we hung out a couple of times before we left. We've texted a few times since then, but not in the past week. All the while I can't get K out of my head. 

I want to be clear, I don't really want to be in a relationship with K. I don't even want to have these feelings and I understand that I shouldn't have them given our history, or rather lack thereof. I know that it's way too late to try to have any sort of relationship with her. I just want to tell her so she can turn me down, since I think she's in a relationship, and I can get over it. What bothers me more is that this has bothered me for so long and I can't talk to anyone about it because I sound like a psychopath, which is probably true. I have no one to talk to about this because no one knows, except my two friends, and all I can do is obsess over it until something happens, which makes me feel even worse.",12Jun2019,1
14,"My father is a foot surgeon, mother is a research nurse, sister is training to be an occupational therapist, and I have a crazy medical history.

15," I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls who were there a few hours (only 2 of them are involved here) later in the night near closing it was quiet and the blonde girl skipped up stairs to the toilet kept looking back at me giggling looking back down the stairs at me , a while later I walked around the corner to where they were sitting and that blonde girl was looking at me and I didn’t look away for a few seconds and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say to her brunette friend 'that lad just been staring at me' in an excited whisper way. (They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

 another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away. (She was saying the weird girl liked me having a joke because these girls never knew I existed before this night and the weird girl wasn’t in third night) 


I then went back to finish cleaning the same table nearby and then the brunette girl said excuse me again twice and I looked then she asked politely but nervously pointing at me when asking  'can I ask you a serious question?' I looked then she went relaxed and said ‘have you got a girlfriend?' I ignored her, she then asked it again, then the blonde watching the whole thing said 'aww leave him alone....he’s dead cute’ and then ‘he probably has’ (probably has a gf) then smiled at me looking over (cute like puppy dog cute is that bad?) then the brunette asked it again ‘have you, have yet got a gf?’ ’ I still continued to ignore them but looked annoyed because they kept putting me off what I was doing (idk why maybe I was nervous) and the blonde girl said aww leave him alone now hes fuming while laughing a bit. The blonde said bye on their way out to me smiling. I wasn't I just felt uneasy, did they like me or mocking me?",12Jun2019,0
16,"i have a friend who ive known since i was about 5. we grew up really close but drifted apart when i went into middle school bc the grade difference. (he’s 3 grades below even though he’s only a year and a half younger- im really young for my grade and he repeated a grade). the thing is we’re reconnecting again and im kind of into him. i think he’s into me as well. 

here’s the thing. he’s going into 9th grade and i just graduated high school. im not 18 though and won’t be till next year. he’ll be 16 (age of consent where i live) before i turn 18. so my first question is would it be weird and/or illegal because of the age difference just to date- not to have any sort of sexual relationship because obviously that would be bad on my part since im the older one. the only thing im thinking that could be bad is the maturity/life stage difference but is it significant enough to make or break im wondering 

my second question is, we found out that we’re either 3rd or 4th cousins a few years ago. that means we share at most 1% the same dna. is that weird too, if i pursued a relationship with him even though we’re cousins (albeit distant ones)?

19,"I've loved this girl like nobody else in my entire life for the longest time. Started talking to her when she still had a boyfriend at the time. We then became best friend and time passed... she broke up, I was still loving her, never had the courage to confess, everything was good and i was happy and she was and then everything went downhill (or not?).  


 It's Chrismast holyday and we are in the middle of a really long messenger call like we usually do everynight when at some point she brings up how much she misses sex since her boyfriend left her and she explains to me how she can't think of anything esle and would really like to find a sexual partner... and then you guessed it... some days after I went to her place and I had sex with her. It was... amazing... to share that extremely moment of tenderness and trust with the person i loved was the best thing i've ever felt... She also clearly stated how **we were still only friend** and all this was like a ""fuck friend situation"". After this we continued to occasionally have sex while **still being extremely good friend** and everything was alright... (at least i was convicing myself it was.. as i was **starting to feel possessive as if i was in an actual relationship, even tho i wasn't**). And then, our friendship became strong like crazy, wich was suprising since most story like that ends with a broken friendship and regrets but we had none of that.. **our friendship, instead of becoming unstable and weak got stronger.**  


But of course every good thing has an end right?   


Not long ago She started to see an other guy and even tho i know I was never in a relationship with her **it still breaks my heart every time** she gets closer to an other guy romantically. And to be honest I think i knew that I was making a mistake when deciding to have sex with her but **the feeling of being able to hold her in my arms for a couple of minutes and being able to be honest with myself**... i couldn't. And now here I am... not being able to work or do anything properly productive because I spend my time thinking about her... and the worst in all of that is that not a long time ago my other friend said to me that this girl I loved told him she had confused feelings for me (she didnt know how she was feeling towards me so for a moment I had hope for a future i would have dreamed of). I don't know what to do now... On one side i really love her.. truely... but **she's been my best friend for so long and I don't know if I even want to break this or not...** I tried to stop thinking about her but I just can't either... and I also couldn't bring myself to confess when she is seeing an other guy since i don't want to make her have to choose between 2 persons... Im feeling stuck.

21,"So I, a female, have the greatest best friend.  We've known each other for about 7 years almost and are really close.  We both have dark pasts/lives/thoughts.  Usually whenever he's feeling particularly suicidal or depressed I'm there for him, always. I'm like a mother duck literally just there when he needs it.  He usually tells me everything, from dark thoughts to feelings or anything else.  But recently we had a talk and he was feeling really put of place and my usual talk didn't work, he ignored me and said everything was fine (over text).  

In the past he didn't really trust in telling me completely everything because I was a girl but he's not like that anymore.  Howver my bf, a friend of his, said after I told him the situation that our friend confided smth in him, saying not to tell me.  He assures me that our friend is fine and it isn't anything too bad, sent me a few SS

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding might have been nothing) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then look away to carry on putting her scarf on.

Long story short - I met a girl on tinder, thought she just wanted to hook up.

Then I found out it was paying for nudes and “meet ups.”

I’ll be honest - I asked if she was a cop and I said that I wanted to have sex, but before I paid her on cashapp I got scared and said I only wanted legal things. I said it three times. Immediately after I paid her, she blocked me.

Is this a sting??? I said “only legal things” because I really only wanted nudes, but now I’m afraid what I said earlier is going to get me sent to jail. I went to the police station to ask about this and they were like paying for nudes isn’t illegal. I did not admit denial.

31,So hubby and I went out to dinner tonight at BJ's. I had a reward that was expiring ($10.00 off) and there was also a coupon for $10.00 off $40.00.  I sent a DM to BJ's via Twitter telling them I had a reward and a coupon. They assured me I could use both. When the waitress brought the bill I let her know I had both. She said I could only use one until I showed her the DM from BJ's telling me I could use both. She. Was. Not. Happy. She started slamming things around and her personality changed from warm and friendly to ice cold. Of course we tipped 20% on the undiscounted bill but WTF? Should we be treated poorly because we had a coupon and used a reward? I'm so angry she behaved so poorly at the end of our meal. What do you think?,12Jun2019,1
32,"I'll try to keep it short and sweet. My sister (14) and myself (21) don't really see eye-to-eye on much anything. This is most likely an artifact of just growing up at different times, if that makes sense. Anyway, this is my last ""summer"" around, as I'm going to medical school in August and from there, I'll go wherever life takes me. We genuinely have no common interests and I often find it hard to have fun with her, mainly because she kind of sees me a third parent. Is there anyone who has/had found themselves in this type of situation and can offer any advice on how to ""transform"" this relationship into a healthy brother-sister?

33,"So hi this is my first time making a post and I really wish it was on any other sub. I'm using a throwaway because I don't want these personal issues in my account history.

I [19 F] am currently enrolled in college but I am dropping out before the end of the year. This is my second time trying and failing to finish the first year of a study and I am feeling a bit hopeless.
I am planning on getting certificates that will enable me to go to a university instead as the courses there interest me way more than what my current level of education can offer me.
This however would mean that I would have to move out of my room that I'm renting as it's a college dorm. That would also mean I would have to move back in with my (twice divorced) mom.

I don't think I can do it. My mom has a clear addiction to wine and cigarettes and everytime I try to talk to her about it she blows me off and says it's normal for people her age to drink every night.
What's not normal however is that all her frustration comes out and is directed at the closest person in the general vicinity which is me. I have an older brother who has clearly given up on having a good relationship with her and moved out the moment he could. 

Problem is, I realised I cannot live on my own. My dad left when I was around twelve and my mom had to raise me. The way she did that is she basically left me to figure everything out on my own. I think I could've ended up much worse had I not made some good decisions, but this also meant I made some horrible ones that scarred me for life. She had no interest in teaching me anything besides letting me do the dishes for her when she felt I wasn't doing enough. When I actually ask her how to do something she has no patience and tells me to figure it out myself. She had a friend help around the house which basically meant I didn't have to do things, she didn't have to teach me. The result of that is I have no fucking clue how a washing machine works or how to cook, never had a job (only did volunteer work) and have no idea how to save my money for bills. 

Now that I am moving back in her personality has changed for the worse. Couple a weeks ago she was pissed at me for something and called me downstairs. I had to do the dishes. Its around 12 AM but ok sure no problem. She blocked my way into the living room however and started screaming at me how I never do anything right and what a useless human being I am. Can't say she isn't right but it still pissed me off that she was blocking the way to the thing she asked me to do. I tried to go into the living room again but she pushed me back and I hit a door handle. I turned around and yelled that she could handle her own bullshit and left.

Tonight she had been drinking again til about 2 am as I could hear her very clearly stumble around. We have maintenance coming over tomorrow early morning so I wanted to get some sleep but instead had to hear her bump into shit and just wasting away as a human being. I went downstairs to check but her face irritated me instantly, she doesn't listen to anything I say or suggest. I told her that ""next time you're chugging wine, keep it down because some people try to sleep past 1 am (I was also referring to neighbours). She yelled at me that I don't belong in her house (even though she made it very clear that I would always have my own room even though she recently moved). During the day she preaches about love and communication but at night it's like she's a completely different person.

I am severely depressed, often thinking about how I should kill myself (don't worry I'm not planning to go through with it but it's like a plan B for if things really go south). I don't have money for psychological help. Have no energy to get through a day. Feel like a freeloader. Can't get a decent job without experience. Wasted 2 years of my life and I still can't even wash my damn clothes. 
If I do anything out of the ordinary thats useful like washing dishes without being asked she usually mocks me by saying things like ""wow what a surprise you're doing something"" which instantly makes me never want do to anything for her again.

I understand I could be nicer to her and that the things I spit back were way too harsh and not helping at all but I am just so frustrated with myself and this situation, I have no clue what to do or where to start. She will not admit she has a problem and denies everything I suggest.

I need advice on where to start bettering myself, how to survive this nightmare til next year and how to become an actual functioning human being without going insane in the process. I have nowhere to go but here, but I'm afraid I won't be able to get through another year.

Sorry for the format I am on mobile and typing this out in a rush. Also thanks for reading through this mess if you got this far.",12Jun2019,1

He would beat me with cords and belts in the bathtub so obviously, I have underlying issues now. I’m now 20 years old and my brother is 15. My father attempted to get back into my life and I refused but my mother wanted me to saying that I should forgive him so I agreed but I had one condition. I wanted him to talk about the abuse so I could try and find some sort of closure. He refused, yelled at me and told me to get over it. He says I’m dead to him, I’m a failure for a daughter and blah blah blah. He literally goes around saying he only has a son. Comical. But he wants to be in my brothers life and my brother want my advice. What should I tell him? I want to protect my brother from who my father really is and what he’s done but my brother yearns for a father, you can tell. How do you tell a sweet 15 year old kid, his fathers a piece of shit?

39,So about a week ago I was visiting a friend whom I haven’t seen in a very very long time. I enjoy this persona company a lot and always enjoy talking to them but sometimes me wanting to start a conversation just doesn’t happen because said person can seem at times very stand off ish so when it seems like that I feel discouraged to start talking with them. Now for my question. We were on a little boat cruise Taking in the sights and they happen to be staring off into the distance. I had ask “hey what are you looking at” to which they replied “just looking” now I saw that as them just not wanting to talk because to me that just stops the conversation. At that point I just felt discouraged from talking to them. Later on in the week we had gotten into a little argument and I said that what they had said had bothered me because they seemed very stand off and they proceeded to say “I can’t read your mind and what you are trying to do is play mind games” Now with that being said am I right in saying that when you say something like “just looking” it doesn’t really add to the conversation and just seems stand off ish or am I in the wrong?,12Jun2019,2

When I am with a group of friends and I feel like I have to make sure everyone is being talked to and included, I get that same feeling. My mom had neck surgery when I was like 8, and we went to Disney that year , and she wanted to ride a ride that said people with back or neck problems shouldn’t ride, and I got that same feeling.

When I was 17 I got pregnant. I wanted to abort but found out too late for the pill type, and couldn't afford the time/travel required for the surgical one. 

I hid the pregnancy from my friends and family. I carried to term and selected a family to adopt the baby out to and gave birth at 18. Alone. I had a boyfriend at the time, he refused to call off work during my labor and he went to a house party that night. We decided on an open adoption. 

I was sexually abused as a child, and emotionally abused until 25. (Excuses excuses) A small part of me still wishes I could have had the abortion. I hate that section of my life, I hate this secret. 

They turn 12 this year. I haven't seen them since they were three days old. I get messages on facebook messenger with pictures and stories. They have younger siblings and look happy. I see bits of myself in their eyes and face shape. I don't reply to these messages, and check maybe once every few months. 

I haven't the emotional strength or stability to meet them, look into their eyes, and know that I still wish I could have aborted them before they were them. I can't tell their parents this (obviously) but I know that once they turn 18 I might hear a knock on the door...

I basically brainwashed myself into thinking I was really awkward and couldn't hold conversations, weird right? I also felt like I wasn't good enough to have a job because I felt bad at everything. 

I started going to therapy for my anxiety in October, which really helped with my confidence and made me feel way better than before. I have a job at a pet store, which was a really big step for me because I hated being social with people I didn't know already. I work 5 days a week and interact with strangers all day.

55,"In a few weeks I will be leaving my full time job (no benefits). For a part time job with great benefits. But obviously, I'm losing money doing this. Hourly pay is more but it's about 10 less hours per week. So I'm going to have to get some extra income on the side. I'm debating working part time (pizza delivery or something like this) or starting my own business. 

The thing with starting my own business is I have no money to invest, I would have to start something off the books that's low start up, make a little money, then make it all legal. I currently work as a mechanic. So I was thinking of maybe doing some basic mechanic work on the side and sort of do a mobile repair type gig. What I would LOVE to do would honestly get into motorcycle mechanic but I've never done much with motorcycles yet. I ride but haven't had to get deep into the mechanical side yet. I would love to also build bikes. Or possibly flipping cars. But both of those take a lot of start up. 

I also happen to be really good with cooking. (I just thought of this on a whim) but could you possibly start a dinner delivery type service? 

What do you think would be my best bet? All I really need to make is around $200-$300 per week to make up for only having part time hours. That's easy with mechanical work. 

I've also toyed with the idea of doing pizza delivery AND going to college part time. But I have a wife and children, so I don't really have THAT much time extra :/",12Jun2019,1
57,"So some backstory: last year I lived on what I thought was a quiet street, but my unit faced the road behind, with lots of bus activity on it. The noisiest part though was that it was a major flight path, with helicopters also flying to the hospital in the middle of the night. I just about went crazy from the noise after 6 months, so I moved out.

Fast forward to now. I moved to a unit on the second floor, facing the back of a well built block. I swear when I went to look, you could barely hear the cars on the once again semi-main road. The kicker was after I moved in, two TWO construction sites started in front of and next to the block. 

Now that I don’t live under a flight path anymore, the sound of motorcycles and cars with loud engines drive me absolutely crazy! It’s all day and night and has made it that even hearing the sounds in my day to day gives me heart palpitations. 

I would love to wear noise cancelling headphones at home, but my bf just moved in and the whole anxiety and moods over the flight path last time really upset him, so I don’t want to be the weirdo going crazy from noise again since it was my idea to move here.

This situation is thankfully temporary as we Are waiting for my 2 bedroom to be ready in January. This place is on a road with some activity, but a lot less. It’s also second floor, triple brick and not only is it facing away from the road with the bedroom at the back, but it’s the building behind the block on the road, so I’m very hopeful that I’ll find it quiet enough. 

What should I do in the meantime?",12Jun2019,1
58,"Need some advice , a hint or something 

Literally happened this morning. I wake up from a bad dream about my dad. From what I remember in the dream, we're in a village of some sort (we're Polynesians so I assume we're in the islands), I see white walls on my left, part of a building but don't see the whole building itself. There's 2 people next to an entrance of the building, I don't recognize neither of them however one shouts through the entrance door ""who's in there?"". However inside its pitch black, nothing but emptiness and no response. The other guy just sits on a bucket looking at me and his surroundings.

I then look on my right, I see people running away from a small shed or some sort (the type to store fire wood, sticks, garden stuff etc). I look at those people running away and recognize one of them, it's my best friend Johnny, who lives right next door. (We grew up doing everything together, playing sports, same schools, same interests). Him and those following behind him are all laughing and smiling. Running towards a small hill, which on top a car is a waiting for them. Getting picked up maybe. 

I turn around and see my dad walking towards me. His face is covered in scratches, cuts, bruising and blood pouring out of his mouth. I yell at him ""Dad whats wrong??"" ""What happened??!"".. His facial expression doesn't change. He walks up to me, touches both my shoulders, eyes still locked at mine and walks off in the distance.

Then I wake up. My phone is right next to me and I see a text from my cousin that says ""cous is uncle ok??"" (referring to my dad). Strange that she would ask that as I've just had a bad dream about him. I reply ""yeah he's fine, same old same old"". She replies back ""Thank goodness, I just a really bad dream that something bad happened to him"".

60,"I'm hesitant to post this as I've never posted in an open forum before, but I'm really hoping someone might be able to give me some helpful advice on this. My older brother is 37 years old, and has been dealing with depression since his very early teens. He has been on medication this entire time, different ones prescribed by different doctors. He sees a therapist regularly. He meditates daily. Some days he's okay, and can laugh every now and then. But most of time he just seems miserable and emotionless.

&amp;#x200B;

To give a better perspective on our family dynamic, here's an overly long paragraph about us:

My parents separated when I was 6 (brother was 9). It wasn't a super messy split, but my dad refused to pay child support for quite a long time, and my mom ended up having to use all of her savings on court/lawyers fees to try and get him to pay. We lived with my mom (she struggled to get by for years), and saw my dad every other weekend. My dad's entire life has always revolved around soccer. He lives and breathes it. Most of my childhood was spent at the soccer field: my mom played it, I played it, my brother played it for a couple years, and my dad coached women's soccer teams, took teams to tournaments and ran the leagues in our city. To this day, a conversation with my dad would include a lengthy chat about soccer. I know he definitely chose soccer over visiting with us numerous times.

In all honesty, I don't really remember my childhood being that bad, I still felt loved by both my parents. But my brother seems to think differently. He has a very heavy dislike (hatred?) towards my dad. And my mom too, but mostly my dad.

Growing up, my brother always did really well in school. He's the smart one in the family, and has always has good jobs. He's had to loan my mom money several times in his life. I think he resents her for not being able to take care of us ""properly"".

&amp;#x200B;

Our family has also never been one to go out of our way to communicate with each other. We don't have any deep conversations about feelings, and we never have. My mom and I are very close, and I'm also quite close to my dad. My brother feels like an outcast. I recently found this out when him and I had a little drunk heart-to-heart outside of a wedding celebration. He thinks he's not like us, and he feels like he doesn't belong when our extended family gets together. (My mom lives in a separate building on the same property as my aunt/uncle, so by extended family I mean mom/brother/me/aunt/uncle/cousins).

When we're together, he's usually pretty quiet, although if he's in an okay mood he's very funny and can laugh and be sarcastic with the rest of us. He really is a lot of fun when he's at his best. It's rare though.

A lot of the time he's sarcastic, I'd say almost to a hurtful extent. I've dealt with it my entire life, so I take people's insults as jokes. I've always laughed off comments that my brother made to me, even if they were true. I think my dad did the same. My mom takes my brother's comments to heart.

I've been paying attention more recently to how he acts around me compared to how he acts around my parents. I moved in with him a few months ago (temporary job), and have noticed that for the most part, he can laugh and joke with me. I make stupid comments and he laughs, it's quite fun. When we're around our parents, he is very different. This is when he'll be quiet, moody, barely smile. He'll make little jabs at my mom (like I said, she takes them to heart, I can see the hurt in her eyes when he says them), and if he's around my dad it's so much worse. He endlessly (somewhat subtly) tells my dad that he's a shitty person. He makes so many snide remarks towards him, being completely serious, but my dad tends to laugh them off (I guess I learned this from him).

My dad is a hoarder, by the way. Not like the garbage everywhere kind, but he keeps everything. He has rooms piled with things (a lot of soccer stuff), and he doesn't clean the house or take care of himself. I know that he's recently gone a month without showering. He's also slowing down in his age (71), so I'm worried about him.

I think the hoarding that my dad is doing has created an even bigger divide between my dad and brother. My dad makes no effort to call/text/keep in touch with my brother. My brother barely makes an attempt at talking to my dad. Every now and then my brother will call him when he's waiting to board a plane (because he knows he'll have to hang up in a certain amount of time).

&amp;#x200B;

I've frequently googled how to help a depressed friend or family member, and all I get are the same results. ""Tell them you're there to listen, encourage them to get help, tell them it gets better"". I've told him I'm here to listen, he doesn't want to talk to me. He's been seeing a therapist for many years now, and has taken countless medications. He's been depressed since he was about 14, and it hasn't gotten any better for him.

&amp;#x200B;

He's still alone. He's had a girlfriend every now and then but nothing for more than a year or so. He's never been married. I know he wants to get married, I know he'd even like to have a kid one day. I think this gets to him a lot that he's still single.

&amp;#x200B;

It makes me so incredibly sad to see him like this, and I don't know how to help him. He truly is a great guy, and he deserves to find happiness and enjoyment in his life.

Any advice to approach this would be greatly appreciated.",12Jun2019,1
61,"I’m gonna try and keep this short, I’m 16, female, and was born with something called gastroschisis, you can look it up for more detail, but basically when I was born I had my organs coming out of a hole right by my belly button. 

they had to put everything back where it belongs as soon as I was born and I now have a scar connected from neck to my chest all the way to the bottom of my stomach- the best way I can explain it is that it’s extremely ugly, people ask if a dog has bit me before and once I showed someone my stomach and, they said I’ll never find someone to love me since it looks like that.

All bulling aside I’ve gotten way bigger since I was born and even though I do hate how my stomach looks, it also causes me a great deal of pain from the scar tissue build up (not to mention I also have cyst on my ovaries which doesn’t help at all) . 

I was supposed to have surgery to fix this and plastic surgery to give me a “normal” looking belly button since I was 13, but my grandmother won’t get the surgery. 

we’re supposed to go out of town for it because that’s the only place they do the surgery, but we don’t have a car, and she refuses to make the appointment. 

recently I had to call 911 because I was in so much pain I couldn’t even move I couldn’t go to the bathroom without it hurting,  when I got to the hospital They didn’t help me much, but there was a nurse there that told me her son had the same thing as me, and he was born in my town and had his surgery in my town. 

My grandma said she doesn’t want to do this in my town because they might mess it up (and trust me there’s no talking to her she’s very stubborn), but at this point I don’t even care what it looks like, sometimes If I don’t eat I end up getting sick and sometimes I can’t eat to much without getting sick, I’m so exhausted from this and I wish I could just get it over and done with because the pain is becoming unbearable at this point. 

I know I’m a minor but I really need some help because this is affecting my everyday life at this point just because she wants to control my every move. She is also trying to get benefits on my mental health from the state, and already gets child support and food stamps for me even though I don’t live with her. 

that’s her excuse to why she won’t let my girlfriends grandma have power of attorney so she can make my doctors/dentists/school appointments. BUT SHE IS HOMELESS.

she also refuses to give me my birth certificate or SSN so I can get a job and my ID. She always has various excuses but at this point I feel like she’s trying to control my life and I have no idea what to do. I feel like I should get emancipated but I have no idea how to go about this. Any advice?

64,"i have this friend and we’ve been going through some rough patches. it would take a novelette to get through it all but here’s the gyst

-she was mad at me because i was friends with someone she had had a feud with in the past

-after ignoring me and blocking me and refusing to talk, i got her to explain her side and we hashed it out over text. from my point of view, i was very apologetic and open minded and i always said things like “i feel that.....” or “i understand that you feel that way” while she was very close minded (my friends who are also her friends agree with me)

-this caused us to stop talking

-she made various posts on reddit about me and her “cutting” me off and how she was feeling not good since she had to cut me off (which, if you ask me, she really didn’t; i was just fine with being friends with her and the girl she didn’t like)

-recently i reached out to her over a misunderstanding with another friend that she caused. she explained and apologized (in her own way) for that situation and it was sorted out. she also apologized for the previous situation and said that she wants to reconnect

i don’t know if i want to. i mean, it’s not like i want to keep the bad blood, and of course i want to talk to her, but i don’t know if i want to get as close as i was.

i haven’t confronted her about a lot of the stuff she said / did. i just texted her asking if we could talk about everting, she said it’s best if we talk in person.

65,"So today was my tennis team's banquet. It. Was. Awful. But not exactly for the reasons you might first think of. Our coach is the reason tonight was awful but first off you need to know what sort of person my coach is.

He's an old white male and he is very old school. He's been coaching for years but this was his 4th year at our school. No one on our team really likes him all that much. He's been known to step out of line and be unfair to others on the team. He clearly has favorites (but they don't seem quite as fond of him as he is of them). A girl on our team said that at one of the matches, he put his arm around her shoulders and called her ""babe"" and a few other girls said they saw it happen. Another friend of mine told me that at the last banquet, he put his hand on her lower back and said something inappropriate that she refused to repeat. (I'm not suspicious that she wouldn't repeat it because she's a catholic girl and I know she doesn't like to say that sort of stuff)

But going back to tonight, he leaned against that same friend's shoulder which made her supper uncomfortable. He also rapped his arm around another freshman girl and pulled her really close. I could tell by the look on her face that she wanted to get away from him. Now my friend is beating herself up about it because of she had spoken up last year then the other girl wouldn't have had to go through that. We both want to make sure this doesn't happen again because no one should have to worry about their coach crossing the line and touching them in a way that makes them feel uncomfortable like he did tonight. 

What should we do? Our school isn't the best when it comes to these sorts of things. A few years back, for example, we had a substitute band teacher that looked at nothing besides to girls butts the whole class. He'd stand behind one of the assistant leaders whenever she'd come up to the podium to conduct and he'd never take his eyes off her back side until she went to sit down. When they confronted the principal about this he told then that they were overreacting and blowing everything out of proportion. He told them not to worry about it and to leave his office so he could get to work. That's our school's response to these sorts of things and so we're both scared to do anything. 

Basically, our coach is crossing the line and into people's personal space which is making everyone uncomfortable around him. My friend and I want to do something about it and put a stop to it so no one will have to go through it again but we don't know how because our school is trash and really doesn't care about anything besides the one sports team that one the state championship 4 times in a row (big surprise, it's not the tennis team).

Him: I understand and I agree. I don’t want to talk when it’s not appropriate. 

Me: Yeah. I don’t want to put my entire livelihood at risk. I just assumed it was going to be appropriate if you were willing to talk but wanted to err on the side of caution 

Him: Well I don’t want that either and whenever I reach out that’s when it would be appropriate

Me: Ok lol sorry it’s confusing cause you reached out a few weeks ago 

Him: I know and I’ve been going through a rough patch and need space and time. So I appreciate your understanding.

Me: I do. I wanna talk but I ruined everything by being a bitch last year. Hope everything is well-ish

Him: Tbh I’m dealing with some mental health issues, I’m kinda at a low and I don’t think I can deal with added stress right now. Please be mindful and helpful by not stressing me more than I can handle at one time. I’ll let you know when I’m in a better place. 

Me: That’s totally fine. I just was apologizing and expressing that I wasn’t upset because I still would enjoy talking to you eventually when you’re ready. I know you don’t wanna talk to me about these issues but if you do you can reach out

75,"Hi, so I a 31/M joined a dungeons and dragons group about a year ago now and while i got on with everyone, one girl stood out to me. Lets call her Ann Ae started to chat outside of games and became friends. We would play board games and chat on skype sometimes. I fell for her in a big way. Told her how I feel but she didn't feel the same even though I got some signals that it wasn't the case. Especially when she would tell me she has considered us being more but with her being at university she's always really busy.

Cut to a couple of months or so back i met more people through the hobby and decided to run a campaign. Few sessions started well until I started to get messages from another one of the players (i'll name her lisa) saying Ann kept staring at her and it was creeping her out a bit. Now the again Ann was always friendly to everyone so I just put it down to that. A bank holiday swings around and I go for drinks with two of my players. Lisa and a guy i'll call him Ben. This is when I get told a lot of stuff. Lisa was working with someone who was also playing in my games i'll name him Paul. Lisa and Paul started dating, and Lisa noticed that Ann was sending messages to Paul about spending the day together. I was never shown these as proof. Ben told me he had spent some time with Ann as he fancied her but she told him it's only a friendship she's after. Lisa also told me Paul said in there place of work in front of customers that he was taking Ann out for the day and saw it as a date. Ben then told me that Paul had also said in a different place of his work that he had slept with Lisa. To which another guy in my main d&amp;d game who i'll call Don, said he had dated Ann some months ago but it never worked out. 

I get it unloaded on me in one afternoon. I suffer with various levels of depression and this put me really down as all I wanted was no shit in my games and to take Ann out as I had really fallen for her. 

I contact Paul asking if he took Ann out and he acts like a complete prick about it, and blocks me. so I go to Ann asking about everything I was told. Some confirmed some not but by this point I don't know what's the truth and what's not. I got that bad I stopped eating for a bit and got really disappointed in all people involved. I ended up cancelling my campaign. I see Ann and Don most of all and both of them know what was said. Looking back I know I did some things that didn't help myself but the trust I had in Ann and Don had gone. When I spoke to Ann after one of the saturday night games about this and how it was effecting me and herself. I was close to tears and she did in fact cry twice because of what was being said about her. I kept going to d&amp;d games every saturday evening but my mind was all over the place. I got angry at the people a bit and rage quit. All players have welcomed me back, Don has said he never wants Ben and Lisa at his games again because of what they did, but I am always welcome. Ann tells me nothings changed between me and her and we will always be friends. I've had a serious knock to my self confidence so not sure I believe them. I tell Ann I no longer trust her and she tells me she never told me about Don or Paul because she knew it would hurt my feelings. But hearing it from someone else has made it worse.

Me and Ann talk some on skype and she wants to skype every Sunday from her university to build the friendship back up again. I'm really not sure it can ever be how it was. I'm not even sure I can be friends. I've considered seeing a therapist over this to help get my head back to the good place I was in before it all was unloaded on me but i'm a bit lost.",12Jun2019,1

During my last year in college, I found that engineering isn't quite what I want to do with my life, and I find myself becoming board with most things I can do with my degree.  The only thing that I continue to find mostly consistent enjoyment out of is trouble shooting equipment.  I currently have a job, but it's not one I'd like to keep (I had it as an internship, but didn't find anything to replace it).  I work in a position that I do a lot of trouble shooting in, but I'm not the biggest fan/board of the product the company sells (it's one of those things that people wouldn't ever think exists because of how niche it is), and the culture of the company is super wack.  I'm looking to find a position that is kind of similar to what I have, but closer to some of the hobbies that I would like to take on/build on (I like to hike and I would like to get back into fishing, hunting and start backpacking).

We are looking for little games and things, also it’s going to be a combo of all of the books we did this year. Gatsby, streetcar named desire, death of a salesmen. The idea is that “gatsby” invited all of these literary characters to one of his parties, so everyone comes dressed as their favorite character. (Blanche gets to mingle with daisy, Stanley kowalski with biff from death of a salesmen) one idea we had was to have a little activity where we have green post it’s and throughout the party, people anonymously write their “green light”. Which in gatsby was a symbol for his desire in life, something he reached for. What are the students reaching for in life. Another is a “photo booth” which is based on Blanche from streetcar, cause she’s self centered and would like to get her picture taken. With scarves and other things, we have a lot of props in the room because it’s an English class but we read plays for the most part rather then regular novels. I can’t think of an activity for death of a salesmen. I’m sorry for the rant but when I say a gatsby themed party, I mean GATSBY.

93,"So, my roommate, M and I are completely baffled about what happened today with our friend, L. And I really need someone to give input on what we did wrong.

So, all 4 of us involved are 24F.
Me, M, L and our friend A all went to college together. We’ve been friends for 6 years, and have never fought or had issues in our friendship. Until now. So, the 4 of us have been trying to plan a vacation this summer and an opportunity arose where we would have free access to a beach condo thanks to some family. However, the condo is only available one week in July, and then August and onward. A is a teacher and goes back to school August 13, so our two options were the week in July or the first week of August.
M, A and I all were 100% committed. L, however, had a family vacation planned the first week in August, and also couldn’t commit to the week in July either because she might have to work on her thesis. Ok.
So L tells us not to plan it around her because she’s not sure if she can go. She said she can try, but that we should go regardless. 
So, today I noticed someone had booked the condo for the week in July. So, I hurry and book it for the first week of August. 
I texted L and the following conversation happened:
Me: soo the condo is booked in July.
L: I can’t go then 
Me: I know. I’m sorry 
L: does A have a fall break? 
Me: I don’t know
L: K
L: *20 minutes later* whatever
Me: I’m sorry L. the dates in July got taken this morning. There was nothing I could do. The condo is open and always free for us to use, we can always go back, especially because off season flights are cheap.
L: whatever 

So when M got home from work today we talked about how we don’t know wtf is going on, so M texted L. M sent her a long apology saying how she’s sorry it worked out like this but if she wanted to try manage to visit while we’re down there for a day or two she’s welcome, and told her how much we love her. L said “lol no.” M said “is the no to coming to see us?” And L said “have fun. I’m done giving a shit.” M sent her another text asking her to please tell us what we did, because we were really confused and we just want to know what we did to upset her. She said to please just talk to us. L said “nah.”

95,"To get to the point, i need help on how to have sex with a guy that’s hung like a horse. We’ve had sex plenty of times, and sometimes i can get through it with little or no pain, but most of the time, it hurts to some degree. For starters, i don’t know if it’s me or him, but he hits my cervix a lot. really the only time i’ve been able to let him go almost or pretty much all the way in was when i’m ovulating/fertile and that isn’t safe for obvious reasons even though we use condoms. the other issue is, he’s a little too wide as well. the first time we slept together it took 15-20 minutes to get his penis in me while i cried the entire time, but i was determined (the same thing happened the time after that, and one more after that). After we had done it several times, things became a little easier in terms of getting it in, but the cervix issue still arose and after not having sex for about 4 months, the last time we tried again, i couldn’t do it because it was so painful we had to stop. it wasn’t an issue with not being aroused enough as i had already came once from oral, so i don’t know what else to do. please help me.",12Jun2019,1

So far I have improved a lot and have even been trusted several times to finish cleaning by myself and close the store.

Anyways, I am super depressed. Or so I think. It’s only in a phase of my life. I show no emotion at all and rarely feel any. I just don’t care about anything or anyone. I don’t talk to any people unless I have to. It’s hard to explain my problem because it’s so regular to me. It feels like i’m making up this story/problem but I seriously don’t have words to put.

I just don’t care about anything. I don’t care what happens to anyone and I show no emotion to anyone. Usually like once a year the phase comes back and I just don’t care again. 

I feel like the problem is past depression but I don’t know. I don’t think of average depressed person things. I would never cut or harm myself in any type of way. I go through problems that a depressed person would cut or cry because of but I just don’t care.

107,"so today i spent the whole day with my best friends. I’m gonna be a senior in highschool and i really vaguely see popularity anymore, but they are some
popular dudes who know lots of people. Now i’m use to it when we hang out, but today it sorta caught my full attention. Our conversations are 40% normal every day things and the 60% is just who their gonna hookup with next. and it’s constantly talking about snap chatting this girl blah blah snaping this girl, or “look who i got a snap from”. We took a mini road trip to one of my friends lake house and saw 2 other girls. right away they wanted their snaps. they didn’t even want anything to do with them, it’s like it’s some kind of sport to obtain. 

the only thing really that sets me aside from my friends is, i’m a little different in that department. i’m not interested in these casual hook ups/ or childish games. A good word for this their approach on girls is very “high school” of them.I feel if i just have a completely different out look on life to a point where i don’t want that. 

Life is a meaningful thing  and  i only want meaningful things out of it. that includes meaningful things with people. But today it sorta bugged me. I wasn’t gonna say anything but my whole body just wanted to say shut the fuck up to them. I 100% do not have any problems with them living their life, but it’s not something i constantly want to hear. Do you think this is our generation, or just being a teenager?

108,"I don’t know if I’m coming off spoiled or entitled by typing this but I really need help in how I should go about the situation. 

I’m a senior in high school and I’m graduating on Friday. My mother is in the navy and she’s retiring tomorrow morning. This seemed like a really good idea to combine the two events into the same week so that our family could come and celebrate with us. 

The trouble is that my parents decided that we would be having a conjoined party as well.  And I’ve had no say in anything involving the party. I didn’t even know we were having a party until my mom and stepdad started talking about it while we were at the dinner table less than a month ago. 

It’s at a brewery, not where I would have chosen but ok. it’s the night of my graduation, well I know I won’t be able to invite any of my friends so that’s great. I didn’t even get a say as to what we’re going to eat. 

I was talking to my mother the other day, telling her a funny story about my friends, and she asked me if they were coming to the party. 

I said no (I had no idea I was supposed to invite people and even if I did it was the night of graduation and everyone’s going to be out with their families) and she asked me “why not?” When I explained to her that no one was coming for me she said that she didn’t want me to have to go to a party if none of my friends are there. 

And that’s where my I guess animosity for the event is starting to stem from. I feel like no one is caring enough about how I feel and what I want. My mother didn’t even consider the fact that because this party was on the night of graduation I’d be all alone. It feels like when someone else’s name is in giant text on the cover of a book and the co author is in tiny font on the bottom right corner. I feel like I’m just an after thought but I also feel like I’m acting spoiled and entitled by feeling this way. I think I should be lucky to have a party in the first place or be graduating from a good school at all, I just wish I had the spotlight for once. 

I just know that this party is going to be full of adults and people I don’t know talking about military stuff and celebrating my mother. But I’m not sure if anyone’s going to be celebrating me. And this is something I want to be celebrated in because I feel like I’ve worked so hard and given 13 years of my life to graduate with good grades to go to a good school, only to be pushed back and ignored for someone else’s special day. 

I’m really excited for my mother because she’s come home almost every day this year tired and agitated by the people she works with, she’s been deployed all over the world and separated from us, and she’s worked really hard to be where she is in life. I really don’t want to ruin this  for her, but I also want to have at least some recognition for all my achievements too. 

Any advice or just words of encouragement would be very helpful. Thank you.",12Jun2019,1
109,"Hi. I’m sorry for bad formatting, because I’m on mobile. Also this is going to be really long. 

 So I’m looking for some advice because I got into a really bad fight with some friends

Ok, so I’m going to lay out some nicknames and such. These aren’t their real names

Doug- been friends with him for nearly ten years. Our friendship had always been rocky, but recently he has just been so... mad and I don’t know why. I got into a fight with him and Carl

Carl- has been one of my best friends, and I’ve known him for about 2 years. We’ve had some rough patches, but for the most part it’s been good. Doug and I kind of brought him into the argument. Both him and Jeff say they don’t really like Doug, but they always kind of suck up to him. 

Jeff- one of my best friends. He doesn’t come up much, but I’d just figure I’d name him. 

Pete- also doesn’t come up much, but is good friends with Jeff and Doug. A very honest person. 

Ok. So I was hanging out with Doug and a few other people earlier today. Every time I started talking, Doug just told me to shut up. He didn’t sound too serious, and I was just hoping it was some weird joke. Anyway, he just out of nowhere just starts saying how annoying I am. I try to ignore it. Eventually, it gets worse and he starts going on about how much he hates me. I sort of just say, “Doug, shut up. I didn’t do anything, and this isn’t funny. You’ve been a jerk to me in the past, so just calm down”. Doug just goes “you know what? Carl and Jeff don’t really like you and you have no friends, so shut up”.

Now, I bring up some stuff that Carl has said about Doug. The main thing was a group chat with Carl, Jeff, and Doug. It was titled “Groupchat without ___ (my name)”. Carl and Jeff both said they were really sorry about it, and that it was Doug’s idea. Dough said nothing about it. 

 I also said told Doug that Carl doesn’t like him, and a few other things. So Doug calls up Carl on his phone, on speaker, and asks if Carl said this. It’s obviously very uncomfortable for Carl, so he says “no” and hangs up. Doug bought this and starts calling me a liar. Now, I know I shouldn’t have brought this up to begin with, and I’ve apologized to Carl about it. 

Now, I get sorta quiet and sad when I’m being yelled at like this. So I’m sitting there, just staring into the distance while doug goes “OP’s a liar! OP’s a liar!”  Then, Carl begins texting Doug some stuff that I’ve said about Doug. Stuff like “don’t be friends with Doug, he gets really mean for no reason” (which I find ironic, because this is what Doug was doing). So then Doug gets somehow even more mad. He also brings up a phone call he had with Pete. He said it was really bad, and it was about me. Pete was sitting there, looking very uncomfortable. I left before it gets any worse. 

I asked Pete what he thought of it, because he was there. He said that Doug was being an ass. I asked him about that phone call. This is his exact text 
“He said I fucking hate (my name) dont tell him I told you”. 

So Carl blocked my Instagram, snapchat, and phone number. I used my alt account, and dmed him. He said that although he was very mad, he doesn’t hate me, and doesn’t want to talk to me now. 

Now, I am not going to talk to Doug about this. I’m done with him and if he wants to apologize, he can. But I want to keep being friends with Carl. I’m wondering what I should say, if you were in this situation. We’re all 13 and 14, so this doesn’t have to be complicated.

115,"I’ve been working at my family’s business for 3 years now, and I am labeled as “Assistant Manager” but I’m really more of a supervisor. 

We are a simple icecream shop, family owned and small. We play music on a computer Bluetooth connected to speakers through Spotify in our establishment. Usually we are found listening to the 60’s, 80’s, 70’s, country, or pop music.

No one is supposed to touch the computer unless part of management. Today, I put on Bob Marley for our shop, and one of my coworkers asked me if we could change the music. I said as long as it’s not explicit, hardcore metal, rap, or anything crazy. I then explained the music we normally play.

My coworker changed the song to “Old Town Road”. About 30 seconds into it, the owner (my mother’s boyfriend) came up and heard the music playing and saw my coworker was the one who changed it. Immediately he asked him what exactly he thought he was doing, and then we both explained the situation and apologized. The owner then left in a bit of a huff.

3 hours later, he came back. He told me to bring my coworker and myself downstairs. We both went down, and he asked about what happened with the music. I gave my side of the story about giving him permission if the song met the guidelines, and then my coworker gave his side which was the same thing as mine. The owner then because very angry and raised his voice. He claimed the song was explicit, and looked at my coworker and told him that he seems to not have any idea of what to do around here and what’s okay, and reprimanded him for changing the music. Then he said “You’re done, this was your last shift.” My coworker remained silent and then left the room. The owner (who I live with, my mother’s bf as stated earlier) then told me that my job is to supervise and I know what I’m supposed to do by now, how I shouldn’t try to be friends with everyone, and how it’s bullshit. I got very emotional and started crying because I don’t take well to angry people raising their voices at me, not to mention I was completely caught off guard because I didn’t think this was a horrible thing that we did.

I feel terribly about my coworker being fired for this and it is my fault, and I take responsibility for this. I am thinking of telling the owner this, and telling him to fire me instead. The only issue is that I didn’t plan on losing my job like this (I’m 21) (my coworker is 15)  and I really need the money, and I’ve been here for 3 years.

119,"Okay.... I really really need advice right now. Things in my life are really really bad and I really need any advice I can get on what to do now. 

So basically I met a guy online named Vinny like half a year ago. We were both looking for someone to talk to online and we talked to eachother like every single night for hours and hours. He worked a night shift so I would stay up all night talking to him basically every night. We got along great.

Then he started to get dizzy and would pass out randomly and told me it's because he was diabetic. He really wanted to go to Disney land with his kid but to be frank... hes broke. He would worry about money so much every night and then he told me he had a large lump on his neck he needed to get checked but didnt have the money.  He was going to get it checked after he went to Disney land with his kid.

After months I finally decided to help out my friend and I sent him $500 to get the lump tested and to go to disneyland so 1. He didnt have to worry anymore and 2. So that I didnt have to listen to him worry about it anymore... It hurt hearing him worry everynight. So he did the trip and the test and it turns out that the tests didn't look good so he started going doctor to doctor, no one could help him. 

During this time long story short I went to the hairdresser and they also found a lump on my head... I got it test and it ended up being a tumor... I know, it's crazy bad luck... but during this time I spent all of my time with family and I basically stopped talking to my friend because it was too hard hearing about his issues while i had the same issues as him, the only difference was that mine was being dealt with quickly. We still talked but I basically told him that I needed to focus on myself and deal with my problems... 

part of me started to resent him because even tho I know he didnt I felt like he brought this into my life... I never had to deal with death and cancer before I met him and it just felt like he brought all this into my life when I never even thought any of this was a possibility.. I know its not true but my brain was just very upset that I had to go through that situation at all. I'm still upset now even but I know now it's not his fault at all hes been nothing but loving and supportive to me, I'm the asshole.

Anyways I had surgery for my tumor in my skull, the recovery was brutal and here we are today... 3 weeks after my surgery I'm finally starting to feel like myself and I've been trying to build back up all my relationships that I fucked up during the time I was having surgery... now my friend finds out that he has really really bad cancer and that he will be disabled forever, might even die and needs surgery/ radiation starting next Tuesday..... FUCK!!!!!

 I still havent even recovered and now I might lose this INCREDIBLE person. This man is the love of my life :( I know I have been saying friend but that's only out of technicality.... be is the most amazing person I've ever met and the thought of losing him is killing me. I am a HORRIBLE helper. I am so shit at helping people... he knows I'm trying but he needs me right now and I have no CLUE what im doing 😭😭😭😭 I love him so much... I dont know if I can live without him in all honesty hes the only person who truely gets me in this world.... even when I needed my time and distanced myself from him he was supportive and understood... he was always there.... every single day and now he needs me.... and I have no idea what to do. This is SO serious I dont even know where to start 

He loves me too... he says he wants to marry me and have kids with me. but now he might die... I'm trying to figure out what to do, I want to be as supportive as possible to him but I'm not sure how to be supportive it's one of my weaknesses. I'm thinking of flying out to where he lives and spending some time with him before his surgery, my family would hate this but this might be my only chance to be with the man who I love and that loves me... I genuinely think we're soulmates. I'm just not sure because 1. I'm still recovering and 2. My family wouldnt like that + he lives in another country... the only other thing I can think of is being supportive over text. But I feel like that will never ever be enough... he needs me. Idn, I just remember how important it was for me saying goodbye to my parents before my surgery I dont want him to not have that... i want him to hold the one he loves before be goes to surgery. 

Does anyone have any advice?! 😭😭😭💔💔💔💔 I have no clue what to do this is the hardest thing in the world... please help :(",12Jun2019,2

could you see the difference in maturity/life experience being a problem? we have had some major similar life experiences if that helps.

Im moderately skilled in painting but im planning on taking a gap year. In this gap year im intending on improving myself in digital art, possibly starting commissions to get a feel for working for people.

I dont know whether I should go to university and get a degree or if I should just spend that time self teaching myself with the free videos and classes online. There are universities here like massey university where they have a course called creative media design, or another institution called 'media design school' where they teach you on how to use digital programs in the industry ( im assuming ). We have weta workshop here in New Zealand so that might be a ticket into the industry, though I dont know if I should gamble teaching myself a portfolio or going balls deep into debt and coming out with a degree in something like creative media.",12Jun2019,1
131,"TLDR at the end

Some background: I live in an at-will employment state (PA-USA), which means I can be fired without reason. I work a job that pays $9 an hour, with an added commission, but we’re only paid the commission in lump sums twice a year. The commission is .01% of what we sell. 

We got a new manager at our office who is absolutely awful. Let’s call the manager Skyler, and to protect all identities, I will use they/them pronounce. 

Skyler is kind of manager that takes everything personally, and does petty, passive-aggressive things while telling you that it’s not personal. Bad at their job, and blames the people below them for their own failures as a boss.

Skyler has a hair-trigger, and fired someone the other day after the employee told them that they were being unreasonable after Skyler was being petty (I understand it sounds like my opinion, but just believe me that it was petty).

I have a gut feeling that I’m the next one on Skyler’s list to go once we get more employees (we’re understaffed atm but I wouldn’t put it past them to fire me without thinking of the scheduling consequences). To be clear: I’m good at my job, I’ve only gotten written up once back in November (I think? It was sometime last fall), and the other managers really like me. I do my job well, if not better than most of my coworkers.

Now that you know the background of what this manager is like, I have questions:

1. How do I ask to see my terms of employment/contract/commission agreement without ruffling their feathers or making them think I intend to quit? I can’t find it on our employee portal.
2. I have a bad short-term memory as an effect of neurological damage in the past—if the manager ever calls me into the office, it would be best if I can record the conversation. Otherwise, I just won’t remember it. How do I ask for their consent without freaking them out? What if they say I can’t record?
3. When Skyler requests something ridiculous, or talks down at me in the office, what can I do or say that won’t immediately lead to a firing?

TLDR: how can I ask my boss to see my employment contract/commission agreement without setting off red flags in their mind? How can I ask to record our one-on-one meetings without sounding suspicious? How can I react to petty behavior that won’t get me fired?

Thank you! Sorry it’s so long.",12Jun2019,1

I was never very good in school, no matter how hard I tried in certain subjects it was never enough. For spring semester I struggled with classes and went to tutoring once to twice a week. I just found out yesterday I didn’t bring my GPA enough and have to drop out of one part of my school and then reapply once my GPA is up. Problem is I also lost scholarships and can’t afford to go. Currently I’m 4 hours away from my family living with my boyfriend for a month, I’m terrified to go home and tell my mom I’m not going back to school. We fought my dad for months on me going to this school and I feel like such a fuck up. I’m also worried my boyfriend will leave me because I kinda flunked. He says he won’t and it’s just a “bump in the road” but I don’t feel that way. I feel like he deserves better and I’m useless.  What should I do about everything? Should I completely drop out and go to online schooling? I could get a full time job and move in completely with my boyfriend but then I’m paranoid he’d leave.",12Jun2019,1
134,"I am having a bit of a dilemma because I usually don’t want too get involved with these things. There is a family that goes too my school that I’ll just call the Smiths and there are 6 kids.

For most of their lives they have lived off the grid, without water and basic necessities but CPS told the parents that if they didn’t move to a place with water that they would take the kids.

 They now live next too my friend Brock in a Duplex, they are very noisy and Brock can here basically everything that happens.

They have also done weird things, all the kids have Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, they don’t wear shoes, they smell and most of them are plain weird.

Usually this stuf isn’t that bad but there is worse things happening. A week ago Brock saw the Mother and the 5 youngest run out of the house into the Car and leave and he means that they sprinted while the mother carried to the oldest, all this happened just after they heard screaming and crying in the house.

Brock’s Mother went over and knocked over and was greeted with the father who said everything was fine and when they saw the oldest son with a hint gash in his forehead and bleeding Brocks mother was obviously shocked but the father just said “He tripped” and closed the door.

There is more weird and downright bad things happening, more then I can fit in this post but one of the worst things happened today. The youngest came to school with a giant scab on her chest. When the teachers asked her what happened she explained that one of the sisters took a red hot fork and buried it into her chest. The parents didn’t even take her too the hospital.

I am legitimately worried for the kids safety and I don’t know what too do",12Jun2019,2
136,"Hello. I’m 20m living at home with my brother, mother and father. I love them SO much and I couldn’t ask for a better family. I was raised very religious in an organization that was very strict in terms of dating - you cannot date until you are ready for marriage (financially and emotionally I guess?) to keep this short, I can’t date anyone outside of our religion even though we don’t take part in it, they still cling to those standards. 


I have a huge career job lined up and if all goes well, I’ll be making very decent money - enough to sustain myself. I don’t know when I’ll get to that point, but I’m hoping it’s within the next year or two. My plan is to buy my own place, a comfortable one and not something out of desperation. I need my freedom as I’m very independent and I want to be able to enter the dating world at my leisure. I’ve had plenty of success with women in the past, but could never pursue anything because of the strictness. Am I in over my head? Part of me says I’m doing all this just to date but the other part of me is saying that I’m going to be getting an amazing job that is rewarding, beneficial to society and will help me reach my goal of independence. I love them to death, but I need that freedom that my soul yearns for. Thank you all in advance for any advice and alternate prospectives you can provide to me.",12Jun2019,1

I taught myself math and tested out of the basic math class, then I took advanced algebra (got an A), pre-calculus (got an A), and chemistry (got an A). I was pretty capable of teaching myself math. It was easy and fun. I was happy. 

Toward the beginning of this year I lost motivation for math and I still haven’t found out why. 

I decided to take a summer course to help me out and get ahead. I only took it because the professor was a really good one that everyone recommended.  First day of class. He didn’t show up, turns out with no one telling us we got a new professor. He has never taught before. Second day of class was okay, I gave him a chance. Third day of class. He doesn’t show up again.  Then he starts speeding through the course. It is too fast for me and I am not learning anything.

145,"This is my first time ever being a personal assistant and I just wanted to know if i’m being biased here. I started this job about 2 weeks ago and I do the basic assistant things like replying to emails, faxing paperwork, running errands,watering the plants, you get it. 

Lately my boss has been dropping hints that he would like me to clean and cook for him. He literally wants me to make him full meals, do his laundry, make his bed, deep clean his disgusting car, wash it, vacuum it, and he even told me he wanted me to write a BOOK for him. A whole ass book. I told him I refused to write a book for him and he told me I have no right to because, “you’re on the clock.” Excuse me? I understanding cleaning here and there when he’s out of town or even once in a while, but this would be a daily thing. The topic got changed and we moved onto something else. I’m not making a huge salary, I only get paid $12/hr and he expects that from me. 

He’s very inconsiderate in general. I was once driving him some place and a customer called and he handed me the phone so I can collect payment, WHILE I WAS DRIVING. Collecting payment includes paperwork, and a long breakdown of what they’re being billed for. He was sitting by me, doing nothing and still gave me the phone. Another example is he runs a moving company so he often has to go down to some sites and oversee the men, I get that. However, I also tag along with him. It would make sense if he’s just standing there and watching them while i’m by his side, but no, he moves with them. He goes in and out of the house, in the hot Floridian heat, and wants me to follow him like a lost puppy. At first he allowed me to stay in the car and do paperwork, contact customers, and communicate with the workers but now he wants me around him while he’s helping to move heavy furniture. It’s very risky since 75% of the guys he hires aren’t even professionals so things are all over the place and I simply don’t like being in their way while they’re hauling heavy objects!

146,"I (23y M) came to visit my mother and stepfather after work to chat a bit. After like 30 min the conversation touched the topic about my childhood and I started talking about the bad memories I had from that time and what she did to me.
Here's some things that I remembered:
She throw me into a pile of snow for crying in a store when I was 6y
She beat me with a wooden coat hanger until it broke for skipping school (10y)
My stepfather broke half of my toys for playing on his pc without permission (9y)
When I was gifted a pc he destroyed it half a year later for disobeying his order (12y)
My mother made me starve for 2 days for calling one of her dishes poison (11y) (I just didn't like it) 
She grabbed me by the hear and smashed my head on the table multiple times for skipping shool again (11y)
And just a lot of screaming at me for doing something that she didn't like
And this is just the thing from the top of my head. It got so bad that until I moved out (which was at 22y) when she passed behind me I would get shivers on my back and have genuine fear that she would hit me. So after all of that she asked me what was the point of this, that it's like I didn't have any good memories from that time which I replied that I genuinely don't. My whole childhood was a lot of abuse at home and bullying at school, so it's hard to remember anything good. After her hearing that I only have bad memories she became quiet and had a sad look in her eyes. We sat in silence for 10 minutes until I had to go home. I know she wasn't the best mother, but I don't hate her just the memories are ingrained into my head and her asking about the good times I had made me realise how shit my childhood was. I still have her face full of sadness before I left in front of me and it makes me feel unhappy. I know I shouldn't have said what I did but nothing can be done now. I just don't know what to do now and I have no one to ask at this time. Main question is that what should I do? Should I talk about it later and apologise for saying that?

150,"My best friend was molested recently - she was forcibly physically restrained, groped and touched. She and I are both 17. I had to pry out her admittance by asking her a bunch of questions that eventually led to her confessing the truth. 

This entire conversation originated when she said that her girl best friend was threatening to tell her guidance counselor about something that had happened, and she vented to me about how her friend was being completely unreasonable. 

I, in turn, asked her how bad it was that **her other best friend** felt the need to tell her counselor about it against her wishes. Her response was ""It wasn't that bad, but my friend thinks it's horrible. I'm over it anyway."" 

I ask: did it involve your parents?

""no.""

""did it involve a friend of yours?""

""not really.""

""did it involve somebody betraying your trust in general?""

""yeah, kind of.""

""did it involve a guy?""

""yeah.""

""were you guys communicative at all when this happened?""

""kind of.""

\- and so on and so forth until she finally tells me that she was alone with a guy (not by her own choosing) that she barely knew, but that she claims she saw around sometimes. She told me that this person touched her inappropriately and against her will, and had to forcibly restrain her in order to molest her. As far as I know, this event took place around a week ago, but our conversation regarding it only began tonight.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked her if she knew this person's name. She refused to tell me. I asked her where it happened. She refused to tell me, but I was finally able to narrow it down to either her house, the horse ranch where she works, or her school (after she said ""I don't wanna say"" instead of ""no, not there"" when I asked her if it had happened in any of those locations). I asked her how old he was. She refused to tell me. I asked her if she'd told her parents about the incident. She has not done so. The only two people who know what happened to her are her other best friend and myself. I asked if she was planning to file a police report against him. She said she was not going to. I asked her if she had blocked him on all forms of electronic communication, and she claimed that she's never communicated with him by phone or by using any form of social media. I explained to her that if he was able to catch her alone somewhere that he'd probably planned out the attack, and that by extension he most likely knew her walking/bus/subway routes to and from school, work, and her home. I explained to her that if she did not report the incident that he would be very, very likely to plan out another, worse attack (such as by forcing her to have penetrative or oral sex with him). I explained to her that she was very likely to be severely injured or murdered at the hands of this person. She said she was not worried about this, but she could not refute my logic and did not try to argue with the points I brought up. She appeared to be very nonchalant and unfazed regarding her and my discussion of the entire incident, and repeatedly insisted that the encounter was over and done with. She told me at least 15 times, ""I'll be fine, I'm okay, don't worry about me."" (famous last words, right?) I hope that she doesn't actually believe she is in the slightest bit safe or that this entire situation is in the past, and that she is merely using her denial of its volatility as a coping mechanism in order to minimize the undeniable and enormous trauma she has experienced at the hands of her molester. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have her mother's cellphone number, but absolutely zero identifying information regarding her attacker. I have contacted her other best friend in the hopes that she will be able to shed light on who this person is, because she is slightly emotionally closer to her than myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am wavering between two courses of action.

&amp;#x200B;

1. completely blindsiding my friend and getting her parents and the police involved for her own safety. I would rather her never speak to me again than have to attend her funeral or visit her in the hospital.
2. not saying anything to her parents, counselor, or police until I and her friend can convince her to report this incident to the authorities on her own, although I don't know what else I can say; seeing as how I have held nothing back from her in my take on the situation she is currently facing. My reasoning for this line of action is to give her a chance to process what's happened to her. Picking Option 1 may also cause her to retreat into her shell and deny that anything ever happened. However, leaving her unprotected leaves her at risk for another attack.

152,"Hi reddit... So I had to make a throwaway for this post because I had some people who would recognize who I am from my main account. 

This may sound silly but I genuinely need advice on what might be happening and what my next course of action should be. 

Some backstory... My ex and I ended our one year relationship a couple years ago. We are both happily in a new relationship and we haven’t contacted each other since the break up mostly because we ended in bad terms. Fast forward to a couple weeks ago I was awoken by several phone and FaceTime calls from a random number. I did not pick up because it was 3 in the morning and I had no idea who it was. After snooping around, I had discovered it was my ex and when I tried to ask why he called me, he proceeded to say horrible things about me and saying i’m spreading lies. Long story short, he said he never called me as he didn’t even have my new number. So I brushed it off as maybe a butt dial or his family. Whatever. 

Ever since that incident he has been calling me at all times of the day, I have always missed them mostly because I was in class or asleep. Then, the voicemails came. A bunch of voicemails were left because I never answered. All of them were complete gibberish and range in lengths. Still, I give the benefit of the doubt and since my name is usually on the top of contact lists, I presume they were all accidental. Keep in mind, he still claims he never made one phone call. 

Weird thing is, he was with mutual friends when those phone calls were made and they have all said that he never made any of those phone calls and has the logs to prove it. However, In respects to his girlfriend and my boyfriend, I block his number to prevent anymore phone calls, accidental or not. 

Fast forward again to today... I was cleaning up my phone and I notice my voicemail log has a ‘blocked message’ tab. I select it and they are ALL  his number, around 10 of them and all of the voicemails were gibberish. I understand if you butt dial me once or twice, but its almost everyday and he proves time and time again that his phone has no proof or any data whatsoever of him calling me. So if it’s not him, what is it? Why me? 

Thanks everyone

156,"So to start, I started working for ACE hardware as a salesperson, after 5 months I was promoted to assistant manager, after becoming assistant manager my work load got insane, found myself working 50-55 hours a week and only getting paid for 40, I made $18 an hour. No benefits, overpriced medical, no overtime pay, Also didn't get along with my bosses, however I absolutely loved all of my employees, 2 of which I would consider great friends who I love.

One Sunday I got extremely overwhelmed and upset and out of panic, I texted an old colleague saying if they were hiring at his company, he responded quickly, by the following Monday I had quit my job and started at the new company, things moved alot faster than I thought.

I now make $21 an hour, in 2 months I will have 2 weeks PTO, 1 week sick, 401k options, affordable medical, life insurance policy. I get lots of overtime which is time and a half, after including the time and a half I make roughly $200 more a week than I did before. And work alot less. Also the bosses are the kindest people I have ever met in my life. Needless to say this job is a major upgrade than simply making $18 an hour.

However I really miss my old co workers, and I'm not really clicking with any of my current co workers, maybe because I've only known them for a couple of weeks ? Also I thought I would stay in better touch with my old co workers but I havent really hung out with them for weeks, vs before we would hang out every night after work.

I knew it would happen, that if I quit we wouldn't hang out nearly as much, what with differing schedules, but it just really sucks and I can't stop thinking of them daily, and they were really my only friends, and I havent seen them in weeks.

I want to believe that over time that maybe I will click with my current co workers better/ miss my old co workers less, but it's just hard to grasp. I know I will hang out with old co workers still but it sucks going from seeing them every day to seeing them once a month.

\- Any suggestions from me with regards to how to improve work efficiency are quickly shot down by Richard and there are other colleagues (let's call him Sam) who are super close with this person so they all agree with him as well.

\- Today we had a meeting about suggestions for the organization so I have included my concerns. Not only was I quickly shot down but I was met back with a personal ridicule, which seems to stem from the fact that any suggestions are perceived as personal attacks.

160,"Hello! Obligatory throwaway because I'm all about anonymity &amp; sorry for crappy formatting I'm on mobile.

Tldr; familial issues hurt my self image and confidence and the lack of familial support isn't helping. I want help in rebuilding myself to be healthier and create better relationships

So some backstory..:
I'm 16F with a sister (19F) living with my mom and her boyfriend. Theyre both pretty uninvolved other than punishing me for doing something wrong. I'm also afraid of her boyfriend because he creeps me out. My parents divorced when I was about 6 or 7 and I haven't had therapy to cope with it. Because of these events, I stopped exercising and playing sports and became a huge nerd, which is fine except I don't feel satisfied with any relationships I have.

Making friends online is a breeze. I feel more confident because I can be whoever I feel like online without being judged on my looks. I've even had quite a lot of boyfriends, none of which were ever fulfilling because I feel like the lack of irl contact sucks. I always felt like I had to do things to feel appreciated and I've fell into predatory acts (which doesn't help me become more approachable or confident) because of it. 

My problem:
Despite having this many relationships, I still feel lonely and empty. I long to create this many relationships irl. Looking on Instagram and Snapchat realizing that I sometimes act copycat of a girl I'm not even close friends with snapped me to this realization. I don't even have people constantly liking, commenting, or snapping me. It makes me feel like I'm a very unattractive horrible person but deep down I know it's just because I don't have bonds with anyone I know irl.

I prefer to play video games (mostly league of legends and MMOs) and draw (insert shameless plug here!) and if I get invited some, I'm either very awkward or boring because I'm not interested or I'm on my phone trying to talk to my internet friends, or I just say ""Uh.. sorry. I'm busy."" But I'm really not busy; just uninterested. 

I wish there were more 'introverted extrovert' clubs (not saying extroverts don't play video games!) for people that aren't interested in stuff like sports or movies, but there aren't so I'm just thrown into school without any basic interests with anybody, hoping they speak to me despite my inability to discuss anything that isn't debate, morality, psych, science, art or video game related.

Last issue, I've got a bad problem with having bad crushes on some guys and really wanting to date them, but that just makes me immobilized and very awkward in an almost creepy or unwelcoming way if they ever interact with me. 

Thank you for reading my 6(?) Paragraph essay about the deepest darkest hells inside my head, summed up in a few paragraphs, friendly internet stranger! But, my question still stands; How can I have better self confidence (without relying on others approvals) and create better friendships?",12Jun2019,2
161,"Hello everyone! 

I recently moved in with my best friend of 8 years. My old lease was ending and she had just split with her child’s father and was kinda struggling paying rent alone. She asked me if i’d move in with her for the year to make things easier for her. I was super hesitant at first as she has a 2 year old but after setting some ground rules and finding a house big enough to have personal space I agreed... huge mistake. 

I have my own business and work from home, so I need alone time and quiet... I thought that would be no problem considering she works but once we moved here she quit her day job and only works on weekends which means her and the kid are home 24/7 making insane amounts of noise. She’ll come into my office and bring her kid when i’m trying to get stuff done, her kid will make an absolute mess of my workspace, scream, throw stuff and she says nothing. I tried talking to her about it but it doesn’t seem to click. 

She also sold her car to save money since she quit her day job and now expects me to drive her everywhere considering I work from home. She takes her kid to the fathers once a week to visit and it’s about a hour ride, she now relays on me to drive her every week there and back because she has no other way. 

There’s also no alone time with her, if i creep up to my room she ask me why I don’t want to spend time with her, or she’ll just come up, open my door, and sit in there with me. We’re complete opposite in the fact that I love being alone and she can’t be alone, no matter how many hints i throw at her about it bugging me they go over her head. 

The house is almost completely overrun with her and her kids stuff, I only have 2 rooms that are MINE and only mine and they still get invaded. I feel like i’m living in a jail within my own house. I feel like i’m going insane and I guess I’m just looking for some advice or if any of you had a similar experience moving in with a friend... there’s 9 months left on our lease and I honestly don’t think i’m going to make it at this rate if something doesn’t change.",12Jun2019,2

165,"I've been looking for a job since leaving college last year, and I've had no luck. I have a feeling that it may have something to do with an apprenticeship i was a part of. Here's what happened.

&amp;#x200B;

While at a career academy, I was approached by an instructor and the principal of the academy in regards to an apprenticeship with four major manufacturing companies. They spoke to me, and they spoke to my mom about it. I was not interested in it in the slightest, but then they said ""10 dollars an hour"" and I got very excited as a 17 year old, as 17 year olds do, when promised a large amount of money. So I decided to do the apprenticeship, because I wanted cash. This led to possibly the worst 3 years of my life, as I pursued a degree I couldn't stand, because I didn't want to look like a quitter. Why was this the worst 3 years? Because after three sites of being told to go stand in the back and stay out of the way, being given countless filing jobs, cleaning out a closet, and not learning ANYTHING that had anything to do with my degree, for three months at a time. Basically ""Stay out of the way, don't get hurt"" work. At my last site, I found my (then) friend ""Brian"" who was a slacker. An awful slacker. He'd literally just stay inside the shipping office or just wander around. Here comes the interesting part.

&amp;#x200B;

Brian had been at that site for two sessions. Six months. He was being held back because the hr for the next site left. Since HR was the only person able to give us the go ahead to the next site, he just stayed at the one site! So I think nothing of it, and continue what I do-actual work this time, as I got moved to a different part of the plant. 10 hour days being logged, 30 hrs a week, 300 bucks a week before tax was delicious to a then 19 year old. I go to leave the plant, and I check in with hr to pick up my last check and I make it a point to ask her, ""Do I just wait like normal for the call to the last site? I know there's no hr there"" and she just says ""yes, just wait for the next site"" and smiled, so I smiled back and proceeded to wait a month. That's when I called her back, got no answer, and called the hr rep who was at my \*second\* site to learn that she had just told them that I was fired, and that I slacked off, and did absolutely no work (reasoning for the firing). That was a LIE, and I think it may have had something to do with them not being prepared, or that hr rep not liking me (she later got the hr job at the site i was to transfer to)? I'm not sure. I was kicked out of the program with no recourse, even after repeated emails and things, I was stranded with a degree I fucking hated and no job. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have these jobs on my resume. Should I remove them, and forget they happened? Do you think they would badmouth me to cover their own asses and could they be ruining my chances for a job? Is there a way for me to get a job from right now, within a month? I'm looking for something retail. Please Help.

He didn’t wanna cuddle. He didn’t really talk.

I’m used to my ex always wanting to talk and text and call and this guy doesn’t do that, yet he has mentioned what I would like at our wedding one day and he said he would forever be there for me. 

He seems distant and reserved like he can’t actually let me in and he seems distracted when we are together.

Cries when he has almost lost me. Hangs out with my friends and drives them around. We hang out for hours and hours on the weekend and play games or watch tv. Calls me his girl. Says we are dating. Says I am his babe.

He has never said I love you to me. He said he takes things slow so he doesn’t get hurt and he doesn’t wanna burn through potential mates too quickly without actually getting to know them. I left him before so I’m sure he won’t try and say I love you first. Well I don’t wanna waste my time.

I decided to text a friend of mine to ask if we could meet up and talk. I was really just planning on vocalizing my issue and after having said it all, realized how stupid I was being and go with what was better long term (which is what I have ultimately decided upon). It was around 10pm and she’s not at all a night person, so I can’t say I was really expecting a response.

The issue I’m having now is that for years I’ve been there for her whenever she needed me, never needing anything myself. I’ve given up sleep and time with a girl I loved to make sure she was ok. We were close and I care about her. She texted me in the morning to apologize because she was asleep.

There was literally no possible way she could have responded, nor should she have had to. I figured things out on my own, but for whatever reason I feel so hurt by this. I know it’s completely unreasonable and I’m upset at myself for it, but I still feel like she hurt me. 

I wasn’t sure what I was going to do about all that, and just hadn’t responded to her yet, as I was considering just kind of disappearing for a little while. However, about an hour ago she texted me about her current relationship situation and how she’s feeling about it all. I just scanned through everything so I don’t know exactly what’s going on, but part of me wants to help. The rest of me though, wants to just ignore it all for a little while.

186,"Hey what’s up guys, so recently I’ve been really interested in huffing gasoline. I figured that it could be a pretty healthy way to cut back on my caffeine consumption, and considering how easy it is to get your hands on some automotive fuel why not just go for it! The only problem is I’m not completely familiar with the act of gas-huffing. I met a guy at Cracker Barrel the other night who was explaining how he went about the act. He said that he would start up his lawn mower and siphon the gas out by sticking one end of a tube in the lawn mower’s gas tank, and the other end of the tube down his wind pipe, so it would pump the gas directly into his lung (he lost his second lung in a roller derby incident). Any-who, I tried that but couldn’t seem to fit the tube into my windpipe, and ended up swallowing half a tank of gas (I’ll have to keep practicing that technique). The other method I know about was introduced to me this morning by a friend of mine. We were lying in bed together talking about some stuff when I asked about his knowledge of huffing gasoline. He explained to me that he uses a method where you take an old pair of underwear that you don’t want anymore, then soak it in a Jerry can of gasoline overnight, then you take it out, stuff your face DEEP into it, and inhale like a mother-flipper. He let me try this with one of his old pair of undies (because I don’t have any), and I have to say it was pretty lackluster. He explained that that pair was soaked in diesel fuel, so the effect might not be the same as huffing regular gasoline, but he’s soaking some more tonight for me.

189,"I’m a 24 F and my boyfriend is 27 M. I love him very much and he’s treated me better than anyone else has. We’ve been together for a year and a couple of months and I can see this going the distance, so to speak. He doesn’t make a lot of money with his job but is taking classes to further his career right now. I make decent money and have graduated with a full-time job.

Being a twentysomething, I often stress about money and the future. I still live with my parents and often express this to them. I pay for everything myself (besides rent — blessed to leave here for free). Recently, when I’m venting about my job, or buying a house someday, or getting married or maybe having kids, their response has been, “Well then marry a rich man.” This feels like a knife twisting into my gut. I don’t want to be with anyone else, and it hurts. I told them, “That upsets me when you say that, please stop.” They only responded with, “K.” Obviously, they’re saying indirectly to not marry my boyfriend. 

If I were my parents, I would want my daughter to be happy and to be treated well — that would be the priority. When they say that, it makes me feel like money is more important than my well-being. I’ve been ignoring them when they make the “rich man comment” and I have only spoken out recently. Reddit, what should I do if this keeps continuing? 

I should also note that this all started within the past month and things with my parents and him were going great before then. I honestly have no idea what happened. My aunt (mom’s sister) has always judged my boyfriend’s career and even called him “Rancho trash” (where he’s from). I don’t know if she got to talking to my parents? 

My boyfriend knows that they’ve made these comments a couple of times but not to the full extent that they do. I don’t want to upset him. I have faith in him that he’ll be successful.",12Jun2019,1

They are refusing to give me any communication device (no phone) so all I have are my emails I can access at the local library.

At face value, it seems perfect for me, but I’m suspicious. There’s got to be a reason they offer good pay and still invite a ton of people to apply. I had to look them up online to figure out just what they do, which I’m skeptical about too. Why wouldn’t they describe their positions in the letter if working there is so great?

194,"I am roughly 6'4"" whenever I meet someone new or talk with family they always begin with something along the lines of ""wow, how tall are you?"" It has been on my mind a lot recently. (alt-account because I don't want anyone I know to ever read this)

&amp;#x200B;

For example, whenever I am around my extended family the first thing they always say is ""Oh my gosh you're so tall."" It makes me feel bad. I don't like being singled out in the first place, I have big problems with social anxiety, but when they all single me out for the same reason it makes me anxious. No. It makes me feel like they don't care about who I am as a person, I feel like they only care about what I am rather than who I am.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents are very nice people and are the best I could ever imagine, we have a great relationship. My only real problem with them is whenever they introduce me to someone they always comment on how tall I am or about the size of my feet. In my mind they are just trying to single me out from others, show how I am special, why I stand out in the crowd. 

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, whenever I am eating with family or family friends they always say ""oh my god, are you only having one plate?"" ""are you sure you don't want more?"" I know it's coming from good intentions and they don't realize that it makes me feel bad, as a matter of fact, all of these things come from good intentions, they just make me feel bad, I don't like being singled out.

&amp;#x200B;

196,"I was a D2 student at a dental school but was dismissed due to poor academic performance, due to a few medical issues I was facing (severe anxiety and panic attacks, a pre-existing metabolic disorder, and resurfacing of rape trauma due to a sexual assault case in my apartment building).

199,"Hello Reddit! I don't post very often so sorry about formatting. I am a little anxious right now as I am trying to solve an issue. I will try to Tl/DR or whatever at the bottom if I am up to it but here it goes. 

I just went on a trip with a group of friends. To Americas's Roller Coast. It was  great trip. But, Mid way through I get a message let us call him Adam. Adam sends me a message request on Facebook. I don't know him so I just say no and move on. Well Adam wants to contact me so bad he tries to follow me on Instagram and other social medias probably. Well I didn't know that Adam was a recent ex of my friend let us say Jordan. Jordan on the ride home decided to ask us hey is Adam trying to message you guys on social media. I know that name he tried to talk to me. And I blocked him. Well I found out Adam think he and Jordan are still together and that Jordan is sleeping with every guy friend on this trip. (Not true lol.) Well on the way home I heard he threatened to come to my job to beat me to Jordan. Jordan is getting huge text messages from him and as all of us friends of her's have told her to stop messaging Adam she still does and was even video chatting him just a little bit ago. He is a textbook controller and harasser. But, why I am asking for advice is I messaged him since he would not stop sending me requests. Now I have the evidence He knows where I work and would do harm to me. (I will clip the whole conversation.) What do I do? do I report it to the police? Since I guess I did provoke will they do anything. I should say I have never met the guy and know nothing of him except my friend Jordan told him everything about our friend group. Any advice will work. Jordan has mountains of chats of Adam blowing up her phone if needed but, I am tired of being threatened by someone I haven't even met. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also yeah probably fucked up provoking him in the first place but, I felt I needed to do something as he was threatening me through Jordan still up until an hour ago.  I just set up and went on the trip. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL/DR: Girl Friend not girlfriend on trip with me and 7 other friends all mix guys and girls and crazy ex starts harassing us over social media. I have proof he knows where I work and threatened me. What do I do.

201,"I am known to have mental illness by my employers and have had a few days off this year. They have not once (apart from one, one time in my employment, who isn’t even my manager) approached me to check on me or ask if I need support. I think sometimes it is clear that I am having a tough day (it doesn’t affect my work but I am sometimes quiet and avoid break rooms and things due to anxiety, I don’t mean I’m having full breakdowns at work), and other colleagues pick up on this and support me but my manager has never checked in just to see if everything is OK.

On Monday, my mental illness became so severe that I was hospitalised. I emailed my manager out of courtesy just to say that I wouldn’t be in for a few days because I am in hospital. I was vague but still shared that I am very unwell. 

This email was completely disregarded and I haven’t received even a ‘thanks for letting me know’ to the point where I had to ask my ex husband to call in sick for me just in case they hadn’t read it - to which they responded that they know. I know it had been received and read, and emails about more trivial matters have been bounced around by management to the staff team.

I felt so guilty and unworthy that I begged and begged my doctor, said my symptoms are fine and discharged myself from hospital as I was so anxious that my absence from work has gotten me into trouble and I need to go back. 

I am not at all well enough for work but felt so uncomfortable with the way it was handled that I no longer felt able to take more time off for fear that I am being judged. I feel like a number in the office, like I am not valued as a person and like I am not supported properly by my employers. 

Am I justified in feeling this way, or am I over-reacting? How can I mention this to my manager and request that they be more supportive without it looking like I’m throwing a tantrum?",12Jun2019,2

fast forward to the first week of june. i got home from my honeymoon and was going to be moving back to my summer job soon. five days before i thought i would be ready for work, i emailed the store as a continuation of a previous thread and let them know what date i would be back (june 10th).

a few days went by with no reply. that’s okay, i thought. i don’t mind a few extra days with my husband before we start work. then june 10th came and went. i emailed again, to a different address i found on their website, to let them know i was back in town and settled. that was almost two days ago and i still have had no reply.

is this normal?? i’ve had pretty odd jobs up to this point so i’m not quite sure what to expect. as i mentioned earlier, i have lots of anxiety so i typically assume the worst. please be honest if i’m overreacting - it’s hard for me to tell sometimes.

215,"Background- This is an alt. Just on the off chance someone actually remembers my main. 

I’m one of a handful of newbies (three) in a trade job. I’m also one of the youngest (second to youngest on our particular crew). I don’t have a ton of experience, and I’m learning. 

Coworker in question has been with the company a long time, and he’s worked in this trade for even longer. He’s usually pretty happy go lucky in how he acts, he works hard, easy to get along with if you just met him. He also has a habit of throwing insults in to people while laughing so it sounds like whatever issue he’s having isn’t actually serious, or that he’s just giving the other person shit. Sometimes it’s blatantly obvious that he’s pissed at you, sometimes not. He’s also known to enjoy spreading gossip and drama. He doesn’t pull his shit with people he doesn’t directly work with, so a lot of outside company people like him. I get why, he’s likable if you don’t piss him off. 

I work a position with either a lot of downtime, a lot of solitary (without other direct coworkers) time or both. Today, I had the rare time of not having to listen in on the CB because I didn’t have one and being in a quieter part of the site. Just got some new Bluetooth headphones and decided to take advantage and listen to music while I did my job. My phone dies *quick* though, and dead phone means no music. Which, I liked the music. So on one of his passes by, I asked him to charge my phone in his truck while he drove around for awhile so I could listen more throughout the shift later. The music had precisely zero effect on my job. 

Thus came the lecture. *My* generation just has no clue. He would have been fired if he’d *ever* taken out his phone. I’m just so *young*, I won’t get it. (Insert to add, he’s constantly on his phone talking while driving. Which I don’t give two shits about because it’s not my business). When I asked for the phone back a bit later, he sneakily said “oh yeah, you need your *lifeline*”. I just told him it was a super weird hill he’d chosen to die on over this, but whatever and walked away. Whatever he was bitching about when I walked away I didn’t hear, and I’m sure that pissed him off more. We didn’t talk rest of the day. On my way out he passed me and (while talking about tomorrow with a boss on the radio) said “oh yeah, maybe I’ll just sit on my ass on my phone all day! *laughs*”. They’re really close friends, so I’m completely sure he told this boss his version of events too. He’d convinced I sat for hours at a time on Facebook or YouTube. 

I looked at my screen time. In three hours, my screen was on four minutes total. Another hour, it was on 4 seconds. Two other hours it was on six and eight minutes each respectively. Couple other hours it was on less than 5 minutes combined within those hours. I checked a text a couple times, got pissed at Siri and manually changed a song a couple times and checked the weather. 

He’s jumping my ass because of his bullshit assumption, shit talking me about it behind my back to people I respect and can learn a lot from, and he’s in a position every now and then where he can make my long shifts miserable. He’s the higher man on the totem pole, I’m not. 

I don’t know what to do and how to respond where it’ll shut him down on his bullshit without adding even more drama. I see these people more than I see my own family and that’s too much to deal with a guy who acts like a drama queen as much as he does. But it’s an amazing job with an overall amazing crew that I can learn a ton from, and I got lucky to even get it and then be called back for another year. I don’t want one person ruining it.

Paul doesn't have a job.
Paul has never made a resume.
Paul graduated high school.
Paul doesn't intend to go to school.

He will bombard my mom for a task, and shebdoesnt deliver he doesn't listen to he the entire day.
He'll say, ""You're useless.""

Honestly, I think it's a lot of pent up emotions from the divorce, the abuse and constant isolation and Paul has never talked about it with anyone.
He copes with his computer trying to run away. And I've learned how to work with kids like him.  But I think my relationship to him (as my little brother) may impair assessing this issue with an impartial perspective.

He was used to insulting me with his older brother and dad but once they left he got surrounded by mom and I. And ever since, he's closing himself more and more. I'm concerned that he was in a bad place and now just kinda got stuck there. 

Don't get me wrong, I want to like hit him with a sandal like I was taught but I am not about that.
I totally have some resentment towards him. He's hurt me, and my mom. And I think he's equating strength to power and since he's hurt us, I could totally see it that way. I could say a lot of foul statements but I've worked through it. I wanted to end this violent cycle and I solved it with a lot of therapy and peer support.

220,"So, a few days ago I flew over to North Carolina to take care of a trial against this bastard who was manipulating my younger sister. Long story short, he had convinced her to not only stop taking her anti-psychotics (she suffers from depression and anxiety) whenever they were together, but he would always have an excuse that would have her steal money or objects from our family. This ended up with over 5k going missing from when they first met. However, since it was her doing all the stealing, and he was crafty in making sure he couldn't have anything placed on him, we couldn't take him to court on anything.

I had to leave for other reasons since then, hence why I had to fly back. we tried our damnedest to at the very least get the restraining order filed, but after 3 hours of debate, the judge dismissed our case. Everyone that was involved in the hearing, being me and my parents, were devastated. I eventually flew back to where I currently reside, and since then, I haven't been able to feel happy. I didn't notice it at first, as I myself suffer from Cyclic disorder, and have days that are generally up and days that are generally down, but this down period has been lasting a hell of a lot longer than usual. I guess in the end, the advice I'm asking for is, should I tell my parents and see if they can fund me seeing a psychiatrist over here (What's stopping me from doing this is I feel really guilty asking for money from my parents since I'm trying to live on my own, but I've been having difficulties finding a source of income), or see if this is just an unusually long down period catalysed by the shit show that was the hearing?",12Jun2019,2

224,"Hey amigos and amigas of Reddit.
I really need some advice on whether I should break up with my boyfriend. I’ve known him for about 10 months and I would describe our relationship as “unconventional”. The most we’ve done is hug, nothing more, nothing less. I’m perfectly fine with that since I would prefer to fall in love rather that fall on someone’s lap. The only problem is I don’t know if he feels the same way. Sometimes I message him and he leaves me on read or he doesn’t open my message for hours, which obviously makes me feel like a second thought. I kind of understand since he’s not addicted to his phone, which I’m very envious of lol. He used to leave me on read for hours and I mean hours lol. Like about 8 hours without a reply and I told him about my concerns and he’s way better now. Idk lol. Sometimes I get a feeling as if he doesn’t feel the same way that I do. He never asked me to be his boyfriend and I never asked him...we both kind of just agreed that we were an item and just went with it. For our anniversaries I always get him a small gift and he has never reciprocated. I’m perfectly fine with not getting a gift, but idk if I should take it as a sign. I hang out with him once a week, but our days are Tuesday and Friday. As of today, we haven’t hanged out on a Tuesday in almost 2 months and I completely understand since he was scheduled to work but he finally got Tuesday off (yesterday) and he didn’t make any plans with me. Also, our “dates” are always less than 3 hours so I basically see him for 3 hours a week. I would love to hangout with him more but I always feel like he’s just going to say no. Which I understand since he’s an introvert but it makes me feel kind of icky when other couples are hanging out all day multiple times a week and I get to speak to him for maybe 40 minutes a week. When we do hangout we are usually at a movie and then leave so that’s why I only speak to him for 40ish minutes a week. I really like him a ton but idk. I get this feeling as if he’s giving me hints that he wants me to dump him. This is my first relationship so I don’t know if I’m just scared to dump him or something. There have been many times when I’ve contemplated on breaking up with him or simply waited hours and hours for him to give me a cue that we’re hanging out on Friday’s or Tuesday’s. Idk what to do lol. Plz send advice or some opinions.",12Jun2019,1

228,"Im 22 and have a good paying job so this is absolutely reasonable. My father will frequently scream at me and curse me out over the smallest things. We just got a puppy as a family and hes screaming and cursing that the dog pooped in the house. I opened a popcorn bag in my room, three rooms over, and he came in screaming and cursing that I woke him up. He smashed my light too. Hes horribly rude to my mom and has said things I wouldnt even feel comfortable repeating. That really makes my skin crawl. My biggest problem is if i move out my mom will be alone with him. Honestly thats a fate i wouldnt wish on anyone. My sister has already moved out because she said our home was toxic. My mom would chose us kids in a second over my dad. That would mean she has to get a job; shes nearing retierment age. Entering the work force at this age would leave  her little hope of retirement. Shes made it clear to me that the only reason she stays with him is that he provides for the family. So all things considered should I move out? It will likley be the catalyst for their divorce. At the same time hes a big man child i really hate dealing with. Eventually im gonna move out and my parents will likely split after. Am i just delaying the inevitable my staying?

229,"To start off, I wasn't always shy. I was very outgoing when I was much younger. However because I had a tendency to always speak my mind and it would get me in trouble sometimes in class, something I'd be teased about, and I became much more quiet. Although I was pretty well liked, I feel like it was around middle school where I became very introverted and my relationships with kids around me pretty much changed.

So in middle school I still had a lot of friends, but because I'm pretty type-A and perfectionistic, (a trait that I still hold today), it can be pretty alienating. It also didn't help that I was pretty much the ugly kid during this time too. I was made fun of for being the fat girl with the unibrow/mustache so basically most of the boys would tease me. The other girls in my grade were nice for the most part, however things really changed in high school.

High school was where the comments got worse. Especially for the last three things. l I lost a ton of weight after one of the girls made a comment about my ""flabby arms"" and things changed. I changed high schools for one due to the school I was at being lower ranked, and at my new school, things changed. The guys were super nice to me, and I found that the girls started being more backhanded. Keep in mind, although I did have, and still have, a group of friends that I'm very close to. I found that a lot of my friendships with girls typically ended with them ""using me so they wouldn't be alone."" I also found that my group of friends is much smaller due to this. I also found that I became extremely shy during this time. I was so confident and able to look people in the eye and speak in a loud and clear voice until all of these happened. Now, its like whenever I talk to anyone, I talk so softly and its like I seek validation from everyone so much more than adhering to my own values. Almost as if I'm filtering myself because I know if I'm myself I'll just be hurt again because the pattern of bullying. I'm also not sure if its just my personality, or sheer dumb luck that I keep attracting toxic people.

The main reason I'm asking r/advice is for help on what to do in order to regain my old confidence and be more likable. I actually just went through a similar following out with my current friend group (although the only thing we really had in common was the fact that we live in the same dorm), and I don't know what to do.

I know that being type-A/perfectionistic at the level I'm at is off-putting, if not isolating. (I think the most common thing I heard growing up is that I'm too involved in school and academics.) But I just want to be able to make more friends, or at the very least learn ways in which I could be less unlikeable. Thank you so much!",12Jun2019,2
230,"I ve been at an unpaid internship for a local congressman for 3 weeks now. I was hoping to get relevant experience in my field as a political science major, but it’s turned into a nightmare. Our office has take on so many interns that I am assigned to tasks now like vacuuming, cleaning, and hanging out picture frames. After I while I realized I was the only one still doing it, and the other interns were assigned to actual projects. Eventually my office manger assigned me to letter writing, but I realized she hates me. Every little mistake I make because of stuff she never explained she yelled at me in front of everyone. I had it the other day because the office manager had me call the DC office to explain a file we had put into the system different, but the lady I called refused to speak to me and said email her. This process was hard to explain via text, I did my best being new to it. Then the lady complained and called my office manger instead of asking me about it. I got yelled at again, his was again infront  of the other interns. The other interns have caught on and avoid talking to me, also kinda talking down to me, like one offered to dial a number for me in a condescending tone because I am apparently that stupid. This is really hurting my mental health (I stuff from depression that honestly isn’t really controlled) I come home every day really depressed.

235,"I’ve been in a relationship for 2 and a half years with a man I feel is the one for me. The problem is... I feel like all of the passion is gone, and that he’s completely disinterested but I can’t tell if a lot of it (or all of it) is just in my head.. 

Long story short, I’ve been unemployed for a year due to familial issues and the money I bring in is a lot less, I’ve also gained weight and my anxiety/depression is at an all time high. We’ve also gone through a miscarriage and after that incident we havent been intimate on the same level in a very long time. We hardly do anything and it’s mostly because I don’t want to, but there’s been times it has been due to him not being able to.. for lack of better words, stay erect. It made me feel even more inadequate and like I am not enough for him. I mean, I can’t even get his rocks off for him, what good am I? 

Lately I’ve been getting a lot worse. I’m sleeping for 12-16 hours a day and we hardly spend time together. When we do, it’s really fun, and feels the same as it always does. But I’ve been feeling like there is a silent distance, and he absolutely never tells me when something is wrong. I have to find out myself if there is, and he’s really good at hiding his emotions.. I’ve asked him to be honest with me if/when there are any issues, but hardly anything ever comes up and we never so much as argue. I’ve heard from a lot of people that if you don’t fight in a relationship at all, there’s something wrong.. I don’t want to believe that, but now I’m wondering if the passion has never fully been there to begin with. 

I love him more than anything, but I hate feeling like this. I hate feeling like I’m not enough and I hate thinking this way. Is it all in my head? What kind of signs should I be looking for? I am truly doing my best to get back on my feet as I used to be when we met. I just applied to a ton of jobs and even back to my old well paying job as well. I’ve been losing weight and trying to better myself, not just for him. Is this just a normal thing that every relationship deals with? A disconnect/trouble with communication?

237,"A childhood best friend of my wife and I is in trouble. While trouble isn't unusual for her, we feel like this time is different. 

In the past she would moonlight as a stripper in hard times, which of course comes with all the pitfalls of that lifestyle. All while raising children. And despite her obvious flaws and faults, her kids have turned out as wonderful people. Truly great kids, and in overwhelmingly large part due to her parenting and difficult decisions. 

Her past shouldn't matter in my seeking advice, but because it matter, she was also raised in foster care mostly with an absent substance abusing parent. She had kids when she was 16. Twins. She's experienced homelessness before, but not after she had her kids.

That is, until she moved to Utah. Her new husband and her were both on the path to recovery. But things fell apart, and what was typically a phase or a long bender turned into a full blown addiction to meth.

Her kids are in the care of some nice people that became good friends with them before things got bad. They met through the Mormon church, and we've been in touch with the kids plenty of times the past few months. They're teenagers now, and we're probably they're closest relatives at this point. We know they're safe, and have been keeping tabs on their mother through them.


Until recently, where she had a few brush ups with the law, and started using meth. 

It didn't take long for her to look like a shell of herself. And she wants to get clean. But right now, she's homeless.

And she told my wife today she was sexually assaulted by two guys since her and my wife spoke last. And the person who's couch she was going to crash on started making sexual advances towards her last night, completely unexpectedly.

I have kids myself (our kids are the same age). I cannot help her yet, and not while she's using.

I don't even think expecting someone to get clean before they have a place to live is even reasonable. Housing and safety first.

I need some advice about: 

- women's shelters in the area (Salt Lake/Ogden area).
- recovering from meth addiction. Rock bottom is something I'm familiar with, but if the withdrawals will kill her I need to seek services for her that can help.
- how to be supportive from afar. I love this person. And they've not done me harm, ever. With my kids approaching college, my wife and I would be more than happy to take her in and help her recover (two normal functioning compassionate adults). But I can't put my kids at risk even inadvertently. If one of us flying out there to help her get started will increase the chances of her recovery being successful we would gladly do so and have means to. And even though sending money is a terrible idea in almost every circumstance, I'd gladly buy some grocery store coupons so she can eat, or something... 
- how she can stay safe sleeping rough

Any and all advice on how I can best help my loved one in need would be greatly appreciated.

238,So I recently just started a job. I’ve needed a job and looked for one for a while and was finally offered one and I was happy about it unit a few days ago. So I’ve been working this job and have been hit on a lot in just my first two weeks and I’m in a long term committed relationship so I just don’t have any interest in anyone else. I just ignored it and went on my way but then one of the managers for the place I work at has been trying to talk to me a lot. Asking me if I’m married and my interests and stuff. I’ve told him yes I am and my only interest is working and making a living that’s it. I like for my personal life to stay private at work. Well he didn’t get the hint. He kept trying to talk to me and making little comments which have made me uncomfortable. Well another manager had asked me if I was interested in doing some other work in the area with this guy and I told her no and what he has been saying and that it has made me uncomfortable. She said I was just being dramatic and shouldn’t think too much into it because he has a woman. I was like whatever. Well that same day he comes up and is just really rude to me and this happened after I seen the manager I told was uncomfortable to talking to him. She obviously told him what i said and instead of him being a decent person and apologizing or just leaving me alone he has taken it personal and is now just being rude. I need a job and I was excited about this job but now I’m uncomfortable being there and i really don’t want to go back. All I wanted was to work and make a living and that’s it. I’m worried if I go back he is just going to keep on and I really don’t want to have to deal with people like that anymore. I’ve delt with men being like that in the past but now I’m older and just don’t want to have to worry about what’s going to happen when I go to work. My husband thinks it isn’t a big deal and that I should go to another manager about it. I’m new so even if I did the chances are they would just get rid of me instead of getting rid of someone who has been with the company for a long time plus the first manager told me I was dramatic and that it wasn’t a big deal. I am currently looking for another job but I don’t know what to do. I need a job but if I go back I’m going to be stuck dealing with this nonsense now.

252,"I just don’t know anymore. I’ve been living with the quiet regret of not blowing my brains out a couple years ago, but had grown to accept that I probably won’t ever go through with it.  Now I got a whole ass life to live. Great. Not really what I want, but I kinda have to. 

Anyways, on living life: I have no sense of direction other than wanting to be a rich motherfucker so I can do what I want and be secure. I really don’t care what I do, I just want money to travel (hello escapism) and buy frivolous shit to fill the void in my soul. The thing is, I don’t really have passion for anything. I was originally going to be a nurse but that’s not me. Thought about switching to medical imaging to follow the money, but I really don’t give a fuck about that. Well shit, I only just completed 2 years of community college and based my entire education in high school on biology and medicine because my whole family is in nursing and I had never been talked to about other careers. Still makes me spineless for not choosing my own career path, but whatever. Turns out I don’t like those, I’m just good at it. So what’s a now major-less, community college shithead like me to do? Computer science kinda interests me and it makes that bank which I’m following just as some semblance of seeking a worthwhile goal. 

But I just don’t wanna do any of it. I wish I ceased being years ago. Life bores the hell out of me. The career, responsibilities, and obligations just fill me with dread. I don’t care enough about anything to make a career, much more my own life. But I won’t kill myself either, not yet at least. 


I just… I don’t know anymore. I’m already feeling crushed my life at the ripe age of 20. I’ve done the therapy off and on for 6 years, I’ve had medication, I’m going through my traumas and psyche with self help books, but I just don’t want anything. I don’t care about my hobbies anymore (fish keeping, plants,  and watercolor).  I’m going through my life based on obligation and stupid shit that brings me some joy like video games- of which don’t bring much joy anymore. The only thing I really do is hang with my best friend whom I love very much and have maladaptive daydreams of a life I wish I had. 

Do y’all have any advice on how to unfuck my shit? I know I need to get better, but I think I’m almost tired of trying. I’m just trying to reach out before I entirely burn out.

253,"Hey everybody, sorry for formatting since I'm on mobile.

So to give a bit of background I'm a computer science major on my last year of school. I've been doing an internship in a startup since September of last year and I've had a couple talks with my boss in which I reviewed the company and he gave me feedback. 

In most of this reviews being the newbie that I am I talked mostly positive things and affirmed him that I would love to get a full time job there since I loved what they were doing and such, we also discussed payment and given my lack of knowledge at the time I settled for a  lower sum than the rest of the market.

Fast forward to now and I'm very close to sign a contract within the next month, but since I did some research I decided to go and do some other job interviews to see what other things were out there. I got accepted in another company that looked like we shared the same principles and the pay was significantly higher.

So right now I feel like it would be a bit of a dick move if I took this other job given that I've told my former company that I was very happy with them and would love to work for them. On the other hand I think that I would grow much more as a professional in the second company.

Thanks in advance for any advice!",12Jun2019,2
254,"     i am 19 years old female(almost 20) and my father is really suffocating because he never wants me to leave the house. He gets really weird when I ask if I can go out he usually yells at me, or he tells me I need to stay home more often- even though I never go out. I’m not allowed out after maybe 10 pm, even during the summer and if I do go out he watches me from a window upstairs from the time I leave the front door until I get into the car and drive off. It’s really infuriating because I have to decline going out with my friends or going to parties because I know he would never let me go and it makes me lose friends a lot because I can barely hang out with them. A few months ago I told him about a bonfire at the local beach and he told me I was going to cancel and not go, and “why can’t you just stay home”. So I got angry and he’s like “i never told you that you couldn’t go” and ended it with “go then if you want”. I decided to clear my head so I got my things and went back to my school campus to do some homework and when he heard me leaving he left me voicemails and texts cursing at me saying that I better not have snuck out to go?? even though he just said I could go. 
     Honestly idk what to do, I barely have any friends anymore, god knows what would happen if I had a boyfriend in this mix. How do I establish I’m independent. When I do go out I make sure I’m home early, and he knows I’m not out doing anything ‘bad’. I’ve brought it up to my mother and she says he acts this way because i’m a girl. I don’t know what to do. He always wants me home and “studying” even thought I’m not even in school right now and to him, me being at home on my phone all day is better than me going out with friends for a few hours.",12Jun2019,1
255,"I’m kind of hurt by this guy I’ve seen on and off for almost s year (I initiated breakups) because he invited me over at 9 am when I get off work to fuck and right after he says he’s going to sleep and said bye right after. I usually would stay over but his AC was broke 

He didn’t wanna cuddle. He didn’t really talk. He was tired, but I was like hey I am going to leave to go out of town this weekend and I guess I’ll see you next week (it’s Tuesday) and he said maybe I’ll see you but we will definitely talk. I wanted to leave after because his AC is broke and it was 90 degrees in his house. 

I’m used to my ex always wanting to talk and text and call and this guy doesn’t do that, yet he has mentioned what I would like at our wedding one day and he said he would forever be there for me. 

He seems distant and reserved like he can’t actually let me in and he seems distracted when we are together. Yet he hangs with my friends and I’ve met his family but I have yet to show him mine (my parents embarrass me with their values). He asks me to express my feelings to him. He makes any changes I ask him to. He brings me food to work. He makes me food. He massages me without asking. Invites me to weddings. I’ve met his family. Texts me every day. Cries when he has almost lost me. Hangs out with my friends and drives them around. We hang out for hours and hours on the weekend and play games or watch tv. Calls me his girl. Says we are dating. Says I am his babe. 

I am kind of hurt he was like oh whatever, see you later. I know he is tired but I feel just used. Like I’m the FWB I think I am not but actually am. We have dated on and off. I left him cause he was too into video games and wouldn’t be considerate of me and let me play. Additionally, he doesn’t have a great job and he used to drink too much. 

He has never said I love you to me. He said he takes things slow so he doesn’t get hurt and he doesn’t wanna burn through potential mates too quickly without actually getting to know them. I left him before so I’m sure he won’t try and say I love you first. Well I don’t wanna waste my time. I am using to dating someone who was crazy about me from the start, but that also went down in flames so probably isn’t the best strategy. Yet, I hear many loving couples start off that way",12Jun2019,0
256,"I am a 17 year old guy who is going to be a senior in high school. I transferred schools last summer, and I had a blast at my new school as a junior. However, now that summer’s here, I’m starting to feel really lonely and unhappy with myself. I started getting addicted to reddit, staying up as late as 3 am just to browse it. All I browse are posts that might seem happy, but make me upset (r/AskReddit is a good example, as there are many questions such as, “What makes you happy?” or “What was your first kiss like?”). Another thing that bothers me is that I’m single. I’ve been single my whole life, and I’ve never even kissed a girl. I feel like happiness would come once I get a girlfriend, but my biggest phobia is that I’ll be single forever. I have a hard time falling asleep at night because of my fears of the future. Yesterday was a horrible example, as I didn’t fall asleep until 3 am, and didn’t wake up until 12 pm. However, I was very lazy and found no point in getting out of bed, so I didn’t leave my bed until 1 pm. I’m worried that my sleep schedule is slowly changing, and I’m worried that my depression is coming back. I had depression when I was 14, and I overcame it. But now, I feel like it’s back. What should I do to improve myself? My friends said I should run (because I’m considering joining cross country next year), but I’ve had no motivation to leave the house to go to the nearest track and run. I feel like this is a serious case of laziness, but I can’t overcome it. If anyone could give advice, I would appreciate that. Thank you very much.",12Jun2019,1

Also, he slams every door and cupboard in the house pretending he doesn't live with two other people. I'm assuming he's not intentionally being loud, but I've already sent two very straight forward texts asking him to try to walk quietly around the house. Surprise surprise the issue hasn't stopped and I'm seriously on the verge of resorting to purchasing loud heavy bass speakers. I don't want to create a toxic situation in the house mainly because I have 0 issues with my other housemate and I don't have a lock on my door. I don't want to turn to immature tactics and cause a fight, but having to hear drum-like stomping through my headphones everyday is convincing me otherwise. My other housemate is aware of the stomping, but isn't directly attached to his room like I am.

260,"Hi Reddit, I'm fairly new to this and this is obviously a throw-away account.

I got the idea to post this from listening to Reddit stories on Youtube.  

&amp;#x200B;

So I got into making money online and joined a bunch of FB groups. From There I got involved with Adblast and  bitcoin trading. Spoiler Alert both are scams. All the signs were there yet I fell for it. I guess because I was desperate to get some money. Long story short,  [Adblast.com](https://Adblast.com) just stopped working. "" They are working on stuff"", meanwhile you can't withdraw your money and I'm pretty sure they'll vanish in a few days. Just some MLM scheme paying out old subscribers with newcomers money.  I don't think I'll get my money back or that I'll be able to get any satisfying closure with that. 

&amp;#x200B;

The second scam was someone promising to 30% interest in 4 days with trading. I know, too good to be true. If you see the account, you'll ask yourself how I fell for it. But it happened. What bothers me the most is that she is still active on FB. The potential to fool other idiots like me is real. Is there a way that I can get my money back? Or better yet, any idea's on how I can get pro revenge so that she stops doing this? I want her to feel the emotional distress I felt and second-guessing her actions online and that she can't harm anyone else. I don't just want to flag her to FB as she may just create another account. All Idea's are welcome.

PS: I never understood how someone can get scammed online, and now I experienced it for myself. High emotions like desperation in my case make you an easy target.",12Jun2019,1
261,"So there's this girl, let's call her K, I met about 5-7 months ago. We hang out often and have similar interests (anime, TV shows, humor, etc). Within the past 3 or so months I've been feeling a little different around her. It started out with me really liking her new haircut and talking about the funny things she would say for a few days after she said them, to me in the past week, not being able to get her out of my head. I like her weird humor and her stupid smile when she makes weird jokes. Her hands are nice, too, and her hair is really cute. 

I like a lot of her outer features and I don't know a lot about her emotionally. She's one of the first friends I've had that isn't emotionally open and I am able to talk about deep shit with them and they will share with me too. I want to get to know her more in these ways but she doesn't seem very open about it and I'm too nervous to try.

I'm freaked out because this is the first time I think I've actually liked someone. I don't really know how to handle it. Not to mention I don't know her sexuality, and that's kind of important (I'm currently questioning but I try not to think about it). 

My mom knows that I like her, I think. She keeps telling me that I shouldn't try to go after her, although I think that's just because my mom is a lil homophobic/transphobic. 

I don't know what to do ahhhhhh

Whenever I talk about her a lot I start to lose understanding of what I feel for her and wonder if it's all made up or I don't actually like her, but then I just feel it other times and it's so weird.",12Jun2019,1

  I had a long talk with my professor who freaked out at me. Long story short I asked him about philosopher kings, he rejected the idea as ineffective, I asked him a hypothetical about if a philosopher king was selfless would you believe in them or say something different than he had before. He wouldnt answer my question. So a confused shy kid who didnt understand why he wasnt answering my question then proceeded to ask him so you would believe this, thinking he might be trying to mask how he really felt about my question. I was ready for him to accept or reject the statement and then explain but he kept answering my first question instead, saying a selfless person is impossible. And proceeded to freak out at me the rest of class for putting words in his mouth when I felt he thought I was being malevolent when I was instead just trying to pick his brain for information. Any thoughts cause I felt very guilty despite the fact that I knew I wasnt trying to manipulate him or literally put words in his mouth as if it was a bad thing. It just slipped out in the moment cause I thought I caught onto his thought process (I really meant so you would think this?, not so you say this). Yet he took my words literally to this day will swear I tried to put words in his mouth when all I meant was for him to accept or reject a thought process of his I tried to predict... despite all the attempts I had made to tell him my intentions he got red faced an wasnt really yelling but it definately wasnt a fun 15 minutes of him being offended.

266,"I’m just gonna say this is long and I’m sorry in advance. When I get writing, I can’t shut up.

I’m 21 F, going to college in the upper Midwest. I met this girl. Let’s call her Amy. We met Halloween of 2017 and I immediately thought she was different and cool. The reason she’d came to the hangout was because my friend Will, knew Amy’s boyfriend Darren. (Before I continue, these are all fake names. Duh.) Darren and Amy have been dating for 4 years now. 

Anyways. Amy and I started hanging out more when Summer 2018 rolled around. We bonded quickly and flirted constantly. I knew I didn’t have a chance. She and Darren have a strong relationship. It became a trend of getting drunk and flirting hard with one another. She started talking about how she was not a fan of monogamy and wanted to explore her sexuality because she’s bi. I was still very closeted at this point and she was the first person I ever told that about having a strong attraction towards women. 

Before I go on, at this point Amy had and continues to have a very difficult home life. Her dad is an alcoholic and her mom and her aren’t close. At that point, she had basically been taking care of her father and had to put off going to school because of him. She loves him and was incredibly dedicated to making sure he was safe. Darren and his family have been her biggest support for the past 4 years, helping her whenever she needs it. She and Darren’s parents are close and have a great relationship that compensates for the relationship with her parents. 

Back to me and her. Amy and I continued hanging out and one night, we decided to get a hotel room so we could drink and be loud. I know it’s weird but to us, it was a great fuckin idea. It’s our moment. We can let totally loose and drink a lot. We do. Things escalate, she opens up to me about her family life more and how things have gotten harder. She opens up about how she’s developed feelings for me. I held her as she cried. I’m going to take full responsibility. I kissed her. Things escalated. Clothes came off but we didn’t go beyond kissing. It was an exchange that can be best described as a release of pent up sexual energy. 

It was the strongest I’ve ever felt for someone in a sexual situation. I felt like I was on fire. 

At the end it all, she asked me to sleep in the other bed and her last words before we went to sleep were, “I just cheated on Darren”

I felt horrible. I never wanted this to happen this way. I didn’t want to make Amy feel guilty and now I carried a guilt that weighed on me for months.

Amy and I stopped speaking for about a 5 month period. She was going through a really difficult time with her family and went off the radar, only really talking to Darren. During this period, I went on a complete sex bender. I lost my virginity a couple of weeks after the hotel and I went on to have multiple male sexual partners. I was chasing a high. It was pathetic.

Eventually, she reached out and we started seeing one another again. I apologized profusely and said that if I in any way took advantage of her in a time of weakness or sadness, I would do anything I could to make up for it.

She looked me dead in the eyes and said that she did not regret having that exchange with me and that she felt very strongly about me romantically. I’m not gonna lie, her looking at me and saying that made me giddy. I have a total weakness for her. 

We continued to hang out and I started exploring my sexuality more. Things began falling into our old cycle: drinking and flirting. 

I met a girl, let’s call her Emily, on tinder. Emily and I got along well enough and she was nice to be around. We had good chemistry and I liked talking to her. For the first time ever, I was dating a girl. Really dating a girl. It was casual and we were both still active on tinder, but she would come over to my dorm  and we would watch movies and makeout. Nothing crazy. I thought it was going well. I didn’t expect for the relationship to stretch much longer, we got along alright but I have a weird craving for intense emotional connection and I could tell that the connection wasn’t at the level I wanted it to be and it wouldn’t get there. 

Amy was still there. She encouraged the relationship and said that she was proud of me for allowing myself to date a girl. She told me she was jealous. 

Then last Friday happened. Amy and I were drinking and I honestly don’t remember how but we were cuddling (which is super weird because neither of us like physical affection much) and then we looked at each other and our lips met. This time was different. She kissed me and the exchange could be best described as sweet. The next hour was a dance of kissing one another and talking. During this talk, I told her I loved her. I didn’t even know I loved her until I said it. She told me she loved me. 

She tells me a shocking fact. She has never orgasmed with Darren and that she’s allowed a little lie to go on for four years and now it felt huge and heavy in her heart. She told me she doesn’t really enjoy sex with him but does it for his sake because she loves him. 

The thing is, I sympathized. If I found a boy that I got along with so well and was there for me so unflinchingly and loyally, I’d fake orgasms too. But that’s a huge problem, and in the future, it’s going to be more pronounced. 

I apologized again the next morning and she again said that she didn’t regret anything.

I broke up with Emily the next day. 

Now, here we are. We’re kind of in a silent agreement where we know how we feel about one another and constantly want to see each other. When I broke up with Emily, she told me she didn’t get off till 1 AM but would come over right after her shift. We never hang out that late. I had an 8 AM the next day but didn’t care. We kissed again briefly that night. 

I don’t know what to do. Darren is an amazing guy and she clearly loves him and I can say with almost 100% certainty that she will not break up with him. The only thing I can think of is to halt communication again but those months were some of the hardest of my life. I don’t want to be a scum bag that fucks over a good guy who I also consider my friend just to get the girl I want. 

If you’ve made it this far, you deserve a medal. Thank you. Please don’t roast me too hard. The journey to get to where I am had been a difficult one and I come from a home where I would be disowned if my parents found out about my sexuality. Amy is the first person I’ve had this kind of connection with and I’m scared to leave it behind even though I’m fully aware it’s the right thing to do.",12Jun2019,2

I was wondering if someone could tell me if this is a good idea or not.

Its my boyfriend's birthday soon and there's something I know he really wants and could use daily but would never buy on his own. It's sort of expense like $150 but I want to get it for him. (And I got a few other stuff too, so it looks like a lot all together)

However, my birthday is next month as well, and I'm worried that he will either try to match the gifts in value or worry that it's not good enough 

As an added complication, he's going to be gone during the week of his actual birthday, so he can't use it until he gets back. I'm considering giving it to him earlier so he can have a chance to use it, or get it for him next month after my birthday. I don't really know T_T

I have anxiety so I have bad awareness when it comes to stuff like this. I wish I could just ask him like I usually do with everything else, but that also ruins the surprise factor :(

Any advice would be great! Thanks.",12Jun2019,1
272,"So I’m currently in my second year of being a premed student and throughout my life I’ve done pretty well in school. I’ve always been near the top percentage of my class and going into college, I accepted the challenge of college being harder and hit the gates swinging. However, a feeling of complacency kicked in and as I’m nearing the end of my second year, my grades are just spiraling down. 

The kicker came the first quarter of my second year, when I started taking Organic Chemistry. Knowing it was notoriously hard, I worked my butt off and got an A on my first midterm. And that’s when complacency set in and I ended with a C in the class. Moving into the next quarter, and getting my first C ever, I tried convincing myself I could do better if I worked as hard. But I couldn’t find the motivation to do and be better and barely passed with a C-. Currently the night before my final for my final quarter and I am sure I will have to retake this course. 

Did the depression of failing those classes just send me spiralling? I don’t know why I lack so much in motivation and I knew what my problem was and still couldn’t fix it. My plan was simple: go to class, do homework on time, a little bit everyday, ask for help, and keep doing practice problems. But for some reason I have this feeling of complacency where I convince myself I can cram and do well, which has no base for it because clearly it hasn’t worked and I know that yet my behavior doesn’t change. I was always a crammer and got away with it in high school and that probably has given me a false sense of security in my own abilities.

Two fridays ago I had a sudden inability to pass gas or stool. This lasted for a few days but I was able to pass the occasional stool. I had episodes of extreme light headedness and thought I was dying on multiple occasions. 
Went to the ER Monday night after a particularly bad episode (hands shaking and numb, lightheaded, hearing muted). They said all my bloodwork was fine that I just had a fecal impaction (your poop is too hard to pass)  they gave me an over the counter enema and told me to take it when I got home. Well I took it and it didn’t work, so I bought another and nothing. Took a third and passed a normal, if no a little small, stool. But def not everything because the doc said I was “full of the goods” and I still feel constipated and like my guts are full. 
They said to follow up with a GI but I’m assuming they thought the enema would work, and I can’t find any readily available openings. I’m concerned because I have heard of people dying because of fecal impactions.

275,"Short version: I'm lonely and I have no idea how to interact with other humans outside of the professional/collaborative context. Most people aren't interested in cache invalidation strategies as a subject of casual conversation, and my hobbies are pretty much all variants of ""sit alone and solve complex problems/build things."" How do I interact with other people?

Longer version:

I (25M) am an engineer at a large tech company. I've never really had relationships with other people beyond of the basic ""we're friends because we go to the same classes"" kind you make during school. Social interaction in general makes no fucking sense to me, but I've managed to stumble over strategies that don't lead to disaster via years of trial and error.

When I was a kid (think grade school) I couldn't really relate to anyone, or share anything I was doing safely (if you start talking about physics and electronics at that age, you just get beat up). That meant I ended up finding things that I could do alone, like programming or electronics. Variants of the same dynamic played out for pretty much my entire life, albeit with physical violence replaced with social exclusion.

At this point I have no idea how to relate to anyone. It seems like everything I enjoy would be considered boring or too work-adjacent for a social context.

For example, recently I've been working on breaking the hardware security measures of a sketchy IoT device so I can replace the firmware and stop it phoning home to China. How the fuck do I talk about that in conversation? Much more detail than the one-sentence description and I'd lose half the people I know.

278,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. 


Last year I made the decision to go back into education after 15 years. It’s been great and I’ve excelled way more than I thought and I can’t wait to carry on my studies after the summer. That said, during the entire year this one woman in her late 40’s has cheated at every turn. She is rude to people who don’t help her cheat and she has joked all year about it. She’s completely vulgar too and some of the comments she makes to people are so disgusting that I’m surprised she hasn’t been reported. 


I have tried to be nice to her and suggested she studies, I even offered to help her study, but she just carries on cheating. Finally, around 4 weeks ago, someone had enough of her and put in a complaint that she was only passing exams because she was cheating and that she openly jokes about it and is even nasty to people who don’t help. This of course was taken serious and management were told. Turns out a few of the staff already had suspicions because her answers were so similar to that of someone she sits next to all the time. Since then though, she has been praised for studying for 1 exam because it was a resit that everyone had already passed and she was given a B for the year which others worked really hard to get. The icing on the cake was today when I was accidentally added into a email that said they (the staff) were so happy that she passed her resit and now everyone could relax for the summer. 


It just feels like such an injustice and that they don’t seem to care that someone was cheating. I worked my butt off to get an A and she didn’t do any work at all the whole year and still passed with the same grade as some others. She was actually annoyed she didn’t get an A!! Is this what going back to education is like? 


Should I let this go? Or should I go above my lecturers head and report this further? The staff have said that because they haven’t actually caught her cheating that they can’t do anything but she was reported before the end of year exams so they could have watched out for her then. She definitely cheated on those too because she tried to get me to help her in two of them.",12Jun2019,1
279,"So I have no idea what this is, but I’ve had it forever. I’ll be sitting there like dressed nicely, usually this happens when I’m dressed quite nicely, but it has happened just randomly as well. Anyway, this weird like, wave of sadness comes over me like a mix of dread, fear and discomfort. It seems based around my body but I have no idea why it happens?! 

I have depression so I know how that feels but this is an entirely different feeling that I experienced long before I fell into depression. It’s not like depression emptiness but it’s unpleasant enough for me to stop what I’m doing for a moment until it goes away.

280,"I work in the one year old classroom at my daycare. All of them are one varying months but all over one under two. There are several problems happening that I don’t know how to deal with that are making days more stressful. 

1. 15 month girl won’t stop biting everyone who gets close to her mouth. It’s leaving marks on everyone and parents are getting angry. We only have two teachers so we can’t hold her all day or keep isolating her. 

2. 20 Month boy who I believe doesn’t get enough attention at home has started mimicking the biting because of the attention she gets from it. He also has a habit of hair pulling, pushing, pinching and hitting in general. When you try to give him attention he’ll eventually start doing it to you. He won’t stop almost every few minutes someone is crying Bc he hurt them. 

3. We have tables where they eat and do activities and they won’t stop crawling on top of them. There’s nowhere else we can put the tables and we’re constantly pulling them off of it and don’t listen when we say not to go in it. Even when they fall off and cry they go back on it. 

4. Dirt eating. Every morning and afternoon we have to take them outside and there are a few kids who won’t stop eating the dirt and rocks. This one might just be an issue of us monitoring them but there are two of us and 12 one year olds. 

That’s all I can think of right now but I’ll also take suggestions for activities and circle time things I can do with them. Bc they’re all varying degrees of development being one it’s hard to find something they can/want to do",12Jun2019,1

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding might have been nothing) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then look away to carry on putting her scarf on.

291,"I'm sorry for any mistakes but English is not my first language.

Throwaway account.

This is too long I'm sorry.

there are examples in this, this is not what we do. it's just a random thing for confidentiality reasons.

\--------------------

TL;DR: 

I'm an Information Management officer at a MEAL department. I was assigned system administration duties because the administrator resigned and i'm currently the only one in the department with IT background.

Data entry people, who have their own supervisors, enter wrong data on that system. and now I cant expand my work because of people who I don't supervise make mistakes, and their supervisors are not taking actions.

I'm not authorized to take actions when it comes the them, I only clean their data for reporting and send errors to their team leaders.

\--------------------

So I started working in Information Management few years age, around mid last year the system administrator resigned and i was assigned to do his administration duties until the recruitment process is completed (stopped now) because I have the responsibilities to report on that system (we have many systems, every system has an administrator) and i know how it works more that anyone else, plus I'm the only one in the team with IT background, everyone else have major in Statistics, research or similar (even my boss, who supervises information officers and system administrators).

&amp;#x200B;

Not to brag or anything, but since I started working at this company, I showed management how dedicated i am in this position and i was able to learn every thing about about the system that was assigned to me in a short time, and the reports i work on required minimal follow up and check, that at some point they stopped revising and back checking my reports. and now that i was assigned administration role, i still know how to deliver everything needed from me. Again, not to brag, but mention my name and people (employees, management, clients and suppliers) will tell how good I am at my job. I mean, it's my dream job, and few people get to do what they love, and every time i count my blessings, I count my job a million times, clearly i will be great at it, i worked hard for this and to be in the information management field.

&amp;#x200B;

So I had my appraisal and in the section (goals for next year) I added a point that I wanted to expand my scope of work and get more responsibilities. I wrote that because I made it clear on many occasions that this is my dream job and I want to learn more, and it's been a long time since I learned anything new and i feel like I'm not adding value to my knowledge, and in the appraisal i made it more formal and clearer (same reports, same graphs, limited tools...etc.). 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you know what my boss said? He said that he can't expand my duties because the data entry people are making mistakes while entering the data. he said that we cant get to the next step when the progress is 70%, and it needs to be at least 90% to take another step, and he knows that it's not fair, but that's how things work, and as an administrator i should supervise the data entry team to minimize the errors. I can't do that, they're not my team, I'm not their supervisor, they have supervisors and team leaders, those are the people who do that job and are held responsible for their teams' errors. 

I am only authorized to give technical support when technical errors occur and give training for new data entry people. the training I'm allowed to give is how to use the system, not how to enter correct data (e.g: it's my responsibility to tell them to enter the quantity in this field and the price in that field, but it's not my responsibility if they ignore the error when they forget to enter a price for a specific item, it's a sheet handed to them and they enter the data), their supervisors should check that, I'm not allowed to do that, i see a blank field i remove it form the report, and inform the team leader (and my boss knows that), next reporting period, if the error was fixed it will be counted. And that's it, as IMOs we are not allowed to make comments about their lack of improvement even though we see it, we simply are not authorized to do that.

I'm not the one to blame for the 70% progress rate, i do my job perfectly and everyone can see that, and my team are doing their job perfectly too, so why the hell I can't take another step, when clearly it's not my teams fault. So I'm stuck with the same repetitive work with no added value just because another team, who have their own management and supervisors, are entering wrong data in the system that i'm administrating because the management decided to assign the tasks to me until they get another administrator and then decided to stop the recruitment process because ""no budget"".

they didn't even add the new tasks to my job description or fixed my salary ( i asked a lot verbally, written emails, meeting, wrote it in the appraisal and did everything possible after the recruitment stopped and nothing happened). he even ignored this point during the appraisal.",12Jun2019,1

As a bit of background, I'm about to be a senior in high school and have still never been in a relationship or even had anyone show interest in me. As a result, I often create fake crushes as a way to feed my anxiety and depression. 

A while back, I started developing a crush on her. It ended after a couple of days and I eventually told her to which she had no reaction. 

I think it's coming back now. Whenever I hear her talking about how lonely she is and how ready she it to finally have a girlfriend I cringe a bit on the inside thinking ""it doesn't have to be that way"" and ""I'm right here"". 

I'm scared to tell her how I feel though because she had bad experiences with her ex best friend and she seems very thankful for our relationship as is. I'm also scared that if I tell her she might not feel the same way and our friendship will be ruined.

300,"I'm a 24f, I used to love shopping for clothes and I would spend a lot of money and dedicate a whole day for shopping with my best friend in the mall.

Moreover, my mom has a different outlook on clothes and looks in general- she believes a woman **has** to always look at the top of her game- wear new clothes, jewelry, makeup, high heels. Whenever I leave she checks me out and bothers me about not looking that way. I explained to her that looks don't have such a big meaning to me now, and I don't care what people think but she never listens. She keeps bothering me about it over and over every single weekend.

I also have a Sensory Processing Disorder, which has an impact on this matter- most clothes have seams and little tickets that drive me **insane** or make me itch like crazy.

And i have feeled that it has grown onto me like a parasyte and intertwined with my""true self"" (pretty much just how i act when i'm alone ,and its also how i truly feel about things)

So fastforward to last friday during PE and i was hanging out with these friends and told them that i was getting really into boxing and that i was also learning how to box and after that they kept berading me with insulting jokes about (i'm not really an intimadating guy) it and i'm guessing they that of it as some joke so i told them that i was serious about and then they made even more fun of me and some time later when i was speaking with one of them and i accidentally started rambling about boxing ,and then he told me ""You know i'm not listening to right?""

307,"Long Post Ahead. 

To start, I'm an 18 year old dude going on 19, just finished my freshman year, and living with my parents. I've dealt with clinical depression since 2014 (this will be important later), but I take my ADs and the depression usually isn't a problem. After highschool graduation, they insisted I get a job to pay for my car insurance and phone bill, which is totally fair. Here's where my problem lies.

I've had 3 jobs since May 2018, leaving for various reasons (one job was a grocery store, they told me they'd written me up 3 times but I never heard anything of it. Is that even legal?). Anyway the point is, I can have a hard time keeping a job.

I finally snagged a job at a Freddy's Frozen Custard this March. It's a fast food place, but on the higher end of jobs like that. It's a bit lower key around the States, but not totally unknown. My longtime best friend's sister has been working there a while, and having her as a reference probably helped me get the job. I started the job and I'm thinking ""Wow, everybody here is super friendly, way better staff than other places I've worked"".

That was, until about halfway through my training. A certain manager spent the entire night raggin' on my ass, finding something wrong in nearly everything I did. It really brought my spirits down. She seemed to expect me to know absolutely everything when in reality, I'd only been there for 4 days so far. Call me petty or whatnot, but it was making me feel really bad about myself. I never give anybody any lip at that place, ever. I'd consider myself a good worker, loyal, and I don't complain about tasks I don't like doing, I just do them and get on with it. 

I thought it was an anomaly, and that maybe she was having a bad night. I just wrote it off. Until another day in April, she was at it again. I was working the drive thru with someone else, and the girl working the drive window asked me to get some Fry Sauce (that's the restaurant's signature dipping sauce) from the walk-in cooler. I walk back there, and only saw spicy sauce there, so I went back to drive thru and told my coworker that I couldn't find any normal sauce. The manager I don't like overheard and said ""Stay here. Just stay here and I'll get it. I don't want this taking forever."" in a really condescending and rude tone. This will become regular of her. When she came back with the sauce and was dumping the packets into the box, I glanced over at her and saw her widen her eyes say to herself ""oh my God"" while shaking her head.

Again, I thought she was having a bad shift and I gave her the benefit of the doubt. But nearly every single shift I work with her (which is most of my shifts), she'll find something wrong in every little damn thing I do and proceed to stop whatever she's doing to come bitch at me about it. She's told me that I'm driving her crazy and bringing the rest of the staff down when all I was doing was stacking up unimportant receipts that she doesn't need because the orders appear on the screens in the kitchen. A coworker I like noticed how rude she is and he told me that she seems to single me out, and that she's friendly with everybody else. Which, surely enough is true. I became more aware, and noticed that she laughs and jokes with pretty much everybody but me.

I got tipped off the other day by my friends sister that the manager said I'm a bad worker and wishes I would move to another job. Again, clinical depression is a bitch and working with her makes in far worse. I don't ever have thoughts of harm to myself or anyone else, but I quit my first job because of depression. I considered going to the GM and telling him, because he's a really family-oriented guy and wants us all to be happy at work. He's awesome. But I realized if tell him about her bullying, he would tell her to stop, but that would only agitate her and make it worse.

I really need to keep this job, I'm young and without much relevant experience for my resume. It's not a bad job at all aside from her. I get $9/hr which for a fast food teen worker isn't bad. I just can't think of anything I can do because she's in a position of power and I'm not.

TL;DR Started a decent part time job, manager singles me out and rags my ass constantly, but is nice to everyone else, and I can't tell the GM because it'd only add fuel to the fire.",12Jun2019,1

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding might have been nothing) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then look away to carry on putting her scarf on.

I was so dumb. So fucking dumb.

Someone hit me over the head. Should I contact him? It's been years but I got a text from him half a year or so ago 'Hello' and I sent a '?' back and got no response and left it at that but I started having dreams a few days ago about him and it reminded me of how much I liked him then suddenly all the fucking things he did was him saying he liked me and I was shipping him with this other girl.

I'm an idiot.

I've been feeling in a romantic mood for a while now - like a I want to settle down with someone feeling - and idk god I like those childhood romance type things too but it's unrealistic and he's like more than a continent away from I am (more than 24hrs flight) so what's the point right?

    But I visit home for the holidays and I think he does too? I don't know. Should I at least catch up with him? I didn't reply with more than a '?' because I wasn't feeling up to par for socialising (got depressed because I wasn't acclimating well in a new place, mum passed etc)

As I dove deeper into the topic of nihilism and read a few books, I came to accept the fact that life itself is pointless and absurd and I had to accept that (which is what I did). I came to peace with that philosophy and could finally carry out daily life without thinking about it.
At this point I thought it was all over and I would finally be able to sleep, but thas was defenitely not the case. In fact my lack of sleep got worse, for different reasons. Every night I would close my eyes to sleep I feel the darkness engulfing me and immediately go onto an anxiety attack and my mind would go to really dark death related places that I shouldn't think off.

326,So I met a guy through tinder and we clicked really damn well. We were great together and we met and sort of hooked up a couple of times and would meet like 2-4 times a week and then once he came over and we had plans to go for a drive and my friends had come over and I felt like he was hitting on my female friend and later when I confronted him he denied it and she denied it as well but I saw it. He doesn’t want a relationship since he’s leaving the country soon in a year and he probably likes his ex till now since he talks about her in a sad kind of way and he still tries to talk to me after I accused him of doing it and he sort of apologized eventhough didn’t admit hitting on my friend but things aren’t the same and I told him we could be friends with benefits cause I’ll never have feelings for him I was sure but now I kill all his attempts at conversation because I realized I do have feelings for him and I miss him and I’m pushing him away because maybe that’s the right thing to do. Maybe he’s just another asshole but it’s taking everything in me to not tell him how much I miss him and how much I want to be with him. He hasn’t yet asked to meet me since the confrontation so I’m guessing we aren’t going to meet. I know meeting him will make things worse for me so I’m not going to meet him if he ever even asks. I removed him from snapchat and unfollowed from Instagram so I don’t have to be hurt more than I already am. Am I being mature about this? I really wish somehow he would want to be in a relationship and would want to be with me because he knows we’re perfect together but I know it’s pointless to hope for it.

Second: I will try to be as fast as possible with this, so please stick with me here.

FYI: I live with my mom, my mom's sister and my cousin.

So, a few years back when I didn't use reddit, I had a friend (Let's call him M) he and I were good friends.
At the time I owned a PS4 and M &amp; I would regularly play together since he came everyday at my house.
Now, my cousin had an expensive phone which was 'stolen'. My father's a businessman so many people come to visit our house every morning/evening so the first suspect were to go to them, but before, my friend M was playing PUBG in the phone, so everyone at my house started thinking M stole the phone, which I tried declining but nobody listened to me.

We checked the last seen location of the phone, it was in our house. My cousin said I should've taken care of what my friend was doing behind my back while I played game on my console, but why would such a good friend of mines steal from me? We were friends for three years before this happened. Our friendship broke because of this and now we never get in contact. I really wanna know what you guys think of this, and whether I should confront M and see him again or not. 

I talked to my mom, questioned her whether I should meet him or not. But she straight up called him a thief, saying. ""(Cousin) You and M were the only one in the house at that moment, where else could the phone go?"" And when I tried talking back she called me 'Rude' and that 'I shouldn't take his side.'

I still see him sometimes, his house is just around mines, if I pass it, he just smiles at me sometimes. His mother has told him to 'not go to my house'. I think my mom's sister did something, probably a broke a dispute with M's mom.. I really miss him, he was my bestest friend, and right now I'm the loneliest I've ever been and his thought came to me, now that I'm on reddit I decided it'd be fine to ask you guys what I should do here.

It would give us our second boy and we are happy for the new addition. We don't plan on having more kids. We like the idea of a family of 4. But for both of us it's really hard to make friends. My wife works extremely hard as a nurse and I couldn't be more proud of her hard work and dedication. When our first son was born we agreed that it would be better that i would stop working and stay at home to be with our son, instead of sending him to child care. It truly has been a blessing to be able to raise him and watch him grow. I am so grateful to my wife for this. 

I still keep in contact with the few friends I had when I was working. We get together occasionally but nothing ever consistent. My wife has co-workers that are nice and she is friendly with but she keeps her work and home life separate and does not see these people as friend material. 

As a stay at home dad it's hard to make friends because all the mom's that are with their kids at playgrounds look at me like I'm the outcast. I feel like they think I'm a creep because I'm the only adult male there, when in reality I'm just looking for kids for my son to play with and learn how to play and share. And when there are other dad's around telling them that I'm a stay at home dad now I get looked down upon. Because society and all it's stereotypical BS of how man is supposed to provide for the family.

342,"For starters, I want to say that I’m an extremely socially anxious person. I was severely abused growing up, and thus, the results of living with a narcissist persists. I always apologize too much and end up in situations where I do something I don’t want because I hate conflict or displeasing people. I am working on this, but recognize that this is a work in progress. 

So, I (26F) have an apartment I’ve been renting for 3 years. This last year, I got a new roommate (21F). For what it is worth, she is not a bad roommate. I like her a lot.  She was only supposed to be here until May, but asked to stay for June as well. I said yes, that’s fine. 

However, now, I want my boyfriend to move in when she leaves for June. She is a student so she’s here for the school year but goes home for summer. This upcoming year, she’s only here September - January. 

At first we brought up the option of all three of us living in the same house, but we expressed our concerns for space and that we’d need a solution. Our landlord wants to raise rent and now charge the electricity if we stay 3 people. We were still open to all three because this year, my roommate is only here September-January and it seems inconvenient to kick her out for 3 months. Yet, we still made it tentative because my boyfriend and I are short on space (we have a small closet and I’m already cramming 2 bedrooms worth of furniture into one bedroom for the roommate). I told her no matter what I’d keep her furniture for her until September.

However, we have come to the conclusion that space is very limited. We want our ability to escape each other and have room to breathe. I have tried to tell my roommate and have a conversation but..... she’s always having life crisis. She’s broke up with her boyfriend at least 4 serious times (she gets back), so she cries and says she doesn’t want to talk about things. Her parents were fired unexpectedly and she took that hard. She then has exams and when she’s in exam mode, she barely eats and definitely can’t handle additional stress.  She goes on camping trips with class a lot right now and isn’t home. I’m finally like I’m going to tell her tomorrow. She comes back and has accidentally broken someone’s MacBook so now she’s crying because of the money for that, and she’s sick. I said, “I hope you’re not sick, that would make packing all your things Hard on you” trying to start the conversation and she said she didn’t want to talk about it. She leaves on Friday. She hasn’t even packed clothes yet. I don’t know when to tell her!

345,"I am a 25M and she is 23. So an ex I was dating for around 1.5 years. We had moved in together (lived together for maybe 5 months). I had found out she had cheated earlier in the relationship, and shit was really messy and we ended up breaking up for good soon after.  Not going to get into the whole thing but it did not end on good terms. She moved back to her parents after the breakup, which was around a 7 hour drive away. I have a really good job here and could easily afford rent on my own so put the place in my name alone and she was taken off the lease. When she was packing originally I was yelling at her a lot and calling her shit (which I regret now but was pissed at the time) so it was understandable she didn't get everything packed. Her and her parents drove the 7 hours back maybe 3 weeks later and I let them get everything else, including a couch her mom bought. So after they left they noticed they forgot all her shoes on the shoe stand we had out front. I still wasn't really talking to her at all, but I told her parents I would ship them over to them. I tend to put stuff off that I don't really care about, and ended up just forgetting to ship them. Over the next couple months we really didn't talk at all, but then reconnected and were talking for a week or so (she still lives 7 hours away) because we missed the friendship. I told her I would ship the shoes over at this time (so 5 months ago). She kind of stopped responding to anything out of nowhere after about a week of talking, which at the time pissed me off, but didn't really care much because I didn't want to get back together with her and talking to her was bringing up the mixed feelings of hating/loving her I had before. 

At the time I was kind of angry at her for not responding and didn't want to pay the shipping fees to ship her shoes over, nor did I want to waste my time going to the post office for her, so was going to just throw her shoes out, but decided to toss them in the attic as I had already boxed them to ship, and I never go in the attic. So over the past 5 months my work was in its ""busy season"" and I didn't really have time to ship in, nor did I think about it, and completely forgot they were up there until I just went up to the attic for something else. I don't hate her anymore. I feel like I barely know her now tbh, as we haven't talked/texted/anything since like 5 months ago, and a lot has happened since.

346,"Hello, 30 yo woman here, i never needed driving, i come from a big country where lots of transportation is always available, i moved a year ago with my husband to his home country, and we live far, so a car is really needed, he drives, i dont, and i have to start lessons next month.
I know it will make my life easier, will give me more independence, and i will get to buy my first car, but i am so afraid, it is like i dont trust myself with driving, the fear of killing someone, of losing control of the car, of any orher car crashing you, it terrifies me and i have been letting time pass because i am scared.
What would be your best advice on how to overcome this fear? Thank you",12Jun2019,2
347,"The irony of this is that i'm in the best shape of my life. 

I'm a pretty successful 24 year old man. I have great friends, a great family, a good job which give me a good amount of money. Saving for a house and Ill be able to afford a good house in a years time. 

Since my ex fiance left me roughly a year ago I have now dropped about 35 lbs of fat and put on roughly 12 or so lbs of muscle. I've consulted my doctor about my weight loss before hand to find a reasonable body weight goal and i'm pretty much there. I'm 175 lbs 5'11 so not much more to lose. 

Yet this is the only time in my life that I've hated my body. I've always had body image issues but it was more that i was a little self conscious about my gut. Now if you look at me with cloths on you would say i look pretty good, not jacked or anything but you could tell i started working out. I take my shirt off and you see the love handles and gut are still there. 

I have a birth defect being my right ear is significantly smaller than my left (i'm also deaf out of it) 

I've tried seeing a counselor once before and its not really for me. I get very uncomfortable when i'm asked to describe my emotions (no problem talking to others about theirs though)

I know that there is no quick fix nor am I looking for one but i'm wondering if there is anything I could do that would either help me accept my body or even better start to like it.",12Jun2019,17
349,"Hey all,

I've run into an odd problem and, need some advice. 

Backstory: I'm a volunteer fire fighter and there's this group in my department who bullies others if they dont like them. Basically trying to push them out the door if they dont agree with the group on how they think things should be run.

When I first joined I was friends with a lot of them because, we all joined at the same time/ a few of them mentored me. Ive wisend up and told them I was done with the drama and bullshit etc...

The problem: A few months ago one of the other guys gave me a radio holster. I asked if he was sure that he wanted to give it away. He said yeah he didnt want it. (Almost $200 value)

I took it, thanked him and I thought that was the end of it.

Fast foward to today, I wake up to a group message. The guy wants the holster back because, the other guy in the group chat broke his during training. He ended the comment with ""I know you dont have a radio"". I know this was a jab because, I can't afford a radio yet and use the stations radios on scene. 

So how do I handle this professionally? I really want to tell them shove it. However, I want to be the better person (preferrably with a back bone).

Thank you guys!",12Jun2019,1

351,"Ill summarize my situation as best I can so I don't bore you folks.

Basically, a girl who I had foolishly fallen in love with told me she won't ever see me as anything more than a friend, which I decided was fine as long as she will be in my life as my best friend as we were very close.

Everything was going fine for the next 30 mins until I told her about what my friend was saying about everything.

He was messaging me because I was asking him for advice, and frankly what he was saying was hurtful so I showed her to ask what she thought.

She ended up getting mad at him because she felt very judged, and despite me telling her that I don't believe what he says and that it means nothing to me she ended up saying ""You're making me feel uncomfortable, can you please leave"", which I did.

We then didn't talk for 2 days until I messaged her telling her that I missed her. To which she replied with ""Haha aw, im still kinda mad, let me think about things."" 

Meanwhile I'm telling her that I care about her deeply and never meant for her to get upset which isn't flirty or anything, I really did just want to be her friend at this point.

She messages me later saying, ""Hey sorry but i dont think we should talk anymore, I hope you find what you're looking for.""

She basically left me with no solid reasoning, completely ignoring our strong base foundation we had.  
I mean strong, like we are kindred spirits strong.

Im on edge and feeling lost and confused and sad it's very hard.

I want to move on because I know I wasted my affection and care on someone who didn't appreciate it, but it hurts as if someone I had loved for years just broke my heart. 

Is there any kind of coping method for something like this? Im trying to preferably not have more trust issues than I already have.

Also how can I force myself to put up a wall and protect myself because this shit sucks and hurts.",12Jun2019,1

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding might have been nothing) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then look away to carry on putting her scarf on.

He doesn't drink caffeine past 2pm, he can't take melatonin because it ends up keeping him awake, he's tried warm milk and cold milk before bed, he's tried different pillows, different blankets, different positions, even different room temperatures. Nothing seems to phase him. 

However, he's been using his phone and watching/listening to YouTube as part of his nightly ritual. He even bought a blindfold with Bluetooth headphones so he could listen even after he 'fell asleep'. He also snores heavily. I know he could sleep better if he didn't rely on YouTube, but he outright refuses to try it. He's a hardcore creature of habit and doesn't like to change them.

We always cared about each other and were deep in love ""from the first sight"". I've got a good job and we always had everything we needed. My wife stayed at home with kids, she was running Instagram and personal blog about herself and parenting. She wanted to be an ""Instagram star"" but didn't manage to make any real money, just got some stuff for kids. Just after the second daughters birth my spouse started to get more and more involved in running her Instagram. She didn't have time for me, all the time sitting with the phone in her hand. I tried to talk to her multiple times but she didn't even listen to me, just looking at her iPhone. She only thought about what next picture to post. Only thing she wanted from me was to buy her some stupid new expensive phones or other stuff that would look good on Instagram. Few months ago i accidentally found their texts on her Instagram about having sex. She told me it was just for fun. I tried to believe her I've never thought that she could cheat on me, she always told me that she would never do such a thing, that she loves me so much. Now I found all their messages on the other account, she wrote a lot of fake bad things about me, insulted me, they were talking about sex, getting married and pregnant together. She told him she wants to destroy our marriage completely and than thay will be together. They were exchanging a lot of nude pics and videos. He even bought her some cheap engagement ring and she agreed. She lied to me a lot, met multiple times with her lover and had sex together. All the time lying to me and telling that she loves me. She wanted to leave me and take kids with her when I found out about their affair. Her lover is 10 years older than us, he's rather poor, doesn't even have own house, lives with his parents. He isn't handsome at all, you should see his face. After a lot of talking she told me she is very sorry, that she got lost in this affair and Instagram life. She deleted all her accounts and told me that she will change. I think I still love her despite all the huge pain she caused me. She was always everything for me and now I lost everything. I felt like I don't want to live anymore but I've got two daughters that I love so much. I don't want them to be taken away from me. We were our only sexual partners since than.

She says that they aren't christian and really tries her hardest to convince me that none of them really care about me, which is untrue. She also saw, in my texts, that I tried weed once. Ever since then she has claimed that the weed has made me r\*tarded and that my mind is slow and that I act and speak like an idiot now.

Originally I called the police because it was outside of my local dog catchers hours (more on that later) the police didnt care.

I was even the prom king in my junior high so theres that, a reason why I should be confident. I think my being anxious at certsin situation or at most times came from my looks because whenever im in public places, I see/ feel people (girls, guys or gays?) Trying to get a glance or look at me. I told my parents about this and they told me people just admire my looks, trying to boost my mood. But whenever it happens I just really feel awkward when some random people looks at me. Also the expectations from people. Im an honor student although my parents are not pressuring me, the society's expectation at attractive people where they should not only be ""handsome/pretty"" but also should be smart is kind of a pressure to me. You know how ""oh s/he is attractive but not smart which is a turn off oooh this and that"" thing. Plus people think being attractive is easy because you can get girls easily which I think is really hard. Because most of the time, girls, even gay dudes only admire me because im attractive and not because of my personality. Im shy, has low self esteem, not confident, anxious, overthinks alot.

- they both entered panic mode and were crying about not having enough time. finally one of them called the whole thing done today

I don’t know what to do. We are all decent musicians and even without the songs being perfect, we still already had a good sound though...

Prior of us rehearsing, I asked them for weeks to let’s start rehearse but all I got was „naaah there is plenty of time“ and now they‘re bailing out because of what? Time‘s running out? Fuck that! 

They’re telling me, that they’re overworked. I work nearly double the time each week (they do 35h, I do between 60 and 70).I basically live at work right now and still try to do my best.

 Now I have to sort this out on my own. They tell me now „it is what it is, if you’ll get personally involved now, it’s your own fault.“ Fuck you, these people are my friends and they trusted me with making this good.
I didn’t even wanted to participate in the band thing because I wanted to enjoy the wedding without anything to organize... I decided to do it later because these guys didn’t had a clue wich style of music the audience would like. Honestly I guess deep down in me, I already knew that these guys gonna fuck up.
The only thing I responded with till now was „thanks for all the trouble you got me into“

I don’t know how to face my friends. How to deliver the message, that there will be no band. They wanted to dance the opening dance to us playing a specific song. We were the ones who take care about a PA system, about energy and Lights. I can pull that off alone, that’s not the problem, but how am I going to tell them, that there will be no live music at all at their wedding...

Maybe I just needed to rant, but advice on how to handle this whole situation is really appreciated 

Thank you",12Jun2019,1
392,"Hey everyone. I’m sorry, but this may be a bit long. I really need some advice, or honestly just some tales of experience with the same situations and how you got past this.

I am 22 y/o and I recently graduated 7 months ago. The semester before graduation I accrued substantial credit card debt due to my animals being sick. First was a 2000$ surgery for my dog. Then I had to take my cat to the vet multiple times for her cysts. Each about 300-400$. My credit card got all the way up to 4500$ in debt. I brought it down to about 3000$ and then I had to start buying a regular medicine that costs about 110$ a month. So then it got back up to about 4500$ from that and crazy car issues.

Soon after all that mess I finally graduated college. I was excited and ready for new beginnings. Me and my girlfriend traveled to see her parents for a week and I returned home to my cat not looking the best. She looked extremely ill, and her tumors had started rotting. I had to make a choice to put my cat down. She honestly meant the world to me, and I haven’t felt right since then. I know I shouldn’t feel wrong for putting her down, but there is a part of me that misses her more than words could explain. Tbh I’m crying like a baby typing this part.

So that is the beginning of this year. I put my beloved cat of 16 years down. Then I started working 2 jobs. I worked for a food truck and a store making videos for them. I was finally feeling a little better because I was starting to pay my debts off and I was able to focus on a new beginning. A month later I lost my job with the food truck because he didn’t have enough money to pay me, and literally booted me the next day. I didn’t do anything wrong it was honestly because he didn’t have the money and cut costs.

That really hurt, but I was thankful I still had the job with the store. I ended up working full time for the store, and was making the same amount as both jobs in one. It was awesome, and I finally felt like things were turning around. I was wrong.

Tax season hit and the store owner had to also “cut costs” and I got booted from there. I think the part that sucks the most about losing both of these jobs is doing nothing wrong, but someone just can’t pay you. So I started feeling extremely hopeless, but then I told myself “ no way you got this.” 

I’m extremely in debt from not having a job, and having sick animals. I also don’t want to hear “you have to get rid of your animals.” You wouldn’t get rid of your child if you can’t pay for their bills would you? Why would I do the same? I am their everything. I couldn’t do that, and it’s not an option.

Well I finally thought I got a big break. The world started to shine. I got a text from my favorite professor telling me about a job opening at a top news station. I was so excited I send a resume and cover letter immediately and GOT A FREAKING INTERVIEW! Things were starting to seriously look up, I felt on top of the world. I had a face to face interview and it went extremely well I honestly thought I had the job.

Guess what? Wrong. I didn’t get the job. I got beat out by one of my classmates from college who graduated with me. My professor also sent her the job and she freaking beat me. I was told the reason why I didn’t get hired is because the other person “wanted the job more.” They said I was a great candidate and they will hang on to my resume. Then I scroll on Facebook and find out it was her. I feel so inferior and I’m just kinda tired of trying.

I’ve put in 20+ job applications and nothing is going right. I’ve tried emailing the hiring managers of the jobs and trying cold calls. Nothing is working. I know that maybe it’s because “something better is waiting for you” but it doesn’t feel like that. It feels like the universe is playing a joke on me. 

In all honesty I have thought about suicide. It kinda feels welcoming, but I also don’t want to leave my fur babies to an empty home. I honestly feel like I am just being a little bitch, but I feel so trapped. I’m in so much debt and every time I have something that makes money it’s gone.

398,"tl;dr a stray I took in and love to death needs surgeries and I just can't afford them. Should I put him down? The shelter here won't keep him around long or treat him. He'd be put down.

 

I really need some advice. My cat, Mr.B, I love to death. He was a stray that I'd see outside my place every day, he wasn't in great shape. Cuts and stuff from just being a big ole Tom cat. And big he is. He's at least double the size of a regular tabby, weighs I think 25lbs. And it's all his size, not fat in the least.

Anyway. He's Mr.B. My Mr.B. My B man, my Bfriend. He's Mr. Godamn B. I love him to death. I've never seen a cat love belly rubs and to just hang out with me as much as this guy.

I took him in, got him to the vet, needled and neutured. And he's happy as can be. Vet said he's probably about 10-12 yrs old judging by his (very stinky) bad teeth.

Last year a polyp grew in his ear. Vet said it'll be about $400 to remove and it'll probably come back. I wasn't able to afford $400 for even one surgery, nevermind another if it comes back. So, he's been living with his polyp. It's very uncomfortable at times. Seems it has flare ups, discharges A LOT, smells terrible and makes him very uncomfortable.

Last week, I noticed a small hole in his neck. I kept an eye on it, did some googling then a vet visit. Vet confirmed Mr.B has another guest. A warble. A fucking botfly larvae inside his neck, maturing until it decides to emerge.

This hole is now infected. It's reeks of infection. Pus and goo and oh man, the stench. And the pain he must be in.

So, you guessed it, I can't afford treatment right now. It's been so financially tough lately, and I just can't do it.

What should I do? He's got an infection, he's terribly uncomfortable and I can't see it getting better on its own. He's so much a part of my life now, but is it selfish to keep him in this state, knowing it's only going to get worse?",12Jun2019,1

406," I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls who were there a few hours (only 2 of them are involved here) later in the night near closing it was quiet and the blonde girl skipped up stairs to the toilet kept looking back at me giggling looking back down the stairs at me , a while later I walked around the corner to where they were sitting and that blonde girl was looking at me and I didn’t look away for a few seconds and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say to her brunette friend 'that lad just been staring at me' in an excited whisper way. (They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

 another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 23 and since I was 13 my main hobby has been gaming, where if I do not have anything to do and there is a game I am particularly enjoying at the time, I'll be more than happy to play 16 hours a day. I just recently finished Uni and currently am looking for jobs, but I realised that I wasn't happy and it's probably because I isolate myself, don't socialise and play games all day.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently started going to the gym and my interest in playing games has begun to decline, but I'm not sure how to fill my time. I really struggle with balancing gaming with a normal life, I can easily get sucked in and whatever game I'm interested in pretty much dominates all my thoughts. All of my uni friends have moved back home and for the last month and a half I've been in the city alone with not much social stuff to do. I'm pretty introverted.

&amp;#x200B;

Other than the gym which I started to get fit and get me out, how do you regular people fill your time? I understand jobs take up a majority of your day, but if I cut out my main hobby, I feel like I don't know what to do with myself as most of my adult life I would just get on my PC and smash out a few hours of some game.

So I’m about to by, reading over the contract carefully, and I notice several things.

- There’s no contract or mention about a warranty
- No mention of pre certified
- return policy is 4 days but $299

I tell the guy I want something on paper stating my warranty. He told me it’s attached to the vin. I told him I still wanted to see it in writing, and after stalling we went to the GM who told me they hadn’t printed it up yet. So I walk out saying let me know when you get that in writing. As we’re leaving the salesman says “sorry, since it just has a recall job done, technically it wasn’t certified yet.

It appears very much so that they were bullshitting me. This morning, the salesman said he had the packet printed up and I can go in and read it; however, if the recall was done yesterday, there’s no way it was precertified from 8pm to 10 am right? If they printed out the warranty paperwork, that’s cool but still feel like it’s not precertified or they’re trying to screw me somehow. I can’t figure out why I just have a bad feeling about it.

426,"This is mostly me asking for advice. But for anyone suffering from depression there are little nuggets in here I hope you can use.

My roommate has spent 15+ hours a day in his room (with the lights off) for the last six months. He mentioned depression early on and I said dealer with the same.

Then a couple months later he begun to literall piss his life away. 

I haven't interviened because I remember when others gave me unsolicited advice during my years long battle, I would go into a 'rage mode'.

 I don't think he would rage, as I was/am generally more agressive than most people (this is the other reason in afraid to give him advice; I tend to be seen as intense). But unsolicited is hardly ever received well in my experience. 

But frankly I am seriously worried about him. I wish he could see how detrimental his behavior is to his health and those around him (especially his dog who now also seems to suffer from depression).

My Question: When does it become my responsibilty to interviene? 

This is the basis of the advice Is like to give. Please note I wouldn't make it all about me (as its written below) when discussing with him

I spent YEARS going to over 5 therapists, 2 monks, exercising consistently, meditating, changing diet, reading books every morning, motivational speeches every night, cleaning every other day. I force myself out of the house when I feel poor. I set three goals a day and work really hard to meet at least one of them. There are countless other little things that make me feel great about myself too. I have never taken an antidepressant in my life. Im not 'Mr. Smiles' but I am improving myself everyday.

He has been on antidepressants since I moved in and he just seems to be going further and further down.

What makes things worse is that they are planning a birthday party for me on this Friday. I know that they bought me a big gift. That would be BEFORE I tender my resignation.  How do I go to this party knowing that next week, I'll be resigning? I would obviously offer to return the gift but still feel shady.

me and my friends booked a flight to mallorca for 1 week. And everything was fine, we placed a deposit so we would get the flight and hotel we booked for. As we paid then the rest of the money, suddenly we recieved a booking conformation but the flight was one day before then orginally booked. So we wrote mails complaining about it like 1 month ago. Havent recieved anything yet and so we decided to give them a call as we are flying next week. 

Now after the call they let us know like there were problems with the flights and they booked us one a day before. So thats not a huge deal but like we are one night without a hotel as the hotel is still booked same. Now they are looking into it and just said yea it will probably cost more ? Like can we do anything against it? Its not our fault that the flight was dismissed, and they havent informed us in anyway. And yea as said we already paid everything? Some advice would be helpful.

436,"So, my family is planning on eventually taking a trip to Universal Studios sometime this summer. The thing is, I'm a very sickly person, and for that reason (among others) I HATE going on family vacations, especially because throughout the entirity of it, I'm miserable, and that ruins the trip for the rest of my family. In specific I have food allergies and crippling back pains that make moving anywhere or doing anything extremely painful, and makes me a burden on the rest of the family.

Yesterday, my mom called me, and put me in a catch 22 scenario. She basically said that I would have to either contribute $200 to go on the vacation, or I would be forcing HER to pay the extra $200. At this point, its not even about the money. I feel like she's just trying to villify me. Either I pay a large sum of money to go on a vacation and make everyone in my family miserable, or I force her to pay for me to go on the trip, and I'm miserable anyways.

https://old.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/bszblq/is_my_32m_ex_25f_trying_to_be_ambiguous_and_keep/

Anyway, we continued to text and call on the phone for a while. During Memorial Day weekend, she was in a deep, depressive valley, talking about how she didn’t want to exist anymore/didn’t think the pain of her mental illness would ever end, etc. I was concerned for her, as always, so I helped talk her through it. Later that night, she suggested we start watching one of her favorite TV shows together, saying it could “be our thing we do tomorrow” (seeing as it would be Memorial Day and we’d both be free). She even used the winky-face emoji. I had tried to watch the show with her when we were together but it wasn’t my thing; however, I jumped at the opportunity this time.

We watched five episodes together on Memorial Day, then had a decently sized conversation about mental illness and the direction our lives were going in. After that she, kinda disappeared for the rest of the night. I wrote her a poem a day later, to help her feel a little less alone in her depressive haze. I know nobody will believe me, but I went out of my way to make it as non-romantic as possible, as I felt helpless to do anything for her *other* than this. She said she loved it, but I noticed afterward that the frequency of our contact was beginning to decrease. I didn’t receive a single reply to any of my texts for four days until two Sundays ago, when she finally resurfaced and apologized, calling herself an asshole and saying she was “very exhausted” from working so much. She said it was nothing I had said or done, just work. I noted that while I wished she would have said something, I understood she had a difficult schedule.

Not a single text from me was replied to for the following *week.* It has been nine days and still no sign from her, so our communication dropped like a rock from ""every day"" to “nothing.” I cannot believe she’s not talking to *anybody* on account of work, so it must be just me. 

My question — am I being crazy/unreasonable to be annoyed and hurt at being unceremoniously dropped for over a week? I would never do this to anyone, no matter how busy I was, unless I was going out of my way not to speak to them. I think it’s shitty behavior. Even if I crossed a line in writing that poem, why not just be straight with me if that’s the case? I don’t believe I deserve silence whether I did something wrong or not. We were intensely involved with each other for eighteen months before we broke up. She called me her best friend back in January, albeit just before we split. This isn’t how you treat your purported “best friend.” Nevertheless, I still consider her to be one of mine. 

What should I do from here? If I walk away, as I feel I might have to do, what might be the best way to approach it? 

tl;dr: LDR ex suggested we watch her favorite show together, we watched a big chunk of it in a day, I wrote a poem to help her feel a little more loved/less alone in her depression, said she loved it but started replying to my texts less and less, said it was nothing I did but due to exhaustion from work, and it has now been nine days since I last heard from her, with all my texts going unanswered.

443,"I’m a student about to enter university as a freshman after a few months. I’ve always been scared and anxious about what others think about me. Ever since elementary school i’ve felt the need to please others even if it makes me feel like trash, but i feel better about myself if i don’t get hated by people but it seems to be failing. I know i can’t get everyone to like me and my twisted mind even wants to get toxic people to not hate me.

A short story from secondary school: A fellow classmate has previously mocked me for failing chemistry as i got one of the lowest grades for that test, and i quote “Huh, you failed chemistry?”, with a smirk she didn’t even so much as try to hide from her face and she said it mockingly. It really damaged my self-esteem a lot and i felt really bad about myself. She also talks badly about people she dislikes on her social media spare account that i used to follow. I found myself unable to be true friends with her seeing the way she does things and i guess i couldn’t be as friendly to her anymore and just didn’t respond well to her interactions. I think she kinda realised it and started speaking to me with hidden malice under her words and talks to me in a sarcastic tone everytime. After graduation, we went to different schools but we still follow each other on social media. I guess i still couldn’t get over the past events and i still feel extremely intimidated by her everytime i see her post a photo or whenever her username appeared on my timeline. I guess i’m just afraid she will hate me and talk about me to her friends who will probably believe her words and start hating on me as well.

Afterwards, I started reading posts about positivity from social media accounts because I wanted to change myself. So, i blocked her account and various accounts of people i found to be intimidating me and made me constantly scared of posting pictures of myself on my own social media, in fear of getting judged by them due to the history we had together. Now one of her friends unfollowed me a short while after i blocked(and unblocked) the girl i was intimidated of on social media.

Now, the scariest part is that i found out that we will be going to the same university, meaning i’ll definitely see her around in campus. This is making me feel even more worried.

I know this problem might sound lame but it really means a lot to me in my point of view. I’m constantly worried about this every single day ever since i made the decision to block her from my account. I was hoping someone could give me advice on how to stop feeling this way. Is there any step i could take to do so? I really want to stop feeling so paranoid, these thoughts are ruining my life.",12Jun2019,1

3. difficult to meet her friends.
4. repetitive motor patterns; as in moving my hands and such when talking
5. walking quite oddly.

445,"This is a throwaway account for the later being. 

I'm sitting outside in the corner of a retail store having nothing but my thoughts swarming around in a place they can never escape out from. I just got dumped by my boyfriend of a year from a past incident that happened a few nights ago. In a way I think everything is under control, he will understand what happened, but the more I wrap my head around it it's never going to be anything he will understand the deeper we get. 

Last Friday I had the last party of this school I'm in and its a good time to say your goodbyes and share the last memories of the best friendships you've had. I thought this party was going to be like any other Ive been to. The ones you share your side of being drunk and forget everything thats laid beside you although I did always have my boyfriend in mind. There were 3 guys trying hard on me at that party. It's never been that much to handle at once and I don't know if they thought they could shoot their last chance even if they knew I was taken and it would work anyway? The first one got sent home for uncontrollable and uncomfortable behavior telling me he knew it was happening tonight and got slowly more aggressive. The second one I managed to walk away from and made clear signs I was not interested. But the third one had their chance unfortunately. The alcohol I had consumed was too much for me to resist anything and worst of all it was my good male friend who I had feelings for earlier on but I forcefully ignored him because who has a crush while they're in a relationship? I should have noticed that something serious was going on here but Jesus 3 attempts? I never in my mind would have thought this many danger signs would appear in just one night and it was all too much for me to have control of. 

I remember sitting upstairs having a talk with him about my relationship. It was hard being this far away from him and we had our ups and downs but I wanted it to work. Before I know it he leaned in and kissed me and I pulled away from him saying I can't do this and I could see on his face as soon as I pulled away that no was not an answer to him. He forced himself on me with a hand down my pants and tried to get what he could. I pushed him away and instantly broke down crying what I had done to my boyfriend. What did I do what did I do and freaked out, this isn't me, its not me at all. I barely even noticed he pulled me in to comfort me while he kept saying sorry for what he had done and he didn't mean for it to happen. I was so lost in shame, shock and sadness just sitting there that I couldn't even see my own legs when I looked down. 

I knew I would tell him about this sooner or later I knew it would hurt minute after minute of keeping it in anytime longer. I told him what happened 2 nights ago and he was hurt about what had happened. He knew about the guy and in a way that made it much worse. It got me thinking that he was not tired of the fact he kissed me but more the reason I was attacked or assaulted. Again. I have a history of past sexual assaults starting from when I was 6. At 13 I nearly got gang raped in Thailand. At 14 I was assaulted by my abusive ex who was slightly older. And now this at 17. In that moment it all fell down, it felt like a punch to the stomach. Everyone is attacking me, this is why he left me. He didn't want to deal with all the attention I got and it must have been too much on him. And when he said ""why does everyone keep attacking you"" it was a clear sign. 

I feel like I've lost my worth. I've lost my dignity. Everyone keeps ruining it for me and it's a scar of a past people don't want to see. It's a scar from the past my now ex doesn't want to see. How can I prevent this? I'm so damn tired of being given this attention even if others are begging for even a little. I'm starting to think this is all my fault. The numbers of this just keep increasing and there is no decreasing to it. I live in a safe well developed country with nothing more to ask of. But
I'm lost for words on this. I really honestly feel like I'm just going down with them in the end.

450,"So I turned 16 this march. And I think most of the kids my age have had some love interests in their  lives. Seeing as some of my friends are dating, some more ""permanently (is that the right term?)"" than others. 

But me? I've barely even had any crushes. And even those were just some minor ""likey likey stuff"" and I did not and would not have acted on them. Mostly just slight attraction to girls a bit older than me (a year or a few). 

A few girls have come to me telling they might be interested in me or they think they'd like to get to know me better. And of course I don't have any problem with that. It's just that always up to this day, I've had to turn them down because I don't think of them that way. 

I'm not exactly sure if it's that I don't have the balls to say that I like them back (even though I think I do not) and see where it goes (and that would probably end up hurting them so I don't want that) or if I just genuinely only see them as friends. 

Just last week I met a girl at a four-day volleyball tournament and for half a week we've been talking on snapchat every single day. We share many interests and seems like we get along really well. She's been (I at least strongly think so, can't be sure tho) dropping me really obvious hints that she likes me or is at least interested in me. Like ""Come over"", ""you should come watch this movie with me"" and ""The key to my heart would be to take me somewhere to eat"" and the list goes on (seriously can't even remember them all).

Now I don't know if she's just messing with me (she's a year older than me) or genuinely being so open and hoping I would pick up the hints and start something with her. I would if I was interested in her that way but at least for now, I'm just not. So far I've just been trying to avoid provoking her and not reply to the hints in a flirty way. 
Also you should probably know that she lives like 60 km (37 miles) away. Otherwise I'd probably at least hang out with her and see where it leads.

I guess I'm kinda scared that I'm some a-sexual who doesn't feel attracted to anyone. Also I haven't really ever experienced that kinda *this is it* crush on anyone. Never been thinking about someone all the time and nobody has ever been on my mind that way 24/7.

453,"So my wife and I have been married for about 3y now and my family has always tried nosing their way into every decision (My family is from Russia and is Jewish, but wife is from USA). We've done a great job in the first year laying down rules about not calling 10x a day and stuff like that. Her side is 110% normal and doesn't cause issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

The last thing I can't fix is how my family expects my wife and I hang out with them every weekend. Every week I get a couple calls asking what I'm doing this weekend and I have to doge them like a bad date with excuses. They know we both work 40hrs+ and my wife is studying for her CPA. They live 1.5hrs ALWAYS insist that we go to their house and rarely make any effort to come see us on our side of town. 

&amp;#x200B;

They are also wealthy and bored, so their hobbies of entering their horses in pageants and showing off their art collections don't really interest any of us. Plus they're so out of touch how normal people live that they can't understand why we can't afford a house, vacations, or new cars. They own a business and maybe come in about 10hrs a week then they go off doing riding horses or something. So the conversation always leads to ""if you stopped spending money on stupid shit you'd have a house by now"".

&amp;#x200B;

The icing on the cake is we see my wife's family about 4x a year and they live just as close (they don't complain). When I tell my family I can't come I get a barrage of these passive aggressive calls from everyone saying ""how can you be like this I thought we were family"".

Let me start this by mentioning I have always been a bit of a pushover, mostly from low self esteem. Been getting better at it with counseling. 

Came crashing right back down last night; I was at work, in a pub near closing time, 12:30am. Alone at the bar other than a few costumers on the terrace. A stranger came in, clearly distressed. He was asking for money for a train (I think, it gets blurry from here), I'm not sure why or how I ended charging my debit card the equivalent of $700 and giving him cash from the till. 

I can't understand why I did it, maybe fear of why he would do if I said no, I remember him crying so maybe pity. 

I'm very worried it might come back and bite me at work. Worried and embarrassed I'd alloy myself to give a big amount of money (for me) away.

458,"So, to start this all off, to put things in perspective:  I am currently in the process of aiding my parents in keeping their house.  This has put a rift between me and my girlfriend, understandably so, because it will not leave me in a position to ever be productive in providing towards buying a house for us if we were ever to be married.

My father has a form of cancer that always comes back.  He has been in remission for about 3 years.  Best case, he has 5 years before it comes back.

My mother has another form of type 4 cancer.  The type you don't cure.  Her aunt died after 5 years of having that.  I'm looking at her being around for hopefully 5 to 8 more years.  With how things go in my life, that is excessively hopeful.

Getting back to how I'm saving my parents home.  My father got cancer bad in 2013 and started missing payments on the taxes or the house, alternating.  After his treatments left him able to work again, he has been making payments, but they went from $400 a month to over $1000, which he can't meet and pay for taxes.

So I will be technically buying the debt of the house, and getting the house in my name, making monthly payments on this house for 15+ years.

I've more or less lost my girlfriend at this point, the one person that I have met that actually makes me happy.  I love my parents, but I wouldn't say I've ever been happy at home.  I am simply doing this for them because I do not want them and my brothers to be homeless.  My father let this go on long enough that there doesn't seem to be other options.

The house is worth more than what I am paying, I could technically turn a profit in 5 years by selling it off, but in the mean time, if I go through with this, I've lost my girlfriend and my future.  I'm old enough that I feel like I'm doing this and then when my parents die, I'm probably just going to disappear.",12Jun2019,4

460,"Maybe I'm just being paranoid, but I don't know what to do. I had a boyfriend almost 3 years ago who, ever since I broke up with him, relentlessly tried to contact me by making new social media accounts, using different numbers, and even messaging my family and friends on their social media. These messages would range between desperate pleas asking me to get back together with him to threats going into graphic detail about how he would violently murder me. 

He has not contacted me at all in about a year, so I assumed it was all said and done. However this morning I recieved a letter from him in the mail. There was no return address, however the postage stamp was from Alabama (nowhere near the state I live in). He may have moved there, but I've pretty much avoided anything pertaining to him or anyone in contact with him so I have no way of knowing where he currently resides.

The letter itself was innocent enough, however given his history I fear this will continue to escalate. It also has me concerned that he may have been stalking me for a while now and just managed to stay under my radar by being quiet. This would not be the first time he attempted to track down information about me.

I want to stop this as soon as possible, so I want to know, is there a way I could stop from getting any future letters from him, despite there being no address? Could I, or should I get the police involved, despite the letter not containing any threats or anything of the sort? I really don't want this to escalate, and considering his history, I fear it may. I don't know where I would start with the authorities though, since I don't even know anything other than his name. 

Any advice is appreciated, and if anyone knows other subs I could crosspost this to that'd be a big help as well. Thank you!",12Jun2019,2

466,"Long story short, we're 23, we've been together for 2 years, we're meant to be moving into a new apartment together in 4 days. He's been living with his mom for the last year. I'm moving out of a shared house where I live with 4 friends.

We both have good jobs, and clean credit, and references, but our application was overturned (after having been previously a done deal) due to things they found in background checks. I'm only finding out now (the process has been going on for maybe a week and a half) and I don't know what to do

Turns out he has unpaid debts that he's been ignoring so his credit is bad (not a huge deal but it means I lied when I said we had clean credit, lying about money is a very understandable red flag I'd say). And that he trashed his last rented house so that landlord won't give a reference. He hasn't actually started his job yet (in training/checking phase), so technically will be working when we've moved in but we still technically lied on the forms that he was employed. He also inflated his prospective income. Both his employment status and earnings were questioned when they rang the company's HR department where he isn't even technically an employee yet.

So i'm out $400 for the holding fee. I get evicted from my current place in 8 days. He's got a bunch of mental health issues and this is stressing him out, he says that's why he suppressed thinking about his problems. I feel so deflated and stressed now. He could have brought this up anytime during our 3 month+ apartment hunt, but I'm only finding out now as the consequences of his actions are coming into play

Is there anything I can do? How do I talk to him about this without stressing him out? Hell, how do I stop crying at the though of shoving all my possessions into storage and sleeping on my mom's sofa halfway across the country until he gets his shit together?",12Jun2019,3

468,"I have a friend who I am not super close to. We have known each other for 2 years, work together about 3x a week and hang ot about 2× a month, sometimes more if we have the chance (more often in summer when her school is out). Often, I get the feeling that she would rather hang out with others and that I am just her second or third choice. For me, I love to spend time with her and am willing to move my alone time around to spend time with her. She does talk to me about personal things like family issues or dating, but is somewhat resistant to listen when I have a problem that I want to talk about. Sometimes she exhibits selfish behavior, but I feel like everyone does at some point, so I do not hold it against her.
Now to the problem:
On Saturday, I invited her to go to a Queer bar crawl on Tueaday Night with me (we are both queer) since it is Pride Week in our town. She said it sounded like an awful idea, that it wouldn't be fun to go to a bar crawl, and that she is uninterested in going to bars at all. Tuesday rolls around, and she tells me that a mutual work friend of ours invited her to the Queer Bar Crawl and that she is so excited to go, so excited to meet other queer women in our town and that she is excited to hang out with Molly.
So my feelings are hurt by rejection but that's not what I'm asking advice for. Mainly I am hurt that she didnt even remember that she rejected my invitation with gusto and that she didnt invite me to go along with her and our friend. She didnt remember enough to lie or hide the fact that she was going.
Is it even worth it to bring this up when I feel like all it will do is make her feel bad? I just feel like I am not even important enough to her to remember interactions with me and act accordingly. She didn't care to try to spare my feelings and I am very hurt by that. But is it even worth it to tell her I am hurt? If I dont hang out with her in the future, I dont even think she would care at this point. I am feeling like just a drag along friend/last ditch option, but not sure it would even matter if I told her that.
Any advice on whether I should bring this up, distance myself from her friendship, or just pretend like nothing happened?
Thanks.",12Jun2019,1
470,"Okay, so my best friend and I have been very close since we were 7 years old. We are 16 now, and 2 years ago, I moved half way across the country from my best friend. 

My parents have allowed my older sister to go see her friends in our old state, even when she was also 16. 

Money for a plane ticket is not the issue. They have bought my sister at least 5 tickets to my old state, and can very well afford to get me a ticket. If they didn’t want to get it for me, I’d save up money as long as I possibly could just to get one. 

My best friends mom doesn’t want to send her on a plane by herself, and can’t exactly afford a ticket for her to come to my state, so it’s kind of up to me to go their. Her mom said that I am welcome to come and stay with them for however long I want, whenever I want. (Obviously, I wouldn’t overstay my welcome, but that’s a sweet gesture.)

I haven’t seen her in so long, and every day it gets harder. I have been going through a rough time, and at the moment, the only thing that could really make me happy is having a sleep over with my best friend, just like we used to when we were little. We are both really “homesick” for each other, and it’s taking a toll on both of us. 

I’ve been begging my parents for a year now to let me go. I want to come up with a mature, reasonable pitch for them to let me go. They’re usually very go with the flow type people, but this is the one thing that they won’t seem to budge on. I know that with the right words, I could convince them, but I need help trying to sound like a mature, responsible young adult when asking.",12Jun2019,1

I also can`t play with my real life friends because we simply play different games. 

I did try to actively make friends by being nice and asking people to play again, but on the next day most people wont remember me or are already premade and can`t play with me because of that.

I don`t know where the problem is and it actually makes me a little sad, because playing with friends and goofing around sounds  so much more fun, than to play solo and trying to win all the time.

472,"I really liked this girl last year. I didn't laugh with her a lot, she wasn't even all that fun but I just really loved and cared about her. It was very strange for me because I often have trouble connecting with people, I don't like commitment and barely even manage to love long-term romantic partners. 

She was someone I could really see myself changing for, putting in work for, etc. I never told her I liked her though and we stopped talking after highschool (ie. The end of last year). I saw her recently again at a party and told her I liked her. I'm in a new relationship now, and felt confident telling her knowing she didn't like me and thus nothing would happen. She had a quick laugh about it, saying she had no idea! And she felt flattered about the whole thing. We quickly moved on. 

However, I'm not over her. Even in my new relationship, I know horrible. I just keep getting reminded of her. When I fail to put in the effort for my partner, I will think about how easily I would put in effort for her. When my partner tells me how much they like me and I can't reciprocate, I think about my love for this other girl.

(They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

 another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away.

477,"Okay so I have this history teacher that I always appreciated (platonically). 

Even though he’s usually straightforward, direct and seemingly cold with others , he acts very nice and in a soft manner to me , especially compared to my other classmates that are addressed in a more distant and harsher way (which I guess is maybe because I seem very sensitive , shy and am very quiet most of the time).

 I really appreciate the fact that he is such a nice person so I made him a drawing to thank him for being my teacher, to which he got overly emotional (to the point where he ran in the halls to tell me he felt sentimentally touched and then pointed to me the rest of the day  when he was talking with the other teachers ) which surprised me quite a lot, but nevertheless I really appreciated it, I’m happy that he liked it.

All of these things let to me liking him a lot , but in no way is it romantic. 
Should I worry about this? I don’t wish to get disturbingly close to this person or anything, I just really admire him as a person and really wish I had a friend like him, which I know may sound very weird but I really want to know.

478,"So this started about 2 years ago where my friend Nancy (not her really name for obvious reasons) wanted to move out of boyfriend's house due to her not having feeling for him for the way he was acting , they have 2 kids in the matter of 3 years knowing each other. At first she was just being distant and of course she only stood for her kids but as time went on the husband and Nancy got into much heated arguments and she decided to move with her mother with her two kids. The kids would see the father every 3 days of the week and during those three days Nancy would work, I believe it was a shared custody officially for about a couple of months. Nancy family is pretty big and her mother was on the verge of moving out of the apartment (forced to move) so Nancy asked the baby dad to hold on the kids untill she finds a place for herself     but he didn't want to voluntarily take his kids and told her it was her problem, due to the short notice of the eviction from her mother's apartment she had no choice but to leave the kids with the baby dad ( due to him not giving Nancy the children's birth certificate and other documents she couldn't file for section 8 and really didn't have any choice.) and  not pick them up and live with me in the mean while. ( In another state) her plan is to get a better job out here and take custody of the kids but the problem is the baby dad had just emailed Nancy for her address to send paperwork for full custody. She doesnt know what to do , she wants to email him saying she's coming for the kids but needs a little more time , she's depressed every day without them but knows she need her own place for the kids . So the question is should she email the husband back ?

480,"TL;DR The accountant at my job does a very poor job of communicating when time sheets are due, to the point where I've missed 3 time sheet due dates in the past year. Would I be out of line to ask him to communicate to me via text, call/voicemail, or email when time sheets are due so I can get them turned in on time and get paid for the work I do?

So, at my job, because there less than 40 people on the pay roll, it doesn't make sense to have some sort of clock in/clock out system, so the hourly workers have to write down their hours on a time sheet and get them turned in every other week. We're supposed to get paid on the 1st and 15th of every month, and we're supposed to get out time sheets turned in to the accountant. No big deal. But, even though we're supposed to get paid on the 1st and 15th, the due dates for time sheets are very unpredictable. The time sheets for the June 1 pay date were due May 28, 4 days before we get paid. The time sheets for the June 15 pay date were due today, June 12, 3 days before the pay date. I understand that the accountant has to get the information into the computer and sent to the bank, and banks have to communicate, therefore the turn in date being a few days before the pay date.

Here's my issue. I'm a janitor. I'm all over the building. I can go a month without seeing the accountant. There are 5 of us on the maintenance/janitorial team, including my boss, who is the head maintenance guy. What normally happens is the other janitorial/maintenance people will keep their time sheets in a plastic thing on the wall in his office. It works out pretty well for them because 2 of them are his daughters, and one works with him most of the time. I, on the other hand, only have reason to go to that part of the building twice a week, in accordance with my duties in the building. The accountant will normally write on a whiteboard next to the time sheet bracket on the wall when time sheets are due. This is his only communicate he gives, with the exception of tracking him down and asking him, if he happens to know off the top of his head. Of course, I could make it a habit to go in my boss's office to check when time sheets are due. But, that's not always predictable. Sometimes, Accountant will write when time sheets are due 3 days before, sometimes the day before, sometimes he'll grab the time sheets without telling anybody. I don't keep my time sheets in the bracket, so when he does this, my time sheet isn't turned in. Normally, my co-worker will text me and let me know when she sees Accountant's note about when time sheets are due, but she can't do that If Accountant doesn't write the date on the whiteboard and just takes the timesheets.

I hate dealing with people I don't know and I know that I may need to get over it in this circumstance. Last time sheet (June 1 pay date), I had put all my hours for all of May and a few days from the end of April on the time sheet. If I don't get a time sheet turned in on time, I can just continue recording my hours for the next due date, so I don't lose hours/pay, I just get paid 2 weeks later than normal. Anyhow, with the June 1 time sheet with all my hours on it, I wrote a more saying *""Here's my phone number and email address, I check both regularly, would it be possible to text, call, or email me when time sheets are due so I can get them turned in on time?""* It was more politely worded than that, but it was just disregarded. I may need to talk to him in person about contacting me when time sheets are due.",12Jun2019,1

On April 1, 2015 ago I was in a car accident that almost ended my life my hand was amputated, crushed, and degloved, I almost bled out at the scene. They ended up putting me into a medical induced coma and air lifting me to a hospital in San Diego were my Dr was able to rebuild and reattach my hand using hardware and multiple parts from my body. It was a up hill battle to recovery, I had to forfeit everything end up becoming nearly homeless while still trying to heal. I gave in and moved back home with my dad, got approved to go back to work, things were looking up and then a month later my father committed suicide while I was home. After the traumatic year I had just been through I decided to move to Texas for my job, and even though it was a rough start at first, I have grown to love it and find love. My fiance and I had begun looking to buy a house and start putting down roots. Then on May 22nd I was at Walgreens opening my car when the medal rod that acts as my wrist and holds my hand to my arm broke in half. I immediately went to the hospital and told them what I thought had happened they took x-rays and proceeded to tell me that everything looked fine, I continue to work although in the excruciating pain. On May 29th I went to the hospital again but this time in different one, they took x-rays in this time I ask to see them in the xrays you can clearly see the bar is broken and I showed them they gave me a referral. Unfortunately the place they referred me to wouldn't take me, due to insurance. On June 4th I went to a different hospital were they give me a referral of somebody that could take me regardless of insurance. They told me they would call me they never did I ended up having to go in there and knocking on the nurses door in order to talk to somebody to get an appointment because I couldn't get through to anybody on the phone finally they gave me an appointment and had a surgeon talk to me. The surgeon that talk to me gave my 3 options all of which my quality of life worse, he say he didn't want to do anything more invasive due to the fact you is not the one that rebuilt my hand. My fiancé and I have discussed things and we I've decided the best course of action is to relocate back to California so my original surgeon can see me again, unfortunately this means dropping everything here picking up and just leaving, meanwhile I haven't been able to work since the 29th.

Needless to say I need help but idk what I should put for a title or what part my my story I should include or exclude. I am not the best writer nor am I good at asking people for money. Any tips/ advice would greatly be appreciated.

We are set to hear some organizational announcements in a few weeks time. This could mean another restructure for my team. Boss might not be my boss for long, but it is very unclear at this stage.

In my normal workday, I work about 80-90% of the time. I check my personal email or read some news outside of lunch or breaks.

487,"So for a brief background, I worked for a local restaurant about 3 years ago when I first started college. I could only take about 4 months of working there as the owner, his sister, and another employee bullied me into quitting. I would routinely go home crying because they made me feel so worthless. I was young and I definitely made some mistakes while working there, but nothing to warrant the treatment that I received. When I finally worked up the nerve to quit, I told him that I was putting in my two weeks. He told me that I didn’t have to work the full two weeks, but just the remainder of my schedule. 

Fast forward to today, I am starting my first job as an RN. Part of my onboarding process is to have employment verification from a previous job. My onboarding coordinator asked me to have my former boss write a letter stating my dates of employment. I dreadfully, but respectfully called and asked if he could do this for me. The girl on the phone was so sweet and asked me if it would be okay if I gave my coordinator the restaurant number instead and he could give her the information over the phone. I told her I would ask if that was okay, but if not would he be alright with writing the letter if they needed something on file. She gave the phone to my ex-boss, and he said “they can call up here but I’m not going out of my way for you. You quit without notice (completely false) 3 years ago so I’m not doing anything for you.” I said “okay that’s fine, sorry for wasting your time” and hung up the phone. I am terrified that I am going to lose my position over this. Any thoughts on how I should approach this situation going forward?

492,"So, as the title says I have an interview today (it’s over the phone, and then we’ll schedule an in person interview as well).

493,"My younger brother graduated with a college degree (communications &amp; PR, lol, I did warn him before we went into it...) almost 4 years ago. He hasn't had any work, aside from a part time thing he does for &lt;20 hours a week. It has no future and doesn't develop any of his skills. He has actively given up looking for serious employment. Nobody will hire someone like this for full-time work (that also has long term prospects). He lives with my parents and continues to stagnate.

I have tried to interest him in doing something creative. Or something small and self-run to earn money. I have offered to teach him how to do a lot of different one man ventures on the web, or creative endeavors using a variety of platforms (eg, self-publish novels to Amazon). Just, y'know, anything. People have suggested he goes back to school. He has a lack of interest or motivation to change his situation and none of these have so far panned out. Talking him about any of this usually quickly degrades into shouting matches. He's become very defensive about it.

I'm not exactly sure what I should be doing, because his lifestyle isn't healthy for anyone. Has anyone successfully changed a situation like this that can offer advice?",12Jun2019,1

495,"I currently live with my parents [50s MF], and brothers [25M and 15M]. My older brother and I attend the same university and the same exact program.

My relationship with my family is strained to say the least. It got to a point where I moved out for six months just to avoid the family turmoil. For background purposes, we're a traditional Asian family -- very conservative and very Christian. Our relationships mainly soured because my dad is a big narcissist, and a perfectionist at that. Nothing I do is ever good enough (sprinkled with some sexist ""I am a woman thus X Y and Z are my jobs""), yet my older brother, who resents me, gets praised for breathing. As a result of not feeling even respected as a daughter/human at home, I became very rebellious; got piercings, started drinking, etc. As a family we've met pastors, counsellors, and older family relatives in order to try not to be at each other's throats constantly, but to be honest I've given up on them.

I attend university at my parents' 9 cents. I'd say dime, but it's technically not the case. I do work and pay for the house, my parents car (I'm only allowed a moped), and utilities + their credit cards sometimes. All this despite the fact that I'm not allowed to have a bank account (and they keep my motorcycle licence and passport with them). My parents cover some 60% of my tuition fees (the equivalent of $200 USD per month) and the rest come from scholarships. My older brother is in the same boat but working on his internship and saving up to move out instead. 

Going to my university makes me sick. Literally. I resent everything about my course (IT) but I wasn't allowed to choose a course to begin with. I tried to convince my parents to let me take a different course (Law) but that didn't go well. Over the last 2 semester, my emotional and mental health went further and further down as a result of being in a program that makes me want to slam my head on the desk every time I go inside that computer lab. I ended up being hospitalized more and more frequently because of this and other issues. I can attribute this to the fact that my advisor is a sadist. He doesn't care if you have the prerequisite courses for a specific course or if it's the appropriate level for you. I've taken senior level courses when I was only a freshman. He also made me take a senior course when I was a sophomore that required me to basically create a fully functioning system with pretty complex legal and financial reports to go alongside it (like a business proposal + all the local legalities), working in a group of 3 people where no one did anything and I nearly worked myself to death to deliver a half-complete project. I had to learn everything (local law, business finance, web page programming) from scratch within a period of 4 weeks with no help.

Another thing in my university is my ex. He was cruel, emotionally, physically and sexually abusive, and the university basically took his side when I finally built up courage to report him. He's extremely charming and good at manipulating people and situations. I mean, he straight up lied to the university counsellor minutes after kicking my arm to the point of spraining, 2 hours before my final exam and said I was the crazy one. What's more is that he's in the course that I always wanted to take, so I always got involved in his faculty's programs, which I can't do now because of the bs that he pulled. He basically made me look like a fucking crazy bitch while he was innocent (when in reality I was fucking right, he was cheating, he gaslit me to the high heavens, and everyone fucking knew it and testified).

Last year, my ex sicked his aunts after me. I'm talking at least 5 50-60+ year old Asian aunties looking to fight an 18-year old. That was terrifying since he actually comes from a pretty known political family. He told everyone I was crazy (even those that witnessed him physically assaulting me). He ruined his own reputation in the campus and he blamed it on me again, and he tries to sick every newcomer on me. He even tried to pull my friends away. Many people dislike him now knowing the truth, but he's the type to like attention, so he goes up on stage a lot and puts on a show like he's innocent.

I've been eating my own head trying to transfer out of this place for months now, but due to financial reasons, I can't. The most affordable place and uni I can find are collectively $1000 USD per month (all inclusive even rent and utilities, transport, food, phone). I'm a foreigner where I live and cannot go back home to my own country (I've tried many times especially for college. I even already had a company willing to hire me in arrangement with a university, my parents barred me last minute from going). I can't just up and leave my family because legally speaking even though I am an adult in age, I'm female and under their care. I've been stuck in this country/position for 12+ years, my family back home has all but died off (last grandparents died from neglect of our relatives in 2016 and 2017, no aunts or uncles from my father's side, only uncle on my mother's side is in prison).

I'm very suffocated. I told my parents that I don't mind stopping studying, but they're adamant that I finish ASAP. If I could stop and just work, I would but legally speaking, I can't. Technically I already breached that clause in my visa (saying I can work a max of 10 hours a week) many times because I was a shadow employee at a school for 1 semester until they found a permanent employee. I worked 8 hours a day for 5 days a week at one point in that semester.

Anyway, I need to find another job soon at least to supplement some health expenses, but the only available opening is at a local media centre... where my ex works. I've literally looked in the radius of town that my little moped can take me. Since I'm a foreigner, I cant work at Tescos/7 Eleven/a gas station. To be fair I have a few friends already working at the centre as well, but my ex talks. A lot. And as much as I've tried to pretend he never existed to begin with, I've already had people coming up to me with the gossip he spread and emotionally it's very taxing. I even ended up leaving the church. And I'm 100% serious that the university did jack shit about the things he did to me.

All of this, putting aside my own internal crippling issues (diagnosed manic depression, BPD, CPTSD, generalised anxiety last year) that I can't afford medication/counselling for... and I'm stuck in a rut. I do have seasonal friends. Since my uni is a boarding school, many of them do leave for term breaks. And since I'm a junior now, and most of my friends are in my level, we're getting busier every semester. In terms of having a social life, I don't really have a problem with how things are.

Honestly, if I have to stay at my current uni, I will very probably not make it to the end of the semester. I don't mean that to be threatening harm to myself, but being there is driving me crazy and driving my body into the hospital. I already took last fall semester off because I already had a suicidal episode. This past spring semester, I actually zombied the whole semester; felt nothing, picked fights, lived half dead most of the time, grades dropped, absences went critical. I literally lost 13% of my body weight in a month at one point due to stress and even though I was eating noodles and bread every day. The next month, I got migraines so bad I ended up having temporary blindness in one eye for 2 days. And I was getting sick every couple of weeks, super nauseated every night that I was sick. I don't even want to imagine what will happen in this upcoming fall semester if nothing gets better.

So sorry for the walls of text. I know I rambled, and probably it doesn't seem like a big deal to some people, but these problems are very real to me to the point where it does affect my physical health. I have a lot of learning to be patient/kind myself, but for things that are beyond my control, I'm not sure what to even imagine starting to do.",12Jun2019,2

So, my mom let my sister (23) borrow our switch and our games which all add up to around $690, she sold all of them about a month or two ago, and has been ghosting all of us, I try to reach out to her and get our money back, but she just ignores us. Is there anything that I can do to get this money back? She lives two hours away and I can’t drive. She’s has lied to us for months. So it’s a good reason to be mad right?
My mom won’t do anything about this and she’s the one who let her borrow it. 
This is what I just texted her maybe 10 minutes ago.


“Savannah dude, this is stupid. I’ve given you 10+ days to text me back. You’ve ghosted all of us, and you’re being a genuine coward. You owe us $690. Text me back, because YOU are dragging this on, instead of texting us back, and saying “Hey! Can’t pay y’all this day, how about next day” super simple, and don’t just drop off the face of the earth again. You are in your twenties Savannah, you should have at least texted me back, had some human decency. Youre what? 23? You have a job that pays $1200 every two weeks, you’re the only who can and will fix your mistake. You didn’t even apologize to ANYONE about this, which is childish by the way. This whole thing IS childish, you’re an ADULT Savannah! A whole adult! How would you feel if someone borrowed something of yours and sold it? Pretty angry huh? Put yourself in our shoes, and don’t be like “I’m an adult I can do what I want” or whatever, yeah you’re an adult, you should have better common knowledge! We literally told you not to sell it so many times! SO MANY TIMES! At this point I don’t care if you were broke at that point, you shouldn’t have sold it. I genuinely cannot believe you did that. Text me back, don’t be like “haha sorry at work” and then don’t ever respond.

504,"I'm a single parent and student with two years of school left. My lease on my current apartment expires at the end of August. I had planned, pending this place was going to become too expensive, to move into on-campus housing for students with families when my lease is up, as it would be lower rent and all expenses would be included in that rent. When I toured a couple weeks ago, they had units that were still available for the following school year. I just got my notice from my current apartment about rental rate increases with renewal and was going to put in my application.  

I contacted the student w/ family housing and they said that now all units are full and there is a waitlist pending any cancellations for units. If I paid the $200 fee and put in the application, I'd be on a waitlist only. 

Some quick facts:

1) My rent, should I go month to month waiting for an on-campus unit, would be going up $435.  

2) If no units came available at the start of the semester, another wave would probably open up for December or January.

3) I do NOT have money set aside to be putting toward a large deposit. (Again, single mom, student.) These apartments require no deposit and would have ensured stability while I finish school.  Can't say the same for any other place I've looked at.

My budget is already stretched paper thin with a rent increase. Like, good luck eating nothing but ramen (me personally -- my son comes first) paper thin. 

Is it better to renew for the year and take an increase that's bad, or not renew, take a month-to-month rate that would be ridiculous manage and hope for a cancellation... or at least try to survive until the end of the year -- and pay the application fee now?

For background, I'm a 22/m recent college grad working in tech. I've always had a sort of lacking connection to my peers throughout school and the divide has deepened since graduating. 

I find that when I'm hanging out with younger friends (current students) I can easily be myself joke around, provide mentorship, etc. I've held leadership positions in various clubs and sports teams so I'm familiar with that dynamic.

Similarly, when I'm hanging out with older friends (most of my coworkers are mid to late 20s and older) I'm comfortable being myself, but definitely a different side of myself. I listen more, ask questions, and generally just look to learn from them.

However, when I try to hang with people my own age I feel like I just dont know how to be myself. Theres no defined dynamic due to the similar ages and for some reason that means I just get anxious, quiet, or irritated.

Our relationship is... different, I say this because she lives 3500kms away in another state and we visit one an on other every 4 months.  We have been so happy since March 31st 2018 when this all began over 1 year ago. Our relationship took a huge turn for the worst around 2 months ago when we had a huge argument and decided to take a break from each other for a few days.

514,"TL;DR at the bottom. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hey, y'all. I want to preface this by saying that it's hard for me to really know exactly what I'm so ""aaaahhhhh"" about, so this may be a bit ramble-y. Apologies in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an 18-year-old male, going to start my sophomore year of college in the fall. I'm studying communication and might want to go into news broadcasting or production of some kind. I currently have an internship with a local news station and I enjoy doing the promotions for it, but I also really want to be in front of the camera. 

Theoretically, maybe I would want to be an anchor for a large news organization like CNN. I'm not passionate about local news and I don't want to do production anymore - sitting in a dark room and pressing a few buttons for a career doesn't seem that fun to me. 

The other issue is that I absolutely hate NYC, but I would likely have to move there if I worked as an anchor with CNN's main office. So my possible career path is conflicted with where I would likely have to live. 

It's a super stressful situation though because there isn't a ton of money in this field, as far as I can tell. Our 70+-year-old newsman told me not to go into this field because, ""nobody in this building makes any money."" So it's either make it big and move to NYC, or not be very financially comfortable. This contradiction is terrifying but I don't want to give up on my major and my possible plan. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been dating my girlfriend for about four and a half months now and I really like her and enjoy spending time with her. She's my first girlfriend but I do really want this relationship to work out. I have no reason why it wouldn't right now. But even typing this out has me a bit uncomfortable because I am so terrified of commitment. It took WEEKS for me to even get over my fear of fucking things up and finally asking her out. 

On the other hand, she seems to be okay with commitment. She's able to say things about ""in a few years"" and that kind of thing, and I want to be able to do that too, but I simply can't and I'm frustrated with myself. I have no intention of breaking up with her and I really want this relationship to last for a long time, but I can't even picture my own future so it's tough to picture something that I don't even have 100% planned for myself. I also don't want to make her change her plans for me, if things do work out. She might want to stay in the state where we go to school and work, but if things work out between us one of us is going to have to live somewhere we don't want to. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so terrified of commitment and it's exhausting. I want to be able to get over that fear of the future and the fact that I don't know what the fuck to do anymore. I can't even commit to a future for myself, much less one of building a life together with another person. And I know the relationship is super young, I'm not really asking if the relationship will work out or whatever. My primary concern is the fact that I am terrified of any sort of commitment with relationships or with my career and I want to get over that. 

&amp;#x200B;

How can I get over my fear of commitment so that I can best live my life? How can I work to get over this fear of making a plan and become more emotionally available? I don't know why I'm protecting my heart so much from someone that I trust. This is frustrating and I'm sick of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR - I am terrified of commitment and I don't know how to get over that fear. I can't even picture my future past the next 3-4 years and I want to be able to look forward to a career and loving relationship, but I am emotionally blocked for some reason that I can't pinpoint or overcome. How can I overstep this?",12Jun2019,1
515,"Grandfather died late Friday night, I took Saturday, Sunday and Monday off from work. As soon as I made the call they told me that I'd need to bring something back from the funeral as proof, and I'm pretty sure my employer thinks I'm lying about it.

My grandpa was always an.... Interesting person.... And some of his last requests that my family followed through with have made it difficult for me to prove anything

Due to a combination of his personal requests, family tradition, and a bit of his frugality he was burried at home (he lived out in the country) without the assistance of a funeral home. There wasn't a church service, no obituary posted in the paper, he had a very small funeral with only a few of his immediate family members and close friends. My grandmother ran everything, Fortunately she made a small funeral program/obituary thing on her computer she printed out that I kept for proof.

They said I either need something signed by the funeral home, which I can't get, or a death certificate and I need to bring it in today or tomorrow.

For context:

I put friends in quotations because I was basically the scapegoat for the group of girls I called my friends at the time. It was very much a clique situation, where Jen was the 'alpha' and would pick a different girl every week to make their life miserable. It usually alternated between me and my friend Caitlyn (name changed) for who would get the abuse. Things like: if you were the last one to the group at lunch, there ""weren't enough spots in the car"" so you had to eat lunch alone, she would start group chats without you in them just to make you feel left out, you couldn't confide in her about anything because she would tell other people to gain THEIR trust and one time I bought her her favourite café drink before school just to be nice and she picked it up, walked it over to the garbage and dumped it in without even taking a sip. She was power hungry for sure, and a very 'subtle' bully as most thing she did were extremely psychological - made you feel like nobody liked you, that you were the last choice, etc.

After we graduated high school, the rest of the girls in that group went through a giant revelation where they realized that, now that they're not forced to hang out with Jen 5 times a week, they don't *have* to be friends. They all effectively and immediately dumped her from their lives. We also all ended up going to different Universities. Honestly, even though I was the one who usually got the shit end of the stick from Jen, I was the only one who stuck around from our original friend group. After she moved away from home to go to her university, she got a *lot* nicer and slowly started opening up to me. Her home life had been extremely abusive (physical, emotional, and psychological from her father) and I think her time at school, the only time she was allowed out of her house, she was trying to regain power because she was so helpless and hurt at home. Yeah, it sucks that the people around her had to go through what she put them through but she started going on medication and going to therapy and I saw a huge improvement in our friendship. 

I kept pretty close to her throughout my years at university, but only really through text as I never visited during holidays. I told her a LOT about *why* I never visit, which is 100% because my family is extremely, extremely toxic and abusive and every time I go home I usually slip back into old patterns of self-harm. Not only this, but I opened up to her about my diagnoses (bipolar disorder originally, then BPD), going on meds, going to therapy, and she was a pretty good listener. The main topics whenever I reached out to her honestly were about my mom (who is a whole other story in terms of narcissism and undiagnosed mental illnesses) and how my mental health affects my life now (as I usually have pretty short, unstable relationships). I *always* make sure that it's okay that I open up to her before I unload anything, and most of the time she usually asks me outright what's happening with me, and attempts to offer advice. I was always there for her too, whenever she needed, but she is an extremely private person who really does not open up much.

I noticed over the last year, Jen has been slipping back into the person I knew her as in high school. This person who makes my life miserable by tearing me down, no matter what I say. That every time I text her, I end up feeling in a super negative mood and I feel like shit about my entire life. It even started getting to the point where she would blatantly tell me she thinks I'm lying about situations (""I'm sure it didn't happen like that""), invalidating my experiences and beginning to side with my mother. In the 8 years she has known me, 4 of those where we lived in the same city and SAW the abuse I went through, she has *never* taken the side of my abuser before so this past bit has come as a shock. She tells me she's ""just being honest, lol"" and that I should ""consider things from every perspective"". She has become condescending and making me feel that I am a bratty, dramatic child who has no idea how to handle life or situations. 

I know this is getting very long so I'm going to just cut to the point now - basically, after our last conversation (about 2 weeks ago), where she again sided with my mother about something she was doing that was hurting me, I ended up sitting down and just reflecting to myself. *What do I get out of this friendship? Why am I putting so much effort into a friendship that doesn't bring me happiness? Is this friendship a productive use of my time and feelings? Could I see this getting any better if I were to speak with her about it?* In the end, I just blocked her (because I knew if I told her about how I was feeling she would just tell me I'm overreacting and that I'll 'get over it'). I didn't give her any warning, after 8 years of 'friendship', I just outright blocked her number. She doesn't have any social media aside from snapchat which she barely uses, where I deleted her.

Now, 2 weeks later (and these 2 weeks were *so* peaceful), I just received a snap from her. I didn't read it, I just deleted it and blocked her there too. I can only assume that she JUST realized I had blocked her phone number and was trying to say something, but I didn't want to hear it. I can't help but feel so, so incredibly guilty and like the worst person in the world. I know what I was doing was for the best in terms of my mental health and wellbeing, but I still feel like a terrible person. I know that talking to her about it wouldn't have done any good, but I just feel sick to my stomach knowing that, even though she put me through hell for so long, I might be causing her a little emotional distress too. I just don't know what to do. I don't want to reach out to her to explain what happened because I think that'll set me back all the progress I made. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Bullied badly by a girl in my 'friend' group all throughout high school. Find out she was abused all throughout her time at home, and we stay friends while we both pursue uni degrees in separate cities. Over the last year, she has reverted back to her bullying ways (siding with my abusers, invalidating my mental health, etc) and I decided enough is enough and blocked her. I can't stop feeling guilty and like \*I\* am the bad person in this scenario.",12Jun2019,1

519,"To give you some context:

* I am a male and my best friend identifies as a lesbian.
* We are both in relationships.
* She and my significant other (s.o.) have been close for a long time.

(I will call my s.o. Sarah and my best friend Kaitlyn)

So yesterday was my 21st birthday. My s.o. and stayed with my best friend to celebrate; we just hung out and drank a lot. Both my friend and I drank more than we ever have. When Sarah went to bed, Kaitlyn and I went into her room so that we wouldn't keep Sarah up. As we hung out and talked, we gradually just ended up laying on each other. At some point she did that ""let me see who's hands are bigger"" thing and we started holding hands. We laid there talking, cuddling, and holding hands for at least 30 minutes and then went to bed.

This morning when I got up, we never mentioned it. Kaitlyn made it very clear that she ""remembers everything"", but we never talked about the elephant in the room. As I said before, Kaitlyn identifies as a lesbian and has been in a long-term monogamous relationship as long as I have. It is possible that what happened last night is platonic, but she is *not* a touchy person so the fact that she made the move to hold hands has me confused.

I know that we were drunk so I don't feel particularly bad about it happening, but I have never been in this situation before. I don't want it to be this weird unspoken thing, but I also don't want to bring it up and make things weird if it wasn't a big deal.

Should I talk to Kaitlyn? Should I talk to Sarah? And if I talk to either, *what the hell do I say??*",12Jun2019,3
520,"My youngest sister has been in an abusive relationship with her boyfriend for the past year. We just found out he's been physically abusing her because of recent events. He gets very jealous, has trust issues and is controlling and manipulative. He made her give him all her passwords because he constantly thought she was cheating on him and talking to other guys on social media. She ended up deleting all her accounts just to give him reassurance but he still finds something to argue about. This has been ongoing for the duration of their relationship and she has tried multiple times trying to break up with him, but he guilts her by saying how he wouldn't be able to live without her and that he'd kill himself if they broke up. This past Saturday is where their relationship culminated. She was over his house, they got into an argument and she left. He got into his car, followed her and threatened her over the phone as he tailgated her the entire time. She didn't want to come home in fear that he would hurt our family (he carries a firearm wherever he goes) so she called our dad to help her. My dad got in his car, caught up to him and proceeded to tailgate him. My sister went home. They stopped at a traffic light where my dad pulled up real close beside him and glared at him even though his(my sisters bf) windows were tinted. He drove home and my dad turned around and called the cops. My sister admitted he had been abusing her and showed my dad the bruises.  Her bf was arrested but got out on bail the day after. 
Ever since, I've been having violent thoughts about beating the ever living shit out of him until his face is unrecognizable. My anger levels have been off the charts and I don't know how to cope with it. I find myself constantly imagining myself confronting him and giving all the pain he inflicted on my sister back to him but I can't because I'd be the one going to jail. 
If there's anyone else out there who has gone through something similar, how did you deal with the violent thoughts and negative emotions? I don't feel like myself and I'm reaching my boiling point. Any advice would be helpful.",12Jun2019,2
521,"Hi everyone.  My friend from college, who currently lives out of state, suffers from severe anxiety and depression.  They take prescription anxiety medication and are tempted to over-use them every night. In the midst of up to several panic attacks a day, these urges to self-harm and self-medicate to harmful or life-threatening levels are sometimes too much for them to deal with.  They often have feelings that everything is pointless because they will never get better and that they are worthless and better off dead. 

I care about their well-being and I do my best to support them every day.  I try to offer constant emotional support, a sense of security and positive validation as well as advice and honesty.  But it’s becoming clear that my words alone only act as temporary relief of their symptoms, but do nothing to stop their struggles from reemerging. 

Because of this, I have told them that I think it would be good if they sought out more help.  Their mom always offers to help but they fights her off and blame me for reaching out to their mother myself.  Similarly to this, they have become increasingly toxic and outwardly combative, even towards those who are reaching out to them, including myself.  They currently rarely talk to an unhelpful, unreliable, and overly-expensive therapist but have to see someone in that group to be able to get support from an neurology institution for their migraines.  They refuse to have their medication regulated by anyone and they are deathly afraid of professional hotlines and doctors because of horror stories they have heard about mental health institutions. They say they would rather die than go though that. 

I am reaching out to you, the good people of reddit r/advice, because I would appreciate any and all input on possible ways for me to help them or for them to help themself. 

Any advice?",12Jun2019,1
522,"I’m in a weird predicament and I really need an outside opinion. (Sorry if there’s weird formatting I’m on mobile.) Also sorry if this is bad writing.

So my boyfriend (A) and I have been dating for a year but we’ve known each other since my freshman year of high school. My boyfriends “ex” friend (C)  use to date me back in high school and it ended on really bad terms around 2014. During that time a girl (D) who was really into C didn’t appreciate that I was talking crap about the way he was and what he’d do when he was with me. Ds solution was for me to meet her at the park and fight her. Mind you, I’ve never talked to her but this girl hates me a weird amount to the point she’s crying when yelling at me in the hall because I smiled at her. (Yes I liked instigating but mainly because she would talk mad crap about me for no reason.) Well my dad seen this and talked to me about what was going on and had me talk to the VP. D got called in and I’m almost certain they threatened her graduation because she was a senior and I was a sophomore at the time. 
In 2018 C hit me up trying to apologize and be friends again and that he felt guilty of the way things ended. So we become friends again! I forgive the dude and we hangout a couple times, and that’s how A and I start talking. I felt super guilty and I didn’t know how to break it to C. I felt like it was a huge betrayal on my part and his friends. Eventually C finds out by going through As phone and stops talking to A and I.  (I offered a solution that maybe A and I shouldn’t date because a girl isn’t worth losing a friend over and I even tried talking to C to see if I could fix it. A didn’t want to lose me and figured C needs to grow up and be happy for him. that didn’t work.)
So this is where it gets weird!  Awhile back A’s mom was nice enough to let friend D stay at their house because she got kicked out of her house when she was impregnated by C. A’s mom is very attached to C and D’s kid so they would stop by to drop him off every once in a while. Now it’s only D who drops him off because C is still mad.

Knowing this I’ve tried talking to D about what happened in high school to see if we could make amends because I don’t think it’s fair to A to pick sides. Well it was a bad decision and she starts getting mad and aggressively talking to me saying she didn’t give a shit what I had to say. Later that day A gets a text from her saying if I ever pull that “elephant in the room” shit again she’s going to fuck me up then ended with “this is a warning.” A hid it from me for a good while and eventually I found out and tell A that that isn’t right and I don’t know if I can be in a relationship where I get lied to and threatened by this girl who’s too comfortable with him. It’s not fair to me that I have to deal with this when I never had an issue with her and she wants to be immature. So he blocked her on everything instead of talking to her. (I never asked him to do that, only to defend me because I clearly can’t when she isn’t willing to listen to what I have to say.) There was other time she was super rude to me when she was over but I always ignore her. Eventually she comes over on A’s birthday and she asked why she can’t send him stuff and he told her “I dont like that you’re at odds with my girlfriend. I don’t know what you thought would come of threatening her.” She didn’t say anything apparently. (I wasn’t there.)

Well the other night she comes over and decided to stay to hangout with A and their other friend, but I’m there. I put everything together for us to hangout not including her and my mood was completely ruined. I really don’t know how to go about this. It makes me super uncomfortable that she comes over uninvited when I’m there mainly because she always tries throwing shade at me. I also don’t know what A could do and I’m already completely devastated that he lost one of his best friends because of me. So what do I do at this point?",12Jun2019,1

529,"So this is not my first time working full time. I have worked full time for several of the summer camps I have worked at before. I however just finished college and now will be working full time for the next 35-40 years as long as nothing crazy happens like I win a ton of money or end up hurting myself real bad. Working full time up until this point hadn't bugged me as much. Maybe its because I knew it would be over at some point? Though I personally think its because those summer camps are just a lot of fun, both for the kids and their counselors. Those camps I worked where for the City I grew up in and now I am interning with that same city in the Parks and Recreation department. The building with my office has the one of the camps I worked at just down the hall. The kids that remember me always  wave high. But now I am stuck here behind a desk doing a lot of things. I became a rec major with hoping to avoid this kind of work. I mean it is unavoidable in any job I realize that. I just dont want to spend all day doing it. Even then I dont think I would have much of an issue. Where i really have issue is the loss of free time. Perhaps that may sound entitled but hear me out for a second. Regardless of what you believe we are only us once. Regardless if we die and go to heaven, die and reincarnate, die and become cosmic space dust, or any other result, you are only you once. Why the hell would I want to spend 30 years taking 40 hours of each week to do something I might not want to do, even more for my generation since we are living longer, when I could use that free time to continue teaching myself to draw, mountain biking, reading or whatever. I mean I understand how that sounds, entitled, especially when its only a relatively recent development that humans get much free time at all.  I think I am only feeling this way because I am not particularly enjoying myself behind a desk as I have worked full time and gone to school and worked part time before so I am not to unfamiliar with the lack of free time. Its just...idono why spend my time doing this menial work when I could spend it expanding upon my other skills that I enjoy, yet am not good enough at to make a living off of.

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding might have been nothing) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then look away to carry on putting her scarf on.

We still live very close and see each other very often. My main concern right now is that she doesn’t respect me as my own person. She’s always in my business. When she’s in our apartment she’s always trying to go in our bedroom or look at my mail and a few times she’s driven by my office to see if I was actually at work when I told her I was. She does stuff like this all the time. 

More recently my mother has been disobeying my wishes when she’s with my one year old and doing things I’ve explicitly said not to. This includes feeding him cheese and cows milk (he’s been lactose intolerant since birth), not strapping the car seat base into the car, not buckling him in his seat right and other things. Of course seeing my mom do these things and completely ignore me when I asked her not to really encouraged my sisters. One sister is even to the point that when I ask her not to do something she’ll look me in the eyes and do exactly what I told her not to. 

My sisters are both teenagers. They live with my parents. I’ve repeatedly asked my mom for help dealing with them since the straight up ignore me And she refused. Her exact words were “what makes you think they’ll listen to me?” I then asked how I can trust them to watch my child when I’m not around. My mom then said I’m a bad parent, I shouldn’t be trusted with him and if I don’t stop worrying about “silly little things like these” I will have a heart attack. She practically dared me to stop talking to her and stop bringing the baby around them so that’s what I’ve been doing. 
I haven’t seen or heard from them in one week then I get this text from my mom: I thought I could give you the time/space you needed foregoing time with [one year old]-but turns out I can NOT. I miss him terribly and need to snuggle him pronto!  Please let me know when he’s available. 

We should all meet on a separate occasion to air grievances, and discuss moving forward. Until then, [he]  is just too precious to not see and spend time with.

I’m pretty sure this bullshit but I don’t know what to do. She never listens to me, she never resolves any issues just forgets about them. There’s no way I can trust her to talk to my sisters or even change her behavior. How do I move forward?


TLDR; my mom called me a bad mom and told me I’m not fit to have my own child because I voiced my concerns about the way she and my sisters watch him.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I have a shit pc. It's literally an old laptop, I think like my second one I've ever had since I was 10, and \*cannot\* handle high-quality games.

&amp;#x200B;

It can barely run medium games. I never even noticed how bad it was until recently, whereas I have very low frames. Beyond that, I can't play great games I own like fallout 4 or Aragami, or TF2 at higher quality with better frames. I have like 3200 hours on Team Fortress 2, most as the spy, meanwhile I'm only decent at most classes, and shit at spy. Any kills I get are pretty much dumb luck with my frames/lag, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I need a laptop purely for gaming. But also for holding some files, such as gaming files and photos. I have a folder literally named ""backgrounds"" for my background slideshow, and tons of photos saved. I have like 5 GB of porn images/gifs, and other photos I love, like, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, the reason I need a gaming LAPTOP is because I don't want to have to unplug, and move my computer and not be able to use it when I get an apartment rather than living at my mothers house, or moving around.

I also am currently no where near being in that phase where I always upgrade my actual desktop computer with the best stuff. I'd gladly do that in the future, but currently, I'm only 18, and don't even have a job.

Again, max price probably 1000$, but preferably less cause I'm not sure how much money my mother would actually spend for me. And it's not like I need a supercomputer. I'm just 18 and game constantly, I just want something really good.

I want to play Fallout 4 in a good quality, The Evil Within with a good quality, Team Fortress 2 with great quality,  Aragami with good quality, etc.

540,"This will be a long question- just to make sure that I get accurate answers. I'll give some background information but as summarised as possible. I HAVE NEVER BEEN THIS CONFUSED ABOUT ANY OF MY MATES. I'd appreciate everyone's take on this. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-I'm 28 (identify as a bi man) and I recently became good friends with a 23 yr old (identifying as a straight male- told me he was previously curious but he's over it now). 

&amp;#x200B;

\-I am a manager and he works at the same company as a ground level staff member. (I don't usually differentiate but I think it might have something to do with our friendship)

&amp;#x200B;

We became friends this year and it quickly transpired that there's some sort of connection and that we are meant to be best friends. He opens up to me in person and I do the same - he likes boundaries on this though. He said that he's never felt this close to anyone and I'm the only person that he can open up to. He went through some difficult times last year and almost took his life. 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently started reflected on our friendship and found some things strange - 

1. He tells me that he is a very private person and prefers to be alone but he is always asking his other friends to hang out (which they don't) and when we hang out, I have to be the one to ask or initiate it. He will also never invite me to hang out with his friends- it's always alone with him. His one friend actually tried reaching out to me to hang out and he lost it cause it was weird, and why would I be friends with his friends. So I left it and told him to do introductions- which he keeps avoiding. It's as if his friends are one circle and I'm the other circle and he doesn't want these circles to connect. 
2. He tells me that he isn't one for chatting on the phone (I'll wait about 12 hours to get a reply on a straightforward WhatsApp message) but another friend or even some stranger that messages him from a group he's part of would get a response within minutes (I noticed this while hanging out with him). 
3. He has had moments with me where he opened up so much that he started crying about feelings etc but the next day things will be back to square one. 
4. He would be cold towards me while hanging out and barely speak and when someone else joins the conversation, he'll do a 180 and ask about their day and laugh etc. I barely get asked about my day or what's happening in my life. 
5. When we sit somewhere next to each other and my leg accidentally touches his leg, he would not talk to me for about a day but if someone else touches him, he is chilled. He even goes as far as to winking to other guys as a joke or calling them sexy- then they laugh about it and it's chilled. 
6. When something exciting happens in his life, he messages the friends who ignore him but I need to find out about it when we see each other and I actually ask him about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

The list goes on but as I'm typing it, I'm struggling to put the actions into words as it just sounds silly. The point is, he keeps telling me that he wants to be best friends and that he appreciates me more than anyone else but as soon as something small happens which he deems weird, I get ignored. It got to a stage where I told him we should end the friendship but he said that he didn't want that and that he wants me in his life etc. I stayed. Whenever I try to make the friendship work, he focuses on other people and when I try to let go, he focuses on me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is it a friend worth keeping or am I being used? Could something possibly have happened in his life that makes him cold towards me but warm towards those who don't want any connection and just want to keep things superficial? Why am I, the person he feels comfortable with and can open up to, being treated this way and the people who has no interest in him being treated like royalty?",12Jun2019,1

543,"I think it's safe to say that we are on the age of social media, and every facet of our lives is, in a way, governed by how the majority acts online, especially how one should act in a relationship. 

A bit of background: I am not a social media type of guy; I surf from time to time and the vast majority of my likes on instagram, twitter and facebook are memes and posts on subjects I'm interested in (games, sports, the environment, the works). I rarely post content of my own and reply to others'. 

I guess it's safe to say that my girlfriend goes on my social media accounts from time to time (she doesnt have access to it but she can see what I favorite or react to) and she has problems with what I like or favorite or what not, not because what I like or favorite is inappropriate but because I like or favorite others' tweets and post but not hers. Please don't get me wrong; it's not that I don't like her tweets, it's just that I find others' tweets funnier than hers? (But whenever she posts something that makes me chuckle, imma heart that shit). And whenever she rants on twitter, I already knew what it was about (cause we talk all the time) so I don't see why I should still acknowledge her problems online when I've already talked to her about it? Also, she mad because I don't post photos of us on social media when she knows that I'm not that type of person who posts in the first place (altho I do post us from time to time).

She called me out on it and I lashed out cause I find it controlling.

Am I wrong?

TLDR: GF is mad because I like others' post on social media, somehow ignored some of hers because I don't relate to them as much (but I do like some of hers when I relate to them). I got mad because it seemed too controlling. Am I wrong? Help me out, guys.",12Jun2019,1

(i’m 17, super slim so i really just assumed i’m not strong enough) he said he’s met others just like me that can. 

this can’t be something i should be concerned about right ? anyway, any of u have suggestions on how to fix this and if you’ve maybe had a similar issue or know someone that has ? i know its odd but now i’m kindaaaa concerned. i have anxiety so i know i’m most likely overreacting but i simply can’t help it!!

552,"Before I spill the tea, I need to shed a little light on the back story. 

A month ago, I (F18) was living in one of the ""rural"" parts of Alaska, and I was working for a great company. My SO (M22) was living in, and working for a small city in Alaska, miles away from me. We stayed together despite the distance, and I honestly didn't know when we would see each other next. I was okay with that fact though, because I knew this was all leading up to a good future with him. We planned that I move in with him when the timing was right. I was content with where I was at in that moment of my life. After a long minute, my place of work was having issues with paying their employees. I stuck through even when I wasn't paid on time, or paid at all. Eventually, employees were dropping like flies. Everyone was leaving, and the company was starting to fall apart. I was starting to stress out. I quit, and came back a week later to work that week, then leave again. Throughout that week though , I made the steady decision to pack everything, and not look back. 

So I left everything behind. I moved with my SO without having secured a job. For me, that was difficult. I wanted to bring something to the table, and not have to rely on anyone to take care of me. My original plan was the move in with him when I secured a job. My SO and I definitely bumped heads at that. He was convinced that he can take care of me, and that I would find a job soon. I caved, and didn't worry so much as I did before. Before I knew it, I landed a job! All was right in the world. 

Fast forward a bit, and here we are. We are both working, and slowly building a life for ourselves. Our plan was to move back to Anchorage where our families, and his dream job are located in 2-3 years. 

A week ago, my SO mentioned that his group of guys, and the maintenance guys are not getting along. Sometimes he doesn't feel like going to work because of it. I've tried helping him by coming up with solutions, but he's certain that nothing can be done. 

Here is the issue: A few days after that, my SO told me that there was an opening at his dream job. He says he's going to apply to it, and there is a chance that we could move back sooner. Now, I just started everything here. I like my job, and my coworkers love me. Just this morning I got a raise! I do not want to leave sooner than what we planned. I miss my family, and everything about Anchorage but I would like to work here a bit longer. I support my SO and his decisions. I told him if he gets the job, then he has to take it. It's an opportunity that he can't refuse! He told me that he won't accept it. That his life is with me, and even if he gets his dream job, he will be miserable without me. I trusted, and respected his decision and that was the end of the conversation. My worry is that down the road, he will regret his decision, and become miserable with me. I don't know what to do at this point. I am happy with my job, and he grows tired with his. 

Should I trust what he says? Should I push him to accept the job if they offer? He might not get a chance again, it'll probably be years before the next opening. Should I drop everything AGAIN and move back? My mind is scrambled, and I need another persons perspective. Everything is appreciated.",12Jun2019,1
553,"I'm a tutor and have to check essays that are used for homework points and then for exams. I noticed that a homework from the most difficult topic was suprisingly good, so I had the idea to check if the person copies from someone who had the same class last year and it was actually the case. After I checked the other topics it was clear that the person copies the content from the last year but changes a few words. Some paragraphs are just copypasted. 

&amp;#x200B;

The question now is if I should report it to the Prof. of the class (my boss). Different things can happen, the person can lose the points, since we have already 2/3 of the points done, he/she will then fail the class and can repeat it next year, he/she can be kicked out of the university, he/she can get a huge fine. But only the first case is very likely.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really want to destroy the nice atmosphere that have right now we the students, and I also don't want to be ""that"" guy at our chair that found a cheater and reported him/her. But cheating is morally wrong, especially at a university, its even a master degree, so the person is old enough. I have only cheated at school, but who didn't, right?

&amp;#x200B;

Contacting the person that telling him/her to ""drop out"" of the module before I report it, is also not an option because dropping out is not possible anymore.

555,"It's about V and L, (two girls)
V and L have been together for about a year i think and in that time they have broken up over L's cheating. When they got back together, L started flirting with other girls over Instagram. And V is kinda defeated about it and doesn't say anything because she loves her.

 V and i hang out sometimes, she and L have been to my house to help me to dye my hair and they were acting normal. When i hang out alone with V, all she can talk about is about how horrible L is but that she loves her. L does not know we hang out, because she doesn't like it when V is alone with other people. We alway go to a bar or town so it's not like we're alone in my room or something. She doesn't tell L, because V doesn't want L to get mad because she loves her.

L is transitioning from male to female, he is on hormones but still has the strength of a man. When V hung out with someone without telling L, L verbally assaulted her before banging V's head against the wall. V forgives her because she loves her.

He chews and spits her out about every little thing and then comes back saying how much she loves V and that she'd do anything in the world for her and all that crap, to guilttrip V into staying.

I have told her numerous times how i feel about L and she knows she should break up with her because L is a terrible person. But she's scared of L's reaction (i personally think)",12Jun2019,1
556,"Well, as the title says, I'm addicted to masturbation. I'm currently 18 years old and in a long-distance relationship with my girlfriend. I've been masturbating pretty excessively since I was around 13-14. Since that age, the porn/ the content I've been masturbating to has become more and more taboo and extreme - to the point where it makes me question whether I'm a good human being or not. It started off with just doing it to pictures of girls from school, then eventually lead to the likes of BDSM, incest, gay (I'm completely straight by the way. It just got to the point where gay porn was somehow satisfying me. That's a different story anyway.) etc. At times these taboos weren't even satisfying my needs and I just ended up feeling sexually frustrated. It was as if I needed something better. 

Due to myself being in a long-distance relationship, I obviously don't see my girlfriend as often as I'd like. But we still see each other fairly regularly. Whenever I'm with her I don't feel the need to masturbate because she'll obviously help me out with my sexual needs, and I do the same for her. All of the wild fantasies and urges to watch taboo porn genres completely disappear when I'm with her. It helps me feel a lot better about myself. But as you know, there comes a time when I have to fly back home and go back to being alone in my room with not much to do. This is where the urges and temptations come back. 

I'm also in college. But as it's now summer, I'm off for over 2 months. Whenever I have free time, such as holidays or weekends, I usually just spend them in my room on my laptop. My laptop and me having nothing to do in my free-time is what makes this so much more difficult. The fact that it's all so easy to access is really a killer. I've tried filling my free-time by doing things that I wouldn't usually, but it still ends up coming back to haunt me as it's near impossible to be busy ALL the time. 

I recently downloaded an app that helps you to stay sober. I managed to rack up 17 non-masturbation days on it. I felt great about myself. Then I eventually caved in and we're back to square one. The app doesn't help anymore and I've been trying to give myself reminders to ignore the urges, but I always seem to fail.

I'll be going to stay with my girlfriend for about 9 weeks soon, so I hope that can somehow rid me of this issue. I leave in just under 3 weeks and I'm trying to abstain myself from masturbation up until then - and by the time I'm home I hope the urges are completely gone. 

For the meanwhile, I'm just hoping some of you could offer me some advice or share your stories with me. Anything would be greatly appreciated.",12Jun2019,1

558,"I want to start by saying that I think I am a relatively good person. I try not to look down on people in my life and listen to whatever anyone has to say. I grew up in a strict Catholic household. I was bigger for most of my life. My parents hover and judge everything I do. I had a lot of issues.

I met this guy. I didn't like him at first but he grew on me. I knew he was a player but I just thought he was a young guy having fun but hes harmless, right? I knew he wanted to sleep with me but I thought, *we're friends. He wouldn't do that to me.*

I was really fucking dumb I know. I went over to his place. We drank a LOT. I remember him refilling my glass over and over and vaguely I thought I might die. We watched Scarface (my favorite movie at the time). I remember he talked about how he needed to shave. I just nodded. I left to smoke a cigarette. that's how I knew I was gone. I cant stand tobacco.

When I came back into the apartment, porn was on the big flatscreen tv. I laughed. I should've been horrified. I should have ran. He had shaved. His appearance is so important to him. He took me into the bathroom and washed my hands for me because I kept dropping the soap and I giggled at the domesticity of it. I thought *wow. Hes so caring*. I was so so stupid.

He knew I was a virgin and it was important to me. The sex was amazing. It was all new to me. I didn't know I could feel so good. And so comfortable when he held me while we slept.

He woke me up early to have sex again. This time he said I should swallow it so I could avoid a pregnancy. At this point I was in pain, just emotionally. I knew this would be it and he didn't care about me.

Just before 11 am, he said ""you should go."" He had a friend coming over.

I was broken. I walked home alternating between laughing and crying. I didn't know what to do. I called my friend. We talked for days about this. She wanted me to go to the cops. Maybe I should have. But the thing is, I fell in love with him.

Its been 11 months. I think about that night everyday. I cannot move on. I cry all the time. I cant talk to anyone anymore. And hes fine. He's moved into my neighborhood. I see him once in a while and he looks great. Hes prospering. He's making money by swindling people. He has so many people singing his praises. Hes a con artist and nobody knows but a handful of people. And I am fucked and scared.

Please help me. I know I was the stupidest fucking kid but I was so sheltered. I was 23 when I was raped (if that's what it is). I'm confused. I want to hurt him or something. just fucking something. I'm losing my mind. Please. I want to win.",12Jun2019,1
559,"So I recently had a watchbox with several thousand dollars worth of watches stolen during a trip with American Airlines. The watches were in my carry-on bag, which had no lock on it as I assumed it would be right next to me. The plane didn’t have enough space so my bag was checked “complimentarily” at the gate. I naively thought nothing of it.

Fast forward to this morning. I went to unpack my bag and the watchbox is gone. I initially thought maybe I somehow took the box out and put it down somewhere already. Then realized that that was absolutely not the case, as I hadn’t even opened my bag since I landed. I’m planning on calling the airline but am worried they’re just going to give me the run-around and I’ll be out of some watches worth around $2000 and worth even more to me in sentimental value.

My mom said to the doctor I would go to therapy but she yelled at me in the car ride home about how I was draining her of cash (check my post history for a better description right after it happened). I’m now at the point where I can’t sit still and it’s affecting my sleep schedule. First I talked to her about how I couldn’t sleep from fidgeting and she said I could take melatonin every few nights when it bothered me, I said it bothered me every night and she said she can just give me one once a week to see if that’ll help. Melatonin has always just been a once a night thing, just because I took it one night doesn’t mean it’s going to continue working the next night and she knows that.

so, i was just in an argument with someone discussing the homophobic community in dubai. my argument was that, abuse towards the lgbt is not acceptable and absolutely disgusting. however, people are entitled to their preferences and beliefs. 

the world is inevitably changing, society is changing, being lgbt is becoming widely accepted, and people are becoming much more adamant on accepting the lgbt community. 

my problem is that because you will never change someone or their beliefs if they don’t want to be changed... does that mean they’re automatically bad people? if they treat anyone part of the lgbt community with respect, should they still be shamed/judged for their beliefs?

581,"I'm off work from a car accident/skiing injury and want to stay off work longer.

Heres what happened:

Car accident happened 10 months ago, took 1 month off and went back to work. Worked for a few months on light duty ( found myself not doing just light duty at work though ) then re-injured myself skiing 5 months after the accident. Currently, I've been off work for 4 months now, following doctors orders through everything. There's some fuckery afoot because at this point, I could force myself back into work but don't think its better or even actually matters according to my bosses, the doctor, my lawyer, my physio therapist or the hundreds of other workers on this big job site. Its a 2 hour commute there and back. There's a good amount of managing stupidity and wasted days/weeks of work on this job site, just to redo the same work in a different location or something stupid. I'm a journeyman in my specific trade and I'm like 1 out of 100, basically a number. There's rumors, toxic people and it's not always a good healthy environment due to negativity or even for the shit you breath in there, weld fumes, chemicals, grind dust. I'm quieter and avoid as much bullshit as I can. The doctor is ok with giving me more time off. I can only speak for here in B.C., Canada but a lot of people abuse car insurance claims. There's truth to mine, I didn't cause this accident where I crashed at 70km/h into someone and my lower back is a little messed up. Yeah I rushed into skiing just 5 months out from my accident. But at the time it was one of my only options for fun and my lawyer, doctor and physio therapist encouraged it since I should be trying to get back to my life after a car accident. I don't know how much I will be compensated, I don't even really care to be honest, I'm not broke, have money saved and should be good moving forward. I do have a ticket in my trade as well. I'm 28 now and I've rethought things, I don't care about rushing into work, into skiing or anything. I'm enjoying taking care of my health and mind for the time being. Stretching, exercising and eating healthy as much as I can. Learning new things about health and fitness has been huge with my lower back pain. I've learned some of the realities of how the world works and how much it cares about you. I've thought about this a lot and the best way to go through it, I think I'm doing just fine or maybe I've missed something.

Questions:

1. Should I care what other people think? I'm in a union and am on a call back list ( If work is slow and they rehire, I'd be called first before random people. ) so I'm still employed and am protected there, I am set to go back at sometime when the doctor medically clears me. Other people might not be welcoming when I go back to work because I've been off for so long and they haven't been off work. They may not think my back injury was bad enough to be off work. I think I'm doing the right thing and taking care of myself and taking advantage of what I can without actually wronging anyone. A lot of the job site I'm on is a joke. People do some work for a week and it gets ripped down just to be moved, so much wasted time and work. There's bullshit, rumors and toxicity there as well among other things.

2. How long could I be off for? I don't want to think years but another month or so could be beneficial for sure

3. Anything I should be worrying about or doing? I think I've covered my bases on what matters here but there is a lot to be doing and keep up with. I'm not sure I've got it all right.

4. Whats my worst case scenarios here or best? Maybe I won't be welcome there and lose my job? Maybe it's just all good and in a month or two I'll go back, do light duty and slowly get back to full duty. Then later down the road I'll get a settlement out of this to recoupe some of the money I've lost from not working and having an injured lower back.",12Jun2019,1

584,"So I’m 21 and just got out of a construction job. I’m trying to figure out what kind of job I want to get and I want to go for something that I can turn into a career, or at least get experience for a future career. 
I have a lot of friends that have had passions for things since they were young. For example my friend has been in love with space and astronomy and now he’s going to school majoring in Physics. He is already working for his goal and I envy that. 
I never really grew up with a passion for anything and I still can’t think of anything. The only thing I have is I really like watching certain youtubers that talk about information that comes out about video games, like patch notes, interviews, leaked info, and upcoming updates, things like that. I also really wanted to be a youtuber because I love technology and the thought of making my own video and editing it to my liking and posting it and having people enjoy it sounds really fun to me. The only problem is that it doesn’t seem like there are any games right now that people want to see besides Fortnite (which I never got into) and even if I did pursue it I wouldn’t make money until years into the future assuming I get somewhat popular. I just don’t know what to do with myself. I just want to get a career that allows me to make good enough money so that I can support my family someday. I just feel really lost and don’t know what to do with myself. 

Idk what I’m looking for here I just hope that maybe someone has some advice for looking for jobs or a career path. I’ve even gone to the length of taking personality career quizzes and they all land on business but I don’t know of any of those jobs that truly make solid good money.

588,"I (21F) am a very emotional person. I cry when I’m angry and sad. I’ve had a therapist for about 8 months but she’s in surgery rn so she’s unavailable. I just had a fight with my mom. She met me for lunch on her break and she was kinda rude to the cashier. I said as much, in the nicest way possible and almost meekly when she turned around and walked out the door. She sat at an outside table and brewed. I sat opposite from her and she just looked so pissed off and started with 
How was I rude to her? What did I say that was rude? 

And I told her it was just her tone of voice and she got all defensive and said that the girl didn’t seem like she was paying attention to her and she wanted to be sure the girl heard her say where we would be sitting. I shrugged and said okay. She still looked put off by my comment and very snootily say “are you wearing a bra” 
Now I’m a country girl at heart but I’ve been living in the city for school. The city folks don’t really wear bras all that often. At least, not in my city. So being home again I simply just forgot I can’t exactly do that. I told her no I wasn’t and she said:
Well you need to in public. It’s weird that you don’t. 

Y’all. Her tone was so damn rude and it made me feel so damn self conscious. **It might be worth mentioning that I have separation anxiety with my mother...who is the only person in my life that has never left me.** I already have horrible anxiety and my mom knows this so when I closed up and started thinking about how weird I look she gets super angry and says:
I can’t have a fucking opinion anywhere I fucking go. 

Wtf? She gets up and leaves and slams her car door shut. I’m sitting there, an anxious mess while crying. The waitress brings me the food for us and noticed my puffy face and red eyes. I’ve never been so embarrassed in my entire life. 

Apparently my mother’s issue is the “art of conversation” doesn’t exist anymore.

591,"Hi. As a backstory, two years ago I was extremely socially anxious and I always acted awkward. It started to bother me, so I managed to overcome it, almost completely, and I started developing myself and my character.It went really well for a time, I made lots of new friends, I met a lot of people, but,

fast forward a couple months and my anxiety started to kick back in (at first, in small amounts) . I don't know the exact reason, but during that time I was dealing with a lot of drama in my group of friends and I was going through a though time myself (with a girl that I liked and other stuff). 
At that time, I didn't recognize it as ""anxiety"" because I thought I got rid of it before, so I thought that was some feeling that will pass with time.

Well, it didn't pass, it's gotten worse, to the point where I think that my actions are very strange/annoying to other people.(as an example, I think that I started to annoy my friends, I don't feel like starting to find any realtionships, even though I am physically attractive)

Today I realized that I actually am dealing with anxiety, but not the social kind. I don't know how to look at it, how to get rid of it, how to deal with it.

593,"Hey all I’m just going to dive in with this. My girlfriend (22) got what seemed to be a great job in her field, salary, health care, etc.  

Unfortunately it is about 45 minutes away, but 2 hours with traffic or public transportation. My girlfriends car was old and unreliable and just didn’t work out. 

My girlfriend doesn’t have the best financial history and has no one to help her in a jam. She tried very hard to get another car but it just wasn’t going to happen. The job wasn’t paying enough to save up and buy. 

Her boss was kind enough to offer to buy her a car with the deal that a certain amount would be taken out of each paycheck until it was payed off. Great. The guy is loaded and doing this is nothing to him. 

Well the car was not at all what was promised. The details had been worked out earlier yet the car she got was a different model and had about 100,000 more miles. Disappointing but whatever. It’s a car and it runs. 

Well fast forward a few months and there are so many problems with the car that were not fixed before it was sold. The repairs are expensive. 

There are a lot of other problems with the job as well, and she is miserable there, but because of the car she can’t leave. The car doesn’t work, public transportation is expensive, she still owes her boss about $2,500 and the job pays pretty low. There is no way to leave without paying him, yet the job doesn’t actually pay enough. She is drowning under other expenses as well and just literally can’t afford life. She can’t afford to leave the job and she can’t afford to stay. 

This leaves pretty much all bills to me, meaning I can’t help her much. We live in the greater Boston area, stuffs expensive. 

Any ideas to get out of this situation? How can she leave? I feel so bad seeing her so miserable but I don’t know what to do to help. 

Just a disclaimer, I’m not looking for money or anything. We have thought about selling the car but the value couldn’t cover it. Is there anything we can do?",12Jun2019,1
594,"What advice would you give to a ""gifted kid burnout"" on re-building their self-esteem? I used to do well in school without trying and have failed to adapt after coming to uni. I'm glad I was humbled, but it was such a blow to my world and identity. I think that for most of my life I've been operating under the assumption that I'm special, and I'm really struggling to integrate the fact that I'm not.

For a while I tried that Jordan Peterson jazz of knuckling down and being tough on myself, but it just made me compulsive, guilty and more miserable.

596,"For the context, I'm in my first year in a medical school. 

I've always been a fairly good student, straight A's, and I graduated highschool with excellent grades ( top 5 % in my country ). I'm only pointing this out to show you that studying was never an issue for me, especially when it comes to math and physics. 

I've always pictured myself pursuing a degree in computer engineering or informatics. However, my parents were strongly against it and they kept repeating how they always pictured me as a doctor and that it is as my best option. My dad later on threatened to disown me and refused to pay for my tuition fees unless I consider a medical career which is, as you can state, what I ended up choosing. I'm extremely grateful for what my parents have done for me and I respect them very much. I wasn't fully convinced but I decided to give it a shot for their sake.

Things didn't go as I planned and I found myself losing all interest and having zero motivation. No matter how much time and effort I put into my studies, I can't seem to get the hang of it. I feel like I'm the wrong place and it sucks to see all of my friends doing well and enjoying what they do while I'm failing in every aspect of my life which made me thinking that I can't really do this after all. 

I really want this to work because I can't afford to switch to another college and I can't keep up with this anymore. I'm constantly blaming myself for the stupid choices that I made and I started to hate my parents for it.

598,"For a little back story, I’ve been friends with my best friend for around 13 years now. We went through all forms of school together, although in high school we stopped talking for a couple years then rekindled our friendship in the last two years of school. 

I was part of the ‘emo’ group, and I hated it as much as anyone else outside of our group would’ve hated it. I felt embarrassed that everyone was judging us and calling us emo, however during my last year of high school cliques seemed to die out and my friend group really solidified. My best friend wanted to spend her time with me but I could tell she didn’t really want to be associated with my friendship group. Then she seemed to get over that and became part of it and all in all I really enjoyed that last year of high school. I’m drifting a bit but just to give a bit of back story. 

Fast forward two years later, I seem to find that I’m constantly comparing myself to her. She is stunning and many people seem to agree as it has been said by a number of people. She is much more slim than me, which only adds more to my insecurities as I have put on a lot of weight recently. The one thing that bothers me the most, though, is how she always seems to be conversing with random people that I have barely spoken to, and she is always out. I’ve had exams recently so I’ve really limited how much I’ve gone out but I’m nearly finished and now I’m worried that I still won’t be going out as much as I want, or at least as much as she does.  I talk to her constantly over Snapchat and because I don’t tend to start conversations, she and my boyfriend are the only two people I speak to consistently over message, yet she seems to constantly be speaking to a number of people at once. Recently, she has also started to speak to this guy and it’s pretty obvious they like each other - this guy was from my friend group in high school and I used to be really close to him. I don’t know why this makes me so uncomfortable but I feel a part of it is to do with feeling left out between two people I was supposed to be closest to and part of it is to do with the fact that she used to avoid this guy at all costs in high school. 

I think the thing that bothers me the most is that if it weren’t for me she most likely wouldn’t be friends with any of the people she is close with now. She got introduced to my group through me which in turn led to her meeting all the people she sees and speaks to regularly now. I know this is an unfair and selfish mindset but it only makes things worse as I feel like people see us as a pair so irrationally I believe everyone must be comparing us. She also messaged me listing the people she has met recently adding she feels ‘people finally care about her’, which kind of rubbed me the wrong way as she knows I haven’t been out much recently. I don’t know, I’m just wondering if anyone has experienced something similar and I kind of just want someone to put some sense into me and give me a logical way of thinking about this because it’s starting to really bother me",12Jun2019,4
599,"I'm going to be a bit vague because I know he goes on reddit and I also may throw in some fake information that won't alter anything crucial.

So I was introduced to this guy by two mutual friends at their wedding. It was clear pretty quickly that we were both into each other. We joked around and chatted a little the first day of wedding festivities. The second day was the same until that night, he came over to my place and we hooked up. He was over for a few hours and there were so many moments when we were goofing around and laughing uncontrollably and it was just so fun. I felt more at ease with him than I've ever felt with any other guy and we just seemed to click. 

The third and final day of wedding stuff the same thing happened at night. He came over to my place and we hooked up. He ended up spending the night and we spent the morning together as well. Again we laughed a lot, talked a lot, snuggled and slept. When we woke up in the morning we just whispered and cuddled for a couple hours before actually getting up and saying goodbye. 

Here's where it gets complicated. I've clearly caught feelings for this boy. We've texted a tiny bit since then (a couple of texts a day). He's involved in the military so is bound to living in a place 11 hours away (driving) from where I'll be living for the next three years. I'm bound to live where I am for two years. 

More importantly, I have NO IDEA if he feels the same way or if our time together was just a physical casual thing for him. For all I know, he doesn't even want to stay in contact. I'm just not really sure what to do since I like him so much but the circumstances are so against us. Also, since our relationship has been so casual up to this point I have no idea how to tell how he feels or if he feels anything. I'd be interested in meeting halfway and meeting up again to spend some time together but I feel like it's weird to ask that at this point.

Basically, I just have this strange gut feeling I've never gotten before where I really like him and I feel like we're not done. I have no idea if he feels that way at all. I've never been so relaxed around a guy so quickly. NEVER. It sounds crazy but part of me feels like it's meant to be? I don't know I just have this weird feeling. I could be crazy though.

611,"**Rewind to summer 2017.**

My best friend (lets call him Al, 19M at the time) and I were enjoying summer as we normally would, as I had some time off of University for Summer and he had just left the military following concerns for his mental health.

Close to our home is a large hill. At the top of this hill is a very long straight road with a sharp, sweeping bend at the end of it, and a small gathering of trees just off the road. We used to sit in our cars on this bend late at night as it was very scenic and quiet, and just a general good place to chill out away from everyone else. 

One day, out of the blue, I could no longer get hold of Al on his phone. I text him multiple times but got no response. I didn't think anything of it at first, as he was very impulsive and often busy. A few days passed and I couldn't get a hold of him, so I decided to contact his older sister to find out if he had gotten a new phone and not told me just yet.

She explained that his car was found, completely burned up and destroyed, with a body inside. The body was not identifiable but a tooth sample was sent away in an attempt to identify the body. My heart sank. She told me that the car was found plowed into one of the trees at the end of the long road on the hill near our home, which was a place we used to sit and talk for hours. I knew perfectly well that he knew that sharp bend was on the end of that road, and there was NO way that he had done this accidentally. 

After about 1 week, his sister contacts me to inform me that the body was identified as Al, and police were conducting collision investigations. These investigations had concluded that his vehicle was travelling about 105mph when it made contact with the large tree at the end of the road. And the death was deemed as a suicide. This made sense to me as I knew he was having difficulties with some of his family, and with the military. 

The news obviously destroyed me. I was completely introverted for a long period of time. I carried his coffin at his funeral with his dad, cousin and another good friend of ours. From this day onward, I saw a rapid decline in my own mental stability. I fell deep into my shell, hardly left my room, hardly ate and often had random outbursts of rage and sadness. I had never lost anybody before this, so was not sure how to deal with it.

**Fast forward a few months to Christmas 2017**

I (19M at this time) was about to sit my first semester exams at University. Just before Christmas, my parents came to pick me up ready for the holidays. I felt a cold atmosphere from the second they picked me up from my accommodation, and knew something was wrong. As we were driving home, my mum told me that my Grandma was more poorly than they had originally let on, and that they weren't sure she would make it to Christmas. Because of this, my family and I traveled to their town to spend time before she passed. After five or so days there, she passed away after a lengthy battle to cancer. I had no idea that she was this ill as my parents never told me the full extent of it. My dad handled this very poorly, I had never seen him cry before as he was very strong and militant but I could hear him sob in the shower from my hotel room across the corridor. 

At this point, my mental health once again spiraled downwards. I lost two people very dear to me in a very close period of time. The only saving grace I had in my life at this point was my beautiful girlfriend. We had been dating before the loss of my best friend, and officially got into a relationship in the weeks before he died. Two years on and I'm still with her. She is perfect in every way and I know that when I say I love her she doesn't believe the extent of it.

Anyway, after losing my Gran, I went almost numb. I thought about everything and everyone in my life and came to the conclusion that I couldn't do it. Over the Christmas holiday before my exams, I rapidly got worse. One night, I met up with all my friends and took them out to McDonalds and a late night drive. I paid for this, and saw it was a way of saying goodbye to them. They did not know what it was for, just saw it as a nice gesture I guess. After my friends had gone home, I got in my car and drove up to the top of the hill near my home at about 2am. I had purchased two small bottles of Vodka the day before, and I sat at the start of this road and drank them both. I knew what I wanted to do. I looked at the tree at the end of the long road and eventually turned on my engine to finally go through with it. 

When I did this, I looked at myself in the center mirror of my car. My eyes were streaming and I was angry and upset. When I looked in the mirror, I almost saw the devil smiling back at me and I began to question my motives. Not a single one of my motives was selfless, and I know this now. I was being selfish and foolish and not handling the situation well at all. I would have destroyed my parents lives had I gone through with this, but I couldn't see that point of view at the time. My head was a total blur and I saw only one option.

The longer I looked at myself in the center mirror, the more I began to think. Three people came to my mind. My mum. My dad. And my girlfriend. I began to think of them and what consequences my actions would have on these people. I sat there for probably about 45 minutes - 1 hour and eventually turned my car around, and drove to a quiet car park where I slept that night. I had told my parents I was out with friends, so they saw nothing out of the ordinary here. In hindsight, I see why my thoughts were wrong and I'm glad that I chose the course of action that I did that night. My life has improved incredibly since, and I have found a fantastic job that has allowed me to move in with my girlfriend. She has an incredible relationship with my parents and I couldn't be happier with my life at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fast forward to present day**

As of today, I've never told anybody of this experience. Nobody knows I went up there that night, and nobody knows what my intentions were. I've been with my girlfriend almost two years now, and I want to open up to somebody about this. As she was one of the sole reasons why I didn't go through with it, I think I want to tell her. I also trust her not to tell my parents because they'd be devastated if they knew. So here is my question, should I open up about this and tell her that she's the reason I'm still here today, or shall I keep it to myself and have life go on as normal. I don't know if it would be selfish or 'attention-seeky' to tell her, but I really need this bit of weight off my shoulders. I don't want to put any strain on our relationship if I can avoid it, and don't want her to think that I'm currently unstable (Because I'm not). Should I tell her or should I keep going about life as normal as we are happy now? I need advice!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My best friend took his own life and my Gran died of cancer shortly after. Mental health took a nasty dip and I was about to take my own life when I started thinking about my girlfriend and parents. This made me change my life and turn the other way. Two years on and I've never told anyone about this but I think I'm ready to. Should I tell my girlfriend that she is the reason I'm still here, or will this cause an unnecessary concern for my health etc? I don't think I want my parents to know as they'd be heart broken that I was in such a place. Is this better being a personal secret or would there be some benefit to opening up about it to my girlfriend?

613,"I currently have an office job, 9 to 5, Monday to Friday, paying about £35k a year. I don't do overtime, I manage my workload as I wish, and I am surrounded by nice people.

&amp;#x200B;

However, doing the same thing day after day after day, makes the job extremely boring. And the pay is extremely low to what I would consider my brain power is actually worth. In a better scenario, I would be thinking of new ways of doing things and would be generating solutions to both existing problems and problems humanity didn't even know they had. I would do this on and off, when I'd feel like it, and would be paid around £5m a year. At least that's the amount of money I feel I deserve for what I can do. And that would be just normal pay, nothing extraordinary. Make it £15m and that would be high pay for my worth. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, my problem is that I do not want to become an expert in a niche or a single subject, as instead I am a generalist with knowledge in multiple fields, and I easily absorb and build complex systems and information in my head. Most of the world's current ""issues"" I can solve and provide viable solutions to them. I do not care about people's feelings much. All I care about is the greater good and I  justice/fairness.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, it is agains my personality to be requested to show up in any place, at any specific times, and meet any specific people unless it is I who decides I want to. I hate committing to schedules, meetings, deadlines, etc. as all are relative and flexible to me. I find and provide unheard of solutions and those take time to generate. It could be minutes, hours, or months/years, depending on what I am dealing with.

&amp;#x200B;

But, coming back to the more current-day situation, I am looking for a job that provides variety in my work, doesn't have deadlines, schedules, and other machine-like, unnatural requirements. I would like to upgrade to a part time job that pays at least £35-40k a year for starters, and after the 2nd or 3rd year, as I have proven my worth, would go up to £70-80k. And continues to go up by at least 20% every year afterwards so I can feel that I'm progressing in my career. Also, it would need to be something I can do with brain power alone.

&amp;#x200B;

And as a bit about me, I get very good at whatever work I do, I get in the top 5% even though I am not competitive at all, but I don't want to become a master of anything as that would mean that I would need to dedicate my full time on that subject. The way I enjoy working and living my life is: do things once, do them best, automate them, and let them run indefinitely and forget about them. I am so efficient at understanding systems and creating rules, that once I get to a conclusion and set a rule based on that, I don't even have to remember how and why I had reached that conclusion or made that rule. When people start telling me about any issue they have, I usually have a response/solution ready before they are done explaining. I. Just. See. Things. With. Clarity.

&amp;#x200B;

The downside is that it gets on my nerves being asked to solve mundane problems like that. And I do not get any good feeling from helping others whatsoever.

&amp;#x200B;

Back to the job hunt - I currently have absolutely no hobbies, interests or passions, so finding a job I wouldn't dread doing based on things like these, is practically impossible.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I find myself doing when I'm not working you ask? I either watch random youtube videos (which I'm planning to quit soon, as google's algorithms are biased), browse /b/, and sometimes come here on Reddit and see what the mainstream affairs look like. I don't get much enjoyment out of these, but I do stuff like this just to pass time until I can go to sleep. I don't have any other hobby even though I have tried various things and used to have hobbies in the past. Now I just feel like I've done everything I wanted to do for fun (not getting paid for it = for fun) so far and the things I didn't do I have absolutely no interest in doing. I feel like life is too boring in today's society, as all you really need to do is become a drone for some company or be a self-employed bumblebee. There are the mysteries of the universe to be discovered, there's time and space to be unravelled, there are parallel universes to be explored. Now THOSE are important and interesting things!

&amp;#x200B;

So, any way you can help with an idea for a part time, well-paid job that offers variety and requires intellectual power and problem solving skills, do share. I am able to solve the world's problems but I can't seem to solve this personal one.

&amp;#x200B;

He's gone dark, he even unfriended me on every platform I know of. I haven't heard from him since yesterday, and I really need it back.

615,"Soooo, basically I have issues when it comes to social interactions since I'm (not self proclaimed) a sociopath,

One major trait I can not comprehend is empathy. I mean i understand the concept but I can't use it. e.g. : My Grand-pa died about a year ago and I didn't give a single crap about it even tho I didn't dislike him and went to him multiple times a month. A friend of mine lost his mom and I couldn't feel any sadness which a ""normal"" person would feel (i guess?).   
Anyway, TL:DR I am not the best when it comes to social interactions and knowing when something is too much.  


Situation : I am in love with my girlfriend obviously and I will not question her feelings for me, no doubt about that.  
Lately she's focused on her exams and stuff and is barely present. I get that, her future &gt; me, makes sense.   
Now when I read those niceguy and neckbeard stories on reddit (which I find quite amusing) I often think ""Hey I've done that kinda"". Which leads to me questionning my own actions and maybe I'm doing something super wrong which would make my GF uncomfortable. Just to be clear, I've asked her ""am I making you uncomfortable?"" and she said No, but she always says No to avoid hurting feelings so I'm not sure if thats true.   


(Quick notice we do not live together yet)

Let me give you a quick example of a daily interaction with her (I am cheesy and I m proud of it)  


Me : morning sweetheart you busy today ?

Her : yeah kinda, why watchu doing ? 

Me : routine and stuff, GL with learning im there if you need any help, cya Love you.  
\*ff 10 hours\*  


Her : im back how you been ?  
Me : okay somehow i just miss you wanna hang ?, btw I've maybe found an apt. for us near your future school.  
(Side note : I did mention that I was looking to live closer to her so I could just walk to her place instead of drivine an hour)  
\*ff 14 more hours\*  


Her : morning sorry no can do still busy.

&amp;#x200B;

and thats it basically , now I should mention a friend of mine also talks to her daily and she somehow replied to him during those 14 hours and left me on ""Seen"".   


could it be that mentionning me moving was ""too much"" ? Its not like it was a new topic and she told me months earlier that it'd be cool.  


Oh forgot to mention I'm 21 she 19 , I am working tho and have a ok-ish income as a freelancer.   
And I'm from Europe so 18+ = adult. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now lets talk more about myself.

Those are things that I do for her without expecting any return...

&amp;#x200B;

... working my a-hole off some weeks so I can afford ourselves a noice vacation

... buying her random shit that caught her eye

... telling her good morning / night and that I frkn love her daily (Yeh cheesy but who're you to judge)

... Orienting my life choices in her favor so I can be available any time any day when she wants

... Stayin fit and losing my extra chub-chubs (which I'd never do for myself).

&amp;#x200B;

ATTENTION PLIZ : If you're a girl in this subreddit and can relate to my GF if you don't mind please share your thoughts on how you'd feel and what I'm doing wrong or how I can improve. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I've done that I think might be the problem...

&amp;#x200B;

... I put my College Ed. on standby to work full time (in the same field I am studying)

... I've moved near her about 100kms already so like only halfway. 

... I've actually told her (and mean it) that I wouldn't mind If I could spend the rest of my life with her

(she shared the same opinion, maybe to avoid me being hurt)

... I'm quite vulgar and have pretty harsh opinion on things

e.g. Yes some will hate me but I completly stand for my opinion (dunno if that makes sense)  
Homosexuality : I don't give a damn if anyone is homosexual. I just HATE like really HATE it when LGBTQ members start yelling everywhere that they're Gay/Lesbian/Bi-sexual and just cant live their lives normally.  
Like i just wanna say ""OK we get it now stfu and go bang someones anus aslong as I dont have to hear your shit again"".

My reasoning is : If they want homosexlty. to be normalized then they should keep quiet and live normally without making it a big deal so it can be integrated as a casual and normal thing to be.  


concerning my vulgarity : I admit that it is intense, my best friend tells me whenever I have trouble with someone else that I have a look in my eyes which tells that I have murder-lust and even my dog senses it and becomes hyper aggressive even tho he's the sweetest lab ever. (Will add pic if needed hes really cute)  
I have inner rage which sometimes comes out when I'm driving.  


... and probably the biggest of my things that I do is lying. Like constant lying even tho I don't want it.   
I lie to get out of situations and I say things in a calculated way to get a certain result which would be in my favor like all sociopaths do. 

&amp;#x200B;

e.g. I've hit on a girl some years ago just to make her break up with her BF because he pissed me off some days earlier. And I used her feelings to get revenge. (I do feel guilt but I'm not really impacted by it)

&amp;#x200B;

Thats it I think. I may add more infos as the days go on.  


&amp;#x200B;

sadly I don't know how to put it short sorry if you're looking for a TL:DR :(

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway thank you for reading if you did and share your thought I really want to improve myself if I'm doing something wrong, Have a nice day/evening redditors.",12Jun2019,0

619,"Hi all, i believe this is going to be a long post, so pls bare with me.  


I work as a full time Interactive Media Developer with 3 years of experience, i mainly build application for the event industry. my role is programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now in this industry, there is always new fresh ideas, i never do the same application twice, every project is entirely different from the previous one, although this can be exciting but also it can be very frustrating. As i'm always digging my head trying to understand the new hardware or software that i just got. and most of the time there is not a lot of information online that can help you .  

&amp;#x200B;

My Issue started since the beginning of this year. literally every project i took has major issues, bugs, crashes... and the most funny thing is that i have no idea what i'm doing wrong. I have truly worked hard on every one of this projects, and i just think it was either lack of time, lack of testes or project managers really doing shit job. 

&amp;#x200B;

to be completely honest, one of the projects was a huge mistake from my side were i was the one who screwed up. but seriously other than that im really clueless what goes wrong. today the project manager shared with me her chat with the end-client, it shows how disappointed and bad the product i delivered is and how the application used to crash. in my defense i truly worked hard on this project, as i even worked 20hrs straight on it without sleep, this project required some new hardware that i never worked on as well, as i developed the project i tested it several times around 1 - 2 hours of user testing and everything went very smooth and i shared the results with the manager. Later on i sent the build to the tech team to install it and again it was tested and again everything was smooth, but on event time a lot of issues and very late feedback happened and again i'm the one to blame.   


This has been happening a lot as i mentioned before, in every project i ever do. and now i feel very unmotivated to handle any other project as i immediately think i'm going to fail, so i'm thinking to leave the job and search for other one.   


I do have issues with my the people i work with ( only the managing team ) , as the manager is very showoff and annoying, and she likes to brag a lot about her self,  and there is this issue that if it's a managers mistake no one mentions it but if its a developer mistake then it's all over the group and everyone knows how bad you screwed up.   


i can keep going on, but i dont want to make this any longer.  


 i have no idea what i'm doing wrong. black magic and weird issues keeps happening to me, even 2 of my colleagues noticed and both of them told me how weird stuff keeps happening to me, extremely weird issues that  they never saw before.  

&amp;#x200B;

Summary: Every project i handle goes wrong, and i have no idea what im doing wrong, i lost motivation and i dont believe in myself to handle any other project anymore and im considering leaving my job.

One day she offered to drive me to the fitness class (it’s about 20min. Away) so I said sure and we talked the whole way. When we got back to my place I gave her a cookie from my work (I work at a cookie store) and said thank you for driving me. 

Yesterday there was construction happening on my street so I asked her to drive me again. She said she’d be happy to. On the drive back I told her thank you and that I’ll drive next time. She said instead of that I could just buy her dinner. I said we could go through whataburger but she said she doesn’t like fast food.

She suggests a ramen place. I assumed it would be cheap because it was just 2 rides that she was gonna do anyway. Once I see the menu I realize that’s not the case. I ask if she wants to split something and she says she wants her own. I suggest stuff from the cheap side of the menu but she orders a $10 bowl and I order the cheapest thing I can find, $8. I’m broke af if that’s not obvious.

I mentioned this to a couple of my friends and they said she took advantage of my kindness and purposefully pressured me. But we also had a good time at the restaurant and she seems really nice so I’m not sure?

626,"Backstory: my sister and I got connected to this girl who we became close with over a couple months. Felt almost like we were sisters. I have noticed that this girl collects broken women at times when they are super low and  need a strong female in their lives. I first connected with her because she came to me with a ""message from my deceased mother"" during a low point in my life (she claims to be a medium). She has done the same to my sister. Making my sister think everything she speaks is the absolute truth, there can be nothing else. The way she operates is very cultish and I fear she has brainwashed my sister. 
This girl has never met my fiance, knows nothing of our relationship, yet has been against me marrying him since we got engaged. She is just going off a marriage she went through in her past and well as her ""medium instincts"" in regards to her opposing my marriage. 
But like I said, it's like she collects broken women and they become followers and God forbid you disagree with her or call her out for manipulation/abuse or even attempt to reclaim yourself from her clutches(see 10th picture). 
My sister- who was involved in this group message- has not spoken to me since this, and it crushes me that my own sister can't stand up for me when I have stood up for her my whole life. She calls this cunt a sister and won't say shit to me. How do you un-brainwash someone? 
*Also, just wanted to add, my sister has NEVER expressed dissatisfaction with my fiance. Not until this girl brings it up! Also my sister and I both have lives we are living so we don't talk all the time, but we do talk. It's not like we never say words to each other, she's actually the one who's hard to get in touch with! *

627,"So let me preface this by saying that I believe everyone in my line of work is equal. With the exception of knowledge, obviously more qualified is more knowledgeable. I know however that there are lads less qualified than me in the trade, that are way better at what i do, and vice versa.

I’m an electrical apprentice. About to qualify as an electrician now in September. The apprenticeship is a four year course. There is a first year apprentice, lets call him X working with my company atm, who at first was a bit cheeky. Now there’s cheekiness in a banter kinda way, where everyone laughs and we all move on.

I didn’t take any heed to it at the beginning because I didn’t think anything of it. He was originally quiet enough when we worked together, and i tried (as I try with all young fellas) to teach him a few minor things that could be helpful to someone coming into the trade.

Anyways, fast forward a few months, i hadn’t worked with him in a while, and i was in a new part of the job, under time constraints. X comes up to help us out, but he’s not particularly helpful, as he doesn’t really care, and sticks to the two lads he’s working with.

Now i know i said earlier that I believe we’re all equal, but when push comes to shove, and shit’s hitting the fan, you need to be in your position ready to rock and roll.

I’m working away, and the supervisor above my supervisor comes into our area and sees it’s a mess. Me being under pressure, say to X, “can you come out and clean up?”

He turns to me and says “You’re not my boss, you’re an apprentice not a supervisor.” I explain that the supervisor told me to tell him, and he essentially tells me to fuck off. I will add, he was being an accessory in a job which required two people, and him there as the third.

So i was pissed off and just cleaned it myself, making more pressure in my work. I reported this to my supervisor saying i was really angry with him and that i just needed to clear out of there for a while.

So the supervisor tells him off and he says nothing to me for a few days.

He suddenly comes back to life, getting a little bit cheekier each time, bringing up the time i tried to “boss him around”.

He then found my old youtube channel, from like 4 years ago. He keeps calling me by my youtube handle, in a sarcastic snarky way.

There’s countless incidents of him giving trouble to the wrong people and getting away with it and that REALLY annoys me.

When i started my apprenticeship, the general rule was “if they are ahead of you, show them respect, do as they say, and don’t get in anyones way. Eyes up, head down, mouth shut.”

This dude goes completely against that.


So, we come to the part of the story where we get to today. I hadn’t seen X in about 2-3 months. He started in my part of the building again yesterday. Same stuff, shouting little anecdotes at me. I just ignore him, and walk past as if he isn’t there. The problem is, I know he loves it. He has shit eating grin and you can tell he’s jumping for joy.

I am not a violent person in any way shape or means. But this little fucker makes me want to pin him by the throat and needlessly and senselessly beat his face in.

I know that is not the answer, and it would absolutely ruin my career. It is literally just my thought process any time this shit happens.

I don’t want to just go to my new supervisor and tell him that there’s a first year giving me a bit of shit, as that makes me seem like i’m tattling.

628,"A little background first. I live in Kansas City and I just turned 18 about a month ago. Just yesterday, my mother and I got into a fight about a movie (of all things). Long story short, it escalated and now she bought a one-way ticket to Florida so I can live with my dad. I'm being kicked out. I don't want to live with my dad, he has anger issues and I fear he wouldn't be afraid to punch me if I go against anything he says. I told my mom this and she gave me a choice. I either go to my dad's or I walk out the door in a few days time. I don't want to go to Florida. My mom will surely tell any family what has happened and I fear they will treat me like hell. My friends are willing to take me in but they live in Denver. Again, I DONT want to live with my dad and my mom will make my life a living hell if I stay here. Is there ANY other place I can go? I will only have 50 dollars and a suitcase of my belongings. What do I do? And please don't call me selfish and spoiled. That's not why I'm here. I need legitimate help.",12Jun2019,3
629,"So I made some new friends online over the weekend and ended up hanging out Monday night for maybe three or four hours at their place (first time being there/meeting them in person). At the end we made plans for Saturday for session 0 of a new DnD campaign and as I was leaving they said this:

""And we have an open door policy. We love drop ins! So feel free whenever...""

And then I left.

So today, two days later, I have a whole day free and would love to hang out with them again. I'm in a new city and they are the only friends I've made thus far, so they are who I think of when I'm bored/lonely, especially considering their ""open door"" police they mentioned. Plus their place is a great space to hang in (board and video games, card games, two cats, chill roommates). But I'm wondering if they really meant it, or if they were just being kind? Should I text and ask them if they are okay with me coming by or is that too formal? They both work super flexible hours from home, so I know swinging by wouldn't interrupt that, but I feel weird just rolling up after two days, since we are still very new friends, and especially since they will see me on Saturday and I don't want them to get sick of me.

Should I text them or is that too planned? Do they really mean I can just ""drop by"" whenever? Am I just massively overthinking this? I appreciate any advice or even personal anecdotes having to do with a ""drop in whenever"" policy.",12Jun2019,1
631,"\[Trigger warning for anyone reading\] A college friend of mine (James- 20) called a few days ago to tell me that he and his girlfriend (19) of almost 2 years broke up. He didn't go into specifics, but he did say that the breakup was not a nasty one and it was primarily because he had sex with her while she was sleeping twice and she's had nightmares about it since. He asked me for any advice or outlets to go to. My only advice was to go to professional counseling but I wanted to know if there was anything else that I could offer him as far as help goes.

632,"So...
I don't exactly know where to start.
I'm a 21 y/o female and I've never been popular with guys, besides being their 'Bro', since some of my guy friends even say I'm manlier than other guys (personalitywise).
I'm not exactly bad looking either (just got a few pounds too much).

The thing is...
Last weekend I had a 20+ hours DnD session over 3 days with my group and happened to talk a lot to one guy in particular whom I didn't know too well until that weekend.
Which obviously lead to getting to know each other better.
We got the same taste in music and we also got a lot of other things in common, so we got along really well.
I don't exactly know what it was, but he had easily wrapped me around his finger without even planning on doing so. Just by being himself.
Since then I just can't get him out of my head.
I tried a lot (also bc I would actually have had a date tomorrow), but it just doesn't work.

I really seem to like him, but I just don't know what I could do exactly.
I ordered a nice set of metal dice in his favourite colours to surprise him, but I'm not too sure if it's such a good idea, or anything other I could do.
Asking him out wouldn't be an option, since I'm way too shy for this and my lack of self confidence doesn't help there either.

633,"My family was never rich. We've lived at the same place for many years, paying rent and scraping by. After my dad passed away, it's been especially hard. We've received a lot of support from family and friends, but that has started to run out. I am currently at a dead-end job that I hate and definitely does not pay enough. I am staying so that I can try and get a raise and some experience since I graduated not too long ago. I would love to pursue my passions in either fine arts or acting, but I would definitely have to take classes that I cannot afford.

I definitely cannot live on my own because I am probably the only stable person in my family to hold down a job. My younger sister is still in college, my older sister is sickly, and my mom is very weak (she works and still does most of the household chores). 

I feel like there are a lot of success stories out there where people started from nothing and worked their way up even after being homeless. But not many describe a situation where they have to try and support their parents and/or their siblings at the same time. It's always saying, ""Go do it now!"" or ""Stop making excuses!"" and I always just get so frustrated.

644,"So I live in Laramie, Wyoming and am working building snow fence and because it is seasonal fuel to the weather idk what I'm going to do around October. Problem is without a college degree it is hard as hell to make a living, even on construction up here because it is generally seasonal so my question is should I leave Wyo at least for a bit.

I am apprehensive because I've lived in WYO since I was 6, my immediate family is here, and all my friends are from here. On top of that I love to fish and hunt and there are few states that provide better opportunity for that than Wyoming. On top of that there are a couple of hunting liscenses that are very hard to draw in Wyoming (Moose and Bighorn) and so folks put in for points, up to 14, that increase their chances of drawing the tag, but it only works if you are a Wyo resident. I have like 9 points each and I dont want to lose them.. Also in state tuition here is like 6000 dollars a year and if I do ever want to finish my degree UW is by far the most affordable place to do it. Also I truly love Wyoming, this state made me who I am and the reasons I love Wyoming are too numerous to count.

I am thinking about leaving WYO also as well. I do want to live in a place different then Wyoming at some point to broaden my horizons. Laramie also does tend to get boring because there isnt much to do, especially in the winter. About two weeks ago I just got dumped by my girlfriend of 3 years and I feel like a change of dating scene might help my moral. If I move somewhere where it is warm year round I could do construction year round as well theoretically. Also a new dating pool would be nice. I've lived in Laramie off and on the past 8 years and even after a 3 year relationship I still will generally see like 2 people I have slept with before on any given night at the bars.

650," I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls who were there a few hours (only 2 of them are involved here) later in the night near closing it was quiet and the blonde girl skipped up stairs to the toilet kept looking back at me giggling looking back down the stairs at me , a while later I walked around the corner to where they were sitting and that blonde girl was looking at me and I didn’t look away for a few seconds and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say to her brunette friend 'that lad just been staring at me' in an excited whisper way. (They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

 another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away. (She was saying the weird girl liked me having a joke because these girls never knew I existed before this night and the weird girl wasn’t in third night) 


I then went back to finish cleaning the same table nearby and then the brunette girl said excuse me again twice and I looked then she asked politely but nervously pointing at me when asking  'can I ask you a serious question?' I looked then she went relaxed and said ‘have you got a girlfriend?'

654,"So me and this girl had been ""getting to know"" each other for about 11 months. The final month and a half we started to get ""more serious"" upped the flirting, making an effort to each other more, etc. Anyways our final hangout was about three weeks ago, we went to a big park. She kept teasing me to take off my shirt and show her if i have abs or not. I'm a bit insecure about being skinny, so I didn't wanna do it out in the open. Plus it's a busy park. So I bought her to a more forested area and I took off my shirt a little bit for her. Anyways, I leaned into kiss her and we ended up making out. I think I made a mistake when kissing her because I ended up kissing teeth and I made the comment ""I think we need to work on this"" in a bit of a playful way, as in we should kiss some more in the future ;) type of thing. Anyways, we made out once or twice more and we left. Throughout the rest of the hangout, I kissed her a couple times more on the cheek and stuff but not once did she kiss me back or anything.

Now for a couple days after, she didn't hit me up. And that's usually typical of her bc she's done that in the past where she doesn't hit me up after we hangout. So after a couple days, I decided to. I had just gotten over a cold the day before I made out with her, so I made a joke ""Did I get you sick?"" and she sent me a gif saying ""I don't wanna talk about it"" I was a bit confused by that response so I put a question mark and then she said ""Lmfaooo no"" and we continue the conversation. A couple days later, I hit her up again to ask if she could speak to me in person. At first, for whatever reason, she seemed hesitant and kept making ""excuses"" to not see me to talk. I suspected it was because she thought I wanted to make out with her again. But that wasn't. My intention was to ask her a serious question. Eventually she did give in and we met up to speak. I wanted to ask her if i made her feel uncomfortable when we were kissing in the park but the conversation ended up becoming about something else and long story short, two days later she wanted to break things off. In the past, she had been VERY difficult to communicate with, but when she finally decided she wanted to break things off, she began opening up a bit and explaining why. None of the reasons which really made sense to me. She seemed so quick to dismiss things and say ""oh well"" as if we couldn't have worked things out and as if she was just trying to find a reason. But I considered it some type of closure and left it at that so not to cause anymore problems. I said my piece about how I felt about her and we left on ""good terms"". Now note that this was two Fridays ago. I was definitely hurt by it for the entire week after and felt so anxious. So i decided to hit her up last Friday night (June 7th) to try and facetime her (because I wanted to tell her that I missed her, not a good idea maybe, ik) and she kept saying for me to text her or she won't hear it. Then she started getting more aggressive and eventually said ""no its going to be uncomfortable and awkward"" then she said ""leave me alone"" and ""i DONT wanna talk"" So i just told her that i missed her and she replied that ""sorry you felt that way, it was nothing that you did"" and she had also mentioned something like ""It's PERSONAL"" in that conversation

Now what do I think the reason why she broke thing off was? 

My hypothesis is.... I think she is insecure about her kissing. She's a bit ""shy"" when it comes to speaking her feelings and by her breaking things off was probably her way off ""solving"" her problem. Maybe the comment I made in the park, that I thought was playful, ""I think we need to work on this"" might have also contributed to it. It was NEVER my intention to make her feel insecure about her kissing. This isn't a make-or-break thing for me in a ""relationship"", there's so much more than just kissing. She isn't even a bad kisser or anything either. I'm not the type to make fun of her kissing or anything. I WANTED her to be comfortable and to not be afraid to tell me how she felt about her kissing.

Now I'm not sure if I should tell her that I don't think she should be embarrassed or feel insecure about it at this point or what I should do???... I know I can't just magically make her feel not insecure about her kissing but I just want her to know that I don't want her to feel embarrassed by it and I wont ""laugh"" at her for it and to try to put her at ease a bit. Also if I'm being honest, I still feel a bit hurt about the whole thing and that she would throw this all always just because of this....",12Jun2019,1

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off.

She had fear in her eyes, she was paranoid, and it was obvious by just looking at her. She was holding back tears for the entire class. I wanted to talk with her, but I didn’t have a chance till later. I remember he telling the teacher something and the teacher responding with “Go to the office when you have time. We’re supposed to make sure you’re safe here. We’ll take care of it.”

I saw her durning a lunch period, and I asked her if she was okay, and she told me she was over it. She clearly wasn’t, but I left her alone, since she only ever talked to me like 5 times this year, and calls me pretty lady because she doesn’t know my name.

661,"I'm 23 years old (turning 24 in a couple of months), and I just got into a good online Master's program in CS. I've been aiming to learn more about artificial intelligence and build a start-up to success. I never really cared about acquiring wealth for anything beyond the benefit of freedom, but for many years now, I've felt obligated to help my mom retire. She raised me with expectations that I will become successful and live a good, stable life. I can't meet that expectation, because an enduring dream ever since I was a child was to live my days in freedom, exploring the world, trying new things as I go along and photographing/journaling my experiences.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I decided to meet somewhere in the middle: make $11,000,000, and then go out to pursue what I wanted. I figured that number since my mom told me she always wanted her own rental property worth $10,000,000 that she could sustain a living from; also, I figured that $50,000/year generated from 5% interest on the remaining $1,000,000 would be enough for me to sustain the dream I wanted to pursue in the long term. 

&amp;#x200B;

But, in the meantime, I will have to work hard towards a goal where I have no idea how long it will take, let alone if I'll even be able to get there. I think I would be very lucky if I can get there before I turn 35. You could say I'm not really living the life I wished for, but who's to say that the life I'm living now isn't so bad either? I have a mom who loves me, and entrepreneurship with the additional goal of advancing technology through AI could have it's own set of adventures that I could grow to love.

&amp;#x200B;

But, I've always had this anxious feeling around my decision. I am conflicted on whether I am doing the right thing or not. I don't know when I'll die, but I will definitely regret having postponed my dream for my mom. But at the same time, I am not just doing this for her: I am trying to build myself up through a career in AI that will allow me to help society prosper towards an amazing future, and develop real enjoyment through that process. And when I do succeed, I could use my wealth to not only help my mom but also fund my dream so that I could truly be free to do what I want.

666,"I tried posting this to r/eatingdisorders but i didnt understand anything so here i am :) 

Disclaimer, my parents wont let me get professional help, and all the online advice on websites are either “get professional help” or “tell an adult”. So ig this is my last resort. 

Help me please. I cant deal with this anymore. 

Last last December i was overweight. I began exercising and eating healthy but that quickly developed into an eating disorder. I lost 55 pounds. Making my bmi 17.5 aka underweight. I passed out twice in the shower, i lost hair, lost my period, lost my friends, lost my will to live.

Fast forwards to last october, i began my senior year of HS. It was a lot of stress, lost a lot of friends,  So i began binge eating regularly which caused me much weight gain. Binge eating is what caused me to be overweight in the first place. After each binge id fast, or exercise heavily. But i still gained weight. My binges are binges. Calories on top of calories. 5000+.


The feeling of food or feeling full disgusted me. So i purged. It was hard at first, but i got used to it. The feeling of feeling full hurts me so much that i purge my water. Because it jiggles in my stomach. Although i know damn well it contains no calories. 

I am still gaining weight. I probably gained back around 30 pounds. Because i cannot purge out 100% of my food. And it kills me seeing myself get this fucking fat.

I know i can stop purging, but that would mean i will have to go back to starving, meaning losing hair, periods, tears and not being able to walk or concentrate in class. Or i binge and purge, meaning i gain weight rapidly, hurt myself because of it, hurt my hands, my stomach, my teeth. 

It feels like an endless cycle and theres no way i could escape. I could just eat a healthy 1500 calories, but the second i exceed 800 kcals i binge. Its just that way. I cannot exceed my limit without binging, and so purging. And i cannot binge without purging. I would rather die.

Let me just say that i dont want recovery. I want to go back to being underweight and pretty. I just want to stop binging and purging. And i dont want to live off 200kcals. I just wish i could reach my gw healthily.",12Jun2019,1

671,"I (F30) manage about a dozen software developers (mostly middle-aged men). The software is rather large and complex, so there are times when it can take several days or even weeks to resolve an issue. Other issues can be resolved in a matter of minutes. So it's quite difficult to tell how much time I should allow for bug-fixing assignments, although the client managers of course always ask for this information so they can set expectations for the clients. New development projects are easier to pinpoint a level of effort (in time), but even then it can be challenging to ensure these guys stay on the rather liberal target they're given. I walk around the office occasionally to chat about this or that, and I often see reddit or other time-sucking sites up on these guys' screens. Sometimes I playfully jab ""that's not work""...""I see you over there""...or something along those lines. But it's easy to say they are just taking a few minutes to refresh their mind or whatever. And I get that, after all, I'm here, aren't I? I don't want to be a stickler. I'm okay with slacking off to a degree...the amount of deep thought that's required for some of the things we do means (imo) that it's okay to balance the load with light-hearted internet fun. But some of these guys are taking it too far. If I walk by 6 times throughout the day and every time someone is doing not-work...then I seriously doubt I'm getting even a half day's work out of them.

Tonight im [14M] having dinner with my mum and my dad grabbed the pan or watever it is with the food, placed it onto the kitchen counter and started eating but not on the table, my mum said come onto the table and my dad didnt respond so my mum asked him once again and he raised his voice and said AND WHAT SHOULD I BE EATING because my mum didnt serve my dad but only to me. She also asked him to fix the sink cuz its leaking water out from like 2 or 3 days when you turn it on. He grabbed his tools and started fixing it instead of eating and then started complaining how my mum is simply doing nothing but just chilling. My mum cooks, does laundry, takes care of my sister, stays with her for an hour 3 times a day for her to fall asleep, feeds her, cleans the dishes and the whole apartment while my dad works till 18:30 goes to the cafe till 22 or 21 pm and then come back home at 23 pm, goes to the toilet for an hour and then proceeds to finally have dinner without any of us. My 2017 since October when i was 12 was the worst year of my life atm. I was crying every single goddamn fucking day because my parents wont stop fighting, my mum would yell, cry as well often, it got to the point she had medication for her nerves, started saying some shit like ""if thats true i hope i die"". Once i watched how my mum attempted to kill herself, i remember it clear as the morning of a sunny day. It was 7 am and i woke up to screaming. My mum screamed ""IM GOING TO KILL MYSELF"" she ran to the balcony, opened the door fast and thats when my dad grabbed her and pulled her out. I was in shock and couldnt do anything, not move nor talk. My dad asked her if she was crazy or something and that she would tell her parents if she did that again. I went in the kitchen to them after 5 mins of that shit. My mum was crying and then went to work. After a month i heard my mum again saying if my dad wanted her to do something bad again. After i went to school i told her im going to the school psychologists and my mum turned it as a joke that everything is ok and that i dont go there. Ive already gotten over that. My dad was accusing her of cheating which she NEVER did. He knew her facebook password, her phone password, they even got to the point of going to some church twice and as well as creating a facebook account of both of them.

Two of the stories follow POC as the main characters, Chinese women in one and an Indigenous brother and sister in the other. In neither of these stories do I bring up or focus on the racism and injustices that these characters would have faced in the time period (1800's.) That is not what I am writing these stories about. I want to include characters that I feel are underrepresented in the genre. Is it or is it not my place to do so? Is it important to mention the social struggles of the peoples mentioned?

Since school is now over I wanted to occupy my summer days by doing something useful rather than laze on the couch all day, so I was looking for a mini-job so I could also get some extra cash which never hurts.

681,"Hi!  
So, a bit of backstory for what I'm about to ask. I've always been super bad with romance. I've only ever had two crushes in my life, both in my late tweens, early teens and both rejected me flat out. I'm not super ugly or strange or anything, I'm average looking, kinda pretty (And can be really pretty if I take the time to put on makeup and do my hair), a nice, funny person, and while I'm not what you would call 'popular' I'm liked by most people and have many friends in my year. I've just usually ended up crushing on the guys that all girls do, that I don't have a chance with. A couple of guys have crushed on me, and even asked me on a date but unluckily I haven't liked any of them back, so I had to turn them down.  


A short while ago, a new guy joined our class, called Noah. From the beginning we got along well (We were in the same group for a science project, and he sat next to me in math). We became friends and our science project group hang out together quite a lot. I had never really thought about him romantically, until someone made a joke about it and I thought about it seriously.   


I realized that I actually did like him, quite a bit, but I thought I'd just ignore it so it would go away, as the first two times I asked a guy out had gone awfully. I thought it would be fine to just be friends.  


Then came the day we presented the big project. Since it was such a big thing, after we did it in the first lesson, we got the rest of the day off timetable. We hung around as our own person friends who weren't in our class still had lessons. We also hung around with a couple other people from the other projects. One of these people was a girl called Layla, who is kinda known for being very... sexual. The guys kind of make fun of her a bit for it and call her a slut but everyone likes her and she's quite popular. We're not what you'd call close friends but we get along, and she's really nice and friendly. She currently has an older boyfriend, but she flirts around for fun anyway. As soon as she found out Noah was quite rich (His dad owns some successful business or something), she decided to flirt with him.I don't want anyone to get the wrong idea about her, she had no idea I liked Noah and she wasn't trying to make me upset or jealous.  


The entire day she was sitting on his lap, cuddling him and trying to get him to look at her boobs and stuff. He seemed to be fine with it, even though he made it clear from the beginning that he wouldn't be interested in actually dating her. I kinda pushed it aside at first, because, as I said before, I was trying to just be friends with him. The next day, at the weekend, we decided to all go out downtown to celebrate the end of the project as it was a big thing and a big part of our grade. Layla and her group also came with us. Again, they flirted all the time, they were basically on top of eachother, and when we were walking around he had his arm around her. And after about half an hour it really sunk in, I was crazy jealous. I tried to lie to myself and tell myself ""Oh it's just gross to see people like that"" but after about ten minutes I had to accept it. I spent the rest of the day trying to hide how jealous I was and talk mostly to my other friends in our group, since I didn't want Noah or Layla to realize that I was jealous.   


That's basically it on whats actually happened, although I see the two of them hanging around with a couple other friends a lot during school, but I know that nothings going to happen between them, since she has a boyfriend and he has made it clear multiple times that he only wants to flirt around with her. He is quite flirty and touchy with everyone, even when we first got to know eachother her kept putting his arm around me and sitting next to me and stuff. I think we definitely get along as friends but I'm not sure if there could be anything more. I was thinking about it, and apart from me, Layla and another girl in our science group (who has a girlfriend) he hasn't really properly talked to any of the girls in our year, or been as touchy. I've brushed it off as him just messing around, but thinking back whenever he'd come up near me (usually when we were all talking about our project and stuff, he'd put his arm around me). He also talks to me a lot on instagram, ever since we found out eachothers he keeps initiating conversations and replying to my stories to talk. And everytime he's seen me in the corridors he's said hi just to me, even though he knows my friends quite well and I would have thought he'd want to talk to them. We also have quite a lot in common, but I won't go into it here.  


He's average looking as well, and he has quite a loud, outgoing personality. As I mentioned earlier, his family are really rich (This is not why I like him, don't get the wrong impression. I didn't even know about this till a long time after I accepted I liked him). He's had a lot more experience than me, and has had loads of girlfriends before. He showed my group photos of a couple and their all gorgeous perfect 'popular girl' types who wear cute dresses and loads of makeup, wheras I've never had a boyfriend in my life. We get along really well and... I don't know if it's just me but I feel like there's something there mutually. I noticed a few times when we were hanging out after the project that I would feel him looking at me, especially when he was curled up with Layla or he had his arm around her. And when we were on the bus there, he sat next to me, not any of the others even though they all had spare seats next to them.   


Reading this, do you guys think anything could happen between us? Do you think he likes me? Can any of you reccomend a way for me to find out it he does? Finally, does anyone have any advice on how I could try ang get him to like me or get his attention? sorry for the long post, I just started writing and couldn't stop.",12Jun2019,0

683,"So I [F22] recently decided to make the decision to pack up my bags and move to a city where I know next to no one (I have like 3 people I know in cities surrounding me). I moved in with 3 complete strangers, all 2-6 years older than me - they seem super cool, down to earth people that I’d love to hang out with, however I have bad anxiety and can barely bring myself around to socialize or hang out with them. They live with a good amount of little farm animals and they allowed me to bring my 3 small dogs which I am SUPER thankful for. They’re all old, and pretty well behaved, just not trained in the “lay down, roll over, sit pretty” type of way. They do know when to sit, not to jump up, and when to respect space and get out of the way. I had issues with my last roommate always complaining about my dogs so even though many people love them and comment about how well behaved they are so I’m now constantly worried about how my new roommates are getting along with them. Like I said, they’re old. So two of them are blind and one is deaf. The blind ones are a little slower and take a while to maneuver and get around the house. I know one of my roommates absolutely adores the dogs, and she is so sweet and welcoming, she comes to talk to me, invites me upstairs to come blaze with them or offering me beer. She’s the one that I was talking to about being their new roommate. However, I don’t know how to socialize with my other roommates and every time I try to, I feel like an idiot and I can definitely sense that they’re judging me or questioning me. The people I live with are all really close and like best friends, and at the end of the month they have another one of their friends moving in which makes me even more anxious. I rarely leave my room, I actually ended up going a whole day without eating because my anxiety was so bad I couldn’t go upstairs to grab a bite to eat. I know that doesn’t make anything better or help the situation at all. I do go upstairs and hang out and try to socialize when they invite me up for dinner, or when they tell me that I should come socialize - I am making the effort. I just don’t know how to progress it. I have one roommate who I just cannot seem to get along with, which makes me super uncomfortable because I can’t grasp what I did to start off on the wrong foot. I try to say hello or make small talk, but it doesn’t seem to work and only seems to make it worse. This is my first time moving in with people I don’t know, and I just want to know how to be a good roommate and how to coexist and get along with the new people I live with.",12Jun2019,1
684,"TL:DR at bottom

To understand this you have to know my school is strict catholic, we have to get all of our uniform off of a really expensive website (for example 1 skirt costs £20-£30). My school is also located in the richer side of my city meaning anyone who can walk to school most likely can wear a different uniform everyday. As you can probably already tell i am not from this area; dont get me wrong we are not under the poverty line but just around lower middle class, so i have 2 sets of uniform and 1 pe kit. 

Now about 2 month ago i lost my pe jumper, and instead brought home one that was too small and ripped, i got quite worried since its a thing for the lower class students to swap their pe jumpers with bigger ones when they got too small however i found it the next day but didnt have enough time to take the small one back.

A week after this i still hadnt taken the jumper back and was actually planning on taking it back this very day, my friend who we will call Samantha asked me if she could borrow my PE kit because we were in different classes and she left hers at her dads so i gave her my PE kit and i told her there was another jumper in there that i needed to take back she said okay and end of that. (This was a Thursday BTW)

On Friday after school i take out my PE kit and put it in for the wash, about 2 hours later my mum storms into my room and asked me why i still have the jumper from last week, i said i forgot to take it back and searched for MY jumper, and it wasnt there. I tell my mum and she tells me that we cant afford another jumper for about a year, so tough. 

I quickly text Samantha and ask her if she has it she tells me since there was 2 jumpers in there, she gave her friend who well call Jennifer the bigger jumper (my jumper) and she took the smaller one. I get on the phone with Jennifer and she says after she used it she folded it up and gave it to Samantha. I text everyone in that PE class too to ask if they have it everyone said no.

Skip to monday i search everywhere for it and it nowhere to be seen. I go to lost property (lost property at my school is different, once something is found you have 1 week to get it or it goes somewhere idk where but just so you cant use it, so we have no spares) at this time i should still be able to collect it and its not there. I tell the office and they ask for my nane and said theyll keep an eye out for it. I search everyday for about 3 weeks and it still hasnt turned up and my mum just tells ne to stop, so i do.

A week ago Samantha texted me saying shell give me the money for the jumper and i say no because my mum doesnt like taking other peoples money and doesnt accept ""charitable donations"". 

Currently where i live its freezing and pouring it down, so i need a jumper of some sort. I do not have one. Ill be freezing without one and dont know what to do since we're doing cross country or something like that. I cant borrow someones from the other classes because i have PE first period and my bus usually arrives late so i cant get to another girl in time and get her jumper.

Can someone help? Im not sure if i can get away with wearing a jumper that looks similar just without the logo since my school is very strict and i already have a detention, ill get an afterschool one. Should i try and bring my other similar looking one without the logo and try to get away with it?

TL:DR lost my PE jumper, its freezing and i have cross country tomorrow, should i bring a different jumper and risk a detention?",12Jun2019,1
685,"Hello everyone, first time posting, not natively English. Every piece of advice is greatly appreciated.

So, I'm 21M and I've been together with this amazing girl (22F) for 6 years now. Long story short, we've been having sex pretty regularly every since we started dating.

We don't want to have kids, not anytime soon at least. So we always wear a condom.

Recently, she started taking the pill (per doctor prescription), and she really wants to have sex without a condom as a byproduct of taking the pill.

The thing is, I'm scared as f*ck of it. I feel terribly uncomfortable just thinking about having sex without a condom. We are booth clean so there is no fear of STD's, it's just the ideia of having kids at a young age that scares the crap out of me. Btw, she gets visibly upset at me being such a wimp, that's why I'm asking this here...

So the advice I'm asking for from all the couples/people who have been using the pill as a contraceptive measure, should I be scared? Should I just put my fears aside and do it? Any other sort of advice at all?

687,My s/o has been suicidal for most of her adolescence. She's 17 and I'm 18. She made a post on an alt Reddit account about how she wanted to kill herself and she blocked me on one social media platform but not the others. I told her best friend who told her mom everything and she must be very very embarrassed and I feel terrible for that. I think I reacted too quickly and I'm worried it was the wrong thing to do. Although she told me a few weeks ago that if I didn't talk with her on that one day she would have killed herself. I don't know if I did the right thing. She's PISSED with me and told me if I was there she'd punch me. I really don't know if I did the right thing. I'm worried she'll never talk with me again and hate me forever and I love her so much.,12Jun2019,1
689,"Okay so, I have a few problems with my mom. (I’m 15 years old)

She always handles me like a baby.
My parents are divorced for a long time and I don’t really care.
But for school reasons like tests I like to stay with my mom because at my dad’s house I don’t have the time to learn.
But every time I ask she says no, and when I finally convince her she ignores me or is pissed at me for at least a week.

An example:

So when I asked to stay here this weekend, after a long time she said yes.
But my room was undergoing renovations and the people that helped forgot to put my door (a HEAVY door) back in.
So I asked my mom to help me but instead of helping me she just watched me struggle.
I couldn’t do it by myself because I’m not that strong but she didn’t even think about helping.
After a while I just went to sleep with no door and basically had a really cold night (i don’t have a heater or anything in my room.)

Is this normal behaviour? I know this sounds stupid but I always here people say about how their mom’s got their back and everything.

Sorry for this post but I just needed to rant for a bit because I don’t know what to do and all this toxicity is really getting to me.",12Jun2019,0
690,"Hi,
  
So this is not to flex but I would like to give a brief backstory.
  
I bought a brand new Audi limousine when I was 19 (2 years ago) and I was broke all my life before. It was always my dream to buy myself a really nice car before I was 20.
  
My car therefore has a very high meaning to me. It for me resembles that anything is possible. And I still feel so much happiness to see it and drive it.
  
Now I moved to a bigger city and public transportation is much more convenient. Also it costs about 50 Eur per month
  
I pay about 500 eur on insurance, parking lot, gas and all that.
  
I just can't get myself to sell my car but I am pretty sure that it's a no brainier - especially considering the value loss.
  
What do you guys think?
  
Sidenote: don't ask me how I afforded it... It wasn't a good way of making money and I was very lucky.",12Jun2019,1
692,"I got suspended for a week from McDonald's for ""verbally abusing"" my manager (long story). They told me that they're going to investigate the situation during that time. Now I got an email today from my manager and apparently they want to have it tomorrow. The meeting was supposed to be this Friday, now they want it an entire day earlier. I feel like they can't WAIT to fire the fuck out of me. Does moving the meeting to an earlier sound like good or bad news?",12Jun2019,2
693,"Little backstory a few months ago I was in a psychiatric hospital to get some help for my mental health, after I was improving and got back into the swing of things family suggested I get a dog. I thought about it for a while and decided I could afford it and was ready to care for a pet of my own. I adopted him a couple weeks ago and although I knew it would be hard work he has more issues than I thought and i am finding it all hard to handle. I do not want to give him up or find a new home for him, but my mental health is still more fragile than I thought and i’m not sure what to do. I am focused on training him and making him more calm but even if he was “perfect” I’m not sure i can handle it on my own. I also feel horrible even thinking about giving him up because that’s not fair to him but I’m not sure how i should proceed. I’m also concerned i may not be able to give him the best life he deserves because he needs a lot of attention and has a lot of energy, I live in an apartment by myself and work at least 40 hours a week, is it even possible for me to be a good dog mom? As i have said before i just don’t really know where to go from here and need some input/advice on where i should go and how to move forward.",12Jun2019,1
695,"So my gf who is a doctor asked a female member at the hospital who happens to be very ""high up"" if she was pregnant. She replied, ""no I am just fat."" Now as funny as I found this to be and advised her to just let it be, she is worried that she just insulted someone in a position of power over her and wants to apologize again. What should she do? I suggested to just leave it be but she really wants to call or email or something. I just think no. What does everyone else think?",12Jun2019,3
696,"My son watches a lot of streamers on Twitch. I personally don't find them entertaining but I can understand why some people would enjoy it. Over the past month he's starting using words like ""pog"", ""jabaited"", and ""Kappa"" which I guess are terms that are used in the of Twitch.

I don't have an issue with my son using these terms but it's gotten to the point where every sentence is Twitchspeak. We were having dinner and my daughter was talking about how she got accepted for a summer program with the local animal shelter, and my son said something that I don’t even understand. I told him that this was starting to get out of hand and that he would have to start communicating normally to his parents and family. To that he said ""Weird champ, feels weird man, normies?” Until he learns to communicate like a normal human being I've blocked Twitch from the internet for the time being. He's really annoyed right now but I told him that I would unblock it if he stopped using twitchspeak, but he's refusing to stop so for now it's banned.    
What should I do here?",12Jun2019,1
698,"So i was coming come from studying and this guy on a bike started hurtling insults to me because i admit i did almost run him over as i didnt see him. Anyway i stopped to apologize and he kept insulting me. I got out of the car and he started shoving and pushing me and grabbed me by the neck, i then proceeded to shove him and as i did he spat on me. I instictively swung (im a boxer) and hit him on the chin and knocked him down. He got up and started hurtling insults at me and taking a fighting stance without really doing anything. I got into my car and left. What do you guys think i should have done? Should i have followed up with another punch, call the police or not even punch him in the first place.",12Jun2019,1
699,"So my parents held me from driving for 18 years. Just a month and a half ago, I finally got a car and now I am able to drive across the interstate to a town 28 miles away with absolute ease. So my mom tells me ""hey we will go take the driving test on Tuesday"" and I'm thinking ""Great!""

I tell my Dad and he goes ""Woah. I'm gonna have to talk to your Mom about this. I'm not saying you can't but I'm not saying you can""

I'm 18. It's time I make my own choices and this is one of the many things that bothers me. They tell me what roads I can't go on (when I'm driving my moped by myself even though I've proven myself with a year of driving and excellent grades). They track my location all the time. I went to my brother's house for E3 and said ""hey I'll probably be home somewhere around 9. Not certain""

At 9:00 on the dot, I get multiple calls and texts saying ""Answer your phone"". I get home around 9:30 and I'm told ""when you say you'll be here around 9, be here at 9""

I'm tired of feeling like I'm being treated as a kid and feeling like they have to hold my hand all the time. How can I fix this issue? If I tell them straight up, they will just get pissy with me and not take it into consideration.",12Jun2019,1
701,"I want my GF to forget about me since we are a thousand miles apart and probably will continue to be further away from each other, so I told my friends about this and apparently they told her (cuz f privacy right?) and they said that she started crying and she told them that it was really hard for her, and apparently it would be my fault if she started hating boys and would never start going out with anyone again, So i want to tell her something but idk what.

Pls help me i really don’t want to be the reason she would start hating guys.",12Jun2019,1
702,"So for context, my last ex and I broke up right before Christmas last year. It was awful timing and really hard on me for many reasons, mostly because it was Christmas, we’d been together for three years and I really thought I’d marry her, and because of the break up I had to move to a new city, basically starting my whole life over from the ground up while going through the emotional roller coaster of a break up. It was a lot and kinda traumatic over all. 

Flash forward to today, my over all attitude towards the failed relationship is more or less disdain, hatred, and kinda relief to be out of it. Looking back, it was a very toxic relationship and my ex really dragged me through the mud and in some ways was very mentally manipulative and abusive. And on a few occasions physically too. But now I’m a lot better, my life has vastly improved and I’ve truly moved on and have a lot of positive things going for me. About two months ago I met a new girl, and since then I’ve fallen for her. VERY HARD. And no this isn’t a rebound (went through all that end of December, beginning of January). Truly, I don’t want to say she’s the one, but........

I could go on and on why she might be and how much healthier and amazingly better this relationship is then the last. But my problem is to this day, I still think about my ex more then I’d like to. At least once a day, and more the less busy and mentally occupied I am. It ranges from mostly hatred and all the scathing but true “in your face” things I’d say if I ever saw her again, to reminiscing and almost missing some of it. I don’t know if this is the relationship version of ptsd or what, but last night kinda freaked me out because I had a VERY vivid dream involving her and kinda got so into it, I thought it was real and when I woke up it took me a disappointing second to realize it was all fake. 

By no means do I still love this women or want her back in anyway. She burnt all bridges and possibilities of that before the relationship even ended. But is this healthy or normal? I feel like i shouldn’t be thinking about this much, especially when I have literally the opposite person in front of me. And I really don’t want to blow it with her.",12Jun2019,0
704,"About over a month ago, I suddenly disappeared out of a friend of mine's life. We've known each other for less than a year but we became very good friends.

It was his birthday. He had -once again- shown up late and brutally drunk, barely able to walk and talk. I spent some time with him but ultimately decided to tell him I forgot something at home and left because I just couldn't pull up with it anymore. I didn't leave out of spite or egoism, I left due to genuine discomfort. I did think my decision thoroughly. I never saw him since. He never called, neither did I.

I felt bad for leaving, but it didn't really strike me how bad it actually was. I just remembered all the good times we've had, and even the bad ones we went through and I remembered just how good our friendship was. I'm afraid I've ruined it.

I've been thinking about messaging or calling him, but I'm stuck. After what I've done, whether justified or not, do I even have the right to show back up in his life like this?",12Jun2019,2
705,"OK first of all, I have already learned my lesson about loaning ""certain"" people money.   The only reason I did it is because I wanted the interest because I need money and I'm too lazy to get a job.  I suspect that he has money he just doesn't want to pay me back because he thinks I won't do anything.  But I don't want to be a pathetic loser anymore,  even If I can't get the money back I want to have the satisfaction of knowing someone can't just take my money and not pay me back without consequences.  I don't like being treated like a bitch anymore.  Ideally I want to teach him a lesson AND get my money back, but I will even settle for just teaching him a lesson.  I've never been in a fight before but I'm quite a bit taller than him, but I still think he would win in a straight up fist fight since he probably has experience in fighting.  But even if I fight him,  It wont get my money back,  My other idea was to steal it from him, but Id have to do it when he's sleeping because I think the money is in his pocket but I am not certain. Third idea is to rob him at gun point but I don't have a gun, and he might not even have the money on him. Forth Idea is just to take a baseball bat and beat the shit out of him but I don't have a baseball bat and If there are witnesses I can go to jail.  Same thing with robbing someone at gun point,  fighting someone without a weapon seems less risk of getting in trouble but I don't really know to be honest. Any other ideas?",12Jun2019,1
706,"So as the title says, my younger sister has been getting more and more into the marijuana scene here. She's been smoking since she was 15 or 16 at least. At first it was socially, but it's been ramping up a lot, especially in the past year. 

She's gotten high before school, smoked while AT school, skipped school to go get high with her friends, all that kind of stuff. She's gone to parties and smoked stuff from people that she didn't know, gotten cross faded, and smoked in our backyard when weed was not legalized. The event that made me desperate was that she recently bought a dab pen that is scentless, so now she'll probably be high all the time. 

My sister has been very open about her adventures to my parents. She tells them stories of her partying, how getting high feels to her, and a LOT of intimate stuff that freaks me out. She tells me more than that because I've expressed an interest in smoking one day, but I'm waiting until I'm of legal age to do so. I haven't told my parents about the pen yet. 

My parents haven't really done much to stop her from smoking. The summer she smoked in our backyard they grounded her for a month, but that's about all they've done. They listen to her stories and express very little reactions, positive or negative. The most they've done in the past year is tell her she should wait to smoke until she's of age. Oh btw she's 18 in a month.. 

I guess my question is what, if anything, can I do? I'm worried she's going to be addicted to it, if she isn't already. As I'm typing this, I can hear her taking hits from her pen in her room...",12Jun2019,3
707,"I don’t know if I should make this long or short. I’ll just type and see where it goes.

I’ve been with this company for almost three years. It’s in the field of my dreams and I was super jazzed to have gotten it. About 8 after my start date I was tasked with a HUGE project. I’m confident in my skills and why turn down a chance to flex a little. I’m by no means the best but I take pride in how hard I worked to get where I was.

Turns out I had been making errors but wasn’t aware of them. Inexperience really.

Well a team member (not yet leadership, but very definitely a senior team member)was taking it pretty hard and was complaining to another team member about my work but NEVER said a word to me.

Come the turn of the new year (6 months after that large project) and now an actualized member of leadership he and the department boss put me on probation. Please keep in mind I was unaware of any issues with my work till this point AND was totally blindsided by the meeting.

Well after a full year of probation and no slip ups I was verbally told that while the issue wasn’t totally solved (they need a strong track record since work was spare over the course of the year) I was considered to be off probation as I was on the right track.

Well, I had a meeting with leadership (boss, and two leads [one was a newly promoted member and very aware of how poorly the other two were treating me]). Where they said I was NOT off probation and that until then I need to start having them check my work.

That new member of leadership offered to have lunch with me and told me directly “He’s been trying to fire you for a year and he had every intention of doing so in that meeting. I told him not to and even HR said they can’t fire you till they met with you at least. But don’t count on lasting here too much longer.”

Now, I’ve had an inkling he was trying to get me fired. But this was confirmation. And I have been actively trying to find employment but my industry has been saturated with people who far exceed my talents so it’s been hard to get that next step.

I’m wondering if anyone can provide some insight in how to go about harnessing that rabid monster. It’s been a stressful year so far and I think it’s only going to get worse.

It’s also a smallish company so even the VP of the company is a viable point of contact. Although...that’s a super last resort. I feel like if I took it that high I’m essentially going to have to quit if it doesn’t go in my favor.",12Jun2019,1
708,"I'm 17 and today I realised I actually don't have any real friends.

Summer has come, and I haave to face the fact that I have no one to hang out with. My mom has already told me that I should go out and hang with people , but I don't know with who or how to do it.

It's not as if I can't talk with people. I'm in good terms with everyone at school. We laugh, and during lunch time I'm with a really nice group of girls. The thing is, I've never talked with any of them about anythig not related to school, so I don't know much about them, and they don't know much about me. This may sound weird, but I moved from the city were I was living two years ago. Because of this, I've lost contact with my old friends, and if by chance we talk, our conversations are verys superficial. I'm sad to say I lost them.

And where I am living now, I haven't bonded with the people here. In the two years I've been here, I have hanged out with people less than 5 times. And due to this, I'm afraid of asking them if it would be ok to hang out, because I'm afraid of being turned down.

I don't know how should I start a friendship after knowing someone for two years, and I really need to, because I can't stay at home during all summer.",12Jun2019,2
709,"First, I want to thank you for taking the time to read this. From one internet stranger to the other, I deeply appreciate any insight you could provide as I’m at a total loss on what to do. 

Work Environment:
A small department that interacts daily with each other. Teamwork is necessary. Predominately male as there are only three female coworkers, including myself. I have built strong relationships with all of my male coworkers.

Aggressive Coworker:
I’ll refer to her as AC (aggressive coworker). She’s the newest addition to our department and moved from separate one. She’s also approximately a decade older than me.

Background:
AC and I have been at odds since she switched to our department. We couldn’t bond as we are totally two different people. She tells many provocative stories that my morals contradict such as:

-punching her dog in the face and leaving it outside in 30 degree weather for two days because it pooped on her ground

-stabbing her uncle with a fork because he said her kids were stealing his food

-getting fired from another job after the police were called on her because she chased her coworker down with a knife

-punching her fiancé in the face while he was dead asleep because he made her mad

The tension grew and she eventually cornered me to address it. I told her I don’t support any of the things she speaks about and we should try to maintain a professional relationship. She agreed. Over a few weeks, we found an even ground to communicate as work acquaintances. One day, she spoke ill of me and my work ethic over the radio. I’m not sure she realized I had one. I approached my supervisor and told him it’s unacceptable for her to speak of me like this over a radio that all of my coworkers and potentially clientele can hear. He tried to shrug it off but I insisted he handled it. She walked in on us as I was stating it’s impossible for it to be a miscommunication and that I know he had heard her attitude. 

She immediately starts yelling and my supervisor pushes me out of the room. HR us involved but as it is a weekend, nothing happens except I’m send home. She blows up my phone calling me childish and not to “play with her job or money.”

My big boss sits down with us separately about a week later. He says we’re all going to sit down together to address it but it’s been months and hasn’t happened. 

Flash forward to now. She is CONSTANTLY making snide passive aggressive comments in front of me to my coworkers. 

“I won’t dye my hair blonde. I don’t want that thot look.” (I dyed my hair blonde about two weeks before this comment was made).

“I’m about the only one in the room who ain’t a snitch. I am not a rat. I’m not part of that rat pack.” (She believes I went to HR.)

Amongst other things, such as yelling my name to get my attention. 

My coworkers are entirely staying out of it, despite seeing her comments. (I don’t blame them as it’s not their problem. I respect their silence.) 

My first supervisory is entirely on her side. My second supervisor can’t do anything.

I’m scared to go to my big boss as she only gets more emboldened when there are consequences to her actions. She’s been in HR before for two other events that don’t concern me. 

My mom says I should be kind. Google tells me to speak directly to her and ask her to stop. 

If anything needs to be clarified, please just ask. I’m more than happy to. I’m trying to keep it short. 

If you were in my shoes, what would you do? And thank you, again.",12Jun2019,1
710,"I'm the type who tends to overthink almost everything. For example, my friends want to travel to a foreign country in the next couple of months as a vacation. While apart of me would love to do so, I'm held back by so many thoughts of what could go wrong, such as losing my passport. Whenever something doesn't go to well for me (ex. I score a low grade on an exam I spent a lot of effort studying for) I'll constantly compare myself to others who had a more positive outcome. Even now, I'm constantly comparing my current life situation to that of the one I had a couple of years ago, thinking about how the earlier one was a far greater experience and thus unable to simply enjoy the present.

For years my parents and friends have been telling me to stop worrying so much, but as you can expect from the title, it's easier said than done for me personally. What are your tips on how to put an end to so many needless thoughts and worries? How do I get out my head and simply enjoy life?

711,"I want to break up with him for multiple reasons;

1) i miss being single, flirting with others, falling in love. All that stuff

2) the relationship is very fucking boring. We never go anywhere. I only see him at school and in the weekends i come over to his house and we just do nothing all day. Half of the time we're 'busy' with each other, the other half of the time he's gaming, and im watching netflix in bed. (I dont mind the gaming, i'm a gamer myself too, i just wish he would actually spend time with me when im over at his house)

3)  he never asks me along when he's going somewhere with friends, he always uses the excuse ""i thought you were at kickboxing training"" or ""i thought you were busy studying""

4) (mainly a problem on my end) i always feel like he's flirting with other girls, every time i look over when he's on his phone, he's chatting with female friends. It feels like hes obsessed with talking to them, since he looks happier when hes talking to others. Since day 1 i've had trust issues with him.

I have talked about 2,3 and 4 multiple times with him, and asked if we could do something about 2 and 3. But it never changed, and it pisses me off a lot. He just says 'sorry' and thats it.

But the big problem is; i would feel like absolute shit if i would see him with another girl after i would break up with him. Is this a normal thing? And should i even break up with him? Is there any way i could fix all of this?

I know people say relationships have ups and downs, but the only up was in the first few months when we first started dating.

Backstory: My grandma lives across the country from me. I (18f) received a gift of a few hundred dollars from her as a graduation present. My grandma is really odd about sending checks in the mail (she always thinks they'll be stolen) and gets upset if she isn't notified immediately of their arrival. She likes using email and usually is fine with getting thank you emails for smaller gifts. 

I emailed her a heartfelt thank you message, since I got her gift yesterday and didn't want to keep her waiting. I also wrote a card for her. After I sent the email I got a reply. She had written a message ridiculing my email, expressing disappointment in me, and criticizing me for being unemployed (completely uncalled for.) 

I don't know what to do. The email was not meant for me, she was talking about me not to me, and she ended it with a totally different signature. I don't think she's noticed yet, she hasn't said anything about it if she has. I'm really upset and I kinda don't want to send the card that I wrote, in case that's not good enough either.

I work at a bar and one day I walked in o the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new (about 2-3 months) who I haven’t talked to stared at me kind of smiling a little as I walked in the doorway as she was sorting glasses and she didn’t look away but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding might have been nothing) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then look away to carry on putting her scarf on.

722,"So I’m at one of the largest crossroads of my life thus far.
I live in the south currently, but will be moving up to Chicago at the end of the fall for grad school. I’m ready to move out of my current city, so the moving isn’t really an issue.
But a few weeks ago while my parents were in town helping arrange my move (I’m moving back in with them in Chicago), my lovely father suffered a stroke. It was honestly the worst week of my life, I haven’t been more emotionally and physically exhausted. It was “moderate”, and his losses were minimal and he made huge improvements almost every hour, but he’s the center of my family’s universe. His prognosis is fantastic, but as anyone who has gone through this might know, your own personal outlook is still grim as hell.
But luckily they got transported back to Chicago and he’s in one of the best rehab centers. But that takes me to my mother.
She’s exhausted and pushing through everything, but I’m beginning to really worry about her and how she’s handling.
But so here’s my thing. I have a job and the last day set for the end of July. But now more than ever I’m absolutely dying to get up and be with my family. Do I put in my two weeks, should I quit my job and get up there? Or do I keep my plans as they are and just be supportive from down here for the remainder of the summer?
I feel completely helpless. Please offer advice. And stories if you’ve experienced anything like any part of this!",12Jun2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an 18M with an 18F girlfriend of 2 years. We normally practice safe sex; the other day we were stupid and didn't use anything. We thought the timing was good (a couple days after expected ovulation), I didn't ejaculate inside her, but she's currently in Hawaii on vacation and hasn't gotten her period on time (only 2 days late now, but she is very regular, there aren't any PMS symptoms, and we are preparing for the worst case scenario). She gets back Sunday of next week, and we are doing a pregnancy test then. We've discussed briefly what to do if the test is positive, and she is adamant about not keeping it (I am as well, so that alignment is good) but her parents are somewhat conservative and I know for a fact her mother is very much against abortions. I have pretty solid &amp; liberal parents for the most part, and am heading to college on a full ride, so I don't really have issues telling my parents or how their opinion of me might change. But, her parents are paying \~$40,000 a year for her to attend UCLA (they're making her take out some loans for it) so she needs to stay on good terms with them.

&amp;#x200B;

  I've got several points where I need advice:

&amp;#x200B;

A) do we tell either of her parents? how should we go about doing this?

&amp;#x200B;

B) how would this play out with insurance if we don't/can't tell her parents? I'm not sure how much a cash abortion is, but I'm assuming it's not cheap. I have a paid internship at the moment and have a comfortable amount of cash/could pay, and my parents would definitely spot me any of the remainder but I'd still very much prefer to not shell out that much money. 

&amp;#x200B;

C) she is coming with her sister, my father, brother, and myself to see some of my family in England later this summer. Her parents have already paid for flights, and we both would prefer this to happen - is there any way to mitigate the damage if we do have to tell her parents?

728,"I’ve had issues with my downstairs neighbor before. She knocked at my door when we had one person over and told my landlord I was having a party. Another time she called the police on me for being noisy at night and I turned my music off and apologized - but she never knocked on the door herself. The final straw was when I was cleaning the whole apartment at 9am-ish and she came up hours later and said “you need to stop jumping around like a 4 year old” and her husband all but threatened to fight my man (who was asleep at the time). She then said “this is between her and I”. We went to the police just to make them aware that she’s most of the problem. They even knew the two of them by name from their many domestic disputes. Nothing happened for months between her or anyone else that lived there. She claims to be disabled and can’t walk well (she walks fine and there’s nothing you can see but I don’t know her personally) so she has the parking spot closest to the building - fine, whatever. We don’t have defined spots since it’s a gravel lot and I thought I gave her plenty of room to park but apparently it wasn’t. She knocked on my door and I ignored it. There was a note on my car saying not to park in her spot. The problem for me is that she never says anything to any of the other neighbors because they’re not attached to her.

734,"I met my girlfriend (20y/o) a year ago. We both are in college and my lease was up and her mom offered me a room at their house. It was cheaper so I accepted. This was a few months after we met.

Turns out her mom is narcissistic, bipolar, and loves to play the victim. She also has to control my girlfriend's life. Like not so long ago, my girlfriend got a piercing and her mom got upset because she wasn't the first to know. This blew up into a fight. And this isn't the first time she yelled at her because she wasn't included.

Whenever there's a fight between my girlfriend, me, and her mom she tells is to fuck ourselves and if we aren't happy and the door is right there. I had enough. I'm looking at apartments now. One of her mom's conditions of living there is to tell her if we are looking to move. So I'm being decent enough to do so.

However, her mother also threatens physical harm such as if anyone was closer to her, she'd lash out. Keeping that in mind, my gf and I have 4 cats and a dog that are very close to us. They are ours. Almost like children. My concern and worry is if I tell her mom we are looking at moving, she'd harm them. I wouldn't put it beneath her after living there for a year. It also doesn't help that we are part of her income by paying rent. If we leave, she's losing money and that just makes it more likely she might do something.

Felt good chemistry and we both decided to set up a double date in the near future so my wife and I can meet them both and we can become couple friends. We don’t have many friends in the area. 

The intern starts stopping by my office (I’m on the other side of the building) just to chat and hang out. We end up walking out to bus together from time to time. Wifey is cool with us getting coffee. Last weekend wifey tells me her Wednesday’s are good for the double date and intern had told me week before her M, W, and F are good. So I text intern and tell her Wednesday would be good, ask her if they have any preference of place to go. No response. Yesterday she stops by my office, apologizes for not getting back to me, we chat more, walk out together.

I figure it may be less awkward if we had coffee first and she felt more comfortable so u text her later that eve telling her I’m free in the eves after work if she’d like to stop by the café and we can chat or catch up. No response. 

She’s very nervous, highly and seems very interested in everything I say and laughs a lot around me. First day we met she told me her whole story and asked me about my life, said it was a bummer we didn’t meet earlier on inbthe year, and exchanged numbers with me. I don’t want to assume an attraction to me but I wonder if that’s what’s happening.

Do you guys think she likes me, isn’t serious about double date, and just wants attention? What should I do?

I’m so conflicted and confused. I’m 29f, my cousin is 31f, I’ll call her C. Growing up, we lived in the same town, went to elementary school together and pretty much did everything together. When I was 6/7 years old and C was 8/9, she would take me into the closet, do sexual things to me and then have me do the same things to her. The details are irrelevant. It stopped when her mom got a job an hour away and they moved to another town. 

I remember thinking when I was a kid it was normal. It’s not like she was a strange adult touching me, she was close to my age and we spent a lot of time together as kids. 

I have a lot of cousins, but C and I have always been very close. We text on a regular basis. She was my maid of honor. She lives out of state, but whenever she’s home, I’m excited to spend time with her. We have a lot in common in terms of music, education and hobbies. I’m an only child and she has one brother, we’ve always been more like sisters than cousins. 

We have a good, normal adult relationship, but we’ve never discussed this. It’s always bothered me and is in the back of my mind. Whenever she’s visiting, I tell myself I’m going to gather the courage to bring it up. I always stop myself because I’m afraid of ruining our relationship or what if I’m making a bigger deal out of this than I should be. It’s hard to decide what to do, because I know if the situation was with an older male, I’d have reported it and etc. But it’s my female cousin who is only a little older than me and kids play doctor all the time, but this was more than playing doctor. 

Should I address this with her? She’s in town for our grandmother’s 80th birthday and I’ll be spending time with her tomorrow and over the weekend. I’ve gone back and forth on bringing it up for years. I don’t want to ask advice from anyone in my family for obvious reasons.",12Jun2019,3

So after the fact,  I wanted to send her a thank you message but didn't have her info so I asked my mom for her number.

about five months ago, i started to notice the handle on my hairbrush was getting weirdly sticky. i smelled the bristles and it didn’t smell like my little brother’s gel so i just assumed he moved the brush to get another one in the pot. a few days later, it was sticky again but no smell. after two weeks or so, my hair started to be extremely greasy every day, no matter how much i washed it. i smelled the brush again at it smelled like my brother’s gel so i confronted him about it. he got mad and yelled that i was trying to frame him. i wasn’t.

a month goes by and i realize the nozzles on my shampoo and conditioner bottles are always opened when i go to shower even if i close them after every use. i immediately go ask my brothers if either of them used my shampoo and conditioner. again, they get mad and yell.

ever since then, they’ve started to use everything i own. i find my face wash with the cap next to it on the bottom shelf in the shower when i closed it and put it on the too shelf the last time i used it, big chunks of my face creams have been scooped out of their pots, i find droplets of my face masks and hair oils and other face products on the bathroom counter, my toothbrush is filled with someone else’s toothpaste, the brush i use to wash my face has the dried up soap of someone else in the bristles. the list could go on, honestly.

this weekend, i got tired of it so i decided to gather my things and place them in a basket and store them in my closet. i had an exam this morning so i left and closed the door to my room like i usually do because i have an aquarium and two tanks i do not want to leave the aquarium unattended around the cats. i come back five hours later and my room door is open. my closet door is open too. i look at my things. shampoo and conditioner bottles open and wet, face wash bottle wet as well, cream has been scooped out. i decided to not confront them about it because i fear they’ll yell at me again.

i seriously don’t know what to do about this. i’ve told my dad multiple times and that i should talk to them about it. that was never successful so after the thousandth time i complained, he just tells me to store my things away or just deal with it. its MY things. i want to just be able to have them in the bathroom without anyone touching them. i find it incredibly unsanitary to share my products. it feels disgusting using my things now because someone else is using them and they wont stop. i cant even find out who it is because i’ll just get cursed and yelled at. please help.",12Jun2019,1

753,"Hey I really need some serious advice. I'm in university right now. Should I quit engineering or push through it? I really hate it, have no desire to do it, my parents forced me to do it for the money + get a stable job and do your passions later + good benefits/insurance. After making it through 3 years of school and being depressed, my goal now is to get the degree, find a job in the field to earn enough money to support my passions —&amp;gt; is this worth it despite it affecting my mental health? Do i just suck it up? Has anyone gotten success from this? Or am i wasting my time?

Background :

I am in my 3rd year in university studying materials engineering. I have 2 years left (5 year program). I have a huge passion for photography and filmmaking. For a career i want to make movies, short films. commercials/advertisements, travel videos, or even filming conferences and events. The video market is absolutely huge today, it is in higher demand than ever, especially with youtube/instagram/social media taking over. With my passions I took one year off school because I was depressed and despised engineering and used my free time to do freelance work and build a portfolio. I did an internship at a media company where i edited and helped film some videos.

After taking time off school I eventually went back to school due to pressure of my parents and I ended up failing an entire semester because of a combination of poor study habits, lack of interest in engineering, and my passions distracting me. I have a terrible GPA that is undesirable for employers so is it worth pushing through? I am very lucky and my parents pay for my engineering school. This is a huge reason why i haven’t quit since I decided to take advantage of free university. I am absolutely having a miserable time trying to pass my classes. With 2 years left, im close to done but i feel miserable everyday and i don't have many friends for support because I failed a semester and i am behind.

My question:

I’ve talked to other engineers and many of them tell me to push through school and then immediately do my passions but it’s not that easy since after school I will need money to fund for my passions. So is it worth pursuing this engineering degree even though it’s making me miserable and I don’t plan to use it? I often hear people say engineering degree can translate to other things like consulting, business, finance etc, but why in the world would a company hire an engineer if they have no degree in business/finance? Wouldn’t they rather hire someone who has a degree in that field?

Also is it possible for me to find a well-paying job in the engineering field where I don’t have to use any engineering technical skills and can earn a decent amount of money for like 3 years and then quit and pursue my passion for photography and filmmaking?

TLDR; Hate engineering. Have 2 years left. Forced by my parents and it’s making me miserable. Only doing it to get the degree/ a well-paying job to pay for my passions. Not sure if I should quit or push through just for the degree since im almost done.",12Jun2019,2
754,"Before you begin; I don't want anyone to try and convince me to not die. This is a decision I've made myself, and I'm at peace with it.

755,"Hi all!

So I am new to Reddit, heard great things about it.

I am in need of advice. I want to move out. The problem is, I am too weak to do so.

It's been a rough couple of weeks at home. I'm getting into confrontation more regularly now in the past few weeks with my family. Sometimes we get over it, sometimes I get the silent treatment, and sometimes it blows up in my face. I have a history with depression and anxiety. Whilst my parents have been sympathetic towards me because of this, they now believe I am making this up. I have had moments at home where I am emotionless to them, and they tell me to act in a certain way, and I don't think I can do this anymore. I had planned on leaving 2 years ago, but decided to stay put because I thought I was being crazy.

I have been planning on leaving for the past 2 weeks now. I have sufficient funds, I have a place to stay, and I am currently looking for a job (haven't had a successful interview yet but I know I will get a job sooner rather than later).

What is stopping me now is the honour my family has. My sibling is also about to give birth any day now, and I feel selfish for going too soon. I am prepared for the fact that my family will cut me off, but would leaving like this make things worse?

I'm sorry for sharing this with you all. I have shared this with close friends who are supporting me, but my anxiety is driving me not to do it. If I don't leave, I risk being a passenger in my own life, and my anxiety is convincing me to stay put.

What do I do?",12Jun2019,2

760,"To preface, I have no idea why I like this guy. He's a friend of mine, kind of. We barely talk, come to think of it. I help him with his homework, sometimes, but otherwise I can't say we're that close. We were closer last year, I think. There's nothing wrong with him, he's nice, funny, attractive, I love his smile, but I've met plenty of guys like that. I never gave a rat's ass about *them*. I really can't pinpoint why *he* makes my dumb heart skip a beat. 

I feel kind of stupid making a Reddit post, it just seems like a really minuscule and petty problem, but man is it bothering me. He's my first genuine ""crush"" (which feels moderately silly to say), and I figured I'd get over it fast. How stupid of me. 

To be honest, when I first realized I liked him I thought I was getting sick. He had mentioned having a girlfriend and I got a really funny feeling in my gut. The feeling was so foreign that I genuinely thought I was becoming ill; I remember commenting about this feeling to my friend's and they got a bit worried, thinking that I was really getting sick or something. 

This was more than a year ago.

And I still like him.

It's causing me so much casual distress, it's ridiculous. I'll be all la-dee-da, minding my own business, forgetting he exists, and then I'll see him in the hall and he'll smile at me or some shit and I spiral. That stupid smile has me wrapped. I'll for split moments think I'm over him, and then like a bag of bricks my heart's back to painfully contorting. We've had like two or three pretty deep conversations between 12:00AM and 5:00AM that really did not help my pathetic case. I remember once mentioning that we probably wouldn't even talk to each other after high school graduation, and he sounded really sad afterwards, saying something along the lines of how he hoped we'd still talk sometimes. It hit me hard. 

He's had two or three girlfriends since I've met him, I think. Each time he breaks up, I, for some reason, think I have a shot? Because silently pining after someone, while simultaneously making them think you'd rather skin yourself alive than be in a relationship, is apparently having a shot.

Funnily enough, I don't *actually* want to be in a relationship. I don't think I'm fit to be a girlfriend for anyone, I'm barely fit to be a person.

I'm running on a tangent, and  most of this probably sounds like really dumbass teenage angst, but what I'm trying to say is I need help getting over this stupid crush. If that's even what it is. I don't have a shot, I never have, I don't think I ever will. He's got so much going, and I'm a little rat crawling into the sewers. Please, help me get over that stupid smile. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Note:** I've thought about telling him, but I really don't want things to be awkward. I've also considered telling him during graduation and then booking it. I'm not a well-rounded individual.",12Jun2019,2
762,"I own a 2012 Mazda 3 Hatchback Skyactiv with \~72k miles on it that was recovered and deemed a total loss by insurance due to what has been determined to be purely cosmetic damage. Insurance valued my car at $10,100 or $1,300 in its current condition.

&amp;#x200B;

When stolen, the car was unprofessionally sanded down and spray painted black and the wheels / rims we replaced. 

Auto body shop quoted 9-12k for the paint alone.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is where the advice is needed, 

Mechanically (engine, transmission, etc)  is in great condition and even awarded me extra $ due to its condition.

&amp;#x200B;

**Option 1:** Take $9,100 and purchase a used car in the 12-15k range pre-tax. This would require I get an auto loan for the outstanding amount. I am in college working part time paycheck to paycheck but could work an extra 8 hours a week to make up for the payment. 

**Option 2:** Take $7,800 and get the car interior detailed, get replacement OEM rims,  get a ""cheap"" paint job and then save leftover money.

&amp;#x200B;

My dad is trying to convince me to take option 2 since i'm still in college and working more hours and getting into debt for a car would be a regret and take my focus away from school and purchasing a car for $9,100 after tax, title, etc. would put me in a less reliable car. His fair point is that I am lucky to have a car (he purchased it new for me) and when he was going to college he drove a beater.

&amp;#x200B;

Rims: $610

Tires: $550

Paint: $4,000 (Total guess, no idea here for ""decent paint job"")

Detailed: $200

Total: $5350

&amp;#x200B;

My concern is that I don't think the left over money does justify keeping the car that would now be deemed worthless because I would only be able to get liability insurance If I get in a  accident or my car is stolen again I would have nothing but the potential $2450 saved to cover damages to my car.

763,"So, I’ve recently lost a lot of weight &amp; I’m looking much better than before. Prior to the weight loss I was quite chubby + had a lot of facial fat. I’ve recently received more compliments, attention etc. I’m still incredibly insecure &amp; remain indoors majority of the time due to insecurities. However, my sisters have strangely accused me of being ‘snobby’ and ‘think I’m superior to others’ after my weight loss. I’ve shown absolutely no sign of that, and if anything I always compliment other woman, and disregard my own ‘beauty’. It’s more clear that i have no confidence at all, than to be someone who thinks of themselves highly. My sisters are overweight, and they are aware of this, yet they are still beautiful to me. Why would they randomly accuse me of being snobby, over confident, if nothing has changed within me from when I was fat &amp; to now, my personality is completely the same. I’m still as insecure as I was before, it’s deteriorating my mental health even more for my two sisters to belittle me and make me feel worthless just because I’m ‘slim’ now. There is even a 20 year age gap, I don’t understand, if I was 20 years older &amp; had a younger sister I’d not call them such things. Help me please, it’s just making my depression worse, I thought I had a family that cares for me, but everytime I talk about my problem they consider it to be non existent and a lie, I even feel suicidal at times. They are the type of family to only care about the males within the family. I honestly feel empty. Help.",12Jun2019,2

767,"So I've been drinking alcohol around 1 year and some months. started when I was 23 about to be 25 soonish. I dont go out to bars, I've only been to one in my life. I dont have friends that I drink with at home so its not a social thing either. But I'll say I have about 30-54 beers a month, a combo of tall boys, 22z glass, 12&amp;18 packs. I drink hard alcohol maybe every 3 months if at all, but it's in the mix forsure. No I'm not going broke purchasing this amount of beers for anyone. Gainfully employed! 

Small facts: I'm 6'2 6'3, 227.3lbs just checked. Id like to say I'm very active. I ride my bike 12 miles a day and average 18,5k steps per. And I got to the gym min2-5max times a week 

Here's some of what I drink


Modelo reg, Red hook(Variety), Ninkasi Total Dom, Big Ballard's, thors equinox(glass dark brew like guiness) guiness, Rainier, Elysian, Blue Moon, wrecking balls, and the kicker to me now. FOUR LOKOS. Flavors, Black, sour, gold and some fruity one. 

I BOUGHT 4 OF THESE LAST NIGHT. All 14%alc by Vol drank them all within the 1.5 hours. the goal was to test my tolerance. I was ready for the consequences, why I drank all four in such a short period was because I literally  felt the effects of each one start to die off. 

I've also never been hung over, I've dranken while really tired after work and I mean I put the 18 pack away and i wake up like i drank water. 

My tolerance held it's own like a champ. I was perfectly functional, coordinated and smart enough to know never drive under the influence. of course I felt ""intoxicated"" but it was no more potent of a feeling than I get drinking a 6 pack of modelo in 30 minutes which I do with ease. Idk how the fuck I'm in the shape I'm in. 

I know someone's going to say oh this is a troll post, your comment isnt needed. This isnt so much a serious inquiry as I'm not worried about being an alcoholic. I just want to know if anyone can shed some light.

769,"We feel so betrayed. Some background info, she comes from Philippine, and she worked at our place for almost 15 years, she was like a second mom to me and my siblings. We made her feel welcome in our family, made sure that there was no way she would feel uncomfortable in our house, and we would always trust her with everything. 
Recently we saw on a facebook post that one of her relative posted one item that belonged to me, and quite the sentimental one. We never gave her that, and that prompted us to think whether she stole more from us. I told my parents that could have been a simple misunderstanding but then my sister went in her bedroom (she is in Philippine atm, but coming back tmr), and we found out that she has been stealing stuff that we would not necessarily notice their disappearance (tools, toys, clothes...). It breaks my heart. I really wonder if we did anything wrong but my family really tried to make her feel like family as much as we could, and she used that trust and respect we have for her in order to steal stuff because she knew we would never doubt her integrity.
We would always gift her stuff to give to her children, always give her more money when she needed it, bought her plane tickets in case of an emergency... 
Im really wondering if we did anything wrong but my family tried so hard to make sure the environment in our house was not like the environment of a simple work/boss relationship. It breaks my heart, and I know my parents will be the angriest since they’re paying for everything. I dont blame them, which is why I am considering having only my sisters talk to her.

Im just tedious of life, and as cheesy as it sounds I drown it out with alcohol. Every day after work I grab 8 pints of lager and go home, head to my bedroom and drink them.

I’m 29, and just graduated from ASU last year with a BS in Graphic Information Technology. I need to look for a career, as I’m still working my day job, and money is getting tighter and tighter. Not to mention that work has now become grating-I have a hard time focusing on anything work related. The burnout is real.  
  
Problem is, my degree was essentially a sampling platter where you took a couple intro classes in several different subjects and had to take it upon yourself to do anything more. I didn’t realize this at the time because I *just wanted to be done,* so my nose was to the grindstone. Point is, I didn’t learn or develop any sort of marketable skills, so now I don’t feel qualified for any job that my degree would help me get.  
  
I also don’t have many passions, simply because I never went out and tried different things like a normal human being. My hobbies include video games, a bit of music production, and recently, any woodworking I can manage to do with my limited means (I live in an apartment, so I can’t make a *ton* of noise). That’s about it.  
  
I’ve tried career aptitude tests, and every option they ever give me sounds like the worst job on earth. I think that’s honestly just because I don’t know *what* I want. And that brings me to the main problem-I don’t know how to figure out what to look for. I don’t know who I would ask, or what I would ask them. I have no starting point, and I’ve been so stressed about it for so long that when I try to think it through, my brain just kinda pushes it to the back of my mind to prevent me from getting all down again because I can’t seem to reach a conclusion.

779,"This is my former professor from last semester. He’s very down-to-earth, super kind and loves helping students. We talked about our day-to-day lives throughout the semester and towards the end of the semester, I’ve been coming to him for advice about another class that I’ve been struggling with a lot. He was there to listen and offer guidance but when I would come and give him an update on the situation, you could tell he started getting annoyed. I emailed him asking him for an extension on the final essay (first time I ever asked for an extension and he’s really lenient with late work with other students). In the email, I also mentioned I dropped something off for him with the secretary as a thank you for his help since he wasn’t going return to his office until summer classes started. He very briefly responded “it’s okay, send it as soon as you can”, which is unlike him, his emails are usually long/detailed. I didn’t think much of it and thanked him for the extension. A few weeks later, I messaged him giving him an update on the class I was struggling with (he was going to help me file a grade appeal and I told him that I decided it was in my best interest to retake the class), I also asked him how he was doing and how’s his summer coming along. He never responded. I figured he was just enjoying his summer and not checking his students emails. Last week, the summer semester started so I know he saw my gift and my emails but hasn’t responded. I’ve been having anxiety over it. I really want to know why he’s avoiding me but I feel like it would be doing too much to send him an email asking if everything is okay given that he hasn’t responded to any of my emails.

The only reason why I’m moving is because I think I’m becoming a nuisance and I don’t think they want me around anymore. It’s kind of became a little toxic, could be my fault, idk. I’ve been living with them for seven months, everything was fine until a month ago. 

Anyways, I have a buddy from high school/co-worker asking me to be her roommate. Which is chill with me, because we are both really laidback people, so I don’t think it will be an issue. However, I am nervous about the bf. They broke up recently and then got back together again.

I’m leaving school. I’m finishing my GCSE’s on Friday and honestly it’s gonna feel like a huge weight off my chest but that’s not what I’m talking about. We get study leave so we can go in and out of school whenever we want we just need to be in attendance for our exams. In our time out of school between exams (there’s around a 2 and a half hour wait between exams in a double day) we go to the park and play football, Im not like every one of my friends, my dad couldn’t be bothered to take me to football and my mum was working so couldn’t when I was younger, while all my mates did, so they’re really good and I’m really bad, I had to teach myself and to say I did I’d say I’m pretty good in that regard but I’m no where near the level of anyone else.

For example, I tried to boot the ball up to my friend playing inbetween exams and it had the perfect speed, accuracy, perfect everything, even the rotation of the ball was spot on, except it landed on the spiked fence dead centre and popped the ball. So there’s me getting shouted at, “you fucking prick”, “ cunt”, “nob”. I got told that I had to buy him a new ball and I would but my family is poor, we literally have pennies left after all food and drink is bought for the week, we barely make it by and I can’t cough up that money for a new ball. And so now all of them hate me, not only am I shit at everything I do but I ruin the fun so much it actually has to stop because I broke the fun. I’m even going a separate collage, one mikes away from there’s just so I won’t be a burden anymore on them

A second thing is my girlfriend, she lives 130 miles away and I finally get to see her a week from now, I honestly can’t wait and it’s the only thing that’s honestly keeping me happy through all the shit. I honestly love her so much. We’ve been together for nearly 4 months, FaceTimed every single day since. This summer I was supposed to see her a couple times and next week I’m going up, I’ve using my birthday money to get up and she’s coming down to me a couple time in the summer too, at least I thought she was. Granted it’s none of her fault she can’t come but I’ve been waiting for this, these days for 4 months only at the last minute to say that her dad isn’t allowing her to come spend the day with me, and I’m going to her, I’m stepping out into a city I don’t know, meeting someone I’ve never met in real life before and he doesn’t even trust her in her own area, he’s only okay with me seeing her if there’s another person there. So basically her dad has ruined 4 months of waiting just at the last minute. It’s honestly so fucking heart breaking finding out that someone you’ve gotten to know over months, who you love so much, that your hardly gonna see them because of someone else and it’s all out of my control. Aswell as hearing every time she’s been upset knowing that I couldn’t be there to comfort her  hurts, and that I could finally just be with her even if it’s just 3 or four days but no, I can’t even have that, the next time I’ll be able to see her is in November, another 4 months away, and it just would’ve hurt less seeing her once a month through the summer. So once again the world rips my happiness away.

I could go on and on but it’s long enough sorry. 

TL;DR - I feel the worlds against me, I feel like a burden on my friends and the one stroke of good got ripped away, it’s like I’m repellent to happiness",12Jun2019,2
786,"Hi, I’m a female and I’ve been an intern at a relatively small company since the beginning of the year. This is probably going to be a fairly long story only because I think the context is important in order to understand the situation. Anyway, I’ll get right into it.

One of the first people I met at the company was this guy I’ll call “Rick”. It’s easy to tell that he has a very unconventional, sarcastic sense of humor and you’re meant to take everything he says with a grain of salt. Up until this one day I never really had any issues with him and actually started to be friends with him. We would go out for lunch sometimes with another coworker I’ll call “Joe”. 

One day in April, I was at work late and there weren’t that many people left in the office. I was getting ready to head home when I remembered that I needed a specific code to charge my work hours to. I went over to Rick’s desk and asked him for the code I needed. Rick started searching for the code on his computer and in the meantime asked me if I wanted to get dinner with him and Joe. I said that it was already pretty late so I should just go home. Rick offered to drive me to the restaurant and back but I was still pretty reluctant. He started joking that he wouldn’t give me the code I needed unless I agreed to go with him and then he covered up the code on his computer screen so I couldn’t see it. I finally just agreed to go to dinner since I needed to eat something anyway. We met Joe at the restaurant and after a fairly awkward dinner, Rick and I drove back to the office. We passed by a dam and Rick started joking that it would be a perfect place to hide a body and that if he killed me that’s where he’d throw my body away. I awkwardly laughed and changed the subject. He started driving in a direction that I didn’t recognize so I asked him if we were going back to the office. Rick sarcastically replied that no, we were going back to his house. I again awkwardly laughed but he kept joking and said “it’s alright if you spent the night at my house right? It’s kind of far to the office so I’ll just take you back to work in the morning”. I again quickly changed the subject and he drove us back to the office.

After the weekend passed, I thought about the interaction more and realized how uncomfortable that whole evening made me feel. Rick one day decided to tell me that everything he says has some amount of truth in it and I replied that everything he's said to me is kind of disturbing then. I decided that I didn’t really want to continue being friends with Rick after that and since then I’ve tried to keep my distance and not really engage him in conversation. I don’t think he’s really gotten the message because he continues to say similar things to me in the office that personally I think crosses a line. I only have a couple weeks left in my internship now but I’m still bothered by the things Rick has said to me. Part of me thinks I should just leave the situation alone and just try my best to ignore what Rick says for the remainder of my time there and the other part thinks I should maybe tell my supervisor what’s been going on. I’m finding it hard to gauge if this situation is serious enough to merit me reporting him to my supervisor and I was hoping for maybe some input to help me make a decision.",12Jun2019,3
787,"I made a post earlier in the day but something else came up
I was just just kicked out of my home due to reasons I do not want to discuss. I have 3 options:
Live with my grandma in another state and go to school somewhere close by to here but with harsh living conditions. Others living here too, pay double the tuition. That’s a dumb choice.

Get my own place at a shit apartment or go to and apartment for close to $900( I make $11 full time) and go to community college first then transfer out to the school I want to get my bachelors.  I could work on side projects as well.

Or go to the Air Force, work a job I may not like but have some money to pay off for school but not have as much time to go to school, work on projects and what not. Heard companies don’t really care if you’re a vet they just care for experience.

I do have a paid off car, I pay about $100 less a month for it and I have a high metabolism and a small frame so food isn’t an issue.

Thank you in advance.",12Jun2019,1
788,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. My uncle (60s) and I (27M) have always been close. My dad passed when I was a kid, so my uncle would come by and help my mom and I sometimes. He used to be in and out of jail when i was younger, I remember that. But for the past 10 or so years, he’s been doing okay. I love the man, he’s always helped me out.

A few days ago, I went to hang out with him at his house while he worked on his car and he told me that he’s always seen me as his son. That meant a lot to me cause I always saw him as a father figure. He then told me about this scam he and a few of his old jail buddies had been running for a while. He said he was done with it and he wanted to make sure I was gonna be okay. He then told me to grab a bag from his room and bring it to him. I did. Inside, there was more money I’d ever seen at once. He told me he wanted to give me some of it. I’m not gonna go into details, but it’s more than $25k and less than $40k. He said I can use it however I want but to be careful not to look suspicious. 

I’m not gonna lie. I was tempted. I still am. I told him I’d think about it because honestly, my job sucks. I have a lot of debt I could clear up. And I wanna go back to school and help my family.

I don’t know what to do. I know he got this money from his scam. I feel very conflicted about it because I could really really use it.",12Jun2019,2

The church doesnt allow that and like I would forfit the priesthood if i ever got married, Also im scared to come out to my parents and my close friends at church.

794,So I recently was late for work and accidentally went over the amount of sick hours that I’m allowed at my job. My boss emailed me and set up a meeting to discuss it. A few minutes before he pushed it back an hour. Later on he said we would talk today at some point. When I got to work I found out that he had called off today. Now I’m on vacation for the next week. I think he did all of that because he doesn’t want to go through with it. We get along really well and he has always been really punctual with keeping a schedule. Now this anxiety is going to ruin my vacation. I don’t know how to handle it. Am I just being paranoid?,12Jun2019,1
796,"Okay so me and my boyfriend have been together for a year come September. He’s been away for 3 months at a camp volunteering and he love love loves nature and anything like that. So I had this idea of buying a star for both of us and buying a telescope and taking him out to see it. Here’s the things that are setting me off from this idea. No one can legally or officially name a star, I’m essentially just paying for a certificate and coordinates for some star. I don’t know how astronomy works and stuff but idk if I’ll even be able to find said star. Also in order to go somewhere to see the star we’re going to have to go out at night in pitch black to a camp site that’s almost 3 hours away. We are both freshman in college and this will be during school. I think the gesture without the cons is really cool and I think he will love it because it’s something that he actually loves and it’s intimate and it will be a year after all. The only thing that’s setting me back is actually buying the star that I’m technically not buying and going out there on a weekend during school. Should I “buy” the star anyways just that way we have something to look at? I’m not sure if he knows that you can’t actually buy a star, but as long as he has the illusion that the star is legally ours and then that’s good enough for me but like I don’t know if he knows that and there’s the off chance he might be like “lol you wasted your money” idk. Is this a good idea or not basically?",12Jun2019,1
797,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. This just happened. I’ll make this brief. I (m22) posted this on a couple subreddits so I can get some advice fast. Basically I went to get a massage. I’m sure this was a parlor that did happy endings. After walking in, it seemed kinda sketch. I was surprised she didn’t offer any extra services because the place looked straight out of a movie. Which is good I did not come for that. I realized (possibly) why she didn’t offer extra services. She didn’t want me to look for my wallet at the end because she stole it. After threatening to call the police and begging for my wallet back. It had one thing in particular I really needed. I even offered to let them keep the money if I got my wallet back. They finally pretended like it fell out of my pants conveniently under the table. Anyways I snatched the wallet back. On my way out I did something I shouldn’t have but I was very pissed off. I spit on their floor. I think they got a picture of my license plate. I’m very worried what they could do with that, or what they might do with it. Anyone have any advice for me?",12Jun2019,1
798,"I was sleeping with a FWB. Strictly FWB: I had made it clear I wanted no part in a future with her, but she was really into the sex. She also assured me she was on the pill and couldn't get pregnant, and that if even if she did accidentally conceive by me, **she would ""just get an abortion without even telling me""** to avoid stressing me out. That was the end of conversation.

After a scare, I began to insist on protection for fear of getting her pregnant. I made it clear I didn't want kids by her, and would rather not take the risk. I'd even stop before intercourse and reach for protection, but **she would always insist against it.** She would tell me that ""condom sex was trash,"" and she **""couldn't get pregnant""** on the pill. She also ensured me that she wasn't sleeping with anyone else, so there was nothing else to protect against. I personally have no issue wearing protection, and if I ever didn't use a condom, it was **never because it ""felt better for me,""** but rather because it felt better for her. I naively trusted her as a friend, remembering that she had also told me that she would “just abort” in the case of an accident.

As you could guess, some weeks go by of us hooking up before she comes over to tell me that not only is she pregnant, but her mother also went through her trash and **found her positive pregnancy test** and told her that she “wasn’t aborting her grandkids.” I was shocked, and though I didn’t flip out on her, I was less than supportive when she told me **“wasn’t sure what to do.”** We then found out before the first prenatal appointment that she was actually **pregnant with twins**, and while that meant almost nothing new to me, it apparently changed EVERYTHING for her.

She soon told me she didn’t feel comfortable aborting. She also explained that she had actually “always believed that abortion is **MURDER**” and that “**life begins at conception**,” but some things she went on to say are just clearly inconsistent with that belief:

\- She had actually strongly encouraged one of her close younger friends to abort their pregnancy from an abusive relationship, and even drove her to the clinic

\- She later told me that she previously miscarried before with a previous bf, but told me she didn't feel much guilt or sadness at all compared to the relief she felt.

\-While she could have maybe seen herself “killing a single baby,” she could NEVER live with the guilt and stress of having “killed two babies”

I was very disappointed. She knew that I was reluctant to raise children by her, and said that she would never ""force me to be a father"" or seek child support through the court, but she would **DEMAND** that I financially support her and the children indefinitely because she **""couldn't afford it""** and she **""didn't do this by herself.""** I vehemently objected, feeling it was her responsibility if she wanted to be a single mother.

When I expressed my frustrations with her, she told me **""Well if you feel that way, you shoulda used a condom.""**

I was dumbfounded. Utterly baffled. To that point, she had been a friend to me if nothing else. This whole experience, but most specifically this argument, effectively ended any real friendship we ever had, in my eyes. She did have a point: I was admittedly naive in sleeping with someone unprotected knowing I didn’t want anything to come of it. No matter what ANYONE says, the onus does lie with me to protect myself. But after all that was said and done, considering she was the one egging me on, I really felt that **SHE couldn’t be the one to say that to me.** Maybe my parents or my friends. But not her. Almost as if she was “victim” blaming, in a way. I was irate. She had left me blindsided and completely defenseless.

I feel so betrayed by her. Where do I go from here? How can I ever trust her again? The kids?

TLDR: FWB insists that I sleep with her unprotected knowing that I didn’t want children by her, tells me she won’t get pregnant and also that she would abort if she did, then gets pregnant with twins, doesn’t abort and demands that I be held financially responsible.",12Jun2019,1
800,"If you have been seeing someone and feel them start to pull away, or feel they are about to ghost you, do you think it's better to just cease contact and let it happen, or would it be better to ask them what's up?

I don't want to make myself seem like an idiot and send an 'is everything okay' or something message, but I feel like it might be a more mature way to end things. Although I'm sure I'd probably just get left on read. 

I'm conflicted, what is the best way to handle a ghost situation, in your opinion?",12Jun2019,1
802,"Long story short;
My friend had issues with her kidneys. She needed dialysis 2 times a week. I went to live with her and help her with her kids. She missed appointments and almost died. Her family blamed me for not knowing sooner. She lost her kids and went to live with her dad. She missed appointments again and actually died. 

I don't understand how she could not try. She just lost her kids but she didn't even try to get them back. She knew what was going to happen if she missed appointments again. I can't get my head around it",12Jun2019,1
803,I asked her to hang out and she told me today shes busy today and working all tomorrow and Friday. So either I'm being neurotic and she's actually busy or she's not interested.
