1,"When he was drunk he said lots of things to me. He said he’s liked me for a long time and not just in a sexual way but sober him was an idiot coward. 

Sober him said he doesn’t want to date me but has never explained what drunk him said to me. He said he doesn’t want to hurt me by making me think he wants anything other than what we have now which is we make out every few days. He said he’s not going to have sex with me right away saying “there’s other things we can do until then”. Why won’t he sleep with me if he doesn’t want a relationship? Does he really think he’s so good in bed I’m going to fall in love with him right away?! He’s either that much of an overconfident idiot or he has commitment issues. I’m so confused. I mean he has extreme anxiety so that might have something to do with it? Ugh what",27Dec2019,1
2,"I recently disassociated from my nfamily and associated with a young woman I never met, but I know about (I won't get into her). I was super confident in my decision, but then I fell into self conflict.

So here's the thing. My nfamily are Serbian immigrants, and are usually strict and narcissistic. I read from others, and seem to have the same problem as me

Then I read about the woman I was talking about then I found out she was mixed (part English and part Czech). It was really shocking.

I also read that her parents were born and raised in the U.S., so she's most likl;ey a second generation. I read how second generation Americans tend to be more American. But it's still hard to trust my decision, mostly because of the face.

The point is I don't want to think negativley about her, but I still have those trust issues

3,"For years I've been walking around with bottled up thoughts and feelings and fears. My closet friends finally convinced me to go to a therapist and I've had my first meeting with them. I have cried at least 4 times (I rarely cry) within 45 minutes and we discussed the next steps. The therapist suggested the possibility of my family becoming involved with my treatment (I'm 21-years-old but still live with my parents)

The thing is that I am not sure how to feel about starting this while process. I am doubting myself and if what I perceive to be the causes for some of my 'pain' are truly the causes. My biggest fear is that my parents (who I love dearly) might have to hear how much they have negatively impacted me (without meaning to do so) and ruin our relationship. I feel trapped and uncertain what to do :/",27Dec2019,1

Hi!I  am 17.The reason I am writing this is because I am very concerned for  my situation and my mother's mental health.For some days, we've been at  my sister's house to spend the Christmas togheter. Yesterday, after  launch, we sat togheter and talked about our future, careers, kids,  memories and other stuff like that. Somehow, at one point, we started  talking about my future. Well, I am studying at one of the best  highschools in my country, which is a military highschool. I am a 3rd  year student, I've been involved in a lot of military activities in  which I could sit and talk with other officers so I could understand the  system better. I've started to understand the military life a lot, and  I've developed a point of view about how military works in my country.  Back to the talk with my mom. I said that during my years of service, I  wanna develop a business, because I have a lot of passions, including  graphic design and photography and I wanna go into that domain aswell.

That  was the moment my mother lit up. She started yelling at me that it  doesn't matter what I think and what plans I have in my mind, cause she  knows better. She is working very hard, and to be honest, she is  struggling with the money, because she is a single mother. She makes a  lot of sacrificies. She had a rough life, she always worked for a small  amount of money. Since I left home( cause I live in the barracks) and  she became a single mother, she started feeling lonely and sad. She  started struggling with everything. She even started talking to herself.  When I come home(once per month), I ask her if I can do something to  help her or I even start helping her, and she starts saying that it's  okay, she can do it herself.(she had a tumor and got her removed by  surgery 2 years ago). She doesn't let me help her with anything.

She  started telling me that I am disrespectful to her, that I am not  thankful for all the things she did for me. She said that I am  brainwashed, I am someone else. She told me that I am an idiot to even  think about leaving the military. Since I was little, she wanted me to  be in the military, so, somehow she pushed me to get in this highschool.

To  be honest, she wants to take the decisions for me, she wants to have  control over the big decisions, so I don't make a mistake, but since I  joined the military, I developed a lot of other passions, I developed  other point of views, different from hers, I see other opportunities, I  started developing myself in many other domains. Now, that in the future  I want to try something else, she doesn't trust me. I think she feels  like I want to throw big hands of shit on her sacrificies, but I think  she knows that next year I will be 18, and I gotta decide for myself.

For  one day, she hasn't left her room, she didn't eat and drink anything. I  had 2 talks with her, and she said that I will leave the house. Tbh, I  believe that, cause she made my dad leave the house several times,  burned his clothes, throwed everything related to him out of the house.

I  don't know what to do, how to react, how to convince her to eat  anything. Every single time I come home from school I get into fights  with her, saying she is disappointed with me, that I am no longer her  son. I wanna leave the house, to be honest, I got places to stay till I  start the school again(It's winter break for now).

Sorry for the bad grammar and for not a linear story, my mind is not clear now.",27Dec2019,1
5,"I’m 22 and I still don’t have my own place. It’s fine, I live at my parents half the time and then at my bf’s the other half. 

The issue is... I have a really bad time at home. Like. R e a l l y b a d. 

I feel like everyone I ask in person, is telling me to save money and stay at my parents house but I genuinely feel like my friends and people I ask don’t understand the magnitude of how bad I feel at my house/ the money I could potentially save is 100% worth it to not be around my parents...... 

So I’m asking the people of reddit, what should I do?

I earn a lot of money right now. Like in a month I easily surpass 5-6k, and I only work 3-4 days a week. I could work more and earn more too. So yes, I can easily afford rent + bills. But let’s face it, even though I can afford it, saving money is important to me because the job I have is like... it’s good money but not sustainable. ie: strip club work etc etc. it’s great money/ cash, but can I count on it for the next 2 years? Yes. Next 5 years? Maaaaybe... next 10 years? Most likely definitely no. So I really need to save what I can before I need to find something else bc this industry is purely: looks, and age.

On the other hand... my home life is just.. so bad. I grew up kind of normal.. shitty, but normal. The bad parts were: my father constantly cheated/ brought women over, beat my mom, massive arguments where cops were called.. and soon my mom became depressed (for good reason but it still affected me), and began to abuse pills such as ambien etc... 

And it still hasn’t stopped. Growing up, I remember wondering if she would be ‘normal’ today or not. She would almost crash the car (before I knew how to drive, now I don’t let her drive in that condition if I know about it), leave the stove on and pass out. Forget about my younger sister.. etc etc. basically, I became the mom of the family. All the while my father would CONSTANTLY yell and insult my mom for being a ‘druggie’ and then yell at me for not doing anything about it. I have, for many years, had many heart to heart serious talks about how she needs help... and all she needs to do is come with me and I’ll set up any therapy / hospital appointment, she just needs to say yes and I’ll take care of it. Well that was years ago, and I’ve since decided to stop trying. I love my mom, and I know it’s hugely because of my father that has created this huge... depression hole.

 But I can’t keep throwing myself underwater to keep her afloat. I also hate being home bc due to my mom’s depression, and my father’s lack of responsibility / care, the house that was actually a nice house, is slowly degrading. Nobody keeps up with it, nobody cleans, nobody helps with anything. It’s gross and dirty and smells bad. Yes, you could be like ‘oh why can’t YOU clean’ - honestly my answer is: I don’t want to. I’m tired of even being around these people, let alone helping them with an issue I’ve tried so hard to deal with for so many years. It’s such a toxic environment dealing  w my mom high on pills - which is easy to recognize cause she stumbles, slurs her words, has glassy eyes and in general incoherent. Yet she tries to drive, cook etc, which. I’m so done with this cycle. 


I’m honestly really considering if the money I could save is even worth the mental and emotional hardships I deal with here at my house. 

The other partial issue is: my bf doesn’t want me to move In for reasons - we just started dating too - which is 100% fine - honestly I’m not even looking to move in WITH him. But the other reason is, I have pets and rn they’re looked after by the people in this house. But if I were to get my own apartment, I would be bringing my pets with me and that would drastically reduce the time I could spend with my bf/ or even my pets. I haven’t really figured out anything but... yeah...I’m sure I could figure something out, but I just want to know on the money part of things if it’s worth it. I can figure the pets part if everything else checks out.. but just wanted to mention.",27Dec2019,1
6,"if we dated any longer back then.  (I’ve never cheated before).  Anyway,  she came up to visit and we made contact and we hooked up.  We both had a lot of fun but after she went back to her life and I went back to mine, we didn’t talk much.   

I went to wish her Merry Christmas and realized I was blocked on everything (probably for some time, i haven’t attempted to talk to her since September) I didn’t think too much of it because I thought maybe she felt guilty or was afraid her husband would find out or something.   

Then I looked at a social media platform we aren’t friends on so I wasn’t blocked and noticed she’s pregnant.  

She looks like shes the correct amount of months pregnant to be about when we hooked up.  When we hooked up she claimed to be on birth control (i was nervous about it because like i said I’ve never cheated).  She stated on SM, that It was a surprise pregnancy, and has lots of pictures with her husband.   

I’ve been thinking about reaching out and asking if she needs anything?  

Idk, Idc, what she wants to do tbh.  If she wants to just wait it out and see if it’s her husband’s and then decide what to do that’s fine by me.  If it is my kid she wants to cut me out completely and cuckold her husband,  I guess I am ok with that too.  If she wants to divorce her husband and come up and live with me, I’m good with that too.   I also have a lot of resources,  I make around $350k a year.  The only option I wouldn’t be ok with is if I am just paycheck to the kid.  If it is my kid and the kid is going to know that i am his/her dad, I would want to be apart of his/her life.",27Dec2019,1
7,"The title may sound uninteresting but here’s my dilemma. There’s this girl that I’m kinda friends/acquaintances with (let’s call her Nora), I became friends with Nora after summer break because of my other good friend who we will call Lilly. 

The more I spoke to her the more we got on because we were into the same things (music, fashion etc) but I started feeling unsure about her because Nora would explicitly tell Lilly and everyone about certain things she does like drinking alot/getting really drunk, hooking up with random guys all the time (and even calling it rape sometimes when she regrets it) and being friends with the wrong people (people who are druggies). she’s just turned 15, hell I’ve known about her doing these things before I even knew her at 13.

When she’s not bragging about those things,  she can be a nice person and a really sweet girl but I do feel like our conversations are kinda forced and awkward (even though we don’t talk that much anymore). We’re just really different people.

I put on my private story “make plans for next week”
Completely forgetting that she was on my story (I added her from when we were close ish but now we’re really not) and I’m 100% sure she’s replied saying that we should...and I don’t really want to. 

I don’t know how I can cancel because I’m the one that asked other people to make plans with me making it obvious that I’m clearly available. I personally just don’t feel like I’m close enough to meet with her and I’m not gonna lie, I just don’t agree with a lot of the stuff Nora does and says.

12,"Please help me interpret this - I have Aspergers and struggle to do so myself.?

Hi everyone,

I just please wanted to ask for some help in interpreting this particular response to one of my messages. 

I think the tone of the message (below) sounds angry at me, and that this person hates me now. 

I posted to someone who I once knew from school that I was lonely at uni and that I had no friends and that people were calling me names. I felt very down and under pressure at Uni when I did, and think that this person is angry at me now. Do you think this is good advice to what I posted, or do you think this person hates me? He responded:

'First of all you need to chill. You are not a retard. The dictionary definition does not apply to you because you are social and you know how to interact with people. Only you can change your loneliness. Throw caution to the wind. Join a club/society. Ignore those who insult you - you have dealt with worse at school. If you think you have no friends then you are wrong. Look up the definition of friend in a dictionary and apply it to people you know. It's not all about uni work. You need to put yourself out there and friends will come your way.'

Do you think that this is good advice, or do you think that the person who wrote it now hates me and is angry at me? Is this person my friend or have I made them angry at me?

Thank you all so much for any advice.",27Dec2019,1

On her time wall shes tagging other friends and joking and talking and to me she acts very sad and unaproachable. 

I addressed this numerous time and I'm just fed up. Life goes on and I realize even friends aren't for ever. I would go through fire for her. But she just pushed me to the side.

I told her to take care and she tried to guilt trip me like saying stuff like "" My mother doesnt eat at all I lost many friends idc I'm numb to it all take care ""

I pray she wakes up one day in a cold sweat and regret this so much. 

And I pray I'll be over her.

She's implied online she was only 16 and was paid a large amount of money by Wowgirls as a result of a Pre-trial settlement. I've asked her about this on telegram and she has stated she was joking when she said this and that she was 18 years old, but I'm still unsure. The most disturbing thing is when I asked the company Wowgirls about this, they at first flat out denied this was true and even suggested they may sue her. 

When I found more information I confronted them in the comments on PornHub and they responded by disclosing my location. They claimed they did this to prove they knew I'd contacted them already, but I'm very worried now. I'm concerned that this company may retaliate against me somehow. I've reported all the information I've found to entities that deal with abuse images, but there's nothing they can do.

I will not contact her again as I feel that would be harassment, which is something I'm strongly opposed to.

23,"My husband has a friend who’s finishing out his enlistment before he returns to his family across the country. He’s taking a long term class at a military base where the living conditions are pretty bad so we offered to let him stay with us a couple weekends over the course of the class. He’s ended up staying over much more often and only going to his class Monday-Thursday. 
At first I was kind of annoyed by this because I’m very introverted and feel like I have to be “on” when other people are around. 
That quickly changed though and I’ve grown very accustomed to having him here. My husband and I still like our alone time but it’s really nice having his (now our) friend here most of the time. He is a kind, funny person who adores our pets and we all have a great time together. I’ve gotten to know him pretty well and he and I are probably as close as he and my husband are (which is fine by my husband because friend is very respectful and trustworthy). It almost feels like having a brother who is best friends with my spouse. The two of them play golf together, he watches TV with me, we all go out to eat together, we even spent Christmas together and had a blast. I’ve never really been around anyone save for my best friend and my spouse who I enjoy as much and I now feel like I’ll be really sad when he does go home at the end of February (even though I’m happy for him to be reunited with his family who I know he misses). 
So the advice I’m seeking is... How do I deal with him leaving and severing the fun friendship we’ve had for the last half year? I get we can talk online and maybe visit. But what mindset could I take on to make it a smooth transition and just be happy that he gets to see his family again.  I don’t deal with change well and I think it will be harder on me and potentially my husband because we don’t make connections with a lot of people as we are very close and like our space.

28,"Have to vent real quick. I’m 20M. My parents have been divorced since I was 11. It was a nasty divorce and they argue constantly TO THIS DAY. My mother is jewish and my father is catholic so we spend Christmas Day with my father every year since the divorce. Yesterday was no different. We had a great day opening presents, having breakfast so we went out for a nice steak dinner. Me, my sister (22), her boyfriend, my father and his girlfriend  who have been dating for 5 years. 
We’re at dinner enjoying each other’s company. Next thing you know our mother texts my sister and I saying “please help me, I’m locked out!” So we told her “we are a half hour away we won’t be able to help you, just ask the front desk to get maintenance to let you in” She would not comply. She DROVE a half hour to the restaurant and WALKED INTO THE RESTAURANT TO OUR TABLE to ask for the keys. She showed up to the table all fake and everyone was in shock. She left and the table was speechless. My mother has made it her mission to ruin my fathers life and she’s bringing me and my sister down with her.

Please help. My mom thinks she did no wrong, blames me for not “coming out” fast enough. Says she was “waiting for 3 minutes” and wouldn’t wait longer. I feel like my mom staged the “locking out” to show up and ruin our dinner. 

She’s not well and won’t accept therapy. Has joked about killing my dad and his girlfriend. I have no stable job and going to school.

29,"I(f19) have been in therapy for many years slowly peeling back layers of my childhood and discovering memories that I've subconsciously blocked out. 
Recently, a memory was triggered of a close family member sexually abusing me when I was about 8. This person was about 19 years old at the time, miserable with a step child and an abusive husband. 
I still see this person fairly often, and I have no idea how to cope with this. 
I feel guilty and gross. Any time anything remotely of sexual nature is on television or brought up in playful banter in conversation, I feel disgusting and uncomfortable and I can only think of the abuse. 
I know the memory is real because it was like a snowball effect. Many more memories which were significantly less traumatizing, were triggered as well. 

If anyone has any advice on how to cope with this, I'd appreciate it. I feel like my therapist awesome, but not always neccesarily good at giving ways to truly move forward from traumas.

Ok so Im feeling like shit at the moment Because i feel like I have no saying in this situation .im 28 and at the moment going through a really tough time in my life trying to get my shit together .the thing is I’ve been trying to straighten my mind up and think positive and change my ways of thinking but there is 1 thing that I can’t handle and that is my mother asking me todo a list of things for her . I feel like a total bitch when I don’t want todo something for her and it makes me feel like a terrible person so I end up beat myself up the whole day thinking about it cause shes my mom and I grew up with her always saying I should do everything for her that god intended for us to serve others before ourselves .my mom is slowly killing me .I mean I do want todo what’s  right even tho I’m not religious in any way but I feel like maybe I’m not happy in life because I don’t do things for others .i mean not a lot of people ask for my help and I do try and help everyone when I can ,like lend money to my mom and siblings when they need the help,I babysit when my siblings need help with their kids ,I help them clean their homes when they need help,if I see homeless people I give them change so they can eat ,I give out clothes to people in need. I mean I haven’t really been asked todo alot of favors for strangers since it’s mostly my family that needs my help but there are some things I feel like my mom can do but she rather ask me for favors (and if I do a favor I do it without expecting anything return that’s just me ).for example today she called me early in the morning cause she needed a ride back home because she didn’t want to ask my sisters husband even tho he agreed to take her ,the things is she wanted togo home that instant so she called me to get her .ever since I was 8 yrs old (my dad hasn’t been in the picture since I was 8) she would make me clean  and cook .and then when I was around 9,10 I had togo go grocery shopping on the bus ,go searching for my little brother when he wouldn’t be home by curfew ,she would also make me go pay her bills ,I mean even tho she would give me the money I still feel like I was out and about on the bus trying to pay the bills when I should of been safe at home. None of my sister had todo it ,I’m the middle child out of 3 sisters 1 brother .I’m not sure if I have resentment towards her and that is why I feel like she takes advantage me.im not sure if this is something I have to get over and if it’s normal and people do help their parents and I’m just a bitch . If I have to get help,I will because this hurts me a lot and I don’t want to have resentment towards anyone . I just want to live in peace and it’s impossible when I’m constantly feeling like shit because I don’t want todo things for her .she calls me everyday togo and eat and then she will tell me to give her a ride and it’s every day that she calls .im not sure if I’m just over thinking it but she only calls me when she needs a ride if not she doesn’t call me at all and doesn’t invite me to eat either unless she needs a ride . I just feel really stuck cause it’s my mom and I feel obligated but it hurts me when she only calls me and  says she doesn’t want to bother my oldest sister beacuse she rather let them rest because they have their life’s with kids to deal with .,or my she doesn’t want to bother my youngest sister because she needs to spend time with her bf (she has no kids ) .my mom was at my oldest sisters today and she asked me to pick her up from her house . the only difference is that I don’t have a bf or kids .and even when I did have a bf she would still call me on the days he had off knowing those were the only days I could spend time with him. Am I just rude or like ,what can I do to change cause I need peace I really feel like I’m losing my mind .",27Dec2019,1
33,"Hey guys, I (19M) currently live in california and I work at a winery as a line cook. The job isn't too far from my house, about 20-30 minute drive depending on traffic. And the pay isnt great either, I only make minimum wage. However, I love this job and the people I work with. They're like family to me. I get alot of one on one time with the chef and I learn alot and he has developed into another father figure for me. He gives me lots of advice not only in the kitchen but life in general. Not only that but  he is very respective of my school and will accommodate to any needs that I have involving it, even if its last minute. I really love it there. Anyways, with winter break starting I have alot of time on my hands and so I picked up a job as a cook at this new restuarant that is right next to my house (5-10 minute drive) and pays me a nice 18 per hour. I've been working nonstop at both, from about 7 in the morning to midnight just about every day. I'm fine with this right now, but with school right around the corner, I'm going to have to pick one as I cant sustain this type of work schedule with school. And I originally intended to stay at the winery but the new restaurant really likes me and has already given me a raise. They've made it clear they want me to stay. And so here is where I'm looking for advice. I know it's best for me to leave the winery and keep this picture perfect job for a college student. And I dont want to work at restaurants my whole life, these jobs are only a means to get me through school. But how do I go about quitting the winery? Some of my coworkers there are people I want to be lifelong friends and I know I'll probably see them hardly ever if at all if I quit, so what do I do?

To unlock account I need to show ID, but I'm not old enough to have a paysafe account.

Yeah so it all started about a year ago and I lost about 10 USD to a my paysafe account because I wanted to refund a game, but they could not give me a paysafecard back so I had to create a my paysafe account. There from I thought I couldn't use the account without getting a paysafe mastercard. Fast forward to today, I bought a game from epic games but forgot I couldn't get the money back because I had to make a paysafe account. I opened the paysafe account and I managed to actually use the account (without paysafe mastercard) I added my paysafecard pins that I got for christmas and I bought some games from steam in ONE transaction. After that I can not log in to my account anymore and I have read I need to file a form.. the problem there is that I need to show ID.

45,"I met up with one of my friends today. I really enjoyed it and am just reflecting on it all. One thing I am naturally terrible at - and what I am dwelling on is how we said ‘goodbye’ at the end.

The last time I met this friend (about a year ago) she said ‘see you later’ to me on parting. Today, we were on the tube and talking right to the very end before she had to get off at her stop. As the train pulled in to her stop, I initiated a cuddle with her (she initiated one with me when we met). She said something along the lines of it was good to have met and good luck with my masters and dissertation (which I am currently working on) and wished me a good **Christmas**.

The words that ring in my ears though were her final words to me ‘see you, bye’. She then left the tube very quickly and didn’t stay on the platform to wave as the train left with me on it.

Is ‘see you, bye’ a suggestion that she doesn’t want to see me again? Last year when we parted she said ‘see you later’ to me. This meant that I had the confidence to reach out and message her and arrange today because she said that. Ending today on ‘See you, bye’ means that I will be much less likely to be as confident in the future to reach out to her again. 

We spent six hours together today and I really enjoyed it. 

Do you think that ending it in this way has shut the door on me contacting her again (maybe in a year or so) to arrange another catch up?",27Dec2019,1

49,"I came to Reddit yesterday, looking for a distraction while at my boyfriend's dad's family Christmas party. Luckily, I made it through the night, but of course, not without a step outside with my man to talk about me reaching a boiling point midway through. This has been going on the four years we've been together and each year, I find a way out of seeing him or stepping foot on this awful man's property or having him come to our house more and more. It's down to seeing him maybe three times a year. Sadly for my boyfriend, they work together at a job that's just too good to walk away from. 

Anyway, when I come to these family events and have to endure him, all I can think about is one day I will marry this person and maybe have a family with him, yet, I don't want his dad to be any part of it as he causes me so much anxiety just being present. You never know what'll come flying out of this guy's mouth. To give you an idea, my boyfriend and I were greeted by him at the party with, ""What the fuck are you doing here,"" followed by him calling my boyfriend a pussy for being too sick to work the other day, leaving our gifts at his house due to thinking we wouldn't be there and saying, ""fuck them,"" when being pressed by his wife why he didn't bring them. 

I'm usually quick witted when it comes to assholes like this man, but he's a master at getting under peoples' skin, always has something to say, and when he can't get you upset with that, will badger you about being upset until you are. 

I need advice on how to handle this guy and whether or not I'm the asshole for not wanting him present in big life events for me such as marriage and giving birth to children (my boyfriend and I have been talking about both seriously lately).",27Dec2019,1

51,"I’m 32 with a house full of kids and such. Trying to work and live the dream.    My family is not close at all.       I’m the only one in my family who cares about my granny. Her daughter (my mother) only cares about herself... and that’s fine... I accepted this as a child.    

My granny was living in North Carolina.... where I was born and raised.   I live in Florida these days....

My grandfather passed away 12 years ago.... and had made irresponsible financial decisions.    Granny was essentially kicked out of their home shortly after pop pop died... I was only 19 or 20 and was basically homeless a few hours away... so... I wasn’t there to help and didn’t really have anything to offer anyways.  So over the years she had some relationships with a few different guys .   3 of them have died.  2 from cancer .     Anyways....

I bought granny an iPhone 2 years ago to help keep in contact with her... she kept going dark for long periods of time.           She used the phone TWICE.

So for the past couple months I couldn’t really reach granny I the phone but this was the norm for many years.... granny would eventually reach out to me with various reasons why she has fallen off the face of the earth but actually never moved...

So about 6 weeks ago I get a phone call from a man at a rest area in Florida.   He said he was with my granny and she was very confused and was looking for me.      SHE WASNT EVEN ON CORRECT  COAST.   She didn’t call ahead of time.    She doesn’t even know what city I’m in.   Blah blah blah

24 hours later she is at my house 

I love my granny do death.  But the timing couldn’t be worse.    I’m literally in the middle of splitting up with my baby momma of 20 years.      Was trying to make everything smooth over the holidays     Fo this separation like a big boy.


People don’t like my granny.     I totally understand this.   She is not very bright but very opinionated and accusatory and  I get it... I understand why she clashes with people... her own daughter....   and now my baby momma... 

Granny’s had a mental decline.. I suspect dementia or something related.  Right before I left for work this evening, she was asking me if I could get her the apartment that is 90$ a month.   I said granny there’s no such thing... you can hardly get a hotel room around here for less than 90 a month....     even when breaking it down and trying to explain that 90 a month isn’t possible.. she just couldn’t understand.  And just knew for a fact that my girlfriend told her about the place .. so to calm things down... got gf involved in the convo   Gf of course says there’s no 90 a moth apartment and now granny is accusing her of lying... to which the girlfriend doesn’t really respond appropriately    She doesn’t respond like it’s a baseless accusation from someone who obviously sick.. she responds like someone who has accused of being a liar and a fraud....   blah blah blah.

My poor granny wants out of the house.   I don’t blame her... hell, I want out too.       

The problem is granny’s ssa check is 1350 a month. I know that we could Find a super cheap place for that amount but I think SHE NEEDS A BIT MORE HELP, CUZ THE LADY AINT THINKING STRAIGHT.   Like a light assisted living? I don’t know.


Also we have got her going to a doctor now... with a follow up appointment in the morning... 

I don’t know what to do with granny.   I want the best for her but can’t figure it out    She gets Medicare and 1350$ a month social security.

He lives where he does for work and I’m not exaggerating when I say there’s nothing there but a mall and chain restaurants. Hanging out in his part of town is basically not an option. 

The issue at hand is that my roommate is gonna be moving out soon and I have my friend lined up to move in. My friend already owns a cat. 

My boyfriend is allergic to cats to the point where he can’t breathe. I know allergies get worse the more one’s exposed so there could be a chance that after repeat exposure his throat could just close up. 

During a typical week he stays overnight here 2-3 nights a week and is here for a non-sleepover another 1 evening a week. He spends more time here than at his place it seems, which I’m totally fine with.

62,"The holiday season gives you lot of time to think and develop theories that you can carry forward in life. Here is one such theory that I would want to share with you all on Reddit. After losing my mother earlier this year (in January) and a close cousin (last week), needless to say, I am struggling this holiday season. In such situations, mind typically goes on an overdrive of thinking.  


Losing mother is obviously a very painful experience. It hurts, makes me sad and all that. But more importantly, when everyone starts going about their daily lives, I feel a kind of void. My mind goes back to the past on what all I would be doing on a festival. I would reach out to phone my mom when confused with a career situation. I feel sad about not able to hang out with my cousin and share our thoughts. And so on, there are innumerable situations that I feel sad about. But the most irritating thing I hear people say is, don't worry, things will get NORMAL.  


Will my Christmas be the same as before? Will my happy moments be the same as before? Will my anxious moments be the same as before? Not really. Then what will get Normal. Nothing. I need to find my new NORMAL. I need a new way to celebrate New Year, I need a new way to navigate through my happy/ sad moments, I need a new way not to vent my frustration at mom. And that's the toughest part about losing someone close.   


Of course my new NORMAL will have learning from my mother and elder cousin. Festivals will be celebrated in a different way if mom were there with me. Family functions would be celebrated differently if my cousin was there. The new Normal will be a fresh way of doing things after which people around me will assume that normalcy has returned. Except that this Normal is not the same as old Normal. That's my biggest challenge for the next year of finding my new Normal.",27Dec2019,1

Do I have to wait 5 years or more to pay everything down? It seems like a long time. Advice?",27Dec2019,1
67,"Hi fellow redditors,
I live abroad and I recently came to my uncle's house for Christmas, to find a situation that has been going for years getting even worse at my uncle's house having got even worse. 

My uncle is tendentially quite bad-tempered and generally mysoginistic. This, together with his frustration for the situation with his wife (who left him with my little cousin and my grandma for the 3rd time today), makes him extremely aggressive towards my grandmother, to the point of furiously yelling and attacking her several minutes long for every single small thing she says.

My grandmother, in such a bad situation (more details I'm not gonna describe) has been acting in an extremely mature way, especially taking into account my grandfather's very recent passing, but at the same time she's being humiliated on the daily and she doesn't have the courage and force to respond, so she just submits and takes in all of this. I can see how painfully this is affecting her, considering she's also affected by depression for a very long time, and it breaks my heart.

I talked with my mother as well but she said she tried to talk my uncle to reason with no success. His behaviour is just instantly aggressive and he doesn't leave any space for dialogue. He also does that with me and with everyone when he feels like he is being put on the spot for something, probably out of an immense insecurity.

I really want to do something and approach my uncle to try and do something about this before I leave. What do you do with people that act like this? I can give more details if needed and thank you very much for any help that comes through!",27Dec2019,1

70,"Basically, I dated this dude for 3 months, had some amazing memories with him and I’m very much still in love with him. 

I struggle with ADHD, depression and anxiety, all these caused us to break up, but on good terms and we have remained close. He struggles with severe allergies and depression.
We remained good friends, and we have tried to help each other. Recently, he has become more and more depressed, and I’ve been struggling to cope with our break up (which has caused quite a bit of emotional strain) so I have been emotional and he’s been lashing out. I’m struggling to have conversations with him as he’s become vague, he also keeps telling me to leave him and when I try to comply and stay on his good side and let him be, but then he gets upset about me leaving him. I need him in my life and I think he needs me but I’m struggling to help.",27Dec2019,1

But dont worry about what messages you sent and how people feel about that, if youre feeling better that's the main thing, and finding a good way to manage your stress, are there people at the uni who you can go talk to if you get yourself too stressed? I remember how stressful it could be at uni, especially at this point in the year when the focus is always on exams and assessments. But even those are not worth stressing so much about. Make sure to spend some time taking care of yourself and doing things you enjoy - there's more important things than grades!‘

73,"In high school you couldn't drag me away from this girl, she was the very air I breathed, I just loved her so much. She and her mother were my chosen family, I was over there all the time. When she moved out of state we were both devastated, and vowed to fly out to see each other every major break. After two years we started to grow apart and talk less, then we went silent the next two years. College was just... so much. Lowest point of my life, and I regret the distance between us because that's when I needed her most. After dropping out and focusing on my mental health, I've been attempting to get back into the swing of things with her. I love her as much as I did the day she left. She just... doesn't seem to want the same thing. We've talked about being apart and how she felt as if I was brushing her off, and I cant explain how much I've apologized over the last year, trying to be close friends again. I understand that maybe I'm coming on too strong, maybe shes just not ready for this, life gets busy, I get it. I just love this girl so much and feel like I need her in my life.

So my request for advice is... should I just give up? This is the person that kept me going when I was suicidal, who i love with all my heart and more. It just feels like she doesn't love me or want me in her life anymore. When I text her it takes a couple days to respond, and I get life happens, but it's never a satisfying response for me. I feel like I'm trying my damndest to pull her back into my life and she isnt trying at all. I just don't know what to do with myself.",27Dec2019,1

I always see people mentioning getting therapy for people’s issues in regards to dating. Problems like self-esteem, lack of self-compassion, intimacy problems, emotional problems, self-defeatist attitudes, etc etc. 

I’m wondering what have your experience been in regards to addressing these issues in relation to dating? Sure these issues can be tied to other problems, but I’m wondering how has therapy for dating problems helped you? Did it make you feel silly? Was the result being at ease with yourself, healthy coping behaviors, caring less, being more comfortable with the people you’re attracted to?

I’m planning on going to therapy once I’m done with break, mostly to address some perceptions I have of myself and how I feel in the dating realm - so I’d like some anecdotes on what you did, what you focused on, how it helped and what I could expect. I appreciate it, thanks!

76,"My parents had a great run but my mom has recently developed beef with all of my family friends that they had spent countless holidays with for dozens of years.

She now believes that my dad's childhood best friend only calls on Thanksgiving because shes going to be there to hear it and not because he's done this for over 20 years.

She now believes that somebody saying that the first thing they will do after getting home from a stuffing dinner is go for a walk, means that they are trying to tell her how to live her life.

And she now thinks it's acceptable to call your (previously) best friend's daughter a whore and then wonder why she got blocked from Facebook and deleted by her previous best friend, then get out of a moving vehicle and wander into the forest, just for that friend to come wrangle her back into the car and then upon getting home, wander off without a word again, resulting in police being called.

She's also told both my dad and I that she no longer wants to live in this world and that she's happy nobody comes over for holidays anymore.

My dad wanted to go to couples therapy. She said there was nothing wrong with her and refused to go. 

My dad, for the first time in my life, has told me he feels depressed. He's more sad now then when his best friend got drunk one day and killed himself. My dad has similarly started drinking the pain away and has reminded me that if he dies, he has a pension for me.

I offered to have dinner with him alone today but we were unable to because my mom would either say we were conspiring behind her back, or demand to come along.

This relationship has completely bit the garbage bin.

What resources or help can I provide my dad to help him realize a divorce is the only option and talk to people that have been in his shoes? (Like online communities)

He's currently trying to set an appointment and obtain a referral for a marriage counselor for himself.

Edit: He's also afraid that if he leaves her, she might kill herself. I believe it too, as I've heard her talk about it and even had to talk her out of it when she was drinking from the back of a car parked in front of our garage screaming ""I don't want to live in this world anymore""",27Dec2019,1
77,"Hey there.

I wanted to ask some advice because I’ve been struggling recently and feel like I’ve really lost myself in a way.

I’m a 23 year old graphic designer and I’m one semester away from graduating college. I deal with anxiety and depression and am seeing a psychiatrist, and soon a therapist as well.
Recently I’ve been struggling with my depression more than usual and I feel really disconnected from my creative self and that I’ve lost any drive or happiness in life.

I don’t have a job. I’ll be the first to admit that I don’t have it that bad, but that I’m a lazy person who possibly just isn’t equipped to make it in the world. Living my life and managing myself on top of relatively demanding classes is already overwhelming for me. Having a job just feels so outside of my capabilities at the moment. My parents have helped me go to college, and while I’m grateful I feel very guilty. I don’t do much and I feel like I just suck money. I really feel like a burden, which makes my depression worse. 

All of my design work this semester fell flat and has me really worried about graduating and getting hired somewhere. I’ve been working hard and trying my best, but I feel extremely burnt out and whenever I get a break to rest I get anxious about the work I have to do and don’t fully enjoy the down time. I also just feel like despite my efforts my work just isn’t creative enough and is never executed well enough to be good. It’s gotten really discouraging and has left me feeling really incapable and less worthy than others. I know that I’m “not supposed” to talk about myself like that, but realistically I bring less to the table.

I really enjoy being home and playing video games and consuming a lot of media like YouTube and anime. I feel guilty because that’s all I ever want to do. I don’t mean to be lazy, but I am. I feel I’ve lost my drive and motivation. I don’t choose to draw or design a new logo. I always choose to watch something or play a game. I enjoy doing that more and frankly would rather spend my time that way. So I do. I know it’s selfish and unproductive, yet it’s still what I do. I want to be different, but I don’t know how. I feel like this is who I am, and I don’t know how to be a benefit to anyone or society as a whole. I just don’t feel like I’m doing it right. I really do feel like I’ve been trying to change and to grow. I want to fit in more. I want to be happier. But the past couple months have been hard and I feel like I’ve stopped trying as hard. After not making nearly as much progress as I would like, and the progress I have made hasn’t helped me much. I feel like I’ve lost to will to fake it. :/ So I’ve just been sitting at home. Watching anime and playing video games while I try to figure myself out. 

I just feel like I’m not passionate, not meant to hold a job, not creative enough, and I’m lazy. All of this just feels like it adds up to be a burden to others. I really wish I could feel fulfilled and happy working a 9-5 design job or freelancing or something, and I’m sure I will end up doing that. But I don’t think I’m going to be happy in the job or in life until I figure myself out more. I’m tired of just grinning and bearing it, but I just don’t know how to make myself happier and more motivated.  I’m just feeling like a failure and a burden despite honestly not having a bad life. 

I’m open to constructive criticism and advice. I also really appreciate y’all listening and helping. Thanks so much &lt;3",27Dec2019,1

So I contacted the site and they had me removed from it.  However, magically, I was just sent a package yesterday of the secret Santa exchange despite cancelling it and the site even confirmed they cancelled it.  

The secret Santa was around 20$ or so so I contacted the secret Santa (they had their Instagram) and so they said it was all okay that I couldn’t sent them anything and that they hoped I liked their stuff.  

Should I return the favor? I did ask the person if they did receive a secret Santa from someone else at least but they haven’t gotten back to me yet.

Yes it was on a work computer, but no not my work email.

This afternoon, my co-manager approached me to let me know that our employer had pulled him aside and shown him my email and asked if he had known I was looking for a new job. 

My employer would have had to specifically choose my personal email on the gmail sidebar, as it doesn’t automatically log in, and then scroll to an unopened email, and then read it.

83,"Today I took my grandkids with me to a store to take advantage of the day after Christmas sales. I was 2 miles from the store going south and a car going north bound went off the road in front of me, hit a sign and hit the ditch. I quickly pulled over, made sure my grandkids were safe and scaled the steep ditch in snow past my knees to get to the car. The man behind the wheel was kind of still conscious and he had his foot on the gas still so the stuck car was still revving. I took his keys out of the ignition and heard a voice. 

He was on the phone with a guy he was driving to meet because he was buying something from their Craigslist listing. The guy told me the driver’s name, Billy (not real name but name for this post) and he took my number because he just happened to have Billy’s parent’s phone number because it was their item he was buying. Billy was totally passed out at this time, I checked his pulse and checked his breathing. His parents called me by the time the police came. Thankfully the police were able to get Billy conscious and he walked himself to the ambulance. 

I talked to his parents for about 30 minutes after the police left and the sadness in their voice really affected me. Billy was sober for 3 months and for him to relapse just really made his parents sad. They were upset also because the officer wouldn’t talk to them on the phone so they really didn’t know anything beyond what I could tell them. I feel for them because my first husband died of an overdose in 2011. 

Would it be weird to call his parents in a few days or next week to see how Billy is doing? Or should I just text. If so, what do I even say?

Thanks in advance",27Dec2019,1
84,"TL;DR: Sometimes I feel like I can't focus and that's why so many things go down the wrong way. I want to change but don't know how. 

&amp;#x200B;

To begin with, I apologize if this text doesn't follow any special red line or anything but I'll try to put the facts together as good as I can. Also english is not my native language.

&amp;#x200B;

I was pretty bad at school since 4th grade and degraded in performance increasingly. I struggled keeping social contacts, keeping up with the ""cool"" kids and developing relation ships with girls. I wasn't abnormal fat or ugly. I just didn't know how to keep conversations going or show empathy. I feel like everything I show emotionally is a mask I'm wearing. I want people to like me, so I'll say what they want to hear, let myself get interrupted by others overtalking me and try to argue as few as possible. But deep down I don't really want to. I want to set free my opinion but fear to lose my contacts due to things I say. 

I had a close connection to someone in my class. He died in a car crash a year before we graduated high school and since then my performance plummeted even more. I kind of lost my motivation to strive for anything, even thinking about ending my life but came to the conclusion that it's stupid and I just would add more damage to everyone. I'm off that thought.

The last months of school before graduation came and this beautiful girl talked to me. We quickly liked each other and for me it seemed like we filled each others insecurites. She got cheated on by her ex and I lost my best friend to a car crash. Sounds dumb but I guess many people do fill their insecurities with something.

We graduated where she did a great job of supporting me. We got an apartment, got a hamster and went to college. Again I couldn't focus and thought other minor things were much more important. I payed more attention to these things and she noticed. She tried to help but it was too late keeping up to all the stuff that had to be done for college. Again, I understand it's my fault. It seems like she didn't like that, and we split up two years after that. In total we spent 4 years together and I still can't believe this beatiful girl chose me back then.

The year before our seperation I accepted an offer from an IT company and am in my last trainee year so to say (after 3 years of being trainee you get a fixed good paying job). I again got to the point where my performance is plummeting and shit is about to hit the fan. I'd aprreciate answers despite from getting a therapist, they aren't pretty cheap here, so I can't afford them at least right now. 

Even though I might not like the job (I don't really know what else I should/could do) I have to at least get the fixed job offer to have something in my hands.

It's about a 7 hour drive, and I'm the only one who can drive because we live in a city where everyone rides bikes or catches the train. We've been planing this for months and I told my parents about it straight away because I wanted to borrow their car which is a 4-wheel drive, and they seemed fine. We've all been super excited about it, and we're all pretty responsible and mature. We were planning on taking a bunch of brakes along the way. However, last night my parents told me that I wasn't ""allowed"" to go because they were too worried about me driving such a long distance. The problem is that if I don't go then no one can go, because there isn't enough time to find another driver. I would just go anyway because I'm an adult and don't need parental permission, but my Mum is really sick in hospital, and my dad keeps saying that if I go I'll kill her with worry.

However she puts me down on a regular basis. Told me to 'stop eating fat bitch', often  disagrees when someone calls me pretty, and has laughed at me when I take an unflattering picture and continues giggling to herself while staring at the pic.

Now I grew up very insecure but have gained a bit of confidence over the last few years. I work out and eat well, I'm not the ugliest but she sure makes me feel it. I would never want to make her feel this way.

Anyone ever been in this type of situation? Not sure what to do as the friendship is great otherwise but I don't know if it can continue like this.",27Dec2019,1
102,"let's just jump right in.

My child and I moved into a house that my uncle was renting from my grandpa, his dad. We grew up together, but then we spent years apart. Throughout the years we have become drastically different while retaining a few shared interests. During the few months I have been living with him, there has been contempt and contention building between us. He thinks I'm messy, and he has said some disgusting things about women and immigrants and family members that I don't approve of. I'll admit it, I might leave piss on the seat, (which is gross, but it's not all the time, and if I do notice it when it happens I clean it up). I might forget to bring the garbage down to the alley the night before or leave a sink full of dishes for a week, which is also inconvenient. as far as I know and can tell, all of his grievances boil down to me being messy or forgetful.

I agree that that can be annoying or difficult to live with but I'm working on it. I don't want to be messy, or annoying, or a burden to anyone, and I want to do my fair share. Recently my doctor and I have been discussing the possibility of me having some undiagnosed ADD, and we are going to explore some medication. Also, I have a child and I work, and I'm trying to get back into school to finish my degree. I have a lot on my plate and, you would think my family would be understanding and want to help me out - I'm going to stop rambling and get to my point, I'm working on myself and I think people are being too hard on me/ not giving me enough slack.

Meanwhile, my uncle has no children, works a better job than me, and he calls in sick all the time so he can stay home and smoke weed and play WOW. While he's home all day, he sits on the internet and gets all worked up about ""trans and gays"" and politics and immigrants. When I get home from work, he barges into my room or wherever I am and starts going on about whatever the topic of the day is. It's all usually pretty hateful or petty. A few weeks ago I told him that I have zero interest in politics and that I don't like talking about it all and I asked him to stop. He never did stop, and I have just kept my mouth shut.

The thing is, my uncle is sick. he's spoken to me about the medications he's on. He keeps himself locked up and doesn't socialize with anyone faces to face, besides me and the people I bring over. He's not mentally healthy and my entire family knows it. I don't know what he's diagnosed with, but he has talked about depression and anxiety. long story short its hard to tell how severe his condition is because while he is sick, he brags about how much time he took off work and how many hours he pumped into wow classic. He will also lie about going to work to his father, and then expect me to cover for him. it's just hard to know how to feel.

anyway, there's some context for the contention between us.

Things came to a head Christmas Eve when he strangled me. I entered the kitchen with a new smart home device. I wanted to put it in the kitchen and leave it there so I can listen to music while I'm doing the dishes. I showed my Uncle (who was in the kitchen already) the device and he was appalled that I would even consider such a thing. He demanded that I put the device in my room because the device will ""record our conversations"". I said to him, ""No one is listening to us, and there is a mute button on the back"" I offered to mute the device when I wasn't using it, be he kept demanding that I put it in my room. At this point, I asserted myself and said ""you don't get to monopolize every decision in this house. I live here too. get rid of your cell phone if you're truly afraid of being spied on, and then I'll get rid of the speaker"". 

My Uncle does not own the house we live in, my Grandfather rents it to us. I pay to live there. I'm entitled to putting the speaker in the kitchen. Also, my uncle owns a cell phone, we have a smart remote that you can talk to, he plays WOW and talks on discord all day. His argument that he wants to secure his privacy is just a front for his real issue with me putting the speaker in the kitchen, which is that he doesn't truly own the home and that he can't control me. 

After I asserted my self and told him I was leaving it in the kitchen, he told me he was going to throw it out. after he said that I said, ""touch my shit and see what happens"". I shouldn't have said this, but at every point in the conversation, I felt like I had tried to compromise with him but he was ignoring everything I had been saying to him, and from the moment we started talking he was not being respectful so I spoke without thinking. I really regret saying that, I should have just walked away. 

After I said that to him, he hip-checked me out of the way and lunged for the speaker. I pushed him, he pushed me, then I shoved him far away and told him I was done with the scuffle. My child was with me that day, they were in their room, I wasn't going to fight anyone while my child was there. I turned my back to grab my speaker and walk away, but he grabbed my arm put it in a lock and put me in a headlock. when I started to struggle he bashed my head into the cupboard and I blacked out for a second. Next thing I know, I'm on the floor on my knees, he's on my back choking me. every time I tried to get him off me he strangled me harder. I started to feel fuzzy and I said you're killing me. He had been strangling me for about 2 minutes at this point. Then he said ""I'm not going to kill you but I'm your uncle and what I say goes, I'm the boss. if I don't want you living here, you don't have to be here."" Then he let me go. thankfully my child had no idea what had just happened.

I called the cops and they arrested him on 3rd-degree assault by strangulation.  unfortunately, my kiddo saw their great uncle get arrested. 

I feel absolutely awful about the whole situation. I feel like I just ruined my uncle's life (he works for the government so he'll probably lose his job). But I also feel very wronged by him, He shouldn't have been so controlling and demanding, He should have gone to work that day, and he shouldn't have strangled me. I just don't know how to feel about the situation. 

My family doesn't really seem to be very compassionate towards me, they are seemingly more compassionate towards my uncle. I don't know what to do because my grandpa told me that he thinks I have to me out. I can't afford to live anywhere else, without sacrificing the time I have with my child. I really just don't know what I'm going to do. 

TLDR: My uncle was arrested after he strangled me, I feel terrible and guilty about the whole situation, and now I might have to move out.",27Dec2019,1
103,"Me and my friend got into an argument because she kept pressuring me to tell her something about her boyfriend that i didnt want to say because i was told not to tell anyone and its the same player shit her boyfriend has done so i was sure it wouldnt phase her otherwise.

She didnt even look like she wanted to be there) so heres a piece of what she sent me because it sounds so ridiculous im actaully shocked on what i should say back..

He’ll stay home, be all pissy and blame me for not going and wasting an afternoon. I still live with him, and I have a job that leaves me exhausted.

105,"Strap in boys, we got a long one. No tl;dr bc details are important.

Since this situation is kind of effed in the ass and lasts over the span of months, I'm gonna make some bullet points. A small introduction to me for some context: I am insecure as hell in every relationship that I have and have yet to figure out how to fix it or to even identify when that's the problem. That's why I'm not sure if im just being dumb or what?

-I have a friend at college and he is gay.

-Beginning of friendship was wholesome and full of good times, we got, in my eyes, close (this was over the span of around a month)

-He kissed me 4 separate times, all while we were both high, and we've cuddled and slept in the same bed before (this was all platonic, I was fine with it bc i am Touchstarved, also this was during the month we were close)

-I developed a very inappropriate crush on him because of our physical closeness and ended up telling him because of some shitty circumstances, reacted very neutrally about it and said that it didnt change anything and he didnt hate me, etc. (all happened in the span of a couple weeks)

-Began distancing himself from me, wouldnt let me lay my head on him or touch him in any way. He said it was because he was overstimulated, which is a valid reason but I cant help but feel like he was half-bullshitting me because it happened on multiple separate occasions 

-him and all of my friends started hanging out without me, they claim it had nothing to do with me and was all just because it was spontaneous and I guess didnt think to tell me (over about 3 weeks to a month)

-we havent spoken in quite some time despite my efforts to text him, he just leaves me on read

I am not good at pretending everything is okay which I feel like everyone wants me to do. Nothing is okay on my side. He refuses to talk to me and tell me what's going on with him that he wont even respond to my messages, it's been that way for at least a month. My other friends say that he's been having personal issues which is a valid reason to not want to hang out but the issue is that he isnt isolating himself from EVERYONE, he just wont talk to ME. What should I do? I've tried talking to him about it but he doesnt do well with confrontation and I'm scared if I have another serious talk with him itll push him away even more. I've also been told and kind of believe that we arent compatible as friends but if that were true, I dont think we would have got along at all in the beginning. He knows how insecure I can be so I dont know why he's acting like this. So, what do I do? Am i being manipulated? By him or my insecurities? Do I try and talk to him? If so, what do I say? Please help, it's all I've been able to think about for months. My heart is heavy and it feels like I've grieved over someone who hasnt even died. All of my friends give me pretty biased answers in his favor and say that I'm being dramatic but this shit is HURTING ME.

Some extra info for funsies, DISREGARD IF YOU DONT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT METAPHYSICAL BULLSHIT: if you know anything about astrology, he is an aquarius and im a scorpio. we both fit the bill for those signs pretty well, I think my libra moon comes into play pretty strongly as well, though. we are all witches and have strong bonds with each other, which is relevant because he once asked me while he was cross faded as hell if we were twin flames (basically an ULTRA SOULMATE) (this also happened shortly after he tried to make out with me and I pushed him away) and we havent talked about it since, so a theory I have is that he is scared of being so close to someone else, so he doesnt even want to be around me if it's anywhere near true but I personally doubt we are twin flames because of the way he is acting. More metaphysical bullshit: I am an empath, and not like the people who Think they are, I AM one, and I dont think he likes how intense I am, he's an earth elemental and I am Very Much a water elemental. I will be ultimately satisfied if someone who is aware of all the witch shit answers with this in mind bc I feel like it affects it in some way.",27Dec2019,1
106,"First off, this is a throwaway account since people know my main one. As I said, I'm a 16 year old female and I just recently got into a new relationship after leaving one that was 4 years long (I know it's a long time for someone my age) but because of this I'm realizing flaws that my previous boyfriend never brought up. To make a very long story short he saw me as perfect in every way which is partially why I left. I knew that viewpoint wasn't healthy.
Now I'm in a relationship with someone else (17M) and I finally came to terms with how overly clingy and emotional I am. I cry over the smallest things and because of my fear of being alone I constantly want attention. In short, I make him unhappy. Does anyone know how I can get over this? I don't have many friends and the few I do simply tell me to leave him. One of my friends even went as far to say that I was too emotionally damaged to be in a relationship and that I should go to a mental hospital because of my depression which I am medicated for and is relatively stable.

108,"Hello, I am a  26 year old male who has been working in the airline industry for almost 3 years now. I started as a ramp agent/baggage handler for about 1.5 years and learned a lot about airplanes and even eventually had a sort of leadership position on the ramp. I eventually transferred internally to being at ticketing/gate agent.  I enjoyed it at first but it is draining my soul and not helping me make any progress financially or mentally.  The ONLY reason I work in this industry is because I can fly for free and that makes me feel like I have the ability to travel and see the world. I just wanted to feel like my life wasn't going to be doing a crappy 9-5 that I would hate. Well the catch with being able to fly for free is that the hours make it difficult to hold a second job and they cap your hours so you can't really work more than 30 hours a week unless you get full time which takes a few years. 

I have no desire to remain in this industry. Customer service makes me feel like I never get to be in my own headspace because I am constantly putting on a fake smile to people and doing something that brings me no joy. 

I have an associate's degree in liberal arts that I just obtained in May with the intention of trying to get a bachelor's in Political Science. I want a life with meaning and for some reason getting involved in politics seems like the route to go. However, I am always broke and can never travel with my job or seem to get far enough head to make completing school a realistic option. It's hard to focus on school when I am scared I won't have enough money to make it until pay day every two weeks. 

What jobs should I be looking for that maybe I can obtain with my experience? Indeed pretty much just recommends me more customer service jobs and it's really demoralizing. I just want to make a difference in the world and feel important and this job does not do it for me. I want to be involved and feel like a part of the world and I don't feel that way at all. Unfortunately, I was a stupid kid in my earlier twenties and didn't take college seriously so my grades aren't good enough to get me into the local Big 10 school that is in my city. It's in the city that I am likely not moving out of as I live with my girlfriend and our dog. So I need to find a way to make school a thing while I try to figure out a way that I could get accepted into this school. But I also want to be working somewhere that will help give me the skills I need to succeed in that world and also will kind of get my foot in the door. Please any advice is appreciated.",27Dec2019,1

113,"my boyfriend and i have been together for a year now, but that’s not important.

a little background on my boyfriend; he has brothers who are WAY older than him that he’s not close to and doesn’t get along with, he lost his dad to cancer two years ago and is still struggling to get past it, understandable because he took care of him while he was on chemo and his dad raised him all by himself when his mom walked out on him.

now, my boyfriend’s ex, who’s also his baby momma - who knows that my boyfriend has no one and lost the only thing in his life that kept him going, is stopping him seeing his son. he didn’t have his son much growing up because if any issues or arguments happened with his ex, she would just stop him seeing his child. she would have things her way when it comes to seeing his son and want him to see his son (in other words, have him babysit while she went out) at very inconvenient times such as; while his dad was alive and was on chemotherapy and needed taking care of, while he’s in work or even going to his best friend’s wedding, if he even THINKS about saying that it’s a bad time, there goes a year of not seeing his son.

so, enough with the background side of the story. present day, yesterday, christmas day. my boyfriend and i were both working christmas day, my boyfriend’s ex decided to send him a video of his son saying that he doesn’t want to see his dad. in the video the son doesn’t look very happy or comfortable that he’s being recorded so it’s mostly just him dismissing his mom when she’s asking him questions - showing that he doesn’t really want to talk about it or maybe even say that.

the same video she sent him last year ON christmas day after she stopped him seeing his son for MONTHS when he said he can’t take him because he’s going to his best friend’s wedding.

she sent it again this year as a way of saying “oh hey, just in case you’re having a horrible lonely christmas without your dad or anyone else, here’s a video to remind you i have the last thing in this world you want and you can’t have it.”

it really broke my boyfriend because she unblocked him on social media just to send that video. i want to do something but i don’t know what to do, clearly she’s not someone to talk sense with, i feel like anything i do, she’ll take it out on him by making things worse than they already are. i can’t help but want to REALLY give her a taste of her own medicine. i NEED advice, guys.",27Dec2019,1

115,"Some info: I’m young, so no kids, I’m won’t say how young but I’ll say this is my first proper full time job.

Additionally: I’m not sure if I’m even fired, they need to read through some computer times to see if my story matches up with what the computers say I was doing, but I’m honestly not sure if my story matches up though.

Why should I lie? Well my family is emotionally invested in my success, if I say I was fired because I messed up(which if I’m fired will be true) and they’d look down on me for failing, which I want to avoid.

The Lie: They knew it was a seasonal position, if I lie and say “ Christmas is over they don’t need me” it’ll be believable. A little weird though, why fire me on the 27th of all days? Why not the 30th or 31st?

Now I could just “show up” for work until the 30th, I’m willing to go that far, I drive myself so it won’t be an issue.

The truth: If I say too much it’ll be obvious where I work, but just know that I’m unsure if what happened was my fault, nobody was hurt or anything it was just an issue with the system that’s apparently enough to get someone fired. But if what happened is my fault, fine, I reap as a sow knowingly or not.

Risk: I don’t feel like the risk of being found out is too high, they send documents to my dad’s PO Box but he doesn’t open my mail, I’m not sure if they’ll send a letter or something saying I’m fired, but I doubt it.

116,"I have issues with my dad. He drinks a lot, is racist, a liar, and doesn't give me respect. When he would come home from work, he would always hang out in the garage to drink and smoke. It got to the point where I would have to tell my little brother (I think 7 at the time?) to go take a bath and then I would tuck him into bed.
I also couldn't voice my opinion, or have a disagreement because he would take it as me arguing. When he would drink, he would get wide-eyed angry and just stare and wobble while coming up with an argument.
 He always has to be right. He isn't open minded, and won't look at the other side of things or other viewpoints. He is also really bad at forgetting (maybe from the alchohol?). He has repeatedly asked me what I am going to school for. Speaking of school, he never really gave much support. When I tried to change professions from a hair dresser to wanting to be a massage therapist, he wouldn't help with my fafsa and talked me out of becoming one because it's ""not in demand."" Now, I am going to school to be a PTA. He barely says he is proud of me, and he also tried to convince me if I'm making a right choice.
There were other instances where if I brought home leftovers for myself, he would eat it. So I started putting my name on it and when he found out, he told me I was being a dick for doing that. Also, I bought myself a bottle of Crown Royal and within a few days, there was a quarter of it left. I asked what happened and he said, ""Oh! I made drinks for me and Linda (his now fiancé)."" Then winked at her. Like I didn't see it? I confronted her later and she said he drank it all. Which, I believe because she isn't much of a drinker anyways. My dad then told me he is worried about me because I am buying strong alcohol.
He makes racist jokes and uses slang to the point it gets uncomfortable.
When he first started dating Linda, she spent the night while me, and my other brother (17 or 18) were home. They had the LOUDEST sex ever and it got me really upset. That wasn't the last time either....
He now lives in Louisiana due to getting a better job. Linda moved in with him. On Thanksgiving, he proposed to her while visiting my aunt on Texas and never told us. I found out on Facebook. I asked Linda about it and she said that the trip to Texas was awful because my dad and aunt fought the whole time. So to make the day better, my dad proposed. She told me that originally, he wanted to facetime all of us before the proposal so we can all be included, but things didn't work out.

129,"Background: my bf (21) and i (19) have been dating about a year and a half. I go to college an hour away from home. I met some new friends in my classes. 

So a guy from one of my classes asked if I wanted to go to a basketball game over Christmas break and meet a couple people there. I texted my bf and asked if he cared if I went to a game with some people from school. He replied with yeah idc. Didn’t ask me any other questions. So the guy picked me up and we went to the game and met 2 other people there (a boy and a girl who were mutual friends of him). Felt slightly uncomfortable but wasn’t going to let it ruin the night. The seats were in rows of 2 so I sat by the guy who drove and and the other 2 sat behind.  The guy knew I had a bf, didn’t try to do anything, never touched me or anything. We’re friends and that’s it. after the game he asked if I wanted to go to the bar I said no and he drove me home. 

I’ve never given any indication to my bf about cheating on him nor would I ever. I love him more than anything and he’s always indicated he trusts my judgement. But he’s upset that I would get in a car with another guy and sit next to him during the game. He thinks I should have called him to come pick me up once I knew the seating arrangements. He’s saying I disrespected him. I never even once thought about cheating. I’m naïve when it comes to guys hitting on me because I don’t care about anyone else only my bf hence why I’m dating him. 

I can see how he is mad about me going with another guy but I didn’t know the seating arrangements or anything like that. He also didn’t ask questions and he always said he trusts me. I thought it was going to a basketball games with friends and having fun. 

And the night I came home from it he didn’t really say anything so I told him it was good and he waited two days to bring it up and ask what I did. Then he got mad. Stating I practically went on a double date and that I’m disrespectful.",27Dec2019,1

133,"(This might be written like a story but this is happening and I need advice)

I have been waiting to write a post like this. Don't get me wrong, I love my mother deeply, but I feel like I want to kill myself because of some things she told me when she was nervous.

My grandpa is old and sick and my mother has high blood pressure. Me and my sister aren't responding well to the situation. We travelled far to support him but seeing him like this makes me want to dig a hole in the ground and disappear. I get very closed off and don't know how to react. 
My sister,on the other hand, wants to control and rule over everybody . Everything has to go her way because she gets incredibly nervous otherwise.

So all of us are in a dilemma where we don't know how to react and act against each other. We're all mourning for the state of my grandfather but lately some things happened that got out of control. Being a teenage girl with an adventurous sister who wanted to come away from all the stress, panic and sickness related to our grandpa we disappeared for a while with our mother's consent (with the restrictions that we were only out for an hour, since the country we're at is quite dangerous). It was at the afternoon and we talked about life and what we wanted to do with our lives, boosting each other while planning. I felt so connected to my sister and we were both at peace.

Suddenly time passes by and we forget about time, so we head back. It's nighttime and nearly 4 hours have passed! I instantly panic on the way back and try to run, shouting my mothers name.

 We encounter our mom nearly having an heart attack, she had searched for us many hours among with our other relatives. I begin to cry and hug her, apologizing. 

Today we got into a fight and I supported my sister. My mother told me many cruel things, that I dont have any personality, that I'm false, that I only care about MONEY. She told me that we were superficial and said that we're nothing but little shits, that we should respect her. She was very angry and nervous, she does everything for us and me and my sibling haven't been supportive or grateful.

I'm not the nicest person there is. But those words stung like hell. I do care about her, I try to show it, but she kept saying that I'm selfish and evil. Fucking evil. I feel like a terrible person and I really tried to support my sister since she has a diagnose and gets really aggressive unintentionally. I also didn't want to pressure my mom but it was like everything she thought was worng with me came out and I feel so bad because of it. I have been depressed and really judgemental towards my self, and therefore bitchy against others. I have also been rude to my mom and my family, I have zoned off completely and haven't really given a shit. I wanted to take my life.

Lately I've been feeling better though. I try to stay truthful and sane but it's in moments like these that I want to give up. I'm staying because I want this to change, I want to believe that there is hope. I want to be optimistic.

TL;DR: I have been rude towards my mother because of my mental illness, and she told me some rude things that really hurt. I want to deal with this and come to peace with her again. I also want to stop being rude.",27Dec2019,1

137,"My work is extremely short-staffed right now. They're going to be remodeling and changing up their concept in mid-to-late January, and I get the feeling they're not going to be hiring any more staff until after that whole process is finished.

So, we've got myself and one other bartender just alternating doubles. This means I basically wake up, get ready for work, stay there for 12-13 hours with an hour break I usually just spend grabbing pizza and a beer at the Whole Foods nearby, and then go home and spend a couple hours being burned out— mindlessly refreshing Twitter and Reddit, watching TV, playing video games, and/or doing whatever your favorite euphemism is for watching porn and masturbating— until I'm past the point of exhaustion and willing to go to bed and do it all over again. Occasionally, I'll hit a drive-through and get some shitty fast food or run some minor errands on the way home.

Every day I don't work is spent pretty much exactly the same as those few hours after work, except when I have a prior obligation like D&amp;D. They basically become the world's worst Mental Health Days.

Obviously, this is a recipe for pretty much everything in my life being miserable. I barely socialize outside of work: it's like pulling teeth for my friends to get me to hang out, and I pretty much never go out on my own; I've spent too many nights exhausted, sulking, alone and depressed at bars to think that sounds like a good time. But what's worse is that I can't seem to make myself work on the stuff that might make me feel less depressed. Writing, illustration, game design, (and troubleshooting and fixing my computer so I can work on those things more efficiently) all the things that I *want* to be working on and insist that I *would* work on if only I didn't have to work so damned much are just being ignored whenever I'm not working.",27Dec2019,1

There is a person I know in real life and occasionally see. I follow them on instagram. They have a dog which is a very cute animal but also kind of dumb and stubborn, so it's hard to train. They don't walk the dog very often (or so it seems, the dog always appears to be inside the house at this point in time whenever I see it). I know that the dog is well-fed and is quite fat but doesn't get to go outside often (or ever). The dog is kept indoors in a tiny studio apartment for many hours during the day, all alone.

Additionally, the owner makes instagram posts shaming the dog for its 'bad' behavior like 'eating grapes' (grapes are not good for dogs, but they were left where the dog could very easily get to them, like at walking level), and for 'blowing out' the owner's 'knee by running into' them. Again, while this isn't a good thing, it's very likely that the dog didn't do it on purpose.

None of these things were particularly concerning to me, as I know people have different standards of pet care, but a very recent event and post led me to be concerned for the dog's well-being.

The dog recently ate some dark chocolate that was left out while the owner was there and had to be taken to the vet because it was really sick. The dg was OK, but very soon after the incident the owner posted this on instagram:

*'\[Dog's name\] is so busted! After last week's excitement with chocolate we set up a camera to see what she is up to when we leave. 5 minutes in she's stuck her head in her food bag, checked every surface for snacks, pulled down an empty decoy wrapper and stuck her head back in the food bag...someone just lost their free roaming living room privileges'*

With webcam photos of the dog doing said things. However, if you look at the web cam, the food is left open and on the floor where the dog could easily get to it. I fail to see how this warrants the dog losing its 'free roaming living room privileges'. I'm concerned because I know the dog is often confined to a small space for many hours at a time, and confining it to an even smaller space is worrying.

What should I do? Keep an eye on this person and document what I find concerning? Mind my own business? Am I just overreacting to normal dog owner behavior?

**tl;dr** Dog owner keeps their dog in apartment for many hours out of the day and rarely walks their dog. Dog has a habit of eating things it shouldn't while owners are out, and is henceforth being punished by being confined to a smaller space in the apartment. Is this abuse or neglect?",27Dec2019,1

148,"Hi all,
So I know it may seem like a typical situation but I just don’t know what to do. I started my freshman year with academic university scholarships and an outside scholarship that only turns into a loan that you have to pay back if you don’t complete the agreement after graduation. I’ve had to not worry about eating or housing for two years thanks to my scholarships and my jobs.

This past semester (would’ve been my fifth) I had a complete breakdown a couple of times all which ended on attempts on my life. Since I had missed around a week of school at the time because of my attempts, the university strongly suggested that I withdrew myself from the semester or that they would do it for me. They assured me that all my scholarships would be intact when I come back. However, I received notice recently that I am losing my scholarships (except the one that can turn into a loan).

Now, this is the part that I’m sure you guys have heard a thousand times. I cannot pay for college because it is too expensive. The only reason why I went to this college in the first place is because my parents nor I would have to go into debt. My parents don’t have jobs, I have a ridiculous amount of hospital bills that I need to pay for, and the career that I am studying for does not pay well at all.

Why am I worried if I still have that other scholarship that generously covers the rest? I am worried because if I get sick again and am not able to comply with the loan agreement then I would have to pay that back which now is at a total amount of ~$70,000.

With that being said, should I prevent myself from further trouble and just end it early where it’s not as painful or keep going and graduate and do my five year agreement so I don’t have to pay anything back and get a degree out of it?",27Dec2019,1

My SO, age 22, is leaving on a work trip the day before my birthday so we only have this weekend to celebrate. I’m currently distant from my friends because of some weird conflict with them and none of them are 21 yet. I always wanted to do something fun and unique for the day I’m finally able to get into clubs and bars legally, but this unfortunately won’t happen. I’ve looked forward to my 21st birthday for years, even if that sounds silly. I pictured it to be a crazy time with my friends. At this point it seems like I’ll have a pretty normal time with my SO, days before my actual birthday. Nothing too exciting. We have the option of taking a quick 2-3 day trip somewhere in the country, but I get stressed out with the thought of flying and being somewhere for just a few days. Flights are expensive and I don’t want to feel rushed, but I’m aware that I’m overthinking it. If we don’t travel, we can stay home in LA and do something ordinary. My friends haven’t tried making any plans for my actual birthday and it all just feels awkward. I feel like I’m seeking to feel special and important for my birthday because I don’t feel either of those things normally. It feels a little ridiculous to want that, but at the same time I feel like I deserve it. I always want my friends and SO to have a great birthday where they feel prioritized. Especially for a big one like 21. 

How can I manage my expectations and just be cool with whatever happens? Every year I’m disappointed, not because things didn’t go totally my way but because it always feels like there’s not much effort from anyone in my life to make it a special day. I’m caught between the feeling of “it’s just a birthday who cares” and “this is a special time in my life that I only get once and I would like to feel special for once.”

My problem is I’m way to self aware of everything I do, and it has been happening for the last 4 years. It started when I got into psychology, and I picked up a book called “you are not so smart”, that book basically in a nutshell tells the reader that no action we take happens by accident (read the book if you disagree, I promise it will change your mind). For some odd reason that book really stuck with me, and after I read that book I started 2nd guessing everything I did. After that a couple of years later, I heard about Nihilism, and I read up on it (a lot) and it’s ideas really stuck with me too, so the idea of nothing mattering at the end piled up on top of this 2nd guessing thing. Now it’s gotten to the point where, for example let’s say I have a new project I want to start, I will get a shred of excitement, but then it will go away as my brain says “Why did you even wanna start this? You know it doesn’t matter what you get done at the end, it’s not actually gonna do anything” (along those lines) Then my motivation leaves at that moment and it’s impossible for me to get it back, so I throw the project or whatever I was trying to do away. 
I don’t feel sad or anxious, quit the opposite I’m always laughing and love being around people, but I just want this feeling of “Nothing I do matters, and every thing that happens to me is my fault” to go away, I can’t accomplish anything because of the way I think, and I keep putting my self down.

I don’t leave the house and havnt for 4 years  except for 6 hours a week to work at a football  stadium as somebody there to help. I used to enjoy it and it made me excited to go out and do something with my day for once , but other times it’s very difficult. I always get picked for the shitty jobs (part of being ugly) and there’s times I blatantly get stared at because I’m ugly. Last week some young guy walked past me stared at me walking past it was obvious what he was thinking. Another higher up authority young guy there always stares at me a lot  and I assume it because I’m ugly and I think it is, he does it every shift and he’s nothing special either but when he’s fatally talked to me he’s seemed nice and friendly with me. and I get a lot of girls sometimes who stare me down because I’m tall and slim it happens so often too it’s made me develop an eating disorder. I don’t ever wanna leave the house for it.

165,"I have been entrepreneurial since I was very young. Selling Pokemon cards at 9 years old, to starting my first e-commerce store at 11.  I have always loved business and got into investing at 14 years old but since the 7th grade, my grades have been mediocre because of my tendencies (70-80%). Because of that, my parents strongly encouraged me to stick to school and stop putting so much energy into something I will do the rest of my life... that is buying and selling either products, stocks or services. 

Since my 5 years in high-school and only concentrating on getting my grades up, I have achieved a global average of 92%. my lowest grade being physical education 76% and my highest ones being finance 97%, philosophy 96%, and English 97%, the rest are in the ranges of 90%-95%. But the sacrifices I had to do to achieve these grades are not in regards to studying hard, but erasing my passion from my life... This made me miserable and after long periods of time of doing it (3-5 months) I would break-down and get in a very depressive phase. I would distance myself from friends and family and would completely stop paying attention in class and even start not going to school for a couple of days.

I love business and I know that's what I want to do in life, I have high interests in politics and history but I know these degrees don't get lucrative jobs. I want to strive for an MBA but that would take me 7 years (in the current Québec system). But I found another opportunity, and that is to move to Poland. I have an uncle there that started a very profitable business making upwards of 7 figures in gross sales. He has a lavish lifestyle and would love to have the type of life he has, but there are still 7 years ahead of me if I go for the MBA. But I have a second idea and this is my question, should I after my last year of high-school (at the end of this year) drop my post-secondary projects and try moving to Poland and start a business with my uncle? If anything happens (my business fails or another unpredictable thing happens), my parents live here in Canada and I can come back at 18 years old and still reapply to the schools I'm interested in. 

The only drawback I see is 1 year of my life doing what I love and gaining much experience in the field I want to potentially study in. But I'm still very unsure about it... what do you think Reddit?",27Dec2019,1
166,"So I would really like some advice, I feel like my situation is very complicated and I have the tendency to be irrational and not think straight so I would love some insight from more people who may be more levelheaded than I am.

For some backstory I’m 22 and I’m a transgender woman. I moved out when I was 18 very naively because I wasn’t getting along with my dad because of my trans status and I was ready to leave the city I grew up in to start my own life. I’m from Seattle but I ended up moving to NY and living with a friend I’d been speaking to online for years. Unfortunately we had a falling out and I had to move back half a year later. I was not happy about moving back because I had fallen in love with everything about NY. I’ve been all over since and for the past few months I’ve been in Seattle living with my mom and I hate it. I never pursued higher education after high school and parts of me has been regretting that and I’ve been thinking of going back to take nursing prerequisites and eventually getting my rn. Currently I’m making good money waitressing but my living situation sucks. I live with my mom and my 3 siblings in a 2 bedroom apartment. Soon my mom will be moving into a house and I would have my own room but it’s very far and out the way from my job and from the city. I have quite a bit of money saved this time around and I was planning on moving back to NY and renting a room off Airbnb for 1000 a month and getting a waitressing job out there. I just want to move back because I feel miserable here and I was happy in NY. I would have to wait a year before going back to school if I move to ny but I’d have to be paying rent etc in ny but here I would be living free etc. not sure what I should do. I really want to move back to NY, any input would be greatly appreciated thanks !!",27Dec2019,1
167,"I’m just going to say thank you for reading this beforehand. And sorry if I talk about too much about my life but I just can’t pinpoint what exactly went wrong with me.

So I’m a 20 year old uni student, mixed raced (half black) Male who’s been raised up in a predominantly white area. My parents aren’t super rich but growing up money wasn’t a problem for them, they built a big house when I was young so I will admit my childhood was awesome. They do come from modest/poor backgrounds so I myself have had part time jobs and earned since 14 and have my own ambitions for my own success. I was also raised as a Christian with a lot of pressure set on myself and my siblings to live to certain standards, not from just my parents but from grandparents and all relatives really except a few who don’t attend the church.

But growing up I was always a very shy and timid kid, I was very nerdy and skinny until I got to high school where I broke out of my shell and became quite popular tbh. However, I was limited with my friends there as I wasn’t really allowed to see them out of school (because of them not being Christian). I was incredibly fast and athletic but i couldn’t catch a ball or throw one well, I just felt tremendous pressure on myself in any team sport really and it would hold me back from my potential, which lead to me being laughed at. I’d get teased by my friends for being so skinny, incompetent at anything, being a weird Christian kid, and being rich. Also, being one of the only ethnic kids in the school also made me feel even more like an outcast. Yet I found myself again when I started going gym at 13 and I haven’t stopped going since.

I had grown my confidence very well through gym as I now have grown my body to be very lean and muscular I’ll admit. By the time I started going uni I felt invincible as I didn’t care about anyone’s bullshit, I had cut people out of my life before, had experience with girls and had toughened up a bit by then (also not an active Christian anymore so that pressure was also gone).

I then met my girlfriend few months into uni and we had gone through some bad drama during the first few months of our relationship. Was fair to say I felt insecure in myself again after this which a couple of my uni ‘friends’ must have caught up on and managed to then draw out all of my other insecurities (being “too white” for a black guy, being a “r*tard” and being a “silver spoon kid”) all over again.

So to be honest, I feel like I’m going back into that personal shell I once had where I could just isolate myself from the world and cut off from people and all their bullshit. I don’t have any mental illness, condition, anger problem or idk if I’m just a sensitive snowflake but I just can’t take the amount of negative fucking trash I’ve had from people my whole life.. it just makes me want to rage out so bad. I’ve even smoked weed everyday to just try keep myself calm. It’s not good to use it like that but it’s hard for me to keep my head up as well.. I haven’t smoked in the last two weeks however which has helped clear my head a bit.

My insecurities now even affect my relationship and I feel like I’m just turning into a toxic person and that I’m about to be dumped because my mind is just torn in two. One side still has that inner ambition to keep fighting back and proving everyone wrong, but my other side just agrees with everyone and says how pathetic and stupid I am and I won’t win in life.

I still go gym every week but I also feel I have potential to be good at boxing if I went for it. It’d be the best middle finger I could have to everyone who has wronged me, but it just takes that initial push for me I need to overcome my negative state of mind and tell myself I can do it. I just don’t know what else I can do for myself, I seriously do worry that I will grow old too fast and I will have missed my window to prove everyone wrong, its one of my greatest fears. 

People think I’m just spoilt, vein, dumb and useless but that just adds to my hunger to win. So I’ve come to reddit to ask for some direction on where I can go from here? And how I can break free from my negative thoughts for good?

TL;DR I’ve had people call me names and label me however they want all my life, I don’t know if I’m just sensitive but I am trying to fight back and be stronger against my mind so I can succeed, any help on my personal issues!?",27Dec2019,1

In those 4 years,we were friendly to each other,and starting from 2 years ago,I changed a lot,and A started liking me
Fast forward to the last year
I changed even more,and A joining me and my friend's when talking different things,I'd sometimes make a joke that would make her mad at me(you know,8th grade jokes,but not offensive ones)
She 100% started liking me,that being confirmed by her cousin,my best friend
However,I did not like her back,the spark just did not light up for me,as I did not dislike anything about her 
Through obvious signs and one time she making a big text saying she likes me but she knows she has no chance,I told her,in a way as nice as possible,that I just don't like her,but it isn't her fault,it's mine
Well,after that,she still liked me,despite(then probably)trying to forget me
Fast forward this summer,it happened like 2 times,where she told either directly or indirectly that she liked me,and I think I explained it more nicely
However,these days I received a message from her cousin saying that she found photos of me in her gallery,in an album named ""FORGET!!"",and the photos were almost every photo there is of me on social media,and on my profiles there are like 5 photos,out of the 20-30 she had,which she got from my family...
I almost cried a bit after seeing how she was suffering
I unintentionally made her think she had chances,by saying things like ""you're special to me because I am the one who gives you a message first"",as I message like 3 people to check what they are doing,and I am pretty sociable

So my parents live in the neighbouring country to where I study and I came over for christmass and told them I will be staying until saturday. 

A short summary of the problems my family have are that my parents are both jobless. My mom got fired a long time ago and she has lost her right to het money from the government (don't know the word in english but you get compensated as long as you keep looking for jobs). My dad got fired about 2 years ago after 9 years of exploitation and stressful court situations. I think it's fair to say that he's badly damaged mentally to the point where he is no longer able to work anymore. He also has major anger issues and verbally abuses my mom and sometimes me. Every single time I come home they fight. I don't want to come home, but I do to try and keep being a somewhat functioning family.

My parents both severly overshare their personal problems with me and use me as mental support. Tonight my dad caught me in  a conversation that I didn't want to have but I feel like I can't leave. I don't think he would be able to cope with my criticism about him and their situation. He already has suicidal thoughts and I don't want to push him in the slightest. I know they have it worse but I'm really going crazy. I'm starting to hate my parents, have nightmares my dad, heart issues etc. I'm just so fucking done but I can't tell anyone because they can't take it.

189," Alright, this is going to sound like something different in your minds than what it is to mind, perhaps, so let me try to explain this the best I can.

I'm currently married, happy, have a child, and am in NO way planning on cheating or doing something stupid.

Back in the day, I had a crush on this girl back in HS. We communicated a lot throughout the years and hung out a lot but never got into a relationship with each other for whatever reason. She seemed to like me, I liked her, but it didn't happen. I got to know her family, her sisters, her mom, and they treated me the nicest I've ever been treated by people before. I really appreciated them for being so genuine and nice to me.

We were always in our own relationships and I moved so it never worked out. Anyways, she's had her second child now, and we haven't talked in about 2 years.

It wasn't on purpose, nor was I actively talking to her beforehand, I was just engaged and didn't need to talk to her anymore than I would any other girl/guy on my friend's list.

Anyways, when my fiance, cheated and ditched me, I messaged her sounding super corny and desperate and basically was like ""here's my #, I'm deleting all apps and take it if you wanna talk."" She didn't because she was in a relationship and I'm actually glad she didn't because I'm married now and things are good.

NOW, I'm considering adding her again only because we had known each other for years (close to a decade) and I feel bad because the last time I talked to her I was quite pathetic in being like here, call me cause I'm gonna delete everything.

I lasted about a year and several months; almost 2 years without social media and then got it back again. I added everybody back but her (since I'm married and felt scared/not right to add her back).

However, I cannot help but feel terrible for just ditching somebody like that (AS A FRIEND). If it would have been a guy friend and I would have done such a thing I'd feel bad.

I'm considering adding her back (not even looking at her profile, communicating with her, etc.) just to show that there are no hard feelings and to kind of redeem myself.

I know you all are gonna think that I like her because I'm writing this huge post but I promise that I don't. We both have our own lives and I don't want her in that way anymore but I just don't want to delete somebody out of my life like that neither. It seems rather cruel and I'd feel bad if somebody did me that way. It's probably too late and I know my wife wouldn't be happy about it, most likely, she wouldn't be happy with ANY girl to be on my list because she's quite jealous. However, I feel like if I do this I won't feel so bad about myself as a person.

I refuse to talk to her besides regular chit chat like I would with anybody else, refuse to comment on pics or be too extra. I have hundreds of other people on Facebook and IG like that that I don't really talk to but that I know.

Would this be fine or am I just a moron/terrible person all across the board?

Thanks guys.",27Dec2019,1
190,"I’m just here looking for advice in a sea of others in a similar situation. I just need someone to help guide me because I have absolutely no one in my life who I can talk to about this, the person I’m speaking about was that person to me.
So I broke up with my ex in September, this person was perfect for me and I broke up with them for selfish reasons. In all honesty I was scared to be with him forever because I wanted to explore. I was scared of how much I loved him. 
So, I broke up with him and I told him I needed time. A few months to clear my head because a serious relationship wasn’t for me at that moment in time. I really thought he would understand but unfortunately he didn’t, and this is where it all goes wrong. He basically begged me to stay with him and it made me want to leave him even more, he told me how much he loved me and he’s never ever even layed eyes on another girl. And I’m not gullible, I truly believe he meant this from the bottom of his heart because he had no reason to say this. I was his first girlfriend at 21 and he’d never had anything even close to serious with a girl. I really was his everything but I couldn’t see how much I needed him at the time so I did everything I could to stop him from wanting to be with me. I accused him of being selfish and only liking me because I made him feel good. I accused him of being forceful in bed with me and worst of all I slept with one of his best friends and lied to him about it. To top it all off I kissed another one of his best friends. 
So then it was successful. I stopped hearing from him. He told me he never wants to see me again or hear from me again. It was shit at the time because I didn’t want to lose his friendship but I think in honesty thinking back I again was just being selfish and wanted to string him along because it made me feel good how much he loved me. 
I moved to another country and heard nothing from him for about 2 months until my friend mentioned him. This set everything off for me. I realised how much I needed him. How much I loved him and how stupid I was to leave him, I’ve been struggling with serious mental health issues for a long time and I think this is why I was so blinded and stupid, but there’s no excuse. 
So basically I was in absolute pieces, I felt the way you feel when you’ve just freshly had your heart broken by someone you love. So I wrote him a letter, I told him how sorry I am and reminded him how much I really loved him. Without giving him the burden of admitting I still do love him. I really poured everything into that letter, not to get him back but as closure because I knew I didn’t deserve him. I sent the letter and that night I went on Facebook and saw he was in a relationship with someone.
This is a boy who’d never really had interest in anyone until 21, fell deeply in love and had his heart broken. 2 months later he was in a new relationship. I couldn’t understand, my mind raced a million ways and it has absolutely torn me to pieces. I still haven’t heard from him and all I want in this world is to talk to him. Not even to get him back but just for the sake of talking to the boy I loved so much, the person who made me feel special and safe. I don’t think I can move on until I’ve spoken to him. In fact I know I can’t. And by move on I mean move on with life. My mental state has completely spiralled and I’m in a pit of constant anxiety and paranoia. All I want is to talk to him and I don’t know if he would care about me even just as a human being. I don’t want him to think I just want him back because that’s not it. And I don’t want to fuck with his new relationship, I don’t want to storm back into his life and fuck everything up. But I need him, what the fuck do I do? I want to show up at his door and just ask him human to human to talk to me. To talk to me as a human not as his ex girlfriend but I’m so afraid he won’t understand and he’ll be angry and I’ll fuck everything up for him. I’m driving myself crazy, please anyone how can I approach this situation? I truly believe this person was my forever person and we connected on a whole different level.

Tl;dr: I fucked up a beautiful relationship and he has moved on. I feel I need to talk to him in order for myself to move on also. Is it wrong to go to his house after sending 1 long message and a letter, letting him know how I’m feeling and not getting a response?",27Dec2019,1

192,I (20m) live at home with parents and two younger siblings. My oldest sister is moved out. My parents fight every few weeks. The most recent one started with something to do with Christmas presents. It turned into my mom screaming and cursing at my dad in front of my 13 year old sister and me. Later on she tried to scratch my dads car. My dad of course stopped her. Then she came in saying she was going to call the police because she had been ‘assaulted’. She never actually called the police. Today she’s been really upset and crying off and on. She won’t talk to my dad and can hardly stand to be in the same room with him.

193,"So my phone has already been turned off but I have been using my boyfriend's phone on all my applications for jobs. His is due to be turned off Saturday. With everything the way it is now we can hopefully scrape together enough for rent in January. Our rent is due by the 5th. That is the absolute last day we can pay.       

What I need help deciding is should we pay the phone bill or rent? If we pay phone to keep it on we wouldn't have enough to pay rent until the 9th at the earliest. Our landlord already said if we don't pay by the 5th she has to start the eviction process bit I know that takes time. So we could just pay on the 9th?      

I'm just worried if the phone gets turned off what will happen to any jobs that try and call me? I've put out so many applications I'm the last few weeks using his number. We can't afford fornme to miss out on an opportunity.",27Dec2019,1
194,"First of all, sorry for my bad English. C': Secondly, hello people and thank you for taking your time to read this. Lastly, I'm unsure of where to begin with but I will try to keep it brief. 

I have known this guy for a year now. He wasn't originally my friend but rather my mom's. I greeted him and talked once in a while when I feel like it. After a situation which happened somewhere in September where I broke up with someone who happen to be his friends, I found out that he had liked me for some time already but afraid to tell me. My mother told me this. However, I didn't really care about this and my mother told me that he had asked my mom to handle this matter, asking her to make an arranged marriage. So technically it's like forcing me to get me married to him without my consent. However, my mother didn't want to abide by his suggestions. Our relationship stayed just like before. I wouldn't really consider us to be friends because of the lack of communications.  

Nevertheless, in the beginning of this month I started to get slightly warmed up to him because he's been going to my house to help my mother with her work. I thought that perhaps we could be friends or like siblings. We joked and stuff yet I was proved wrong in my judgement when I was assaulted by him few days ago in the morning when I went to wake him up. Luckily for me, it didn't went as far as him penetrating me altho he did try with his finger. It was traumatic to say at least. This would be the fourth time and I'm starting to think that all guys that I have met are all the same. He apologised that afternoon and gave bunches of excuses. One of them being, he couldn't hold it anymore because he had been waiting for 6 months already. I didn't want to make the situation worser and by that I mean, I still need him to help my mother with her works. I told him that I'm willing to let it slip but would never trusted him anymore. I thought it would ended there but I was wrong. 

Apparently he told lies to his family, telling them that he's already married me. But since that wasn't the truth, they found out about it rather quickly and forced him to quit working here and asked to go to another state. He didn't want to and yesterday he pressured me into promising him that I will wait for him and marry him. I was like what the fuck. I told him that if god wills it will happen but no. He didn't accept that answer and insisted me to promise him. So I told him that he should be patient and let the time decide and we should be friends first. And that I need the time to recover from his selfish act. In spite of that he questioned how long we should be friends when it is already long enough according to him. Heck, if we are really friends then we would know more about each other but I don't even fricking know what his hobbies are or any other stuff that a friend would share with each other. 

I got so pissed off that I then dared him to tell the truth to everyone, his own family and mine about his attempt to assault me the other day because it seems like he is forcing me to accept him. And of course he refused to do so even though he said he would tell them. 

It seems like I ended writing a long one and I am sorry about it. So, can someone advise me on how should I tackle this problem? Thank you.",27Dec2019,1

198,"So, at the beginning of December, I moved in here. It is a nice flat just 1km from the University of my town. (Germany)  
Basically my Landlord was living here with 3 subtenants and now was moving to a different city but the flat still is his so he just gave me his room as the 4th sub-tenant.

I am a very introverted Person to people I don't know, like to be alone and like to avoid new social contacts.  
So I didn't find it suspicious when I didn't get to see the other subtenants before I moved in.  
We have a legal binding Rent-Agreement (Or however you call that in English) and I pay him a normal price for the size of my room and location of the flat. So not extremely cheap or expensive.

But now I noticed a few things that made me suspicious.  
It is over 20 days now and I only noticed one Subtenant at all, which I spoke to like 2 Sentences. These Sentences were ""Oh yeah I move out on Christmas.""  
So I am living together with 2 people I don't know and a 3rd new one is coming according to my landlord.  
But somehow I can't believe it. Sure, sometimes the Shower looks used, but not very often, and I hear steps, but that could be from the other flats too.   
Today I noticed that everything in the kitchen that doesn't belong to me (I got a separate fridge space and a separate box in the freezer, so I didn't care at first) has expired like 2 or 3 years ago.  
We literally have 2 Bottles of water in the kitchen(which I didn't care about, because I also buy my own drinks and put them in my room) which EXPIRED 2017, so it has to be from 2015 or 2016 right?  
Also Starch, Noodles and other stuff which I got a quick look on expired even as early as 2016.

Is there some shady stuff I got myself in? The Landlord seemed nice, and I am even in a Whatsapp Group for this Shared Living created in April this year (Even though my Landlord says they have this for over 5 years) with 6 Participants.  
My initial ""Hello"" wasn't answered, nothing was written since I got in there and I am too socially awkward and shy to write anything in there.

But somehow it creeps me a bit out, living here 20 days now with only once seeing a human being in here.  
Not that it hurts me, I like being alone after all, but the last time I pursued that I got charged with ""being Member of a criminal organization"" which luckily got dropped after they found out that I in fact knew nothing about what was going on where I lived (Was a bit more complicated, worked for a not-so-legit employer and lived there too. It was nice and isolated and then got waken up at 4 in the morning by the police, so I am a bit paranoid about this stuff).

Does someone recognize any scheme or something in my story? A common fraud?  
I already checked for cameras and electronics other than mine in my room and found nothing.",27Dec2019,1

I’m a 21 year old college student who for lack of better words is pretty lonely. I have a full time job set up after college and I’ll be graduating this May.

As a result I start having a lot of self hate and some hate to others. Other times I become really sad to the point of crying or wanting to cry or to just heavy sighing a lot and being very emotionally exhausted as I keep wishing or wanting to be a better person.

They said that won't happen so I offered to pay all bills from next month forward, but I'll pay bills from January-May in May and continue then. So, the idea is I don't have to start paying immediately while I don't have an income and can pay when I'm more financially stable.

208,"I live in a quiet neighborhood. Houses close together but well kept. Lots of kids. Everyone's nice. Up until the last few days, the police and city officials have always proved helpful. Well, crap went off the deep end this past week and frankly none of us know what to do. They've tried getting the police involved, but they aren't helping.

For starters, there's a pair of pit bulls who ""somehow keep getting out"" and have killed at least 3 pet cats. There's a few other missing cats that the neighbors are looking for, but are still unaccounted for, and since one cat was found torn up in a field, there's a possibility the poor things just haven't been discovered yet. We have photos of the two dogs, bloody snouts, and a neighbor who heard her cat screaming and found these two dogs on her porch with her cat high up a support beam.

Police say they can't help.

My neighbor two doors down woke up on Sunday to discover her cat SHOT DEAD in her front yard. Obvious entry-and-exit wounds. Blood pooled in the grass. No one heard a gunshot. The cat was shot straight down, execution style, and the neighbors are buying a metal detector to see if they can find the bullet to prove the cat was shot there. Her second cat is also missing.

The police say they can't help. This sweet old woman brought her dead cat to the police station, hauled the poor thing out of the bag, and MADE THE OFFICER LOOK AT THE HOLES....they still can't help. She spoke with the chief...he apologized, but couldn't do anything.

None of us know what to do. There's quite a few missing cats, and we in the neighborhood are scared and afraid for our remaining pets. Mine are on strict house arrest. What can we do to make the police look into this? Or is this something the police can do nothing about and we're just spinning our wheels? Any advice would be great. We're scared and feel so helpless.",27Dec2019,1

I have always thought her to be very attractive but quickly in the friendship I developed an intense crush that I kept to myself. I am very uncomfortable with it because she is my bestfriend and I have never felt a attraction as much as I do to her. I have never approached her or made a move or anything but we hang out and complement freely. I think I just want to tell her. I hate hearing about her dating life it makes me feel awful and I know why Im jealous but it makes me physically ill and nauseous to hear about that and I am praying talking will help. I am absolutely confident shes not gonna take me with open arms. She told people all the time that she would never date me.

217,"Hello reddit. I'm not sure where to start so I guess I will write about where I think the problem started. 9-10 years ago (my memory of those days is a little hazy) my parents got divorced. It happened so suddenly that when my dad gathered me and my brother to break the news, I couldn't understand what I was hearing. I cried, unable to comprehend why. I still don't, because my parents seemed so happy. I was looking forward to the new house we planned on moving in, looking forward to my new sister, and new school.... my life shattered that day. I was 12/13 years old then. 

Before the divorce, I would describe myself as carefree, happy, maybe a little mischievous (Because I remember making alot of jokes during class, although I was loved by the teachers) . At school I tend to get straight A's. In fact, I aced all my exams until lower secondary school. 


I lived with my mother, and we (my siblings and I would go to our dad's place during the weekends. I was getting by, and things were pretty calm until that day I made my mother cry. I have never, ever, wanted to hurt her. But it happened. How? I don't understand why either. One day, when my mom came to pick me up from school, I got in the car and she was crying so much with my little sister comforting her. Apparently, it was because she waited over an hour in the car and that it was hot and she said I was late. Again, I can't recall the exact reason why I was late, but I'm pretty sure I wasn't messing around. Anyway seeing her like that and saying that it was my fault really crushed me.  I'm sure she didn't mean it, that it's the weather and maybe she had a bad day. From this day onwards, I started realising things. Stuff like how I never really had friends - most of them come and go. I realised then how pathetic I actually was, and I just saw myself as this evil person who makes his mother cry and that there's no going back. 

A few months later my mother announced that she would like to get married with somebody new. I hated the decision so much, that I argued with her and my grandmother who tried to convince me to accept this decision. Eventually I had to move in with my dad. Then I guess after a few months living with my dad, he managed to get me and my mom back on talking terms and I moved back in with her.

On October 2013, we migrated to France. I was 15 then, but being in a foreign country opened up my mind a lot. I learned French, went to high school, and now I'm in university. But everything was a blur. Somewhere along the way I forgot my purpose. I don't know what I'm doing. I go to school but why? It seemed so obvious before, but I no longer want to study. I don't really have friends here, because I don't really fit in... I don't have any ambitions (I think I wanted to be an engineer when I was younger). When I look in the mirror, I realised so much time has passed but I'm still lost. I've tried figuring out who I am for at least 2 years I think, but I'm desperate for an answer. I can't live like this because I'm so empty inside. I feel sorrow, but I think I'm so used to it that I don't cry anymore. I want to, but the tears just won't come. I'm 21 now, and I see my peers getting a job, or getting married, or doing some other cool shit. 

I'm currently doing a degree in biology. (second year btw) I need something to push myself, to motivate myself. I've lacked motivation to do anything for so long. I'm surprised that I even validated my first year at uni. But I realise this can't go on if I want to excel. I've thought of  just letting things go and just find a stupid job somewhere and live a peaceful life in the mountains or countryside. I want to travel away from all this crap and just do what I want. But I've read stuff on the internet that as an INFP I can't give in to my feeling too easily. 

In the end I don't really know what advice I'm looking for. But I need something to move on. I feel dead inside, and I can't keep this up anymore. I don't want to appear miserable or pathetic but I think I need help. If you have an idea on how I can find myself again, please, tell me.",27Dec2019,1
218,"I first met this boy in eighth grade. I very quickly developed a crush. Then freshman year he was in my math class so we would talk sometimes. It was a good conversation. I really think that’s when I fell in love with him. A lot of my friends talked about how they think we would be a good couple, some of them not even knowing I liked him. And that definitely fed into my fantasy of him feeling the same way. During sophomore year we had two classes together but we rarely ever talked anymore. But I still thought about him all the time. Halfway through that school year, I left and started doing online school. Nothing serious, public school just really worsened my mental health. I still had feelings for him. I still had dreams about him. Its halfway through my junior year and I still miss him. We both follow each other on Instagram, but we never communicate. I really just want to confess everything to him. My feelings for him over nearly 3 years. How I still feel about him. I know he will most likely not feel the same way. I’m prepared for the rejection.

220,"  I am a 17-year-old senior and I graduate in May 2020, which means I'm going to be going to college fairly soon. I am really into K-pop and Korean culture, (call me a koreaboo or whatever all you want, i know that i'm not), and I have wanted to move to Korea for a few years (probably 3) and teach English to children since I was a junior in high school. For most of my life, I hadn't really known what I wanted to do with my life, but after stumbling upon Korean and it's customs and culture, I knew in my soul that I wanted to be an ESL teacher. The feeling is so strong and every time I think about doing something else, my mind wanders to teaching English. Not just in Korea though, I planned on living in Japan, China, Thailand, etc. I just wanted to teach in Asia.

  My family is so, so poor and we got kicked out of our house of 8 years a few months ago. We are living in a new place now, a townhouse, and it's infested with bugs and my dad is really depressed. I'm not going to go too much into my personal life but my dad is quite old. Older than your average father. He's old enough to be my grandpa. He has been struggling all his life with different things, but he made sure that me and my younger brother (14) have always had a good childhood. Getting kicked out of our house took a huge toll on him, and he's still not happy. I could go more into our home situation but I don't want anyone that probably knows me IRL to know this stuff.

**Now here's the hard part**: Lately, I've been thinking about going into the medical field so that I could get my family our of our poor situation, and luckily some representative from a nearby medical school did a thing at my high school and it made me interested in the pharmaceutical field. The school had an advanced program, which meant that I could be certified for the work within 5 years. Pharmacists make 6 figures, and always it's been a dream of mine to buy a house and have kids soon after college. I really would love to be a pharmacist but... I wanna be a teacher :(

If I become an EPIK teacher (google it), I won't make very much money, only about 1,000 - 2,500 a month depending on my qualifications. Also, if my dad dies while I'm overseas, I won't be able to forgive myself for not being there for his last days. This definitely makes being a pharmacist seem like a better idea, but my heart wants to teach.

If I become a pharmacist, I won't be able to live out my dream of teaching in Korea, sure I could visit the country for about a week, but that won't satisfy me. It's also notable that I have no interest in drugs or medications at all. The ENTIRE reason I like the thought of being a pharmacist is the fact that I won't be poor anymore and I could probably buy my dad a 200-300k house within the next 10 years so that he'll feel better in his last years.

So guess what? Now I'm in danger. My entire family, in fact! We could get broken into, assaulted, hell even murdered. And my dad wants to smash his face in instead of showing the police the evidence of clear threats!! Smart! Dont let the professionals do your job and put your family in jeopardy! 

I'm so scared of what's going to happen. I cant sleep, my doors locked, etc. 

But I'm also worried for Clark's children. Both are girls, and if his sexual misconduct is true, I'm extremely worried for their wellbeing. What makes it worse is that one of them should be staying puberty soon, so it means she will be extremely vonerable to him... 
I am too anxious to tell the police, I have no evidence, no way of direct contact, and the closest I can get to contact is asking my cousin (who is too pure to even concern about this stuff) if she is okay. But I doubt that'll bring up much. I have no evidence of anything because I am obv not directly involved in any of this, so I cant really contact authorities...
I'm so worried he is using them as an outlet for his lust, or worse, harming them. I'm also worried for his dog, who has probably had more litters of puppies this year than the many many months I've been alive. 


This whole thing is making me so stressed, and it's not helping that my dad wont shut up about this prick. Please, any advise, even a way to help calm down, *anything* will help me.",27Dec2019,1

223,"I apologize in advance for formatting and possible typos, I’m typing in a hurry. 

My older sister is 20, and when she was 18 she married someone she only knew for a week. Immediately they had issues. He would verbally abuse her and gaslight her, eventually pushing her into the wall causing her to get a nasty cut on her eyebrow that needed stitches.  He cheated on her for a whole year and bought prostitutes. There’s so much more that he’s done but I don’t have time to get into. The cheating was the final straw and she moved back home with my parents, planning to divorce him. 

I go to college in the next state over, so I’ve been out of the loop on a lot of things. I’m now home for the holidays. She still hasn’t divorced him, and he’s been sending her money trying to win her back. She keeps calling him and talking to him, saying she loves him (after a whole phone call of yelling at him telling him to leave her alone) when a few months ago she was done with him and blocked him. 

Today she told me he was going to drive all the way here to see her and she would be sneaking him into her room. I immediately got mad... She’s putting herself in danger, and possibly our family.  We all have expressed our hatred for him, and he’s known the be violent, and shes letting him into our home where he could hurt us. She thinks he’s changed, but thats how gaslighting works... 

I told her either she can tell my parents he’s coming by the end of the night, or I will tell them. She is now saying she has dirt on everyone in the family and will expose us if i say anything. She says i don’t understand and that i wont be helping her.

227,"Hello, I am a teenager and have been barraged by an slurry of information and things to confront within a few years. Bluntly, all caused by my dad. I will be using  more vague wording for people for my privacy.

From all the information I have gotten, he is the definition of a deadbeat. Recently, he lost the house we were planning to live in, having the gut to directly lie to my sister about it, saying he sold it. He basically abandoned me at a relative’s home for my 2 other relatives to raise me, who I consider my real parents at this point. He is also like a leech to my mom. My mother is not well educated and I believe he is exploiting her and leeching off of her and she is not even realizing it. This all is linked to my suspicion and well proved view of his gambling addiction. He continually asks my mom for money, even if she make that much, for ‘job’ reasons even though he doesn’t really even have a job. I gained the knowledge of hearing he gets violent with her, which makes me sick. He gets mad very easily and you can see his true nature through the mask he wears. He also had the nerve to ask ME to ‘borrow’ a few hundred when he doesn’t even pay me back 100$. Imagine how much my mom has given him. Well to add all on top of this, he drinks and smokes too. I have also gathered and accidentally seen evidence of his gambling habits too sometimes. I’m SHOCKED how my mother married this type of person and can bare to stay with him. She continually talks about how “good” he is and how much he “loves” me. Yeah right, abandon me for 98% of my life and come in expecting to call him ‘dad’. He basically brainwashed my mom for how it looks and has the nerve to say how “bad” he feels for her sometimes for not learning a lot and being sick. He now is staying under the house I am currently in because, of course, he doesn’t have one, and I’m getting sick and tired of it. A long while ago, he somehow bought my trust for a while with material goods but I soon realized and started to be more cold.      He also favors his kids, he used to “like” me more than my sister and pampered me with goods but suddenly, after I have been enlightened, he has been more cold to me and nicer to my sister. He is a snake and is deceptive and deceitful. He used to yell at my sister a lot,  now at me. Of course, I say something back always since he won’t have the nerve to fight back when my 2 relatives are present. I really don’t know what to do as a kid in this situation.

228,"This is going to be the stupidest thing I have ever done. I am going to confess to my best friend my romantic feelings towards her. We've known each other for two years and clicked from the start. We went through separate relationships and I once teased the idea of us dating, but it was a short lived (but not negative conversation).

Yes, the whole 'we are best friends' thing might come up. Yes, I will say that her saying no won't effect anything in our friendship.  It'll be okay either way.

Normally, there would be signs of her not dating a certain type. She went on a date earlier this week and wasn't 100% but the type was nearly against lots that she normally went for. For some reason it was motivating

I'm just trying to figure out how to say it or do it.  I don't know if I want to do this before the window closes again or just to get it off my chest so I would stop juggling the thoughts of what to do or what she would think.

And then I had to leave town for work. I sometimes work away for a couple months at a time. And she was not really into that, understandably so. 

So we kind of ended things. But still kept in contact. 

A few months go by and she happened to be in the same city as I for a little vacation and she had her child, who is amazing! We hung out everyday and explored this place immensely! And then We went our separate ways... And now I can't stop thinking about her. 

I've honestly never had this feeling about someone before and I don't know what to do. 

Now we don't chat as much, just a text here and there, usually once a week! We saw each other last 2 months ago. I'll be home in 3 weeks and I know I'll see her at least once. 

Side note about me...
I'm a big flirt, have had many flings and a few committed relationships... But, when I met her, something triggered. I fell harder for her than anyone I've ever been with. I really value her and don't know if I could ever tell her since we don't really chat as much now.... And I'm working at getting a job back home full time... Is she an influence? maybe...

231,"For privacy, I’ll be using aliases:

Amy: my 34 y.o. female friend
Brian: her ex husband, also 34, from same country as Amy
Me: close friend to Amy, but lives in different country
Cherry: Brian’s younger sister, in her early 20s

About 8 years ago, Amy visited my country and decided to stay for a long period. Brian visited, and got to know Amy through a mutual friend back home. They had flings, but ultimately Brian went back and Amy stayed a while in my country.

2 years later, Amy went back to her country and they reconnected at a party.

They dated, had their ups and downs, but did end up being together and started living together.

During this, there were some sketchy behaviors like Brian lying about meeting his ex, but Amy, who has codependent tendencies, kept going.

They got married end of last year, all seemingly good to their friends and family (I didn’t know about these problems until they separated and Amy told me, months later).

According to Amy, Brian had been lying about many things:
- prior to their marriage, he was still seeing his ex even though they were dating. He would clean up the house Amy and Brian lived in whenever his ex visits, so his ex doesn’t realize he’s living with Amy
- he’s addicted to viagra and has been using it since his teen days
- he frequents prostitutes, and has sex party with prostitutes with his friends
- some his friends, accordingly to Amy, are drug dealers who grew up with Brian. These guys don’t like Amy because they think she’s taking away their “homeboy”. Like every time Brian declines to go party with them, they would blame it on Amy
- Brian grew up without his mom. His aunt took care of him and he considered her his mother figure. Amy contributed a lot of Brian’s negative behaviors to his childhood. She sympathizes with him.
- Brian filed for bankruptcy. He lied to her about his wealth. Fortunately, after he told Amy, he did the responsible thing: he made sure his debt wouldn’t befall on Amy.
- To the world at large, Brian is charismatic. Tall, handsome, loving, cool and all that. Most people that know him wouldn’t believe what happens behind the door.
- They both went to see therapist in the past, after their marriage. Amy mentioned to me that the therapist diagnosed him with Borderline Personality Disorder. But seems like they didn’t pursuit these sessions any further.
- Amy, through her own research, thinks Brian has NPD (Narcissistic Personality Disorder), and she herself is codependent. 
- Brian has choked her in the past, but Amy hasn’t told me full story yet.
- Amy has only told selective few people about this. A lot has to do with people not believing her, as Brian is charismatic. She’s afraid her own family members won’t believe her as Brian is now seen part of the family.
- Brian has also kept in touch with mutual family members and friends, like sending them birthday messages. Amy wants him to all channels with her family members, including social media, but he doesn’t. Claiming that it would be rude etc.
- Recently Amy has been talking to Brian’s younger sister, Cherry, and was able to tell her part of the truth. Cherry seems to believe Amy and sympathizes, as she knows her brother is messed up. Amy finds some solace as now at least one family member from his side knows the story.


Amy implemented No Contact and for the past six months or so. She has been focusing on herself. She has lost many people in her life through this, as some people didn’t believe her, or she feels like she couldn’t open up to them because those people have affinity with Brian. Now she’s finding new group of friends that she feels connected with. In the past six months, if Brian needs something from her, she replies with minimal effort and moves on quickly.

However, recently Brian has contacted her, telling her he has a gift for her. She knows it’s to make her meet up with him, yet she cannot help feeling guilty as he dropped that he has been “googling suicide”. I told Amy that she can use this to show to his family about Brian’s potential self harm, but Amy told me that it was a voice (I don’t know why she picked up the phone), not in writing. She told me she’s having anxiety attack and doesn’t know what to do. I wanted to help her, but having no concrete proof about Brian suicidal ideation means that it might be hard for Amy to tell someone else. I was thinking she could use the message to show to his family members, so they took care of him.

In the two months I’ve been working with my manager, who I’ll call Pete, I’ve had several issues pop up and have had to call out of work several times because of illness, injury, and my car breaking down (life is kind of crazy right now, hah). He’s been very understanding and accommodating. He’s a competent manager and also pretty new in the company, and everyone already loves him. 

He knows I’m struggling financially and Pete rallied some other area managers to help buy some of my son’s Christmas presents. It was a huge ordeal that I’m forever grateful for. I’ve learned of some of his past struggles and he’s been through a lot, but continues being generous and kind. I’ve told everyone I know about him and how much I respect him as a person and a boss. 

Today, I worked a short and slow shift and we got to talking about his family. I knew he was married with several kids, but he told me today that he has been separated from his wife and is looking for his own place. He knows I am separated from my son’s father. He asked if he stays with me and I told him he doesn’t, shared a bit of my own drama and we moved on with the day. 

As I was leaving, he was outside smoking a cigarette and asked to talk. He told me that he asked about where my son’s dad stays because he had a sex dream about me. “Three, actually,” he said. I awkwardly laughed, told him I’m nothing to look at, and then blabbered on about how complicated things are with my ex. I compassionately turned it down. He told me that if I changed my mind he’d be around. I gave him a fist bump and told him that I sincerely hope things aren’t awkward from now on. 

It wasn’t, in any way, a confession of feelings or anything like that. Just seemed like a straight up solicitation for sex. I don’t really buy that it has anything to do with a dream or dreams, it’s just a way to bring it up while reducing awkwardness. 

I’m not interested and did not think of him in that way, and I’m kind of heartbroken. I really liked working with him and I like my job and I feel like I’ve lost a lot of respect for him. I feel dirty and uncomfortable, as we are both adults but he is much older than I am. 

I’m not really sure where to go next or how to move on from this. I don’t believe he’s the type of person to let this go. Prior to today I’d seen him as very professional and while I hope he maintains professionalism after this, now I’m not sure.

Am in Au but thought would ask you guys too... I paid $400 to have my hair cut and coloured. I have dark hair but I wanted it all blonde then a pink wash through it. 

They did tiny small pieces blonde throughout with a slight red tint through it. Wasn't at all what I wanted. Cut was nice but colour was, well I may as well have had nothing done.

250,"Been dating this 30 year old guy for the past 3 months. He looks like your average Joe.

The problem is, he knows I’m from a well-off family and from all the info he’s told me I can’t tell if he’s actually broke and after my money or trying to hide his (potentially false) wealth?

I probably sound dumb/materialistic but it’s mostly because I’m quite young and new to this

Things that point out to me that he’s probably broke:

1) He’s 30 and lives with his parents in an apartment since he lost his decent paying full time job 11 months ago (invoice management/processing but he got laid off) and is now studying Accounting full time without working for the next 3-4 years

2) He avoids spending money on our outings and admits to being pretty cheap (He’s never spent more than $5 per outing whereas I have spent significantly more)

3) He and his parents don’t own a car, which means he either walks or takes public transportation

4) His phone is a 5 year old Android with a crack on the screen, and he has a 7 year old laptop 

5) His hobbies are going to the library, studying at home, or going out to a pub with friends every Saturday to watch football/hockey

Signs he may have been well off?

1) He grew up in the most expensive city in the country we live in and went to a private school with annual fees of $17-$20K (Although he graduated high school more than a decade ago and no longer lives in that city)

2) His mother worked as a paralegal (does other computer/office related work now) and his father was a casino manager but is now retired

3) He now he lives in an apartment with his parents in the 3rd-4th richest downtown neighbourhood/district in our current city (When I mentioned the area to one of my friends, they gasped and said he’s either loaded or living with 10 roommates)

4) He has a very large, although plain wardrobe (Not even sure if this counts)

5) He majored in History 10 years ago just because he wanted to and didn’t want to become a teacher, and if not he would have majored in English (It also took him 5 years to graduate)

257,"Hey everyone, 

I have a friend who i'm really close to and who means a whole lot to me. These last couple months have been particularly rough on her. She was severely abused by her parents and her parents themselves are paranoid freaks. 

When she was younger, she was beat by her father to the extent that she lost the majority of her early memories. Her father stopped beating her, but her parents have been controlling and paranoid. A week or two ago, she told me that her mother called her 20+ times because she didn't answer to a singular text due to the fact she was swimming with friends. Her parents are still acting distrusting of her, and it's made it hard for her to go outside. There's cameras throughout her house (yes really), and she can't even go outside for a walk because of her parents. She told me about how She's bipolar, has anxiety, and (presumably) has PTSD. She IS seeing a psychiatrist, but she can't really talk about the issues she's currently facing because she's afraid of the psych calling CPS. She called CPS on her parents two times, but they didn't do a thing for her and her parents tried gas lighting her into believing nothing is wrong. I know she's not making any of this up, I've seen the conversation between the both of her parents and I can confirm that they are 100% controlling. I also heard a recording of her father berating her for no reason at all. It made me so fucking angry. 

We hung out today and had a good time, but while I was driving home she had a panic attack and I had to console her. She seemed like she was going to lose it. I drove off, but she just didn't seem okay so I used my phone's voice control to text her. Basically, she said that her parents weren't home, but she didn't feel good. I ended up going back to console her for about an hour, until her parents got home.   


I don't know what I can do to help her. We've talked about this in depth, and she's researched her options. She can't get emancipated because her parents won't let her get a job, custody can't be transferred to a different family member, CPS won't believe her because the abuse isn't physical, and she obviously can't run away. My current plan has been to keep her away from her house as much as possible, but my money situation at the moment is rough so gas money is limited. She's 16, and I'm recently 19. I figure that she could make it the next two years with my help, and she could live with me while she tries and get a foothold. But it breaks my heart when she talks about not wanting to live and not seeing anything changing and whatnot. I love her and I feel like my options are very very limited. Because her parents are so controlling she can't be out for more than 3 hours at a time without her parents freaking out.

259,"I’ll try to keep this short and sweet.
Also, I’m on mobile. Sorry if formatting is bad.

My dilemma is that I’m not sure if being in a relationship is morally acceptable.

My senior year in high school, I (18M) was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder(BPD) after a traumatic event that I won’t go into much detail about. To make a long story short, my girlfriend (17F) that I believed to be “The One” committed suicide due to sexual and physical abuse from her adoptive parents.

Because of my BPD, I find it extremely difficult to feel empathy or even love (towards family, friends, etc.). Since my traumatic event, I had never gotten back into a relationship until about 2 months ago. Now (almost two years later) had decided that I was ready to be in another relationship. 

(As a side note: I knew that I can’t feel empathy/love but thought it would be fine.)

I had been talking to a girl (who we’ll call M) for about 2 weeks and it seemed to be going well. I had told her about my BPD because I feel that being more open about it is healthy for both me and anyone I believe should know. She seemed caring and supportive about it, which I thought was amazing. 

A week had passed and I then met her family at their family Thanksgiving dinner. M and I had talked to her younger sister about me because they were close. M decided to tell her sister about my BPD (I thought it was a little too soon but whatever). I then told her (gf’s sister) what BPD was.

She didn’t like what she was hearing. She believed that, because I could not feel love, I was just using her sister (my gf). I explained that I was simply trying to re-enter the world of dating and that M seemed like a loving and caring person. M was silent at this point because her sister was about to explode.

Her sister had asked if I loved M. I simply said, “No, because I am physically incapable of feeling love.” She responded with, “If you’re not able to give love, you’re not worthy of love.”

Needless to say, that statement tore me down hard. I was about to have an emotional breakdown so I simply upped and left. Now I’ve been having a deep personal struggle with this one question...

If I am unable to give love, am I worthy to be loved?",27Dec2019,1

261,"I (24F) have struggled with being a toxic person in my more intimate relationships of the past. I acknowledged this was problematic pretty quick and have always made an effort to not repeat the same mistakes I have in the past.

After a while in a relationship I kind of start letting go of myself, not caring about myself, about my goals and essentially putting my self worth on this other person who’s obviously getting frustrated with me for becoming a lazy sack of depressed shit. Even though I’ve been conscious of this for a while and have been focusing on trying hobbies and having interests and working towards personal goals for some reason this whole thing dissipates when I feel truly accepted by someone. It’s insecurity, and I’m aware of it but this cycle always happen. 

I’m a better person when I’m alone, I’m more productive, j take better care of myself, I accomplish things and I’m far more rational. But  deep down I just feel fucking lonely. 

I have lots of friends, have good solid relationships with them and their acceptance and love doesn’t seem to take away from me. But that feeling of being desired and emotionally intimately connected to someone I suck. 

It kind of feels like a trade off at this point, I’m starting to think feeling lonely at night is healthier option for me. I’m scared to get close to anyone even though I truly desire it because I just can’t multitask I guess. 

I don’t want to hurt anyone and I don’t want to go through that pain again. Feeling lonely sucks but it’s not life shattering painful like the alternative. And I feel like I just can’t sustain a long term healthy relationship. Maybe I’m better off being alone.

263,"Back story: Our eldest is at this weird stage of teenage angst and fights us over every little thing. We don't see him often as we only get them on the weekends IF they choose to come over. We feel a bit used because he seems to only come over to stay with us when he wants something or when we're going to do something fun. He has shown interest in an expensive hobby and expects us to help fund part of it if not all of it. He is 17 and jobless, but we have given him many opportunities to earn money by doing odd jobs at home because we want him to learn how to appreciate the dollar. He has taken no advantage of these many EASY opportunities. He once ""asked"" his dad by simply sharing details of the costs but not actually coming out to ask for financial support. So I asked my stepson why he didn't ask his dad to see if he would help pay for part of it. Stepson's response is ""Why? He's only going to tell me I have to work for it""....not realizing that all the money given or spent on him was earned by someone's hard work. So, that gives you a bit of a background of the kind of teenagerness we are working with here. 

Our family Christmas is delayed until this weekend because they only come over on the weekends. This year for Christmas, he has asked for very expensive electronic gaming gear that will cost approximately $600-800. It is a hard ""no"" because we simply can't afford it. We're quite shocked by his ask really. So, we have decided to buy him zero electronics. Instead, we're giving him crafty things he can do with his hands to build and put together.  He *has* previously shown interest in those things, and also, our budget is tighter this year.

We are both bracing for impact because we just know he will show great disappointment and ungratefulness due to how he has responded to other things previously. We know he doesn't understand the true value of hard work yet nor does he appreciate what he already has. He definitely takes what we have given him for granted. 

If he does react negatively, both my husband and I would be very hurt and could possibly say something that just puts a huge damper on the festivities and we don't want to do that. What are some wise parenting responses we can give him instead?

TLDR: Christmas is delayed to this weekend. My 17 year old teen stepson is very likely to be disappointed in his Christmas gift because we didn't buy his $600-800 gift request. What is the best way to respond without sounding upset at his potential ungratefulness?",27Dec2019,1

265,"Hi, throwaway for obvious reasons. I found out today that my friend was sexually assaulted as a child. She says it was a really long time ago, and that she hasn't really told anyone else about it. The rapist was from her family, and about 15 years older to her. It started when she was in 1st grade, and stopped when she hit puberty. I'm not exactly sure about the timeline here, since I didn't want to urge her for the details at the time. She tells me that she didn't know what was happening as a kid, so she never spoke up. She doesn't want to tell anyone or do anything about it, because it'll be inconvenient for everyone. The asshole now has a wife and a daughter of her own. My friend is about 24. They don't see each other often, except for big family events, which are rare. She happened to tell me about it today when were just discussing sexual relationships. I'm still pretty shook, and I'm sure I'm missing some details. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have. She seemed nonchalant about it, I guess because she's learned to forget it. I told her she should bring it to her parents notice, or someone who could help her. She said she didn't want to get into it. I am treating her the same way I was earlier, so that she doesn't feel like a victim. But I'm not sure if that's right thing to do.

271,"I'm 21F. My parents divorced when I was a baby, and my father married another woman when I turned 3 years old. I'll call her R for short. 

I live with my biological mother and would visit my dad and R every other weekend. R and I never got along well, and most of the family dislikes her as well. She is critical and judgemental of everyone (especially behind their backs) and throws tantrums when she doesn't get exactly the way she wants it. She also complains and brings up old topics constantly in order to create drama. I could fill a whole book with the bad experiences I've had growing up with her, but I'll try to keep it brief and just give a few examples:

Fighting was frequent, if not expected. R has slapped my dad across the face before and he has cussed her out to the point of her running away in tears, all while I watched in shock. She would snap and scream at me for very minor things, like not washing my hands or not doing the laundry. What hurt the most, though, were the awful things she'd say about my mom. My mom is one of the kindest people you will ever meet. I love her and owe so much to her. Which made it all the more painful when R would scream at her, say how awful she is as a parent because of my minor misbehaviors, or straight-up insult her; frequently referring to her as ""the b\*tch"".

As I got older and reached my teens, I slowly put more distance between us and I only visit them once every month or two now, or for holidays. I had Thanksgiving dinner with them this year, and afterward, they asked me if I would like to come to their Christmas eve party. I didn't want to, but I didn't want to be rude either and just agreed to go. Later on, I found out that my mom was already planning a Christmas eve party and invited a few other family members, like my uncle and grandfather. They live several hours away from us and I don't get to see them often. Because of this, and the fact that I already spent Thanksgiving with dad and R, I tried to politely let them know that I would like to spend Christmas eve with my mother instead.

Big mistake. They bombarded me with angry texts for the next few days leading up to the party and tried to guilt-trip me into changing my mind. I apologized and explained the situation to them, even offering a few other days when I could visit, but it wasn't enough. I honestly regret mentioning my mom to them or trying to tell them what happened, because the day before Christmas eve they began texting her, too. They put all of the blame onto her, calling her selfish, etc. My mom stayed civil and tried to explain that she deserved some holiday time with me just as much as they did and that in the future, they should try to contact each other more so that situations like this don't happen again. They refused and didn't let up, telling her that she shouldn't be butting in in the first place. 

I felt horrible about the whole thing and told my mom how sorry I was for the way they were treating her because of my decision. She was surprisingly unfazed, though, and told me that she's used to it. I asked her what she meant by that, and was horrified as she explained how they treated her throughout the years, especially R and how she would go as far as to spread lies and rumors about her to the rest of the family. Everyone knew R's antics and disliked her as well, so thankfully, no one believed her. But still, to me, that crosses the line.

We just tried to ignore their texts as best as we could, but the whole situation brought my mood down and took a lot of enjoyment away from the time I spent with my mom and relatives. Now that Christmas is over, I contacted my dad back and we agreed on meeting up this Saturday. I want to confront them both about their behavior, but whenever I do, their go-to reaction is to guilt me, say how much they love and care for me, or blame my mom for the way I'm feeling. I'm sick of it and I want to firmly tell them that they need to respect my mother if they want to keep me in the picture, but I don't know if this is the best approach. Should I just cut ties at this point, or keep trying to work things out with them? What's the best way to go about it? I have a lot of issues with anxiety and I'm not good with confrontation, so any advice would be appreciated!

272,"I’d been talking to this guy online in the country I’m moving to soon for work but at this point I’m fairly sure he has bad intentions.

First of all he insisted I must go there immediately although I have work obligations but he said if I don’t go immediately it means I’m only thinking about myself and he can’t be in a relationship with someone who is so selfish.

So I canceled my work stuff and booked a ticket but he then told me he doesn’t want to talk to me until I get there because it’s selfish that I’m not going immediately.

For me it doesn’t sound like he wants to get to know me since he doesn’t want to talk.

Another thing, he said I can’t talk to other guys but because he’s a guy it’s different so he can talk to and meet other girls.

Also earlier today he said that to prove I am who I say I am, I have to send him proof. He demanded a photocopy of my passport, driver’s licence, proof of address (bank statement), and asked me some other questions not limited to my NHS number so he can look me up and make sure I’m real. I wanted to set his mind at ease so I answered all his questions. He even made me give him my login to online banking to prove I have money and am not a gold digger. I felt really uncomfortable but he wouldn’t take no for an answer. But then I asked if I could have his phone number so I can contact him when I get there. At that point he told me I have no business asking for private contact details and that if I give him flight details he’ll be waiting at the airport.

A few hours later my manager pulls me aside and explains that they searched everyone's belongings, and only me and one other person had a 100 bill in their bags. They asked me if I stole it and then questioned why I had the money in the first place. I explained to them that I had that $100 because my bf had bought my airpods off of me a few days ago and at that time I didn't have my wallet so I stuck it in my bag (which I forgot about tbh). I'm not a very organized person. I literally had a $20 dollar bill in one pocket. And the $100 in another pocket. 

MY manager didn't really seem convinced and so they explained to me that they would record all of this and continue investigating to see if there's a pattern of theft at my job. I wasn't the only person that was working at that time, but I was the only person who came in that close to 3. But there's no telling if someone else had taken it before I had arrived or whatever. I guess I just feel a bit anxious because I don't want to be incriminated based off of having a hundred dollar bill. I love this job, I am treated well, and have always been kind to others. Is it possible to be fired based off of this one thing alone? If so, is there anything I can do about it? All responses are appreciated. 

TL;DR: someone stole coworkers $100 bill. There was a search conducted and only me and one other person had a $100 bill on them. I didn't steal and have my own personal reasons for having that money on me. But I am scared they may take action against me anyways, what can I do?",27Dec2019,1
287,"This has become an issue just in the past year or so. I’ve been with my bf since we were 14 and we’re 20 now. He’s the youngest of 4 sons and is very close to his mum. I think it’s because he’s the youngest and she had a miscarriage before him.  She’s very protective of him and is always in contact with him. For a long time I knew our age was an issue and she didn’t want me to hurt him. Now we’re 20 and our relationship is still fantastic but I’m really afraid his mum will prove too much for me to handle. 

In November I went overseas to see family and my boyfriend came. It wasnt the first time we’d gone overseas. I offered to pick him up on my way to the airport since I’d be going straight past but his mum insisted on driving him and coming in and everything and they ended up being 20 minutes late which stressed me out enormously. During the trip she messaged him multiple times a day to see what he was doing and how he was feeling and such. I was sick in London and used to have severe emetophobia which she was aware off. Like any normal person, I took the next day off to recover and my boyfriend went out on his own. His mums reaction was to say it was “unfair” and that he had to be very careful. This ticked me off because she didn’t have any compassion for me.

Then just over Christmas my grandma died and I had to housesit while they all went interstate. We’ve been frantically trying to find someone to housesit and take care of our dogs so she said my boyfriend could do it. We took her up on that and asked him to housesit from the 27th until the 8th of January. My boyfriend said it was fine but his mum said no because it was for too long. He insisted but she then went to my dad without talking to me or my boyfriend first. So we’ve had to spend a lot more money to find someone else. She also said we didn’t need to go so early if the funeral wasn’t until the 3rd. I’m so hurt by the things she said because we have been hurting and are now in financial trouble because of flights, accommodation etc. 

My boyfriend is kind of neutral about everything, he considers their relationship as close but I don’t think he realises it’s unhealthy. I have no idea what to do, especially after this last incident. How can I go about fixing this?",27Dec2019,1
288,"(Throwaway account).

Im transgender. Ever since I was a child I always wanted to be like my twin sister; a girl. I have 4 sisters and  2 brothers (one which was mostly absent from my childhood) . So I was comfortable growing up with my sisters as I liked playing with them and identified with them. My brother on the other hand, is a full gym junkie muscle head and he's always controlling me on how to act and think whenever I'm around him. I live in a family of 9, so privacy or avoiding him is literally impossible. Every singe day I wish I was born as a girl. Not one day goes without thinking about it. I really want to transition but I can't because as a teen boy I keep getting taller, and my shoulders keep getting wider. If I come out as trans I will be kicked out or isolated. I really love my family. I'm scared if I do take hrt, in 20 years my body will reject it and I will look hideous. I'm scared that I will regret transitioning, I'm scared of God, I'm scared of becoming suicidal. I can't live alone because my culture is very family and relative orientated.

295,"I posted this on AITA genuinely wondering if I made an asshole move by excluding my husband from spending Christmas with our kids. Anyway the feedback made it clear that what I need isn't a ruling on who's TA. I think I need some advice on next steps.

The background:

My husband and I have three wonderful children together. No regrets there. 

Both of us suffer from depression but while I am actively treating it with medication and counseling, he has refused any help at all. He has become increasingly negative and angry over the last year. He spends most of his time at home disengaged, watching YouTube, and laying in bed.

Anyway - Christmas Eve was a blur of baking and cooking. As things were in the oven, I wrapped presents. In all, I was up until 2:30 am making sure the kids would wake up to another great Christmas morning. I did clean the kitchen some, but didn't finish. I had planned to, I was just so tired after I finished so I went to bed instead and planned to clean up after presents. 

Christmas morning dawned and the kids were amazingly patient waiting for their dad to get out of bed (he was on his phone watching YouTube videos and just didn't want to get out of bed). I kept them entertained with classic Christmas cartoons. After over an hour of waiting, however, I told him that we were opening presents in 5 minutes with or without him. When he surfaced he went straight to the kitchen and started angrily cleaning. I know that he hates it when I leave the kitchen messy and the sight of it set him off.

So as the kids opened presents, he was cleaning and then he started breaking things. He smashed a few of my favorite coffee mugs and my measuring glass. This is a new level for him and it really worried me. 

We have done Christmas with my best friend's family every year. In fact, we celebrate almost every holiday together. After presents (which he never joined in for), however, I asked him not to accompany the kids and I when we went over. I felt like the kids and I all needed space. I was also very worried that he would not be nice to me in front of my friend, and I was sure that would end up not going well. I could have chosen not to go at all, but again we needed space and besides, the kids (my kids and my friend's) were excited to spend the day together so we went without my husband. 

I feel terrible for leaving him alone on Christmas - and it has not helped with his mood. My main concern though, are the kids. I don't want them growing up in what is becoming an increasingly stressful environment. So I am actively planning for the possibility of leaving him as I am getting to the point where I can't wait for things to change or get better anymore. Am I overreacting? If not, how do I even go about this?

I've started applying for jobs (I've been out of work since our oldest was born) but I'm financially dependent on him. Other than that I really don't know. Any advice would be truly appreciated. 



-----
Side note on our mental health issues: 
We both have depression but the circumstances are dissimilar.

I have been managing C-PTSD nearly all my life. This year it was exacerbated by a particularly severe bout of depression. In my case, all those emotions get turned inward where I try not to harm anyone but myself. Getting the appropriate meds and counseling were not optional, and they saved my life. 


We both have depression but the circumstances are dissimilar.

My husband is showing almost all the signs of clinical depression but has told me more than once that he does not believe in medication. He also does not believe in counseling.  I can't force him to get the help I believe he needs - but I also think I can no longer wait indefinitely for him to get it.

The jacket is now stained and I now want him to pay me back but is it unfair to ask for such a large sum of money? Should I just let it go because it’s just a jacket? It hurt me most that he would even throw something at me, the coffee I had just bought him thrown all over me just because we had a disagreement about something really stupid.

301,"(TLDR at bottom) 

A couple years ago, social services finally got involved after years of my mother abusing me. I got pulled from my house, and am now living with my three brothers and father. This new living situation was less than ideal for all of us (my dads place is a two bedroom and I’m the only female), however two of my brothers are well into their 20’s and expected to move out soon. We all had our own little space, but my room was in the “corner” of the house for more privacy because no one wants to deal with seeing so much as my midriff or a pad wrapper. Still, my dad was constantly yelling at me, and my oldest brother hated my mother and made my life hell (I guess for being related to her??). So my depression has been near unmanageable.

This year, I moved out to go to a college a couple hours away. I picked nursing, as it’s all I’ve wanted to do for years, and  I’m positive that it’s the job I want.
(Also the hardest major the school offers) One month into the semester, my grandmother died. I was destroyed. She was all I had growing up and I swear the only person that cared about me. I ended up flunking for the semester. Upon returning home for break, my younger brother had moved into my room and refused to leave. With everything put on me while I’m at home, having my a place to cry and clear my mind was my only solace and I feel like I’m losing it. I can’t buy food because my brothers eat it all, and I can’t afford to eat out all the time. Everyone comes to me to vent all their frustrations, if anything is wrong in the house it’s automatically my fault, and I just can’t take it anymore. Now I don’t even have space for my things, the bathroom is always taken so I have to wait to change my clothes (can’t just change like my brothers can) and it feels like nothing will ever be done. My mental state is horrible and I feel like there’s a thin thread keeping me from jumping off a building.

I can use my one appeal to work extra hard next semester, through the summer, and be back on track, with no room for error, to get my nursing degree. But I would be in this same living situation and I’m questioning if I can do it. My other option is to get my lpn (much less time, and I work as a cna so I would have a job secured) get an apartment, save up money, and go for my BSN later. But I’m not 100% sure they would accept me into the program again. I’m sorry for the venting, I really just have no one to turn to.

TLDR; my mental health is down the toilet and I failed my first semester of school. Do I try again next semester or take a break, work, and try again later?",27Dec2019,1
302,"I met up with one of my friends today. I really enjoyed it and am just reflecting on it all. One thing I am naturally terrible at - and what I am dwelling on is how we said ‘goodbye’ at the end.

The last time I met this friend (about a year ago) she said ‘see you later’ to me on parting. Today, we were on the tube and talking right to the very end before she had to get off at her stop. As the train pulled in to her stop, I initiated a cuddle with her (she initiated one with me when we met). She said something along the lines of it was good to have met and good luck with my masters and dissertation (which I am currently working on) and wished me a good **Christmas**.

The words that ring in my ears though were her final words to me ‘see you, bye’. She then left the tube very quickly and didn’t stay on the platform to wave as the train left with me on it.

Is ‘see you, bye’ a suggestion that she doesn’t want to see me again? Last year when we parted she said ‘see you later’ to me. This meant that I had the confidence to reach out and message her and arrange today because she said that. Ending today on ‘See you, bye’ means that I will be much less likely to be as confident in the future to reach out to her again. 

We spent six hours together today and I really enjoyed it. 

Do you think that ending it in this way has shut the door on me contacting her again (maybe in a year or so) to arrange another catch up?",27Dec2019,1
303,"I feel like a miserable human being and not at all the kind of person I thought I was. This started off the way these things do, hit it off with a coworker as friends. I had no intentions beyond that but time and chemistry resulted in feelings but I was more than prepared to never express or act on those feelings and saw it as a good thing that I could still feel that way about a nice person after my own rocky romantic history marked by domestic violence, cheating and emotional abuse. Other than believing I was starting to heal and ready to seriously date available guys, I didn't put any stock in it. 

&amp;#x200B;

But he showed up at work with a black eye and later with strangulation marks, and admitted that there is repeated and cyclical violence at home when his bipolar spouse cannot manage her anger. She assaults him in front of their child. After some drinks at a company outing, he took my hands in his, admitted feelings and kissed me.  I started sobbing instantly, told him I was too fragile to go through anymore difficulties but felt the same way. He tried to come over to my place afterwards, but I didn't open the door or answer his calls. 

&amp;#x200B;

My concern for his situation mixed with my own history with abusive partners and parents who beat each other and consecutive spouses my siblings and of course myself. I am strongly committed to ending cycles of family violence and know full well that victims have difficulty leaving spouses and male victims are not respected/supported the way female victims are, and female DV victims are hardly supported either. My feelings grew stronger and we acted on it on two occasions afterwards. He had a lot of guilt and shame in between as did I but we continued to talk as we have a lot in common and get along well. But after hearing about how he had strong feelings for me, was considering divorce but was scared of how ""big"" it was, wanted me to meet his child etc etc, he reversed that decision but seemed really mixed up. Maybe he still values the marriage and this is not a serious issue to him and I was just an outlet for his reaction. He then avoided responding to my pointed concerns about our cognitive dissonance and its effect on our lives and well being.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is a bad situation. After trying to provide advice and guidance to remain friends, and for him to get help in his marriage, and getting evaded, it is just too much for me and I know I have to end all communication outside of work and have done so. I don't intend to stay in this position in the company with him for many years, but have at least a year of work left with necessary daily communication with him. It's been miserable so far and bad for work too. I used to like my job and now I hate coming in. I feel physically ill and totally drained. I don't get the dignity of removing myself from all connections with him and can't just quit and look for new work when I intend on going back to school. I don't want this to affect my resume after fleeing my domestic abuser caused a gap in my cv. I've lost a good friend and am obviously a bit heartbroken too, in addition to feeling foolish and shameful.

What is the right thing to do? I thought of myself as a good person. Now I've done a bad thing. I'd like to learn from it and move on, but whatever else I need to do I am open to doing, however difficult.",27Dec2019,1

He did lie about another thing 30 mins ago too so that made me even more worried. Saying first that he doesn’t text my sister (which i hate) and then telling me that they do test but barley.

306,"Until today, I had a long distance relationship. I [26M] recently got into a fight with my boyfriend [28M] because he made a joke about his dick being massive, and I replied with “massive? I’d say pleasantly large” and it really hurt his feelings. He fired back with a guilt trip of my sex talk talking about his size and how he guesses I’ve been gassing him up and ended with “I guess you’ve sat on enough dicks to know about massive dicks”. 

Several times in the past, fights have escalated beyond stupid shit like above because he insinuates I’m a slut, and to be fair I’ll admit I’ve had a lot of sex during my 20s. So has he, we are real and transparent about it. But I really loved this dude, when I’m in a relationship I’m committed, he meant the world to me.

I blew up, I called him fragile, I tiraded about how he has been nothing but cruel and distant since leaving to China for a basketball season abroad, and I let him have the full force of my anger about my boyfriend calling me a slut. 

He insisted on knowing why it means so much to me, “after all, a joke is a joke, right?” So I confided that my ex husband let his friends rape me. The story is jumbled, I didn’t even know it happened until two years after the fact because I was drugged, faded, and blacked out and had only drank 2 or 3 beers. According to my ex husband, I was on the floor of the bathroom with several guys coming in and out, and he saw me there and walked away. This was after we were split but I was still living at his house and we were in a placated mood towards each other. Confirmed oral sex, suspected anal sex though my ex husband didn’t witness, only suspected it happened. 

My boyfriend spent a day trying to say it didn’t happen, I had to have been lied to by my ex in some weird vindictive psychological attack (two full years after our marriage had ended), or I had to have made it up. Finally we settled that: however tame he thought the event was, I was “taken advantage of” and should be “more careful about how I carry and take care of myself”. I wanted to express how much it hurt that he would downplay what I went through and the tightness and fear I feel today thinking about it, but only remembering nothing in a party I didn’t really drink in. That it was my fault. I fear every time I think about it if it was my fault, but to have someone tell me hurt down to my core. 

I don’t hear from him through Christmas or all of today. I texted again and he let me know he’s not ready for a committed relationship, and he’s got too much stress to worry about someone else’s baggage. 

How do I stop having the past chase me like this? Am I just being a victim and letting shit keep happening to me? Am I supposed to pretend it never happened so convincingly that I forget it myself eventually? Should I just get used to being alone?",27Dec2019,1
307,"I've been friends with this girl for four years now. We met in high school and are now in the second year of college together. We had great times and not so great times together. But now I feel distant from not just her, but our friend group.

I had always felt like I was on the outskirts of our friend group. Now, in college, it's clear that our priorities are completely different and so has our growth as people. It feels burdening being with this friend group honestly. I feel like a different person. Unfortunately, this friend is still clinging onto our past selves.

She wants to dorm with me for next year. I do not want this to happen. I predict it being a mess and would rather not go through all of that (I had a bad experience with another friend when we dormed together. I no longer talk to that friend). There's a myriad of reasons why I can't find myself living with her. Shes impulsive, she refuses to get help for her mental illnesses and instead self medicates with weed and alcohol (I do not use either at all and would rather not have it in my living space), and everyone around her has allowed for this to happen so that she won't self implode. They're afraid of her acting out otherwise. I've been expected to take care of her in other situations and will most likely be expected to take care of her if I live with her. 

I've been partly at fault for prolonging this inevitable conversation. I know for certain that I can't put myself through another bad roommate situation. I have to tell her no. But I'm not sure in how to go about it without hurting her feelings outright.

315,"So here is my summary and what my worst case theory is. I will copy this at the end after the back story and what has recently happened.

I’m worried she has been in a relationship with the younger brother who recently left for the military. Has kept our relationship secret from her roommate so he wouldn’t tell his younger brother. Now that he is on break from the military she is keeping her phone hidden away so he couldn’t see anything about me. Which is why she is only looking at my messages late at night or when they are gone. And why I have never been able to even see her roommate. 

*back story*

We have been dating for three months now, and it has been the most wonderful relationship I have ever been in. Everything seemed to click immediately for us, our first coffee date turned into a dinner date, followed by her staying the night. I was a virgin before I met her. But because I was waiting for someone I could be in a long relationship with once I got to college. I’m a sophomore.

The most attractive thing I found about her is our ability to talk about what truly matters to us. We talked about all the traumas we had been through and comforted each other.

Part of these tales involved us telling stories about our exes. 

One of mine being this one:

My first girlfriend who when I traveled over the summer decided to date an ex which I had serious grudges with and keep it a secret and pretended to be in a relationship with me till the first day of school where she brought him over and broke up with me in front of him because she wanted him more.

She told me some of her stories including one about how she used to cheat until she got cheated on and realized how painful it is.


*Events that happened*

For Christmas my family wanted me to fly up to Tennessee for 3 weeks over my college break. 

My gf and I have always kept in very good touch. Even when super busy with finals we would do our best to send each other as many texts as possible and calling when we had some free time at a meal or at night every couple days or so. 

So here is what I’m now not sure whether to be worried or not about. 

She has a M(24) apartment roommate each with their own room. She is good friends with him and his younger brother M(20-22?)  who is now in the military.

I have never been able to come over to her place if her roommate is home because, “he is weird about people coming over.” He has a girlfriend so I’m not worried about him. But this fact will come up again.

Now I have left for three weeks and have been gone for 2 of the 3 weeks. 
As mentioned earlier we have always kept in good contact sending each other goodnight and good morning texts at the minimum every day.

Now after I was gone for a week her roommates younger brother started staying there for 2 weeks from the military, 

Now this wasn’t a secret and she told me about it. But as soon he arrived she stopped messaging me for the most part. 

Now I understand that she wants to hang with them and that’s totally understandable just as I’m spending time with family. 

I’m only sending her a good morning and goodnight text with a couple lines about my day every day. She reads them about once a day usually after 2am (it tells me when she reads it, I’m doing my best to give her space and not be pushy) but she only responds every other day or so a couple messages when I’m still asleep telling me she is having fun. Christmas morning she sends me a “Merry Christmas love.” Message.
But since hasn’t messaged me.
She called me once when her roommate and his younger brother left for a couple hours. I didn’t ask her why she wasn’t messaging me. But it was a nice call until my parents needed me and had to go. 

So here is my summary and what my worst case theory is.

I’m worried she has been in a relationship with the younger brother who recently left for the military. Has kept our relationship secret from her roommate so he wouldn’t tell his younger brother. Now that he is on break from the military she is keeping her phone hidden away so he couldn’t see anything about me. Which is why she is only looking at my messages late at night or when they are gone. And why I have never been able to even see her roommate.

But at the same time I’m not sure if I am just being paranoid because of my past relationships which usually end with me being ditched for another guy with no explanation given.

Any advice would be much appreciated!!",27Dec2019,1
316,"So. I’ve have made the decision months ago that I wanted a therapist and I’m finally for going to get one. My mom kind of pushed me away when I first approached the topic bc she thought my mental health problems works go away on its own. I don’t blame her for it. I’ve had alot of stuff go on inside my own little head and it trips me up sometimes. 

I’ve fully realized there’s depth of my “crush” on my coworker and it’s not awful I’ve just noticed one red flag: he doesn’t care for his mother. Bc of my ability to read social cues bc of my childhood traumas, I realized he had some stuff going on. I fizzy started to interact with him when I noticed how quiet and cold he seemed, I took it upon myself to fix him. I know now I was just reflecting my pains and trying to fix him was a cry to fix myself. And I get that now. But I still talk to him and we flirt back And forth. I can’t tell if he likes  me back. Everyone notices the banter between us and everyone thinks he will make him move after my birthday and I’m not so sure. I’m not banking on him to love me the way I’d like him to. I have to be carful about my fantasies, I get caught up a lot and it is painful to step into the real world. 

Question— if I guy buys you multiple books, does he like you? I think yes bc he pays attention to my special interests but i can’t tell bc of his cold and attitude. 

I guess I’m seeking advice about a boy like I stereotype but advice from strangers helps. (If the first section is confusing, it was for me and if you read it, it can help w advice apparently if you know a bit about me.",27Dec2019,1
317,"So Christmas has always been tough with my side of the family, but tonight crossed the line. I’ve never felt unsafe around my family until tonight. We were having a normal civil discussion at an extended family members house when politics were brought up. I’m a very calm person who never lets my emotions get the best of me. I was defending my stance and it was completely polite and respectful(I’m 21 surrounded by 60 year olds so I have to be extra respectful). I kept asking for proof or where they had heard the things they are saying as I’m a naturally skeptical person. Well once I presented some adverse evidence and defended my views all hell broke loose. I was verbally berated and called a disrespectful dog by a family member I thought loved me. I’ve played hockey my whole life and have been in mutual fights on the ice but I have never felt the energy like I was going to be hit without cause off the ice, let alone by a family member, until tonight.  I could see in my family members eyes he wanted to hurt me, all while being screamed (and I mean fist to the table in my face screamed) at and essentially told I’m a little shit. My mother sat in silence and my dad egged on this family member as this happened. My dad and mom aren’t angels but have always defended me and my sister(27) until about 4 years ago when we both moved away. now we’re treated like we’re stupid little children even to the point of belittling my sister at a dinner to the point that she hid in the bathroom and called me crying. It’s getting to the point where it’s effecting my mental health and tonight was the breaking point. Is this grounds for cutting off family? It’s been a long time coming and I know extended family definitely needs to go but my parents are hard and I do love them. Though tonight they threw me to the wolves and even helped the wolves feast, I just don’t feel like I’m their son anymore just the man they call their son. It’s like it’s only surface level “love” from them.",27Dec2019,1

319,"Hello /r/advice

I'm a 24 year old woman with a bachelor's degree in a field I don't want to work in. I escaped my indecisiveness on what to do by moving to Japan to teach English, but I'm at my limit here too.

I just don't know what to do with my life. I don't know what I would want to study if I were to go back to school because I don't have anything that I'm interested in beyond 'it's cool I guess.'

I've seen a lot of advice on the net like 'follow your gut' or 'find something in your hobbies', but my gut is terribly confused and my hobbies are super generic (games and movies).

320,"Usually I (20F) use whatever phone I see in front of me if I need to see the time or search for something real quick and usually in our family we know each other's passwords...so one day (at around mid August) I had to search something and my phone was far so I decided to use my dad's phone and when I opened it there was a message from someone that was very intimate and it didn't look like it's from just a friend (it was in the lines of 'I love you' and stuff like that) 
In the beginning I thought might've read it wrong or maybe it's from someone close to him, but then at around end of August I decided to open my dad's phone without him knowing and check if what I saw was right because it kept bugging me...and then I saw he was cheating with someone and she knows that he has a wife..and later on I discovered that they had known each other and been together 3 years ago but they stopped seeing each other for some reason and now they're back together
The lady seems like she's a drama queen...coz from the messages I read she would get angry/sad if he doesn't reply as soon as she sends him a message and over really small things.
Fast forward there to around October I wanted to see if he's still meeting with her and I saw that they had some kind of a fight so I thought that it was over but now he's been on his phone alot like before and he keeps asking us to take photos of him where ever we go and I saw today that he's been sending her photos of him and same for her and he's sending her details of everything he's doing.
He even once was sending her photos of my pet and she asked him to buy him one (from the messages) and I remembered that before when I asked him to buy one he said it's too expensive but he was willing to buy it for her.

321,"I (25M) flew home 9 months ago (other side of the country) to visit and ended up sleeping with a friend of my brother’s. My mom revealed to me she was pregnant but she thought it was further along. The dates line up, it’s probably my kid. What the hell do I do?",27Dec2019,1
323,"Weird situation. 

My mother kicked me out this year. Long story short, I had severe burns, couldn’t walk. My mother and I lived together which is pretty normal at my age for my country (housing costs). I lost my job due to the injury, and got depressed. 

My mother didn’t want to deal with it (she has bipolar and refuses treatment and is really, really bad at having responsibility) and kicked me to the curb. 

I have spent the last few months relying on friends, have slept in public a few times. My mother has helped sporadically (sometimes she allows contact and sometimes she doesn’t), but not without great difficulty. 

During this period my mother has also contacted the police three times re me trying to get them to charge me with trespass for trying to collect my things. She also got me sectioned twice despite not being acutely suicidal/suicidal at all. 

I have recently found out that my mother has lied to me. I recently found out she has bipolar and has never been treated. She’s also controlling and changeable. 

I got in contact again with relatives who my mother had ex communicated a decade ago. We used to be very close. They took me in for Christmas and offered money and a place to stay should I need it, until I get my degree and get work. 

A few weeks ago my mother said she signed a lease on an apartment, saying she would pay half the rent until I can pay all, for me. She hasn’t spoken to me in a week (changeable, unreliable). 

Here’s the situation: 

If I accept my mother’s offer, I will need to find a full time job. I will need furniture, rent, clothes, textbooks, general living expenses etc. I will have to move my studies to part time. I will have to go from complete exhaustion to complete over exertion. However it is my own space and it’s close to university. 

If I accept my aunt and uncles offer, I get to be with family for a few months. I get to do my degree full time and finish quicker. I could work casually and save money for a move out. I wouldn’t have to be reliant on my mother and I wouldn’t have to have contact with her. 

I’m not sure which to choose. 

On the one hand, my mother has apparently already signed this lease. I don’t want to infringe on my aunt and uncle (who have two spare rooms and two spare bathrooms btw - I wouldn’t be in the way) if my mother is offering g another option, I’m not sure if that’s ethical of me. 

On the other, I’m exhausted from three months on the street. I’ve had the worst year I’ve ever had. I don’t know if I can work full time AND study at nights right now. I don’t know if I can afford the rent, plus other expenses. I’m also genuinely scared of my mother. 

I’m worried that if I’m open with my aunt and uncle about the options, they won’t want me with them. After all, they probably only see me being there as a last resort. 

I also CANNOT tell my mother they are involved because she loathes them and will go even more off the rails.",27Dec2019,1

(I am openly gay) it’s just she’s so young she can’t comprehend this stuff yet, and my mom told her about a year ago what gay/lesbian was so I don’t want her to think oh this girls pretty so I guess I’m gay.

327,"First things first, I'm only posting this due to the fact that I couldn't really find anything online already that pertains to my exact ""situation"" (as I guess you would call it), so here I am. Anyways on to the main subject here. Lately at school I've been noticing something that has been reoccurring somewhat frequently (unless I'm going crazy and becoming paranoid or something). Pretty much every morning or so when I come to school, right before I enter my homeroom I'll notice this girl who sits right up front in the second row of desks towards the door (the same row that I sit in too) will look at me as I'm coming in the classroom (all the way from the hallway until I'm passing by her squeezing through the row of desks to sit down). Since I'm a shy and not really confident person I haven't really attempted to make eye contact with her and usually when I enter the classroom I tend to look towards the ground as I get to my seat, however there might have been a time or two where I did by accident make eye contact with her but I would break it off very quickly. Even though I know this is simply just her looking at me as I enter a classroom, I'm wondering if this might be any kind of subtle sign that she might be interested in me or something. I doubt it, but I'm curious to see what other people may think. Currently I'm on my winter break at the moment and won't be coming back to school until next Thursday I believe (the second of January). When I come back to school I'm going to see if this keeps going on and if it does maybe I'll  try to make eye contact with her just to see what happens. Even though I know this is r/advice, I don't really need any advice, more less just people's opinions of what they think might be going on here (sorry about that, didn't really know we're else to post this). I know people are going to tell me to go talk to her as that's really the best and only way to find out if she's interested in me, but as far as I know this girl mainly speaks Spanish and barley any English and I haven't taken a Spanish class since the 8th grade (I'm a senior) so I guess good luck to myself in that department.

TLDR: Girl in my homeroom looks at me as I enter the classroom and sit down. Wondering if this maybe some kind of hint/sign that she is interested in me. Opinions on what might be going on is appreciated. Thank you for reading. Also if you have any questions let me know and I'll try my best to answer them. Once again, thanks.",27Dec2019,1

329,"I am 26 M. I rent an apartment with roommates near work at the city but every weekends and holiday season I go back home and spend time with my family in my parent's house.

My mom stays home and takes care of my dog. She spoiled her too much because my dog have separation anxiety and get sick if she was left 
alone. My mom stay in my dog's room for the whole day to play with her.

My sister have more than 20 cats. She works as a freelance artist and stay home, but sometimes she works late hours at night to meet the deadline because most of her clients are from the other side of the globe. 

So more often than not, my dad took over the cleaning and the feeding of all her cats. Add that he's also in charge of cooking / preparing food for both pets and humans in our house. He loves cooking.

By the way, he does not work anymore. He used to work as retail, but ever since I settled with a good job 5 years ago I took over all the family expenses and even continued paying support for my sister's college until she graduate. I also pay for all their expenses in the house. I pay their bills, groceries, other living expenses and all our pets expenses. 

Then I helped my dad start a business around two years when he told me he wanted to. I saved up a starting capital, rent him a nearby commercial space so he can sell whatever merchandise he wants to there and open/close anytime he want since its just walking distance from home.

For some time, he was happy. But let's just say he's not good at handling business because he's too generous to the point that he sells his customer the goods with a pay-whenever-you-want policy. Needless to say it went bankrupt. I helped him settle for all the balance he incurred from the suppliers.

Then Christmas came, and we had some family drama over the dinner. It would take more than a few post to detail everything, but let's just say my dad is not happy with our current living situation. He even said some scary stuff : ""I hope I get sick and die, maybe then I won't have to suffer anymore"". I don't know what to do anymore. I keep asking him, what does he truly want, but he don't say. He would always walk away and get so angry if I keep persisting on asking him questions about what he want me to do.

I told him I'm sorry for whatever offense I did to him. Just tell me what's wrong and I'll do my best to fix it but he keeps on insisting it's not me. It would have been ok, if he did not add that ""I'm too young to understand"" or sometimes he tells me ""It's because you still think like a kid"" or worst he sometimes yells ""Stop acting like a child!""

He still sees me as a kid and he don't trust me to make adult decision and he won't tell me his problem. I know I can't say I'm an adult, yet. Hey I'm still living with my parents right? But at least let me help you. I might be a child in your eyes, but I'm *your* child. 

Anyway, from all the hints I get he probably don't want our current living situation. I don't know why, but I keep on thinking, I'm not enough. 

I want to do something about it. I want to help out. So far the following things I find he complains too much about:

1. The cats. We have more than 20 of them, ever since we took care of some strays my sister decided to rescue and take care of more of them. They are such sweet and loving creature. But I think, my dad hates them. When he has no where to go but home, he can't stand being surrounded with them. 

He hates the fact that you have to clean up the mountainous litter they make in a day. One time he did not clean up their litter and my sister was passed out from work the house was filled up with terrible smell. He loves to we have turd factory and he was the only employee. Do I need to let them go? My sister would kill me. She loves them very much. But if those thing makes my dad's life miserable, what can I do?

2. My dog. He's such a sweet dog. But my mom spoils her very much and I think my dad is getting jealous because my mom spends all her time with her instead of him. He might want my dog to go too, but she's already part of the family. I can't bring her with me since no pets allowed in my apartment and my mom already grew very fond of her.

3. My sister. He also complains about my sister staying home all day. But she chose to be a freelancer. I respect her decision. She earns honest living to but all her wants. Its not like she asks him money for anything. I know she doesn't pay rent, or contribute food but I am the one paying for everything not my dad. Anyway all he wants is for her to get a job. According to him a *real* job. He even tried to apply her a minimum wage position as a chamber maid in a hotel. But my sister refused it for: A. she earns a lot more doing the work she loves, for god's sake, she's an artist. B. she doesn't know how to iron bed sheets. hehe we, me and my sister, never did house work. my mom used to do it for us all the time.

4. Our house. Well, currently we live in a compound with my uncle as neighbor. Its been a struggle but we survived. And also, I also took a housing a loan. I'm giving them a new house soon. But then, he's still not happy. Because he worries we will still bring our cats. Well... I'm not really sure. Do I bring them with us?

5. His business. Was it my fault he's not good at handling his business? I tried to warn him time and time again about certain customers and his *strategy* but he won't listen. Now its gone, I could save up again to let him start over. But I'm afraid it would just end up the same. What can I do about it?

6. My mom. Well, she really loves pissing him off, but I know she still loves him. We all do love him. But I think he doesn't love her anymore, he just can't tell it straight because he's afraid of the consequences. I don't want to meddle with their marital affairs. It's their problem, but my problem is its affecting us his kids because he's turning his anger towards us or sometimes the cats. Sometimes he hits those poor creatures. I don't know how to fix relationship. Heck I don't even know how to be in so I can't help him with that,

7. Me. There are times when I think I maybe his problem. I think I hurt his ego by taking over all the family expenses. But I just want to help. There are times when I think, all he want is for me to leave. He sometimes asked me if I never thought about working overseas. Away from them. I don't know what I may have done wrong, but I sometimes feels he hates me too much.

This is getting too long and personal. Its becoming more of a rant than seeking advice. Anyway, sorry for cluttering this sub with my drama, and sorry for my English, its not my native language but I'm trying my best to get better at it. Maybe I should just make short:

but i dont hear anything now, so im afraid. ive locked my door, but as ive said, shes crazy. shes chased me around the house with a butchers knife before, i had to barricade myself in my room with a baseball bat, and then made a swift exit out of the house to a (former) friends house to get away from her. the kicker? she pulled the knife out on me over my damn skate board. A. SKATE. BOARD.
shes also very manipulative and cruel. last December she manipulated me into drinking glassfulls of cough syrup, began belittling me (being transphobic, saying my friends dont love me/no one cares about me, etc.) and pretending to punch me. me, freaking out, my liver or kidneys being killed by the cough syrup, and anger towards my sister for saying horrible things to me and trying to make me feel small by making me flinch finally got to me. at some point she turned around, so i kicked her in the back of the head (i was laying on my bed and she was standing) and then we started to fight. she ripped my shirt, broke the necklace i was wearing, and dug her nails into me. my dog was also in the room and i was afraid of him being hurt so i quickly ended the fight, BURST into my guardians room (which was right next door, dunno how they didnt hear anything) and began sobbing and telling them everything that i just happened. ended up going to the nearby hospital (not the good one like Einstein, a little lesser known one near a Wendys) getting my vitals or whatever checked, had a nice nurse named Gary who told me to never ever do anything my sister tells me to do ever again, and then proceeded to have me take my own IV out of my hand. he was quite the character.

332,"i (19f) started remembering that my brother (23m) used to use me sexually. he would touch me, make me touch him, and more. i remember i never wanted to, but i never stopped it. 

i have a hard time accepting that what happened was abuse. i’ve certainly reacted like it is: nightmares, panic attacks, constantly thinking about it, aversion and obsession. but i also tell myself it wasn’t a crime, we were too close in age and there’s no way to know if he really /knew/ what he was doing. 
he continued to touch me (not in an explicitly sexual way) and randomly walk into my room at all hours until about a year and a half ago. 


anyways, he’s the golden child. doesn’t use drugs. apparently all the girls in college want him (i don’t really believe this cause he’s ugly and annoying and gross and probably a pedophile), and he’s definitely getting into a good medical school. 
meanwhile, i’m abusing alcohol (that i steal from my parents), off all my antidepressants, and lashing out nonstop. i couldn’t stop thinking about the abuse and it made me fail a final. 


i want revenge. i want him to suffer but i don’t want to start any legal battle or anything because i’m embarrassed and i don’t need that stress.

333,"  So I went to my brothers house today without the rest of the family there and was given the gifts from our mother that I did not want to accept but opened anyway to remain on good terms with older brother. Our mom is psycho btw. They're sitting on my floor and I'm pissed. I'm 50/50 on either leaving them on her doorstep or just giving the clothes to goodwill and money to a church. 

Option 1 sends a clear pissed off message to leave me the fuck alone but also runs the risk of retaliation. Her husband is a felon and has vandalized my car before and almost hurt me but I would really like to retaliate myself and stop being a pushover coward. I struggle with confrontation so this might help me. Not doing anything before did not help me and she still continued to vandalize and ruin my life and harass me.

Option 2 keeps the waters calm, gives to the needy but I would still be a tip toeing coward in the end and where's the strength and morality in that?

334,"It’s happened a few times. After the first time I thought that it only happened because we were both drunk and there, didn’t think they were actually attracted to me outside of that...but then it happened again and I thought if they were not attracted to me, surely they wouldn’t voluntarily drink with me again and have it happen again, right? 

I understand that a lot of people drunkenly hook up with someone that they aren’t attracted to but that’s with someone you’re not gonna see again, especially not in a work environment, which leads me to believe that maybe they are attracted to me when sober but only brave enough to do something about it when drunk. 

Stupidly enough, I’m interested in more if they are but due to the circumstances I know I have to tread lightly and I’d like some advice on what my move is here or if you even think I have a move.

335,"Hi. I'm a sophomore in college majoring in psychology. This year I'm required to take a statistical research methods course as part of my module and have been failing the exams for the class. I find the course extremely difficult to approach (my professor's required homemade text notes which he reads verbatim from every class are just walls of text) as it's very content-heavy and my professor is notorious for writing very challenging exams (the class averages on the past two exams have been well below the expected average for courses in my year). I got a 41 on the first exam and a 48 on the second, so I'm currently failing (need to average a 50 on the exams to pass). I do have two more exams so I know all hope isn't lost, but I'm terrified because I can so easily see myself hovering over the ""almost-a-pass-but-not-quite"" mark for the rest of the exams.

&amp;#x200B;

I've considered a tutor but I'm not sure of how much use they could be as I struggle less with the math (so far) and more with the content-based application multiple choice. I struggle a lot with mental illness so I've set up accommodations with the school for the rest of the exams, and I have started reading ahead in the textbook (even though it's christmas break lmao) but I still feel like this won't be enough. It's been setting off my anxiety ever since I wrote the first exam. I can't fail this. My parents will be so disappointed. I really don't want to pay a lot of money to retake it in the summer. I have no idea if there are any extra steps I can take to increase my marks. Any advice would be very appreciated, thank you.",27Dec2019,1

337,"Growing up kids always teased me for how pale I am. I can’t count how many times the comments, “you’re so pale”, “go outside”, “get some sun” and “you look sick” have been said to me. As I got older even family members started pointing it out. I can’t tan naturally and I became super insecure about it and haven’t been able to shake that feeling of embarrassment and shame since. I even went as far as self tanning for an entire year recently just so I could feel normal and not so outcasted. Needless to say I got tired of that and felt just as bad trying to hide my paleness.

338,"I just wanna start off with saying that my relationship with my mom is great, and she is a good person, and I couldn't have asked for a better mother but sometimes when my she gets mad, she doesn't just stay mad for a couple of hours, she can stay mad for 4 entire days locked in her room and every once in a while she will go and yell at me. I apologize over and over again, but she won't even accept it, no she will just go up to her room and slam the door. 

During these periods I feel so down, and since I’m already going through a rough time this makes it so much worse, it's like she thinks she is the only one who suffers. 

She says I’m spoiled and don't do anything but being on my phone. While I cook food, do the dishes clean, vacuum the house, clean my cats’ litterbox. I'm just 16 and I can't take it anymore.

When I go to school I must pretend that everything is fine, and my grades are already starting to drop because of stress and I've been trying to talk to my mom about this, I came home from school and said to my mom ”mom I haven't been feeling so great lately” which she replied with ”how can you say something like that, don't you see I’m busy”

And right now I can't empathize with anyone, I feel like I’m a bitch, I don't care about anyone and this is so far away from my real me. I do not wanna be this way. I just wanna sleep and wake up when everything is over.",27Dec2019,1

340,"Ever since I was little, I wanted to be an artist. I would be obsessed with drawing and I was always known as 'the artist' and my friends/ family would always introduce me by saying I'm 'really good at art'. I used to spend hours and hours each day just drawing and I would not sleep just to draw. Not to brag at all, but I think I do have some skill/potential in my art. I always got top marks in my art classes at school and around when I was 15/16 I managed to grow a somewhat successful art account on instagram and do commissions.  (the account is deleted currently)

But around when I was 16/17, I started experiencing artblocks. The amount of time I would spend drawing became less and less until I would go months without doing any personal art. I still very much wanted to be an artist, yet I began to lose motivation to even pick up my pencil. Instead I would procrastinate or just lie in bed watching mindless youtube video or sleeping all day. I was fully aware that this was not normal but I couldn't bring myself to change it. Also to note that I was a massive film/anime/kpop fan during my entire life, but slowly I found myself no longer binge-reading manga or couldn't seem to finish any anime/film/tvshow (old or new) or listen to the new album by my favourite artists. During this time I felt incredibly listless and felt like I was wasting my time but I'd still pretend that I was enjoying my hobbies. 

Eventually my grades in highschool started dropping because I couldn't finish assignments. Throughout this whole time, everyone around me still thought I was going to become some amazing professional artist. Several friends told that they couldn't wait for me to 'become famous' and they'd see me 'being interviewed on tv' and hearing that hurt me like I never thought it would. Eventually, whenever someone mentions art or refer to me as an artist I feel quite stressed and anxious, like I'm hiding a dirty secret. I don't want to disappoint everyone who's been supporting me so far. 

Being an artist is so closely tied to my identity since I was little, I honestly feel like I've lost who I am as a person and now I'm doubting everything I do. I don't have any other skills because I spent pretty much all my life drawing and nothing else I want to do careerwise. Everything I do seems empty and it's scaring me how I've been acting these past few years. I don't think I can go on like this much longer. Despite everything, I still want to do art.

I'm (f21) now a 2nd yr illustration student and my work is good in quality but everyone in my class seems way more passionate than I am and I feel like I'm just floating through. I don't have any idea what I'll do when I graduate. Sometimes I get a flare of art inspiration or a new book/song that I get really into, but it doesn't last very long. 

Do I have depression or am I just in a rut?  I don't want to bring this up with a therapist because it doesn't sound serious. I'm hesitant to call this depression because I don't necessarily feel 'sad' and when I'm in the company of my friends I laugh and smile a lot. I have lots of close friends that I genuinely love and spend lots of time around. My relationship with my family is okay. I have been able to hold part time jobs. I don't want to blow things out of proportion. For the longest time I've been telling myself that I'm just being lazy but now looking back, I'm wondering if it might be more than that. I've lost a lot of faith in myself.

Does anyone have any advice on what I can do?? 

Tysm for reading and really sorry if it seems rambly. It's the first time I've confronted the past 4 years of my life and I'm desperately lost. I want to be able to move forward with my life.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TLDR: 2nd year art college student, Built my entire life around art since childhood. But have been losing motivation/interest in drawing/hobbies since 17. But still want to be an artist and no other interest/skill. Social and family life is fine. Is it depression or a rut?",27Dec2019,1

He wanted to hang out so bad but I didn’t really want to considering I have a boyfriend and I know if we did hang out it could turn to something way different... but I did anyway cause I ended up speaking up about it, I said we could hang out and smoke a little Mary since I know we both do. Well this dude ends up bringing a bunch of beer and I gave into the alcohol. I wish I hadn’t, I know things could have gone differently. Thing is, I’m not the best with alcohol and I just have had a hard time not consuming it lately. Anyway we drink a few beers and smoke some weed where it is now 3 am. I want to go to bed we were outside of my house just chillin. Anyway I go and lay down in his back seat cause I’m absolutely trashed, we smoked so many joints and drank a ton of bud light.. I remember I even drank more than he did. But man I was just sitting in his back seat when he comes back there with me and starts kissing me and all... I kept kind of pulling away and such and he was just not getting the hint.. I know the alcohol was talking now and I couldn’t find a way to pull away completely before he got to my pants. So I just let him. I didn’t do a single thing the entire time. I just laid there. I was so upset honestly and mostly because he didn’t use a condom. I was just upset the whole time after that...I vividly remember us joking about “consent” before drinking and I kept saying I couldn’t do anything beyond just hanging out. I didn’t think it’d go this far and me getting all fucked up and such. I keep thinking about it and it’s honestly ruining me. I feel like shit :’( and I wish I wouldn’t have had hung out with him in the first place. What do I do? I know that I should break up with my boyfriend for hanging out with him because it’s technically cheating but I just cant seem to bare it together... I didn’t want to have sex with the guy, I thought we’d agreed to just simply hanging out. I need someone’s input.. advice.. help.",27Dec2019,1

349,"Doctors commonly tell them that they've just got some sort of bacterial/viral infection around the kidneys, give them antibiotics, and that's that. The symptoms lessen for a bit, then come back again. Been this way for almost a year, sometimes with long periods between symptoms. The symptoms include (but aren't limited to) severe back/side pain, constant nausea &amp; vomiting, frequent urination in small amounts, coughing, dizziness, and occasionally some blood in urine.
  
Now they're in so much pain that they can't work (they're employed, but on temporary leave), don't have insurance (so medical bills are just gonna keep piling up because no one can seem to find the problem), and aren't able to even pay for their regular bills at this point. Finally got some medication for the pain and referred to a specialist (appointment next week), but it's getting worse fairly quickly. Going back to the ER will more than likely just have them go through the same routine, maybe give them a stronger pain medication, and send them on their way, with another medical bill that they can't afford.
  
What can be done at this point? It's keeping me up at night worrying. My biggest fear is that the specialist won't know what it is, either. My friend is to the point where they'd almost not mind it being something terrible like cancer, just so they'd know what it is.

350,"Hey all,
In 2 weeks I’ll be turning 23 and I’m exactly where I wanted to be when I was 20 years old, except I’m now here in ways I didn’t anticipate. 

I have been cooking as a career since I was 16 and I love it, I went to school for culinary arts and a bachelors in entrepreneurship.. at the end of the day I’m a business man who loves cooking, but all I ever have done is cooked. This year (Jan 2019) I made an agreement to operate a failing restaurant as an owner, and I doubled sales in 6 months and gained a following, but eventually from grinding 7days a week and 14 hours a day, I lost my love life, social life and I eventually built up a 25k debt and basically got burnt. I threw in the towel and moved to nyc, to try to rekindle with my ex but that’s not going to happen now. 
After such a hard hit this year, I’m contemplating switching to real estate and learning that skill set. I’m an extremely ambitious and dedicated person who has no problem grinding hours to succeed (clearly). 

Right now I’m a cook at one of the best (2 Michelin) restaurants in NYC, but I’m making shit money.. I know I’m bright and talented, would it be a good switch to go into real estate. 

I have plans with food in the future of my life, but I know I’ll never be able to make enough money and invest in a future by cooking.",27Dec2019,1

Steal from a local McDonalds or Grocery store public bathroom and wrap it around my empty roll. This will presumably look rather suspicious and not perform adequately.  


Come up with a reason to cancel, or cancel with the genuine reason.  


Roll the dice and hope they don't have to use the restroom

353,"So, throwaway because eh, rather not have this on my main account, but anyways, let's get to the point. So, I'm 15, and I was closeted to my parents until about 9 hours ago, and I had my boyfriend at my house, and we were just cuddling and all that with the door closed, and then my dad calls me into his room. Basically he tells me he was spying on me through the doorcrack, which considering that I haven't done anything to lose either his or my mom's trust and justify doing that, is just plain creepy. What's more, is that a bit afterwards, I decided to see how well you could see into my room from the doorcrack, and you can only see into it when looking from a very specific angle, meaning he either spent around 3-4 minutes trying to spy on me, or he's done this before. Now before this, he already never respected my sister's or my privacy, he never knocks, if we lock our rooms he just unlocks them, and he just overall doesn't let us have any real private time. This, I was relatively alright with, it's annoying, but I can live with it, but now, knowing that he's willing to just, spy on us through the doorcrack like that, I don't feel comfortable in my own house in the slightest, especially since he's always awake until around 12 or 1 am. Ontop of all that, he's never told me he did this, until now, meaning that if he has been doing this for a while, which I suspect he has, he's just been silently spying on me, which considering the fact that I occasionally crossdress in private, and masturbate every now and then, is quite offputting. And again, he has no reason to spy on us like that, we haven't done anything to lose his trust. Overall, I just don't feel comfortable in my house anymore, and I don't know what to do, since he's essentially a brick wall when literally anyone, even his own wife, tries to negotiate or reason with him, and if he's proven wrong, he just throws a fit and starts yelling about how you're insulting him, before changing the topic.

359,"I have been experiencing multiple problems that I don’t know what to do with, it’s like I get obsessed with something so easily, and I can’t stop being obsessed with it. I’ve noticed that I’ve gone through obsessions with other things, for as long as I can remember, I just want to be able to like things without making my life about them, and to be scared of things for only a little bit of time without being disturbed for months. 

(Most of this stuff is really cringey and immature, but in the moment I was so obsessed and stuck in my mind I really didn’t care about  so bare with me, I wouldn’t tell anyone in real life this stuff, and I’m bad at expressing how I actually feel with words.) 

This all started last year, I had been doing voice lessons for a few months and then there was some chances to do plays and stuff, and I’ve always wanted to do that so I did and looked forward to them, but it wasn’t just something I thought of sometimes and was excited for, I wanted it to be my personality. I started thinking about how cool it would be to be known as someone who was into plays and singing and other stuff like that, the thing is that it wasn’t just sometimes, it was like the only thing I thought about. 

So I made it a great importance to literately fit that personality for some reason, I’ve constantly been told I’m too quiet so I made it so I would talk louder and more often, I wanted to be like that for some reason. I also decided to dress in a certain way. (that I hate now, and have decided that it’s the very opposite that I am going for if I want to look good)

From now it just kinda sounds like a cringey phase that I wanted to forget about (I’m so glad I moved schools since then) and it was, but I really couldn’t understand anything that was goin on around me and it’s like I got stuck in my mind, and i didn’t actually like it, but I was stuck with a unrealistic expectation that I wanted to reach but never would)

Anyways so one day I went to go watch a certain movie in theaters, And there was a character I really thought was cool and I wanted to be like them, and it’s pretty normal to like some fictional characters, Maybe buy a shirt because it reminds you of the character, or be inspired to get into a hobby by a fictional character, But not to the point that I was, I made it a point to get rid of all of my clothes that I had as soon as I got home and decided to get all clothes that reminded me of that character, not just the style, like it had to be the exact color scheme, and I decided to cut my hair a little bit shorter (and I’m not looking back.) and it lead to some other cringey mini phases in between there, like a steampunk phase where I wore the same necklace and earrings everyday for 2-3 months, because I thought it reminded me of the character. 

This phase lasted till 1-2 months ago, and now I don’t think about it anymore, because somehow I just stopped being obsessed with it. I remember during multiple times I had just come out of this phase for a few moments just randomly, and I felt so useless. Plus this phase made me act in a snobby way and I started to ignore my family members and act completely different, and do other...cringey things that I don’t think I would’ve done if I was in the right mindset at the time. This phase almost lasted for a entire year. 

And it’s not just about trying to be like a fictional character or something you have in your head, it’s also just being obsessive in general without me thinking about it. This seems to also lead me to be paranoid for literately no reason when nothing’s even happened to me, sometimes for months. 

I’ve noticed since I was a little kid I used to be really afraid of things that I saw online on on tv and it would cause me to stay up all night on my devices and constantly look around my room to see if anyone was there, and I would keep on waking up my parents because sometimes I just couldn’t take it anymore. 

In October I saw this true crime mystery on YouTube, and I made the mistake of clicking on it, I only watched a few minutes of it. And it scared me almost immediately, I now know to avoid stuff like that. This case was real, But there was no reason that I would be afraid of it, they found who did it and they are still behind bars, it was in a completely different country and culture, And the victim wasn’t just random. And it was a famous case, not a urban legend. Anyways that night I went to go talk to someone and suddenly I shook from fear and dropped my phone. I also went to go get my hair done (something I usually like) and all I could think about was the thing. That night I couldn’t sleep, I was shaking and got up every few seconds to check if someone was in my room, I was scared to move when I did finally close my eyes. This continued for about a month (well to around December 4-6th ish) , and I eventually broke down crying to one of my family members because I was so scared of being alone. It’s like I couldn’t stop thinking about it, I couldn’t get out of this mindset. 

About a week ago I saw something on the news that scared me so much I started taking things out of my room because I believed they had cameras in them, and I stayed up for most of the night, and I swore I could hear someone outside.

365,"I’ll try my best to make this as short as possible. My husband and I are in our early 30s. Three years ago my parents decided to sell their home that I grew up in to move to another state. They asked us if we were interested in purchasing the home by making payments to them for ten years and then at that point, get a traditional bank loan. We agreed as its very difficult to find anywhere in our area at an affordable price, and we both liked the idea of our kids being able to stay in the area. Two years in my parents found out after five years they had to use our payments as a source of income. They were not happy. At this point they started bugging us to move down near them. We declined numerous times. 

In the three years we have been here, we have put ourselves in debt from all the repairs that have had to be done. Taxes have doubled in the time we have been here. With that, on top of repairs, needing to buy another car and another child in the family, we are maxed out. My parents, yet again began bugging for us to move down near them. 

This is where things get difficult: after numerous offers and at times almost threats of selling the house, we agreed to let them just sell the house. We can’t afford the maintenance at this point and even when we do it’s not good enough to my fathers standards EVER. It becomes stressful on my husband because he’s doing everything he can and it’s never enough. This house has become a source of stress because of how tied to the house my parents are. They offered us in exchange due to the cost of living being cheaper we’re they reside, to take $250k to buy us a house near them when this house sells. To them, they get to be close to their grandkids which they both want and it helps us financially. Normally, this would be an amazing offer... however, the problem is they live in the middle of nowhere... the closest jobs in my husbands line of work is 3 hours away and the only jobs locally are minimum wage jobs... we would be in worse condition there then here more than likely. 

We were told they wouldn’t put the house up for sale until summer. This let the kids finish off the school year, save money and to make a decision on if we were finding a place to rent here or to move down there. 

A week ago I came home to my parents standing in the middle of my kitchen. Telling me a realtor was coming the following day... and now they already have a buyer and we may have to be out by the end of January. 

Jobs are non existent there beside low paying jobs. We have no money saved. My husband and I aren’t sure what to do. They want my husband to just quit his good paying job and take a chance on making things work because they’d be buying us a house. Our only responsibility would be the utilities, insurance and taxes on the house... plus obviously our other bills (car, insurance, credit cards, cell phones) and obviously, to live off of. 

We aren’t sure what to do. I expressed my concern to my parents and they think I’m stressing out about nothing and we will figure it out down there. If it were just my husband and I, I’d take the chance but we have four kids to take care of. I’m upset we’re in this situation. I feel like we are being forced out and much sooner than we would have ever expected. We’ve been trying to find a house or apartment some legal local to rent but are having a difficult time even finding anything big enough... which is sad because my husband makes a decent wage. I’m not sure how to proceed honestly and my family is so biased over the situation I’m finding it difficult to make a solid decision. 

Please no bashing. We work very hard, pay our bills on time, keep food on the table.... just struggling since the birth of our fourth child (and before anyone says we shouldn’t have had a fourth if we couldn’t afford it, my husband had a vasectomy that failed so a fourth child was never supposed to be in the cards for us). We are just trying to make the best of a difficult situation. 😣",27Dec2019,1

Hello everybody I have had 2 best friends one I’ve known since I was 12 years old and one since 15 years old. In total about 9 and 6 years of friendship, I am now 27 years old (f). We had stopped talking when I was 21 years old due to them moving, but we recently connected and we all crossed each other’s paths again. We are all the same age and went to the same high school together and live in the same town. Yet I do have some issues that I seem to not be able to let go... when we were in high school they would make fun of me jokingly but it hurt me. Made comments about my makeup looking bad and my Adam’s apple which was prominent I am (f) one of my friends is a female and one is a male he is gay (so no he didn’t make fun of me cus he liked me) lol. I basically knew them both and introduced them to each other. I thought we got past high school since we recently connected since a 6 year hiatus, but ever since we started hanging out again I find myself going back to old traits such as gossiping about people and just becoming “high school “ they also don’t respect my boundaries and ask me to keep hanging out with them at least twice a week if I say I’m busy they get upset with me. I finally decided to confront them since we’ve been reconnecting for the past two months and explained to them that they don’t respect my boundaries and only seem to want to hang out when they know that I am busy, for example I told them beforehand we can hang out after my finals week, but yet they kept bugging me to hangout that week, when I told them I’d be busy, it seems they do it on purpose. They decided to show up at my house unannounced during finals week it was nice seeing them but I got annoyed that they didn’t listen to a simple request and I let all my feelings out. I let them know that I feel left out of the conversation most of the time when we’re all hanging out together and sometimes I feel like I’m background noise to them. I also told them I was hurt from high school memories with them even though we had good times . I dk it all came out in anger because I was frustrated and they apologized said they said they would respect my boundaries and such but now I feel awkward hanging out with them after that outburst.  I also feel that I’ve noticed bad traits come out ever since I’ve hung out with them, my partner and my parents pointed out that I’m acting like I’m in high school and there’s always drama. Should I continue the friendship or is it time to let go, instead of reconciliation? It’s hard for me to make friends and that’s why I was happy to reconnect with them again but I find myself in a high school state of mind... and the worse part is that they like to talk crap about people sometimes I think they talk about me and when I asked them sometimes I feel I can’t trust you guys because you guys like to talk about people, so you guys probably talk about me, and they laughed and admitted it, but said they were sorry. What should I do? Cut them off, reconciliation? Or distance myself?",27Dec2019,1

372,"

Following a break-up and being fired from my job I made the decision of moving back to my home state with my mom after I pay off my 2k debt. My mom was thrilled that I was moving back in and started making plans right away. 
Because I was unemployed, I had extra time and decided to stay at my moms house about a week to celebrate the holidays and just spend more time with them in general. 

My mom lives in a tiny attic apt because our house was foreclosed 5 years ago. My older sister lives there too along with our family pets 3 cats and a dog. It has 2 bedrooms, but they’re both taken. My mom said when I moved back we’d be sharing her room. I’ve been here since the 22nd and I’ve had no privacy at all. Both my mom and sister are needy and constantly seeking me out to watch tv with them and just mingle with them. I get it because they miss me and I’m never around due to the distance, but also Im an introvert and although I love my family, I need to take breaks and retreat into a room to be alone for a while to “recharge”. They’re constantly barging into my moms room where im staying, which doesn’t even have a door just curtains, they turn on the tv super loud and the lights are constantly on as soon as they wake up (6am). The house is messy and my mom doesn’t feel the need to have furniture because she “plans to move soon” and doesn’t want to move the furniture when “she moves” so instead we have a small futon and a white foldable picnic table in the middle of the living room. The kitchen is SMALL, but cluttered with a ton of knick knacks and there are stacks of papers everywhere around the house. Ive been at her house a total of 6 days and I’m frustrated, overwhelmed and ready to go back to my own house. Im second guessing moving back in with my mom because of how small the space is, but I also know that I can’t afford an apt in IL on my own. Im so torn between staying in my state where I have no job, friends or SO or moving back in with my mom and starting fresh, but having to deal with the tiny apt. I planned on buying a house with my sister and all three of us living there, but because I got fired I now have no income and have to start my 2 yr job requirement again, which means I wont be able to buy a house until 2 yrs after I move and we’d have to live in the tiny apt together for two more years. I’ll be staying at my current state until I pay my debt ( I dont want to move w/ debt) which should take 6 months at most and then after I have a decision to make, but I’m so freaking torn.

I met up with one of my friends today. I really enjoyed it and am just reflecting on it all. One thing I am naturally terrible at - and what I am dwelling on is how we said ‘goodbye’ at the end.

The last time I met this friend (about a year ago) she said ‘see you later’ to me on parting. Today, we were on the tube and talking right to the very end before she had to get off at her stop. As the train pulled in to her stop, I initiated a cuddle with her (she initiated one with me when we met). She said something along the lines of it was good to have met and good luck with my masters and dissertation (which I am currently working on) and wished me a good Christmas.

The words that ring in my ears though were her final words to me ‘see you, bye’. She then left the tube very quickly and didn’t stay on the platform to wave as the train left with me on it.

Is ‘see you, bye’ a suggestion that she doesn’t want to see me again? Last year when we parted she said ‘see you later’ to me. This meant that I had the confidence to reach out and message her and arrange today because she said that. Ending today on ‘See you, bye’ means that I will be much less likely to be as confident in the future to reach out to her again.

We spent six hours together today and I really enjoyed it.

Do you think that ending it in this way has shut the door on me contacting her again (maybe in a year or so) to arrange another catch up?",27Dec2019,1

378,"My (28f) sister (38f) have had a turbulent relationship throughout our lives. She's a selfish person, has a nasty streak and this has become more apparent in the last year after turning our relationship into a competition.

It started with myself and my partner buying our first home together. We've been together 7 years and it felt like the right time to put down some roots so we found a home we loved, and started the proceedings and finally got our home in February after months of stress. When the sale was going through, my sister kept making comments like 'I'm so jealous, I want to buy a house' so I told her there was no reason why she couldn't try and helped her and her partner through the whole process of buying their house (nobody helped me!). Just after she moved into her new house, my partner popped the question and we announced our engagement. And since this happened, she has become so bitter and angry, she's stopped talking to me basically and only contacts me when she wants something or needs someone to feel sorry for her.

Just before December, she called and said 'just 2 presents each this Christmas, I'm getting you a joint one so do the same for me and my partner, I'd rather you spend the extra on our son'. So I said OK fine, I got her a couple of presents and some odd stocking fillers that cost next to nothing.

I spent about £45-50 on her son. He's starting nursery in January, she demanded no toys so all was left was clothes so I got him some nice comfortable clothes for when he's running around with other kids and some books. I've spent probably just under £100 on her family. Plus her birthday is 2 days after Xmas (today) so I had to spent more money on her for her birthday.

Anyways, after an up and down Christmas with her (she wouldn't come to see us on Christmas day, cancelled last minute because she said she couldn't be bothered), she text me yesterday to say she's 'lost' the present she got for me and my partner. Which wouldn't be an issue - if I didn't have bags of stuff here for her, her family and her birthday. I'm meant to be going out for a meal with them tonight for her birthday and taking the gifts with me, but I genuinely feel like not giving her anything apart from her birthday present and the clothes for her kid. She's become so arrogant and rude.,made nasty comments to be about getting married over the last few months for her to now turn around at Xmas and say shes lost my gift - I just feel like she's being a cow on purpose. She was really nasty to her partner on Christmas eve, tried to isolate him on Xmas day and it was me that talked her out of it.

I just don't understand her behaviour. I feel so distant from her but I know that isolating her from my life isolates my nephew which I don't want. What am I to do today with these gifts and what do I do in the new year? Do I cut her off?",27Dec2019,1

TLDR - I am a man in my late 20’s who has been in a few committed serious relationships. I find myself wanting to be more of a f***boy even as I see my friends get married. Sometimes I find travel/hookups meaningless, but I still chase it. IMO long term joy = real meaningful love and building a life. What do you make of this?

Reddit,

Help me gain your understanding and perspective on this. 

I’m a late mid twenties male who has stable career with advancement, had a few serious relationships, and been lucky enough to have the opportunity to live abroad a few times. At this stage in my life, I understand where joy comes from - a happy family, a few friends and a partner who actually love you, meaningful shared experiences, learning, self growth, exercise, good food, sun. As I’m approaching 30 I can’t help shake the feeling that I ought to be using these lessons and building a “real” life for myself. But instead I find myself yearning for more travel, adventure, and more sexual exploration - even though sometimes when I am traveling or meeting up for sex I am thinking “what’s the point of this.” I know this stuff is “foolish” in the sense that it doesn’t lead to “true joy,” but I can’t help but have these desires. And I think it’s important to pursue them - maybe not too much but at least to some extent. 

What do you think? Is this something I need to see through? Is it meaningful/meaningless? Am I delusional and missing something completely? I guess ultimately this is my ask - I know the things that bring joy are things you build and last, but my desire to go deeper into the “prodigal son/meaningless exploration” path for now is still strong - what’s your take on this?",27Dec2019,1

So?? She found one of my social media accounts, and started looking through it and asked if I liked him, said yes then said we were dating, she asked since when and it was a good two weeks after we had stopped dating, short time but I just moved on.  Apparently she never moved on and still wished for us to get together, but the thing is our relationship was horribly toxic we didn’t know each other , thought we did and it was just horrible. She started to say I liked him when we were dating then and I said “No, I figured it out after we broke up, I never liked him while dating you.” And she flipped. We fought for hours, then she gave up and said we weren’t talking about it anymore and said we should rot in hell. And then a few minutes go by and she starts spamming on one of her popular social media accounts that me and him will pay for this and she will be ruining our lives, and that it was not an empty threat.

I essentially have given up on my life and still live with my folks and one of my brothers (who is on the autism spectrum) doing unofficial work for my dad at his car dealership. However, the business is slow sometimes and I just don't see myself ever taking the place of my dad when I am barely keeping it together.

Because of various issues I am dealing with in life such as depression and anxiety, issues paying attention, failed relationships, family struggles, the list goes on - I just don't know where my life is going or where it should go. I don't have any real skills I can use, and I have been too scared of driving to have get a driver's license. I've been working for my dad unofficially for the last year or so since he offered a better wage than most places that would hire me with me not having a college education. But I just do not care about cars. I'm actually scared of driving like I wrote earlier. I can't work there forever if I'm to truly become independent (I don't want to be independent or free though honestly) and I know I do not want to do what my dad does. 

Recently I had revealed the extent of my disillusionment to my parents, which led us to trying to find affordable places to get some sort of therapy or counseling since I don't have any insurance or health coverage (I honestly don't know how that even works) we haven't had much success. My folks just gave me some vitamins to take to try to improve my mood and to talk about it more to figure out what we plan next.

So this leads to my issue. First of the year really, I have to find another place to work full time or go to school again. The problem is though, I have no passion or want for either of those things. I gave up on college early on, realizing the careers I thought I wanted were honestly terrible choices and nothing else sounded inviting. As for work, I am extremely limited on what I can get because of my inability and fear of driving. I don't not mind really where I should work, as it really is only a means to an end to have money to me.

I just don't have any goals or plans right now. I'm bitter towards everything, I like people but only when I want them, and I don't do anything besides doing what work I can for my dad and chores around the house. Thankfully I don't do any drugs or drinking in really any capacity, and I have no debt or loans to pay off. I know it sounds so whiny to hear from someone as young as me and about how much I've already given up, but I don't know how long I can keep pretending to play along with everyone and just end things because I just don't have any true passions or drive for a better life than this.

So, what should I try to do? Try to seek out counseling before trying to get another job or return to school? Get a license and move out despite not being ready? I just don't know where to take things, maybe even not wanting to do anything at all and to just give up. Hope you had a nice Christmas or holidays, and hopefully the first of the year will bring with it some change.",27Dec2019,1
398,So long story short me and my ex broke up a month ago and I got the closure I needed (I think atleast) We decided it would be a good idea to talk after christmas.

399,"Im 17f, When i was around 5 my parents divorced and he started to go downhill as a human being, he cheated on my mother god knows how many times and mentally abused her and myself so much my mother fell depressed and i can't remember 80% of what a normal person would remember of their childhood. 
There was a traumatising 5 year legal battle over me over how i was almost sexually abused and my mum somehow won when the court was bias. 

I met up with him yesterday for christmas as a do every few months and everything was fine until he started telling me about how since I'm not seeing him anymore he can't have stable relationships anymore and he's gone to counseling (good for him) and when ever he gets too close to someone he builds up walls and its all because I'm not seeing him or coming over to his house where i only have bad memories. Yes he's my father and he isn't getting to see me grow up but he's also an abuser, manipulator, liar and a cheater and i dont know how to feel.
He also mentioned how much he wanted to be a good father and husband when he cheated and mentally abused his wife and child.

I mostly feed off of others though, like if I think they are faking it or they seem cold then I lose my emotion no matter the situation like.
When my brother died and my aunt came to console me I began crying sincerely but someone who I think is fake and manipulative came to console me I lost the emotions and just stared as they cried and talked about my brother. 

I don't mean to sound melodramatic but I know I am weird.

Any problem I have, I bring up to him for reassurance, instead I get “ you’re throwing a fit” “ look at it from someone else’s perspective “ and I just want to feel like I’m not being overly dramatic or insane, but I feel like everything I do is wrong and someone is always mad or upset in the house about something I knew nothing about. Example: I asked a housemate who’s turn it was to do dishes because I could’ve sworn I just did them. They informed me it was my turn, I told them if I had known I would’ve done it, they said a reason is just an excuse. I wasn’t trying to start a fight or upset the other person, I really wasn’t. But when I brought it all up to the bf, it felt like he was taking their side. Am I wrong in feeling like I’m being turned against? Am I blowing things out of proportion?  Am I really being childish for wanting someone on my side or reassurance when I’m feeling unsure or upset? My bf says he can’t handle my “fits” about things. What should I do?",27Dec2019,1
404,"So let’s continue with the juicy shit..

Apparently I can’t add this to the relationship page bc?? Anyways...

Thank you to the two who commented pretty quickly to let me know this is an outlet that ppl will look at. Y’all are the real MVPS 😘 

So let’s get on with this long fucking saga that is my life 🤦🏻‍♀️ 

So he got the promotion. It fucked me up on so many levels. I wanted to be happy for him (remember, I realized I was being selfish to not let him apply so why would I be selfish and make it about me when he had such a great thing happen for him?) but I was also so, so let down. It was a fuckery of emotions but he was by my side while I broke down, and he let me get it out. Which was the best thing in the world, bc I saw how much he cared about me. I never resented him or brought it up again, we just supported each other. He was supervisor next door and I was still front desk but at least now we could ask off for the same time and actually do shit outside of work. **side note/spoiler; no one in upper management knew shit then and they also don’t know shit now.** We had this different type of freedom that we’d never had. It’s real sketchy to ask the same dates off when no one knows you’re together. Now, y’all are probably wondering why we decided to hide it (keep in mind, 1. Like I said **small management company** and 2. two front desk people can’t both go from the same property at the same time when this property is looking for 2 supervisors). Well, in December of 2018 (after my boyfriend had this promotion for about 5 months), his co-supervisor got fired. And guess who came running to me to hire me? The **now former** FOM. I didn’t even apply. He came to me, begging me to apply bc he’d wanted us both all along, but had to take one or the other at that time. Understandable, right? So I take it and got the same title of Front Office Supervisor in January of 2019 (co-supervising with my boyfriend). Now would I have gotten the chance to be promoted if people knew we dated? The answer is obvious... absolutely not. That’s why we kept this a secret (also like I said before, it was easy for me to separate our personal from professional lives and honestly, no one’s business). Long story short, the FOM took another job about 2 weeks after I started so it was just my boyfriend and I running the department. We handled everything. And we handled it well. In April, they hired a new FOM. We obviously knew it was coming, we just weren’t ready for the type of FOM we got. 

She came in and changed everything. Cut our legs out from under us, undermined our positions, and basically was our worst nightmare. Now, I know I may sound dramatic, but y’all have to keep in mind that it was our department and ANYONE coming into ANY role shouldn’t strong arm anything without observing first. 

She made our schedules completely opposite, which was the first breaking point (LOL there are about a thousand breaking points I’ve had with this person). 

My point (and I will go into so much more detail about work later) is that we are still together and so happy in our relationship. We moved into a gorgeous condo last October, and we’ve just celebrated our second Christmas in it.  

**There is so much drama in all of the details of this horrible human that I would never get to a point if I made all of the specific examples (which I will over time).**

The biggest issue is that we are literally working opposite schedules, and pouring everything into this fucking job, for what?? To miss out on our life together as a normal couple? We’ve been dating since August of 2017. And I feel like I’m in a closeted relationship (this is an analogy people). I can’t be open and happy with who I’m with bc of this job!?!? His parents are currently staying with us for the week of Christmas (they came down from NY) for the 3rd time in a row. It’s not like it’s hidden from our families or close friends but ya girl wants to be open with who she’s with. Why am I letting this job fuck up my mental well-being?",27Dec2019,1

411,"I am 20 years old and have two siblings that are older than me. For as long as I can remember I have held New Years eve with one or both of my siblings and my parents and their friends. This year both my siblings are going to two different parties. And my dad died this summer, so I can't go with him and my mom is going with a different friend group.   
I have been quite bad at keeping friendships in the past and that has resulted in that I haven't been invited to any place on New Years eve by any friends.   
My mum felt a bit bad and talked to my aunt(not on my request), who have then invited me with her and two of her friends. 

I have also been on an app that links parties and guests together, but the parties seem to disappear from the app and it's hard to tell if any parties will actually manifest from it. 

So the way I see it, I have three options for New Years eve. 

1.Go with my aunt and her two friends

2.Hope that a party manifest from the app and then spend New Years eve with some strangers. If there doesn't end up being any party from the app I will then spend it alone. 

3.Spend it alone. 

What should I do?",27Dec2019,1
412," 

Hey,

For some months I've been thinking of moving back to my family and friends. I moved in the first place because I studied and got a job here. Then, two years ago, I started the relationship with my boyfriend.We had some fights, but overall it was a good relationship.

But for two months I'm thinking o moving back to my family. My main reasons for doing so are:

1. I would see my family daily. Our family is really close (we all live in the same house which got many flats), so there is an everyday interaction. My Father is the landlord and is always helping everyone, my grandfather is old (80) but still quite in shape. My brother lives with his girlfriend there, they are gonna marry next year. Whenever I go back there, they always celebrate, enjoy the time we have together. But it's not like I want to move back because of celebration, but more because of the everyday life. I want to help my father with the renovations of the flats, be there for my grandparents as they are quite old (my grandfather had been in hospital for some days and I couldn't be there) and go out with my brother and friends as we did before I moved.
2. My current job is not worth the money. The rent for a flat here is quite expensive. At my home town, it's like 1/3. Currently half of my pay is gone because of the flat. The 1/4 for living, making only 1/4 for going out, not a lot to safe for the future. My boyfriend always dreams of a good car, a nice house etc. With the situation here, I will never afford that. Also, one day I want to start my own company, but here I can't get enough savings for that. If I were to live in a flat owned by my father, I would have the half of my pay for savings, so starting my own company would be doable without waiting a lot of years.Also, I can switch to another office near to my home town. So I would not need to look for a new job, just change the office. I would earn the same, but I would pay less rent (and less cost for travel as they have job tickets)
3. I would be able to do what I like in my free time. Currently, I'm mostly watching tv shows or enjoying time with my boyfriend. Which is good and I like that, but I would like to do some stuff for my new company, earn some money in addition and do that. Whenever I want to do that, my boyfriend doesn't like that as I'm not enjoying the time with him.
4. My boyfriend and I have different hobbies, ideals and visions for the future. He wants to have a farm, with animals etc, without any neighbos somewhere. He wants to have kids (soonish) and marry (soonish). I don't want to have kids. I also don't want to marry now. I'd like to start my company and earn some money. I also don't think I'd be happy not living in a city. I like having my friends around with I don't have any where we live now, I like to be with my family.

So with all that, I've decided to move back to my family. My boyfriend would not move with them, as he clearly stated that he doesn't like them (They are all ""false"" and always lie), and if I were to move there it would be without him.

Today, before he makes his way back home, I want to write a message to him saying ""we have to talk when you're at home"". When he is at home, I'd bluntly say that I want to move back to my home town, then I'd wait for his reaction and answer any question he has honestly.

My guess is that he either starts to accuse me of having another boyfriend there (which he does quite often), or he says that I don't love him (I do love him). But I guess, once time passes, we'll be able to talk over it (or I hope).We'd have to talk about the time that is left ( I won't be able to start at the new office the next day, we also live in a flat together he can't afford so I cannot simple move out, he would have to move out etc ... things have to be discusses).

What do you think about this? Should I behave differently towards him? What should I be prepared for?",27Dec2019,1

Thought okay, some people do kiss on the lips but he didn’t do it with anyone else he said goodbye to. The whole time he was making very inappropriate jokes. It was just me and a couple kids but they didn’t see as his back was turned to them. I feel really dirty and upset about what happened, just wondering if this is like a normal thing?",27Dec2019,1
418,"I turned 18 recently and my mother has started recommending movies like The Graduate and Harold and Maude. Both of these movies are about younger guys falling for older women, should I be worried? It may be nothing though, I'm an extremely paranoid person, I just need advice.",27Dec2019,1
419,"I might as for more, but thanks ahead of time!",27Dec2019,1
420,"So this is a throwaway because of the situation;

(TL;DR I think i was sexually abused and taken advantage of for money by a close female friend’s ex, she was mentally, financially and sexually abused, she can’t yet talk about it except with me, and so i don’t know what to do about my anger about the whole situation, because I don’t know if I should talk about it with a therapist since she doesn’t want people to know)

(Also, I know people might think im a complete idiot for financially supporting some girl I dated for a short amount of time, I understand this, and im not asking about whether it’s right or wrong)


So i dated a girl LD for a bit,about 4 months, and things were going good, but some person things happened and i was in a bad place, and due to not knowing how to handle any of it, i became a toxic person and she decided I needed time to sort my stuff out without her, because whenever she tried to help me, I would just lash out at her, and I accept that she made the best choice for the both of us.

Well as i was trying to fix myself, she found someone else, and they started dating and he lived nearby, and he had his own place, but she lives with her mom because her mother has health issues and cannot work, so the only income they have is from the daughter, and the new boyfriend had his own bills so he couldn’t help, and since I had the ability and the funds, I started giving her part of my check to make sure she didn’t end up on the street because I still very much cared for her

We continued to talk over Discord and such and one night she asks me if I could do her a favor, and I accept to find out that she needed me to be the third person in their couple dynamic for a kink they both discovered, and for better or worse I accepted because i was starved for affection since we had broken up, and this continued for a year or so until they broke up, and it apparently was very bad, but I never would have guessed why

As it turned out, he was abusing her financial, mentality and sexually, he had found out that i was helping her by giving her money and he forced her to give it to him so he could control what she could use it for, he forced her to submit to his fetish, and forced her to bring me into it all because he needed another male and I trusted her, but forbidded her from saying anything or he would punish her

after they broke up and she had finally eliminated him from her life entirely, she felt safe enough to tell me what had happened, and she apologized because she felt horrible for having to lie to me and for tricking me into doing something she knew neither one of us wanted to do and for letting him steal all the money i gave her, and the guilt messed her up for a long while, but she still can’t bring herself to talk to anyone else about what happened, and so i don’t know what i am supposed to do because im extremely angry at her ex, because he abused her, stole from her, and I feel like i was sexually abused in a way, but I know it’s probably not to the extent that she was, which is horrifying to me

And so im asking for advice on what to do

(Also if anyone is going to ask, im doing better, she is doing better, we both just have this situation sitting off to the side because I’m waiting for her to be emotionally ready to resolve it, and I also hold nothing against her for anything that has happened)",27Dec2019,1

425,"**TL;DR:** My boyfriend and I opened up our relationship and now he's back together with his ex, who he wants to move in with and get married to, but he and I still want to be together as well. Feeling like his stupid slutty teenage half-girlfriend, don't know what to do?

This July I \[20F\] started dating my now-boyfriend, \[23M\] and immediately we were quite taken with one another. He's a wonderful, wonderful person––sweet, gentle, compassionate, morally astute, caring, generous, curious, kind, and incredibly intelligent. We're extremely attracted to each other, have almost identical politics, find each other very amusing and have really similar senses of humor, really enjoy spending time together, our physical chemistry is *insane,* the sex is *insane,* and we just really really really *like* each other. He'd been pining over me for over a year and makes me feel adored and cared for and desired and beautiful and sexy and my self esteem has never been so high in my life and etc etc. We only hung out twice before he asked me to be his girlfriend, and pretty much immediately he introduced me to his friends and family. We spent practically every day together and normally would have sex for about six to seven hours every day (lol!!!)

Also maybe worth mentioning that this is my very first relationship and before meeting him I'd never even made out with anyone, much less had sex! He's dated a lot, had several serious, long term relationships, and has been having sex since he was 15. He's been extremely conscious of my inexperience and has been so wonderful about taking things slow with me, being considerate, and acknowledging what our disparity in sexual/romantic experience does to our power dynamic. I really couldn't have dreamed of a better first partner.

Pretty early on in our relationship, he told me that he was getting over a breakup with the girl \[27F\] he thought he was going to marry. She had just moved four hours away, and they couldn't make long distance work. Soon I learned that they had only broken up a few days before we went on our first date, and they were still in contact and talking romantically. I told him I wasn't okay with this and it hurt my feelings and he stopped! He's always been very transparent and honest with me (which I so appreciate!!) and he told me that while he *really really really fucking likes me,* he is still in love with her, and would need a lot of time to really get over her. (Once said to me ""I can't wait until I'm less heartbroken so I can give you more love"") :,) But basically, he's been in love with someone else the entire time we've been together.

The deal was that we would only be together for the summer, as I was leaving to go back to school (but returning for the holidays) and neither of us particularly wanted to do long distance. Didn't really work out! When I was at school, we talked on the phone for an hour a day, texted constantly, acted exactly like we were still in a relationship, sexted all the time, etc. By mid-November we realized we were being silly, and decided that we were still in a relationship, but an open one. (Totally fine by me as I am sleeping with someone at school!) I asked that if he was seeing anyone else he not tell me, and he said that if I was he would want to know about it. Without confirming this with him, I assumed that we were each other's primaries and anyone else would come second. (Also I should note that I am *not* polyamorous and I don't think I'm suited to be in an open relationship, but I'm making it work because I want to be with this person and having an open policy is the only way we can do that right now.)

We were talking on the phone a few weeks ago, and I mentioned to him how excited I was to go to the Christmas party he asked me to in October. Went on a whole thing about what dress I wanted to wear for like ten minutes until he told me that he ""couldn't take me anymore"" because he ""asked someone else."" I was really stunned and just said that was okay, but when we hung up I burst into tears and cried for a few hours––I knew he would feel awful knowing I felt awful, so I called him a few days later so we could talk about how him taking another girl on a date while I would be back in town upset me. Then he told me that the girl he was taking was his ex girlfriend, the love of his life, and they'd gotten back together while I was at school. Although he knows he asked me to the party first, if he took me instead he would be ""going public with everyone \[he\] know\[s\] about having two girlfriends,"" and he's just ""not really ready to do that.""

Basically, if he was hard-pressed to use poly terms, he would call her his ""primary,"" and he prioritizes her over me, his ""secondary."" I was devastated to hear this, as I'd conceptualized our arrangement as us being in a relationship and maybe sleeping with other people while distance was an issue. It feels a lot like I've been demoted from his girlfriend to, like, his secret half-girlfriend, which feels pretty terrible, but I think I'm handling it pretty well. We both have an understanding that our relationship is more of a very romantic fling than anything else, but I would still like to feel like he's committed to me for the time we're together. I'm also feeling like a little bit of a home wrecker? Like, knowing that these two people want to spend the rest of their lives together, aren't I getting in the way of something? (He says I am ""absolutely"" not, and it's great to be assured on that, but I can't help but wonder what the point is of him keeping me around.) (However he says his other girlfriend is ""not thrilled"" about this situation either!) (She is fully aware of his and my relationship, and he made it clear to her that we're not just hooking up and this isn't a casual thing––he told her that he and I are in a relationship, albeit one less serious than theirs.)

He has been talking to me noticeably less since we talked about this, and it feels a little bit like I'm being iced out. I've been home for almost a week and we still haven't seen each other, as his other girlfriend is in town and she takes priority. It feels pretty terrible! I feel pretty terrible! I'm trying to be cool about it, as I *do* understand that they're thinking about marriage and it makes sense that he'd prioritize her because he and I are only temporary, but shit still hurts, I still feel disrespected, and I wish he would take me a little more seriously. I miss him so so so much and I really just want to spend time with him. I've been dreaming about reuniting with him for the past four months and I'm beyond excited to see him, but I am still feeling hurt. I want to communicate that I'm feeling hurt by the waning affection and I need more attentiveness/commitment from him, but because I'm his ""secondary"" I feel like I'm not licensed to ask for that, and he'll respond by telling me his other girlfriend comes first and that's that.

I don't think it's at all necessary for us to break up, and neither of us want to. He's assured me several times that I'm not encroaching upon his and his other girlfriend's relationship, which is cool, but yeah, I do feel a little bit like a home wrecker. (Which I shouldn't! I didn't even know about this relationship of theirs until after he and I were already dating! And also I didn't have sex for 20 years!) I feel like he's been a little less affectionate with me lately, which is also hurtful, and I can't help but worry that now that he's back with the girl he's actually serious about, he'll lose feelings for me. He and I have still been talking basically every day and he's told me how excited he is to see me soon, but I'm still feeling pretty insecure/worrisome/upset.

I'm pretty lost here, so any wisdom, insight, advice, or solace will be very appreciated. Thank you so much for reading :)",27Dec2019,1

427,"I've been in a Severe depression for the last few months now. I have Chronic pain and for a lot of this time I've been stuck in bed because it's hard to get out for more than 30 minutes or so without my pain getting unbearable. 

I have tried both regular weekly therapy and an intensive outpatient program. Neither have worked much, I try to take the advice to heart but I just end up too sleepy to do anything. All the advice I get is hard or impossible to put in motion because they don't understand the limitations of what I can do because of pain, no matter what I say. And when I can do something, it doesn't seem to have helped much. Outpatient even said they could not help me much after I had an outburst because of some past trauma.

My physical health is failing too-i used to be relatively healthy a few months ago , now I got some tests done and I have pre-diabetes. I try to eat healthy (when I can eat) but we can't always afford fruits and veg because my mom's on disability and i am unemployed. Lately I have been barely eating at all between long hours of sleep. 

I'm always sad. I have small flashes of happiness but they never last. I have suicidal ideation but it's not something I'd ever follow through with since I need to be here for my mom. 

Outpatient and therapy aren't doing anything. So I'm not sure what to do. I am afraid to go to Inpatient because I am not suicidal or a danger to anyone , and I don't want my family to judge me, which they've already done. 

I don't know what to do, and I don't want this bout of depression to go too far into 2020, because my resolution is to try to find a job that will accommodate me and to sleep less.",27Dec2019,1
428,"Hi all. I’ve had a very weird night so far. Also, I’m on mobile. So sorry in advance, formatting, blah blah..

Background:

I’m a 20 year old female college student studying 3D Animation. I’m more than halfway through the program and I’ve enjoyed it a lot so far. There’s a huge range of areas that you can specialize in the 3D industry, and through my classes, I think I’ve been at least decent in all the areas so far. I really like animating, but I’m also starting to wonder if I like it enough to do it for the rest of my life. I think I could, if I step away from it, but the long hours at school are starting to burn me out. And it’s almost time to finalize my applications for summer internships and I’m stressing out because I feel like I’m nowhere close to being good enough for Pixar or Dreamworks. I found out that my college doesn’t really pump out people in the specific area of the field that I want to go into, and that I’ll probably have to do another two years post-graduation with an online program if I want to get a job. 

When I was a kid I always had a long list of things I wanted to be when I grew up. Marine biologist, doctor, astronaut, etc. But looking back, most of them had to do with law enforcement. Detective, forensic scientist, etc. I wanted to be in the Air Force for a while. I’ve been watching shows like Forensic Files and Dateline since I was in elementary school. I love that stuff. 

I’ve loved art since I was in middle school. I love painting and drawing and embroidery. I was really into theatre and acting and I always wanted to be in movies. I thought that animation was the perfect career choice to mash those together. At the same time though, I’ve always been intrigued with crime and anatomy. I always thought that I’d be an EMT or something in college, but so far I’ve just been working in restaurants. 

Side note, I’ve always been an academic and overly observant. I’m past my core classes in college now and I kind of miss using all the analytical parts of my brain. I love animation, but I also love the feeling of writing reports that I can be proud of and solving equations. I have taken every class I’ve ever had way too seriously. 

ALSO I’m a person who really looks up to authority figures, especially supervisors or teachers. I commit myself to my work and I really enjoy gaining responsibility and climbing the ladder, even at my dumb high school fast food job. This is definitely possible in an animation career, but it’s also a career that could involve a lot of freelancing, which might be difficult because I do have trouble motivating myself sometimes. And I’m awful at social media marketing and branding myself and all that.

Some Rising Action:

I quit my waitressing job a month and a half ago because I thought that I had a different job, but that fell through. Since all of my final projects were coming up and I was in crazy crunch time for school, I delayed getting a new job until after Christmas. I thought about going back, but I hated my restaurant. I do well under stress, but I thought that I might look for jobs where I felt like my stress was at least about something important. When I left work after a very stressful shift at the restaurant, I didn’t feel relieved or glad that I did something that day. I always felt bad. Sure, people got their food and had a good night, but if the stress got to be too much, I never felt like it was worth it. 

I looked for nannying jobs and nursery jobs. I tried to find any sort of medical job that I could do part-time (are candy-stripers still a thing?) or maybe police jobs where I could just do paperwork or something, idk. But holiday shopping was wearing me down and I  couldn’t afford to dance around and consider my options. I got another restaurant job. This one is really fancy and high-end, and I have the chance to make a lot of money. I should be excited, but I’m really not. 

Today: 

Tomorrow is my first official day of training after all the interviews and paperwork and stuff (for the restaurant). And while I was trying to get to sleep, I thought about my old thought about being an EMT in college. I did some research about that. It sounds fun, but I wouldn’t have enough time to build my animation reel for school. I looked into hospital jobs and police jobs. And I saw some listing for the FBI. 

Now, I know what you’re thinking. The FBI isn’t a college job. And it’s not what I’m studying. And it’s so intense and competitive and high-level, there’s no way some art student could just apply and be in the FBI! 

But I read through the requirements and the interview process and the student internship programs. I couldn’t help but think—what if I put in an internship application for the FBI along with my Pixar, Dreamworks, Sony, and other animation internships? If I somehow got it, should I even take it? Would it be totally stupid if I threw away the career I’m trying to build for a career in law enforcement? I’ve been thinking that I know what I want to do with my life for a few years but suddenly I’m questioning it. 

I’d really value all of your advice, Reddit.


TL;DR I made the decision between art and science/law enforcement in high school. I chose art. Now, in college, I’m second guessing myself. Should I try to get an undergrad FBI internship?",27Dec2019,1
429,"I (27F) am finally pulling myself out of years of a depressive state with the help of my partner and I’m finally ready to try to help those I love. Specifically animals, as they’ve been a constant hand in keeping me in this world.

My partner has been a huge force in pushing me up instead of down and after some early morning talks of what I want to do in life, I brought up wanting to help animals and possibly working at a vets office. I’m doing my own research as well, but as someone who has never been to college and honestly has no idea how to start, what would be the first step?

432,"A few years back I had this course in my university called introductory philosophy and that really really changed my life. I started to understand things better. I understood that things are not always bad or good. Its just different. I also learnt about existential crisis. I became nihilistic. Even suicidal. 

I tried to think whether i should proceed. I was held back. A bond held me back. A bond with my parents. I couldn't bring myself to do it. I found a purpose in life. To serve them.

My parents.. both of them are deaf-mute congenitally. They have raised me very nicely and I thank them with everything I can. However it's not enough. During my realisation, I understood that I want to serve them by brining back their hearing. I want them to hear. Hear how sounds sound like. Hear how I play the guitar or the keys. Hear how nature sounds. 

I want to help them but i don't know how. It seems like i have two options.

One is to go and study something relevant and try to do some research and fix the problem myself. If i don't then i keep feeling guilty. I have no idea how to proceed.

Second is to wait for someone else to fix the problem and be rich enough to afford it. 

Now certain other things come into play here. I have lately realized that I feel like I am a fake( don't know if i am.. people have high hopes from me). I suffer from an immense fear of rejection. I crave attention of others massively.  I have mixed goals and don't know what to pursue in short term. And most importantly I can never do anything consistently. Never ever. I start something new and drop it soon after. 

On top of all this my family (other than parents as well) keep trying to force me to get out of my country and settle elsewhere by going for Masters education  and settling eventually. I want to do that but my fear of rejection holds me back from applying. I don't know if its ego or pride or what but if i apply somewhere and can't get there or can't get into a university that i deserve (or my friends think i deserve) .. i just can't think after this. Can't face rejection so run away from it instead. It will be useful for my parents too since my country (india) isn't really that good for differently abled people. I studied from one of the top private institutes and yet I keep feeling like a fake.

I have no clue what I'm doing(I am working in IT right now but wasting my time i feel) and how I should proceed. I just know that I want to help them ultimately. If that is not a goal worth my life then i suppose I shouldn't live anymore. I don't have any other goals. 

TLDR:
My parents are deaf-mute. I set my life's goal to help them get their hearing back. I am suffering from a whole set of other issues as well which are sort of hindering my goals. I want to help them but have no clue how to.

433,"I suspect my best friend is angry/annoyed with me.

This is how it went down:
We went to tge city to party. It was me, my bff (let's call her emily), and bf and two other friends. I am also best friends with this other guy who didnt go with us. We had a taxi booked to drive us to and from the city for which the fare was split among us and pre paid. I spent the whole night with them. But then instead of taking the taxi back home with them i took a lift with my other best friend because we wanted to hang for a bit. 

No she's acting off with me, and every time i ask her if she's okay she avoids the question. I should also mention that before i left with my other bff i asked her multiple times if it's okay and if shed rather i take the taxi with them and meet him some other day.

I dont see an issue with this as she was with her bf and the other friend on the way back. Taxi was paid for so if anything im the one losing money, not them. And the taxi was dropping her straight home. 

I honestly don't get it. Maybe she's just jealous i ""chose"" to go home with my other friend not them. But like when she left us to go have private time with her bf thats somehow okay??",27Dec2019,1

435,"I [26F] married the love of my life this past year. He [34M] has a younger brother [33M] that has had some serious issues in the past. He is the youngest in the family, with two older sisters. 

It started when he was little, about 10 years old or so, and had a brain tumor. It was removed successfully but his hormones were seriously affected. From then on forward, he took hormone supplements and dealt with the aftermath of the surgery. Physical and emotional obviously. 

Fast forward to when I meet my now husband 5 years ago. I find out his brother is still living with his mom, has no friends, never finished school, etc. basically, he had the social capability of a teenage boy who played video games all day, had his mom make him sandwiches, while simultaneously doing his laundry. It’s important to note here that there is nothing wrong with his brain today, and cognitively he is a fully capable individual. (Aka no mental disabilities)

So I lobbied to move him out of his moms house to our city to give him a fresh start. He moves out a few months later (important for later... he moved to an apartment right next to us after asking to move in WITH us. Which my response was a swift hell no. My now-husband and I hadn’t even lived together for a year at that point). 

Today though, I am realizing that as much as he has grown in the last 2-3 years, my husband and I are becoming his parental figures. He’s asking us for permission to do things, asking us to hold his hand through every daily decisions, he mimics our actions without any real critical thinking, etc. it’s driving me mad. I love him but god it’s driving me mad. And my husband can sense it. 

Basically any type of frustration I show to my husband is private gets the response of “you don’t understand, you weren’t there 20+ years ago”. If we have him over for dinner or are visiting with him, any questions I ask that my husband perceive as difficult he will answer for him as if he’s not sitting right in front of me. Literally We will be at the dinner table and my husband from the kitchen kitchen will yell “[BROTHERS NAME] said he couldn’t look up that topic on the internet today. He didn’t have time!”  

And not to make this about me/us (because it really is about helping him... but also helping us) but our very short year marriage is literally falling apart over us not seeing eye to eye on this. We’ve literally gotten into screaming matches where my husband is yelling about how I’m void of empathy for his little brothers situation. And I’m screaming he needs to stop babying him and ruining any potential he has at an adult life. For the life of my i have no idea why this now is such a huge issue when during dating it never really came up. I can only guess it’s because it was never officially my family problem so i was kept out of it. 

Worse, if we go on a trip or are nonresponsive for a few days, the brother starts to tell his actual mom multiple states away and basically tattle on us for not helping him with grocery shopping or something else small/ridiculous (he now lives 45 minutes away from us instead of 5 sooo this is ridiculous in itself. He should be able to pick out his own apples ). I also recently discovered he speaks to his mom about 4-5 times daily on the phone at length. I’m all about mother-son love, but i really think this is stopping him from growing into an adult, Since he always has a hand to hold. It’s like dropping your kid off at college but then sitting in his dorm all daylong while he’s in class.

I am new to dealing with this scenario. I am not in the mental health field. And am seriously struggling... but i think it’s time we get professionals involved. But how how how do I breach that topic without the entire family throwing fireballs at me?",27Dec2019,1

440,"I needed some advice about this because I'm currently panicking and feeling really bad about what just happened.  


About 30 minutes ago at around 1:30AM I was driving my girlfriend home from my house and I failed to yield correctly for an ambulance with its sirens on. I came off of the freeway and onto a green stoplight and made a left turn, but while I was making my turn I heard a siren sound, so I completed the left turn and slowed down. The ambulance appeared behind me and I made a full stop on the left side of the 2 lane road instead of pulling over to the right. The EMT informed me to move to the right, and as I did so, the ambulance didn't start driving for a few seconds and then took off. I dropped my girlfriend off at home, drove home and was not pulled over. I'm currently worried as I keep speculating and assuming the worst scenarios, but I'm assuming that the ambulance didn't take off because they took note of my license plate or something so I could be cited for a ticket.  


My reasoning for why I didn't pull over to the right was because I panicked from the sudden appearance of the ambulance and the best course of action I made in my panicked state was to stop and allow the ambulance to complete the left turn and pass me on the right side of the 2 lane road. I'm aware that I should've simply pulled over to the right as I saw the ambulance but I made the wrong decision. How likely is it for me to get a ticket for this?",27Dec2019,1

444," For  reference, I am in my freshman year of high school.  I have an issue  with feeling that my peers at school look down on me, and/or view me as  stupid.  In middle school, I was often told by peers that I came off as  smart - now that I'm in high school, I have heard this a few different  times again, but I have had incidents with certain peers where I was  left wondering if I come off as unintelligent or incapable of following  what's going on.  Is it something about my physical appearance?  I have a  picture on my profile if that helps.

The  most blatant example I can think of is in my 2nd period class; a boy,  Chello, walked by when I was checking my grades and was shocked to learn  that I have a 4.0 GPA.  He said that he could not ""believe his eyes.""   He was very kind to me later on when we worked together on our interview  project, saying that I'm smart and that he knew I'd be chosen to work  with him, but this was the first incident in the school year that led me  to wonder.

I can think of another  time in Chemistry, when a peer discovered that I had finished the  majority of our worksheet on isotopes and looked at it with skepticism,  as though he couldn't quite believe it himself.  I had a feeling that he  was thinking I couldn't possibly be smart enough to have completed it.   A classmate did butt in to say, ""She's smart"" to his friend while this  was going on, though.

I can't help  but wonder if my low self-esteem and difficulty navigating through  social situations might be leading my peers to think of me in this  light. I don't get this from the adults around me, though.  The adults  usually tell me that I am intelligent, or view me in this light - my  peers never seem to.

447,"ill probably regret this but....
im 29 , female and due to mental health issues and housing instabiloty, have had to share a room with the man biologically responsible for knocking my mom up.

long story short, i fucking hate him. even as a child, he always made me feel uneasy and gave me creepy vibes. my earliest memories at 3 are seeing bikini girl pictures everywhere in the house , yet he never even hugged my mom from what i remember.
he used to give me nasty wet kisses on the cheek and i used to dread that and him hugging me. 
9 years ago i found a bunch of m4m , really explicit adds on craiglist in his browser history by accident (i was buying a bike).
my mom left him 10 years ago. 
he hasnt dated anyone since and gets really really angry when well meaning friends try to set him up a date with a female and he claims to really hate gays. 
he gives off thi sad, creepy, lonely, pedo vibe that my friends have told me as well.

he gets really butthurt because i refuse for him to even touch me, like a hug .

ever since i was a kid i felt this nasty energy coming from his groin area and i feel it even more since sharing space. i try not to be home at all and wont sleep if he is sleeping or stay out all night.

i recently got a kitten and he treats her in a way that triggered alot of bad memories. he will smack her stomach as a drum, hold her up, pretend to ""walk"" on her using two fingers and other things that i remember he would do to ke , as a baby and child that made me feel violated. i only now understand seeing how he treats my kitten.
i keep my kitten away from him as much as possible but then he gets butthurt .
he is very prissy, talking bad about everyone in his life and only brings things up to complain about them and if the conversation doesnt include him or is about him , will cut you off and make it about him.
i fucking hate him. part of me wants to deport him. part of me knows that if the sleep apnea doesnt get him, his wonderfully shitty diet that he is so proud of will kill him.
am i right to feel this way? i have many many things  from early childhood blocked...but i think what is most troubling are the naked newborn pics my parents had in an album, but with my vulva being in focus.
my mom is another nutjob. she would touch down her pants in front of me as she laid on the couch after work, also gave off sexual energy and would pluck my pubes when they first started  growing. .
was i abused? this has been haubting me for 5 years now.

I don’t really know how to get myself to prepare well for the public examination. May I ask what advice could you give me? I really appreciate your time.

458,"I was advised to come here to ask my question, so if this information is not for this recommended page I apologise.

 

I have asked on different sites on what is the best solution for this problem, but I did not receive many helpful answers and many insulting remarks. Before I continue, please do not say to install cameras as we have since the second shooting. We are trying to move, but we lack the money at the moment. We also lack money for a lawyer, and we did call some but we have yet to receive a call back. Beginning 2013 my relatives were harassed by neighbors who began trespassing at first, then began to make numerous death threats for demanding they stay off our property, asked their friends to harass us, then shot my mother's house twice on different dates. No individual involved has not been arrested to this day. Since we did not have cameras then or dependable phones to record all of the incidents, I comprehend why we was met with skepticism at first.

The Police here has not ever assisted us with our cases as we have noticed our reports was missing important information (I had to call the station more than once and ask why), and have been accused of lying and harassing these people. Because of the lack of help from the Police who did not believe our calls, we currently have over ten cases unsolved. Some these tenants are repeated felons, once I learned these people and their friends were doing disturbing actions online (selling weapons when a felon or hosting dog fights) I tried sharing to other people in hopes the viewer would also report them. I contacted the Police after what I found, but the officers I spoke to displayed no interest to help us to investigate the accounts or offer us protection if I did share what was found. The evidence I found online is enough to have these people arrested and should warrant a subpoena, but my relatives warned me to not share what I found publicly since we are not able to move from this subdivision safely. **What is the best solution that me and my family can do to safely resolve this?**",27Dec2019,1

a thc edible after his parents went to sleep. it all went fine but a few days after i was at his house we talked about it over instagram after i told him i was going to smoke and he said i did it too much (which still isn’t very much, as i only have around 10 times). his parents saw the conversation the next day and had a long talk with him. they were not mad at him or me and i was still welcome at his house and they thought no less of me but they thought my parents should know. after around a week of thinking about it they decided they would either tell my parents about it or i have to talk to my parents about it.  my mom and dad are pretty open to drug use as my mom has told me she has had many experiences with numerous drugs so i’m not sure what her reaction to this will be.  should i tell my parents myself or let my friends parents tell them, if i tell them what should i say?

At first I thought I was crazy, we were high-school sweethearts and did cool shit together and we knew each other through and through, but after a while it just wasn't it for me. 

After the messy break up in the beginning, we talked it out and I felt shit about it, but we both were positive this was best way. After making sure we weren't dependant on each other anymore, we went our own way. 

Fast forward, two years:

We both met someone new and life has been good to me. However in the past week, I found out who her new BF is and who his friends are and it gave me an eerie feeling. I knew the group from my clubbing days and know that they are mostly up to bad shit.

She drinks and cannot cope with stress and is constantly tired. I understand how she feels but she unknowingly gets too stressed, takes everything out on us (her children) and will never see what she is doing. It’s so frustrating because since moving out I’ve realised what a damaging effect a mother can have if she is a certain way and I can’t help but see it all the time. She’s very mentally toxic but disguises it with basic parenting. 

I’ve detached as much as I can but I can’t help but empathise for my brother and sister. I know it’s not fair on me mentally but I am used to it but I just worry for my siblings as I can see through her but they can’t. It’s not fair and really frustrating. It’s so hard I feel like I’m living two parallel lives and either one is reflected badly by the other. I get so belittled when I’m home my life feels like a joke and it’s so confusing.

I've been married to my husband for almost 10 years he is very caring and loving toward me most of the time. 

He can be very aggressive to me sometimes tho and I get it because I am sometimes hard to deal with 

He gets impatient sometimes and instead of letting me use the proper rail lift to get from my wheel chair to the bed he will just pick me up which is fine I don't care but sometimes he basically throws me onto the bed and idk just feels a bit degrading I guess 

I can shower myself and half dress myself I only need help with getting my knickers up as I can't pull them up and hold myself up at the same time. 

(I do not expect help from my husband I do have the option for a carer to come in daily and help me but my husband refuses and says he'll do it all) 

When he helps me pull my knickers up he'll be very condescending to me saying things like  ""well you're not wearing these, you can't show your ass off anyway"" and will take them off me and put ones I dident pick on me.. if I ever try to talk back to him and say no I want these ones he'll just get mad and leave me alone in the bathroom and he'll take my phone so I can't call anyone to help me up and it's just humiliating having to be naked struggling to get my underwear up by myself without falling and yeah I get there eventually but it will take me 10 minutes + to get that simple task done. 


When we have sex it's the same he's very degrading. I already can move my legs so he dosent have to hold down my arms. If I tell him I wanna stop he tells me to stop whining and that I can't feel anything anyway so I should just take it. 

I have bruises on my thighs all the time from where he grabs me too tight.. obviously they don't hurt but still they're unsightly 

I talk to him about the way he makes me feel and he just brushes it off says I'm being dramatic and should just deal 

I don't understand what I'm suppose to do. Whenever I stand up for myself he'll just leave! No matter what even if where in bed he'll just leave and take my chair with him so I can't get out of bed until he decides to bring it back 

If I left him I'd need a carer and I'm so terrified of strangers it makes me too anxious to rely on someone I don't know.. 

Also my worst fear is being lonely .. 

Although my husband is a bit abusive ? Idk if that's the right word but sometimes he's really sweet and we talk about stuff and I feel so incredibly happy in those moments I don't want them to go away 

I'm scared if I leave him I'll never find someone else to spend my life with.. someone to love and love me

They stopped talking to each other for several years until they rekindled their relationships some time ago. They usually stay for two days but any time they are here is annoying as fuck. For starters, they are a family of melodramatic, attention seeking people that love to say they have some sort of illness every single time they come here. The wife has had cancer, leukemia, kidney infections, depression and anxiety. The dad also claimed to have cancer and made a big facebook post about it and the daughter ALWAYS seems to have the flu. Their whole time here is filled with them complaining about some sort of illness or pain they're having. Their supposed illnesses are a private joke among my family because of how outrageous they are and how they seem to vanish after a while. Another thing that it's so fucking annoying is the dad and his religious fanaticism.  I truly believe in my heart that he thinks he is some sort of apostle or prophet based on his relentless facebook preaching. One cannot talk to this man before he starts presenting a whole ass essay about his religion. Their whole family is INSUFFERABLE.

She knows that no one in the house likes or enjoys having these people around and yet she keeps inviting them over every single time and I personally got really, really upset because I wanted to enjoy the holiday after our Christmas got ruined by another conflict that happened between us. The more she talked about having them over, the more I got upset and after a while I angrily called my mum selfish, inconsiderate and started spewing my thoughts about the situation on her. This was done over the phone and she promptly hung up. We did not try to talk to each other until she got back from work and by then I made peace with what happened and decided to just forget it. Apparently, she did not and got all worked up, saying that she's thought hard about what happened has decided to not involve herself with us anymore (my sister and I, specifically), that she know understands that we are very cruel to her and it's better for all of us if we do our own thing now. We had another big fight and while I'm still mad about the guests thing, I can't help but feel awful about my mum saying she feels disrespected and does not want to be with us anymore.

495,"Some background on this: pretty dysfunctional family since childhood, I'm now in my 30s. Mum passed 10+ years ago and dad is overseas. I have one older sister and we rarely speak throughout the year. As a sort of routine gesture we see each other before Christmas to choose and exchange Christmas gifts.

I have nothing in common with her and I feel like this once a year meeting is just to prevent us losing contact altogether. Its a weird distant relationship we have. She's the type the just shrugs and doesn't know what gift she'd like from me. So I just end up giving her money in a card. I have one niece that I never see and I do the same with her and her boyfriend.

My sister has a long term partner and he earns double what I do so they are not short of money. I am on my own and have always been financially independent from late teens.

So this Christmas she gave me gifts and I ended up getting her a gift and also giving money in a card, alongside money for my niece, so £90 all in.

I wondered what she'd got me since I'm not really ever asked what I'd like, she just goes and picks something and wraps it up for me

What she got to be honest probably spent £30. This isn't so much about the money spent, but I feel like she knows I will give money so sort of doesn't let me choose and buy a gift. It's annoyed me this year for some reason. We are not close but she is literally my only family and it's sort of hurtful that I feel I have to maintain this strained relationship since its all I have.

498,"We had a bitter fight a week ago, where you told me you feel you come second to my depression and my studies, where you don't even know if I cared for you anymore. We cried, we talked (sort of- you never want to talk and just want to brush it away under the rug named 'whatever') but we hugged it out, and I promised to be better. Every day since, I have actively been the best I can be for you. I've asked you every night if you felt loved and cared for today and with the biggest grin on your face, you said ""I have. Thank you and I love you"".

Christmas day was so beautiful. You were so proud of giving my the best Christmas I ever had. We were so happy.

Today, you woke up making mean comments. That isn't that uncommon; our sense of humour sometimes involves bullying the other (with love though). Three hours later and you still hadn't properly spoken to me, nor said anything nicer to me beyond ""you're ugly"".

I just asked you if you're okay, why you aren't talking to me and why you're making me feel sad.

You said ""I don't know if I love you.""

You put your headphones back on and went back to playing video games.

I asked what you meant and speaking to your monitor you said ""I care for politics, doesn't mean I love it"" and closed the conversation.

I’m good at maths and was recently looking at studying optometry as that consists of maths and physics. 

But I would have to leave my current job which I love. 

I work in a care home (at reception) It’s the best job I’ve ever had and I do not want to leave but I’m thinking for my future - I don’t want to be in a shitty paid job forever. 

My manager spoke to me about possibly studying nursing, I could do this part time (online study) and keep my job until I’m qualified, then she’d promote me to a nurse, which is good pay. Also, nursing is useful no matter where I go. 

I also live right next door to my job and working all hours of the day/night is no problem. 

I have practically zero passion in either subject, and am only considering either for a better salary in future. I do enjoy helping people as I help out with minor tasks in the care home currently but I wouldn’t say I’m amazing at it. Should I go for the nursing even if I’m not passionate about it?",27Dec2019,1

A while back, I (17 F) made a post here talking about my friend (17 M) the same friend I’m going to talk about in this post) commenting on my body, and my body fat rolls. Which made me uncomfortable, since he pointed them out to our friends, and called them cute?
Once, I was wearing a jacket, which had 2 buttons on the chest (unintentionally, they aligned with my breasts, as if they were my nipples)
And my friend said: “Look! You have coin nipples!” In front of our friends.
I let that slide, in sake of not making a scene in public.
Anyway, we were at my house, it was a small gathering with our friends, we were wearing pajamas (I was wearing leggings) and out of the blue, he said: “How weird. Jeremy (friend of ours) has bigger booty than you”
He said that in front of everyone. Again. 
I don’t know what else to do. I’m afraid if I talk to him about this he’ll tell everyone, and use it against me.

511,"# My best friend has been accused of touching a guy's dick at a party we went to together without consent. For some reason, this has completely destroyed me without her knowing and I don't know what to do or think from this point on.

Here are the complicated basics of what happened:

My close friend started dating a guy our group disapproved of and warned her about. She wasn't very happy with our friend group when she started dating him because of what was said, so she started hanging out with her boyfriend's group. She still remained close to me because I was close to them too, even if they were sometimes rude. This is where my best friend comes in. That group always expressed belittlement toward my best friend to me for silly reasons that could always be disputed, this has been happening since last year when my friend had stopped having a thing with one of the guys in that group because mutually it wasn't working and since then they've hated her, and not even because of the thing she had. I haven't told her any of the stuff they've said about her because she's insecure and I don't want to hurt her. My close friend has heard some of this stuff from them as well and reported back to me. She told me that my best friend had been called a rapist and she didn't seem like she was doubting it when she told me. This was a serious accusation and shook me to my core. How could my best friend, the sweetest, most understanding and the person I can't live without, do something like that? Over the next few days, my close friend slowly explained to me what was being said. Basically, when I went to a party with my best friend near the start of the year (still when their group disliked her) and she went off with another guy from their group to somewhere I couldn't find them. Spookily, and unimportant to this story, I believed she was getting raped and frantically was trying to find her at that party to save her, I don't know why, I just felt like I had to. After a while, she and that guy emerged back to the center of the party, smiling. She then told me about her *first sexual experience ever* with him at the back of the house excitedly, and I was happy for her at the time. Turns out that that whole group believes that she did something without consent that night.

According to my close friend, that guy my best friend was with, who she still hasn't met, told his friends that his dick got sucked without his consent, causing them calling her a rapist and such. When my close friend told me this I instantly denied it because I was at the party and they weren't. This was not a good move because I obviously had no way of knowing. I denied it instantly because my close friend is very prone to ""canceling"" people easily and I believed my best friend would never do that because whenever I talked about my sexual assault stories or others she would be completely empathetic. There were a lot of loopholes in this story, such as my best friend told me she only gave him a handjob, not a blowjob, and I highly doubt this would be a lie because she has told me all her sexual experiences since then with detail, but this detail could've just been skewed because it didn't come from the source. After I let this information settle in my head for a bit, I didn't flat out deny it, because it's not my place. My best friend had no idea this was happening though, she didn't know he thought this and whenever she talked about it she always seemed surprised that he decided to go for her (doesn't prove anything but). I just felt anger and confusion. I found it unfair that she literally had no idea.

I convinced my close friend to discuss this situation with my best friend. It needed to be done, what if she did do it and she does it again because she didn't know she did something wrong? Or what if it was completely unfair and they made it up? It is horrible to think if it's true and full empathy for that guy but she needs to know. My close friend eventually agreed to talk to my best friend eventually but she still hasn't. I couldn't hold on to it for too long, so recently I let her know that my close friend has something serious to talk about that includes that group, this caused her to cry and I just feel so much sadness for her. 

I just don't know what to feel or who to trust in this situation. What sent me over the edge is when I caught my close friend feeling sad and asked her what's up. She told me ""I'm okay, I'm just thinking about (guy at party who was with best friend), even though I've never met him"". I don't know why but it's just sent me into complete sadness. I'm so confused I feel deep sorrow for my best friend because I love her so much, but I don't want to disregard an accusation so serious.

Please help me in knowing what to do next, I'm sorry this is so complicated and long, there is much more to the story but that was the vital details. Should I tell my best friend about this or is it not my place? How do I make sure no one gets hurt? I really don't want to hang out with that group again, them bring it up and me to start crying about it.",27Dec2019,1

We’re really good friends, and we’ve never had issues between us, more so than scheduling time together, but is she pushing me away with this comment, trying to be honest with me and wants to continue with this friendship, but is genuinely having difficulty or something entirely different?

518,"I'm 17 (guy) and my girl-cousin is 20, by the way.

The price for two tickets by the way, is 260 dollars (so around 130 dollars for one ticket). This festival however isn't happening until this summer, and I've been thinking of using money I get from student grants, as well as my internship (I go to school three days a week and am at my internship two days a week). I've also been thinking of using my birthday money, as it's very close to the date of the day I'm going to the festival. 

The reason why I want to pay for my cousin is because she is such a special person. She's incredibly ambitious, and sweet. It's like she's my best friend even though I'm not her best friend. But I want to pay for her because I feel like she's probably going to think of me more highly then. And we've never bought each other gifts, we just get money from our aunts when it's our birthdays. I haven't asked her yet, although she went to this festival last summer, so I know there’s at least a bit of a chance she'll go. Although I have several friends, none of them would want to go to the festival, because of one of these reasons:

1.They're not interested (maybe don't care for music that much or they don't like big crowds).

2.They're too poor for the ticket.

3.They would rather spend money on something else.

I feel like I would  be in a really surrealistic dream to go to this festival with my cousin. I imagine that when/if Pearl Jam play ""Black"", I tell her ""holy shit this is the greatest day of my life"".

So how do I convince my parent's that it's OK for me to pay for someone else's ticket? Remember that I will make sure I have enough money for two tickets. With money I get from my student grants and my internship, and the fact that the festival isn't until this summer, I will have more than enough money if I save up. (I get about 200$ a month in total from both student grants and my internship)

TL;DR I really want to go to a music festival with my cousin. I haven't asked her yet, but if she says yes I want to pay for her ticket. My parents told me though I can't pay for anyone else. How do I convince them it's OK for me to pay for someone else's ticket?",27Dec2019,1
519,"Hi. This post will probably be all over the place and a little hard to follow maybe. But I’d really like some help.

It sucks because it could have all been avoided. We snuck around too much, as I was trying to be accommodating and not pressure him into getting to know them too early on. He’s introverted and shy and my family is very very loud, complicated, and crazy. I told him on several occasions that my mom (Fyi I refer to my grandma(62F) as my mom in this scenario bc her and my grandpa raised me, also adopted 3 other younger children who I consider siblings) wasn’t comfortable with him spending time in my room and in our home if he isn’t willing to be somewhat a part of the family, saying hi, hanging out a little. Which I know is understandable and fair. He agreed every time I asked him but we just never got around to really doing things right. I would always sneak him in late so that he could sleep over. I’m at fault for that I feel. He met her briefly on Halloween but that was it.

Fast forward, we’ve been caught 1 too many times. She told him he was not welcome in the home and actually called the police, caused a big scene knocking on the neighbors door and everything. I left that night and went to go stay with him for a while because I thought that was way over the top. I know I’m the one who is wrong but still. 

I’m stupid and in love and let him come over again after that situation. As my luck would have it we got caught within an hour. So needless to say my mom was pretty ducking pissed &amp; roasted both of us. 

Him and I have had some issues the past month or so. Petty immature fights, and we’re both firey and stubborn so they don’t always turn out well. I’ve rage dumped him a few times bc he really can be an ass at times. But I love him regardless and I understand that we’re both still maturing. The worst fight we’ve gotten into was the one that we had last week. He ended up leaving me stranded in the city by myself. I thought I was done, but honestly I do forgive him. He apologized and acknowledged that the situation was entirely his fault and we’ve been better than ever since then.

The problem is, this last fight I feel like was the very last straw. Not for my mom (grandma) but for the rest of my family. It’s to the point where my bio mom threatened to turn my phone off. To where my bio dad is wanting to find my boyfriend and, idk, scare him? I’m not sure:/ I don’t have any friends really, so I share a lot with my mom (grandma) and my bio mom. I confided in them about certain things that may have made me uncomfortable in our relationship and now I feel like they use it against me and him. I feel really dumb for ever even saying anything:/ 

I don’t want to lie to my whole family about being with him, but I don’t want to end it with him either. I’ve done it multiple times and I know that it’s not what I want. I just don’t even know what to do. I don’t want to isolate from my family, I love them to death as well so ugh. What the hell do I do? 

I know long term, the solution is for my boyfriend and I to get our own place. But I’m afraid that me being with him is going to have a permanent strain on my relationship with my family. Do I just say screw their opinions? Do I give it time and try to facilitate something later on where he can meet people and apologize for stuff? I don’t even know. I’m so sad because he is important to me and I know he means well. And I know that the majority of this is my fault. And I was so excited about him meeting them truly:( I just didn’t wanna scare him off. Help me

522,"Let's call her by name ""Anne""

My feelings for her started way back to when we we're still in nursery (we were both 4 years old back then). We were the best of friends in pre school. We were able to understand each others' feelings so well, that we knew how to cheer each other up no matter what was the cause of our sadness. I soon developed a crush on her. Then she suddenly skipped one grade level ahead of me (We were never able to talk to each other ever again, so I never actually knew the reason why she skipped prep.).

I felt very sad and actually fell into clinical depression during prep, she was the only person who I was actually able to understand how I feel, and I lost her.

I moved to another school in first grade (Carrying the sadness of not being with my best friend, with me.). A few months into first grade, and our 1st quarterly examination was already fast approaching. 

The day of our examination has arrived, I was sitting outside our classroom trying my best to study for the test, I dropped my pen, then as I picked up my pen I looked across the hallway into a classroom, in that classroom I saw Anne, I was surprised to see her. After I saw Anne I then thought to myself ""There she is the girl of your dreams. Make her proud."", from that point on I made Anne my motivation and inspiration (I wanted to impress Anne and also notice me). I started to study hard, and was able to ace all my tests from that point on.

Because I made Anne as an inspiration and motivation (and with the hope that she will notice me again) I was able to think clearly and study hard, to the point I was able to compete against other grade levels, and even other schools.

I reached fifth grade I was able to build myself a good reputation (friendly/smart/quiet). My name eventually became so well known in our school, that I thought to myself ""It's time to man up"". 

During lunch time I wrote a love letter, and was able slip it to the table she was always eating on (with the help of a friend.). She read the love letter and had that extreme blush on her face. She then started acting awkwardly and became shy around me. Her and my friends started teasing the both off us when we were near each other. She then became fully shy and quiet. I couldn't get the right timing to try and talk to her again

During dismissal her mother talked to one of my friends (Anne told her mother about the letter.). My friend told me what she said and she was ""impressed and amazed"". I kept on getting better and better on school to try and impress Anne.

I talked to her friends about her grades, and I was shocked to learn about her being really low. I then started to help her indirectly (with the help of her friends). I helped her in many projects and was able to help her start raising her grades (and she didn't even knew it was me helping her, because she thought it was her friends). Her smile was so sweet it was enough to make me happy, after a long time of feeling sad

But...

When I was in highschool I was moved to another school (it was a science highschool, because I really love science and math), and was never able to see her up close again, although I still get to see her, everytime I walk and pass by that school.



TLDR: I really love her and she was the reason why I was able to achieve such things. My feelings for her never had any hindrance. She was the only girl I ever loved. We are now both 14 (10 years since I started falling in love with her). She is really unique, irreplaceable.

525,"Hello. I (22m) have somewhat of a luxury problem. Since I moved country at age 13 I was trying hard to make friends and to be a good friend to them. I didn’t have real friends before and that was all I wanted. Today I have a relatively big circle of close friends, all of whom I love dearly and who I believe (and know) love me back just as much. I also have gotten back together with my girlfriend recently and I obviously love her too. 

Now I’m also in law school (doing quite well), have a part time job (doing well too), and parents who sort of have issues (my mum has strong back pain and sometimes depression, my dad is not as bad but sometimes a bit clueless and drinks too much). My hobbies are tattooing and, most importantly, hanging out with friends. 

So I’m not in high school anymore and at 22 have to be a responsible adult (sort of failing on that part sometimes because these duties like paying bills, arranging phone contracts etc. are not pleasant to me so I tend to push them off. But I’m working on it.) and I’ve been feeling like I don’t have enough time anymore to be as much of a good friend to some of my friends as I would like to be. Like I would like to seem them more and be a bigger part of their life. And I know that some friends already think they’re not as important to me as they used to be. But that’s not true. I tell them that I’m sorry for not having much time and they say it’s fine but I know it hurts some of them. Especially those who don’t have many other friends.

Some of my friends are pretty compatible and we hang out in groups a lot but some of them just don’t really have anything to say to each other. So I want to see them 1:1. I also prefer quality time over just hanging out in large groups. 

I really want to get old with all of my friends. They mean the world to me. I’m not trying to sound like I am co-dependent to an unhealthy extent. I just really love and appreciate my friends. But I also have to keep my life together and I want to see my gf more (she lives 1.5hrs away). And I also need time to myself. I haven’t drawn or tattooed anything in like 2 months. Do you guys have any advice? I know that as we get older we tend to drift apart but I don’t want to be the one to make them feel like I am leaving them. Please tell me how you managed to get old with your friends. In case you are older, do you still feel the same bond with them as you were younger?

I recently got back from a 2 week trip to Japan with my now Fiancée, and brought back some souvenirs for my parents who I [M23] still live with. They were really happy and nice when we got back home and super excited that we got engaged. Just recently though, they got really mad at me saying that I didn't get them anything for Christmas and when I stated that the souvenirs from Japan were their gifts, they said it was just small trinkets/crap and put them all in a pile saying they didn't want it basically. The souvenirs were not anything huge, mainly some keychains, art postcards, a tin of cookies etc but they still said I didn't even get them a Christmas gift. They also gave me as my gift this year, $300 for our vacation and now demand that I give it back to them. My parents are super devote Catholics so hearing them yell and curse at me over not getting them gifts just made everything worse despite the religions belief of not obsessing over materialistic goods. My  fiancée however did the same thing with her family and only got them small souvenirs as their gifts but they didn't get mad at all and accepted the gifts very kindly. 

My fiancée and I were already going to start saving to move out this year together but now I think I'm going to try and move sooner even though we don't have much saved up currently.

530,"IVe currently got so many thoughts in my head I'm terribly confused as to what I should do now. I'm mostly having feelings of shame and anxiety 

I got married 6 months ago to my husband and I feel like he did an entire 180 after getting married and is just the opposite to who I thought he was 😞 

I did love this man but now I'm not so sure. I do know I'm incredibly afraid of him. He is so angry and violent most of the time. Always punching things and screaming when something goes wrong. He's much bigger than I am so I usually go into another room and avoid him when he's like that because I know if he ever tried to hit me or anything I'd have little ways of stopping it 

Last night was the most embarrassing night of my life. He'd been yelling for nearly an hour because he'd thrown the controller at the wall and then it wasent working properly he'd gotten so upset he punched a hole in the kitchen wall. I went to our room to get away from him after he did that and just on our bed listening to him yell. Eventually he stopped yelling and came onto the room to find me when he seen me crying he started yelling at me again I got up off the bed to stand up because I was going to leave the room but when I tried to walk past him he grabbed onto and walked me back up into the corner blocking me from going anywhere. I was actually really scared at that point. I put my hands out so there was space between us and he grabbed hold of both my hands and shoved them back. At that point I was sure he was going to hit me or start beating me or something and I was so scared I accidentally peed myself 

😔I've never done that before I was just really scared of him in that moment. When he seen that I'd peed my pants he kind of calmed down because I think he felt bad. He told me to relax and breathe properly. Because I hadn't even realised I'd been holding my breath 

He helped me into the shower and everything after and was really kind and apologised to me. 

I feel so ashamed and can't believe that happened 😣 

But although my husband is being sweet to me now I know the next time he gets pissed off or angry he will flip out again like he always does. 

I don't understand what made him this way because he was always sweet to me for the two years we were dating before marriage 

Why does he act this way now ? Is it something to do with being married now ? How can I make him go back to the way he was before ?",27Dec2019,1

🔸Me: 29

🔹Sue: when yer birthday?

🔸Me: November 30th

535,"Some quick information about me:
-23 year old guy
-65k annual income (about to rise several thousand plus when I get this pay increase)
-currently in grad school and have over 100k student debt (but will more than likely be making over 100k salary within the next 2 years once I get my Master's degree)
-have been renting a house paying $700/month + utilities for the past 9 months, moving out at the end of March

I'm contemplating whether I should rent another place at the end of March, or if I should just buy one. I live in a city where I can buy a house for 40-50k that will be in better condition than a house I can rent for $900/month.

Seeing as in the past 4 years of college I've already spent enough money on rent to have already paid off a house like that, I'm starting to think maybe it would be better to just buy a house.

There is the possibility of moving within the next 2 years, once I get my Master's degree and move into a much higher paying job (I am a data analyst now and wish to move into a data scientist/machine learning engineering job when I get my Master's, which will generally pay 100k+ even in an entry level position). I would rather stay here and not move away, but if I get a sweet job offer elsewhere then I'll move.

I figure even if I do move, I could probably just rent my house out to my friends if I were to buy one. There are multiple universities in the area, I have a lot of friends still in college and I don't doubt I could easily fill the house with renters that I know in the event that I move out. But if I moved out and had to sell it, I don't feel a $40-50k house is really that big of an anchor. It's basically the price of a new grocery getter sedan.

If I actually bought a house at the end of March, I'd realistically probably be able to put somewhere between 5-10k down on the down payment (I have been putting all my extra cash to student loans and haven't really been saving much for a house up to this point).

I am also generally pretty handy and would likely be fixing any broken things/upgrading things on my house myself to make it nice.

At the start of 2019, I had


A very long-term girlfriend - Ended amicably and are still friends.


A successful business - Lost my main customer through reasons outside my control and haven't been able to pick it up elsewhere.



My best friend - His girlfriend is pretty controlling and doesn't approve of him meeting me for beers at all. He's late 30s, I'm early 30s. I see him once a week and then he's leaving this country in a year or so.



My friends group - Don't even know what happened. I really don't know. We didn't even even meet each other over Christmas. We met once before it. The main sort of person who brings people together is about to have a kid in less than two months and I think that's part of it.




My casual friends group - This fizzled out. I used to be able to call down to that cafe / bar any time I wanted and someone would be there, but people have moved on. I was there earlier and it was empty.



My favourite game - Fell out of love with main big game and the community I was part of. 




I really don't know. I simply cannot comprehend that I started 2019 with so much and it all just slipped away somehow.. Was I the cause of it all, or was it just part of how things go.. Does this always happen but only my relationship and business failing make me realise it..




Such an awful year. The only thing I have left is a job I barely care about 13 hours from my home country which I haven't visited in nearly a decade. There are so many who have it worse, but I tonight have had quite the fucking trip thinking about this.",27Dec2019,1
541,"I'll start off with what happened to my dog. My dog used to go outside to use the bathroom I had just gotten home so I let her out. Then I started hearing crying noises at first I thought it was the neighbors dog being excited but when I heard kids screaming too I went out and saw my dog bleeding screaming in pain. I'll skip most of the gory details, when the neighbors took her to the doctor told us that her back was broken and it would be difficult to do surgery to repair it because of where it was and that she (my dog) wouldn't be able to walk after recovering. In the end my parents and I decided it would be best to put her to sleep because of her age, she also had a heart condition that would make thw surgery more difficult. We were there to watch her as she passed ik it might seem strange but I was relieved when she stopped breathing because even with pain medicine she was still in a lot of pain. All while that was happening the neighbors were in the waiting room and they were sorry that it happened. It's been a little over a month now since that happened and I still can't look at them. 

The neighbors dog was normally outside on a chain before it happened but after they kept him inside. Only let him out when they were at home, recently I haven't seen him at all. I'm still quietly grieving over my dogs death. I catch myself getting out a plate to feed her in the afternoon, looking at her bed because I forget that she's not going to be there and waking up in the night remembering her and what happened. 

The past 2 weeks my grandmother has been bringing up to me that we should get another dog and she's been bringing it up ever since. Whenever she says that it makes me angry inside. This morning my mom told me to come look at some puppies someone was giving away on Facebook. As soon as I saw them it made me sad and angry. I know that they aren't trying to but it just feels like they're trying to replace her (my dog). No dog could ever replace her but I feel like they're trying to drop a dog into that spot. 

I can't even stand the thought of getting another animal. The dog that killed mine was a labrador retriever he was always nice to they're family but he didn't have any social skills when it came to other people or animals. He broke out of their fence and attacked my 12 pound dog. I always thought labradors were supposed to be nice especially with his nice upbringing but he went out of his way to injure my dog and she didn't even fight back.

So in these past couple of months me and my boyfriend (of a bit over a year) have had a rough patch which led to us having disagreements and arguments. I did not like how he was treating me and others and wanted to see a change in his behavior, but nonetheless this is where the big issue arises. Whilst he was away for a week I talked with some close friends, and not him, of how I felt and looked at our relationship and wanted to know if what he did was wrong or right. The biggest problem I realized when I told my friends was that some of my perceptions were incorrect or rather lies to them. Yesterday I talked with my bf, we agreed that we would not break up and during that conversation i was genuine, but when said friends found out about this, they sent him the chat logs i had with them and painted me in a bad light. Now I admit that some of the said claims were incorrect because after the conversation he shed me the truth of how he thought of his actions, agreed and disagreed on some claims and moved on.   
I want to apologize to my hurt friends and boyfriend, to tell them that it was my fault for claiming some things wrong, because I never intended them to turn on him, but they are all turning on me now.

Once, I was wearing a jacket, which had 2 buttons on the chest (unintentionally, they aligned with my breasts, as if they were my nipples)

Most of these embarrassing memories happened between the age of 6 and 18, mostly in elementary school and in high school. Embarrassing things I did online are also up there. These memories involve both me humiliating myself or being humiliated by others. I have bad reaction to these memories. They make me depressed or angry and can distract me for hours. They enter my head at random times when I run into situations that remind me of such events. I mostly just try to suppress these memories. Sometimes it feels like these memories are stains on my body and like other people can see them when they look at me.

I have discussed this with my friends and the advice they always give me is: ""don't worry, these things happen(ed) to everyone"". While this is probably a good approach to take it doesn't really seem to work on me. I really really wist I could just go back in time and undo these memories. I am very photo shy and I always cover my tracks online, mostly to prevent more stupid things from happening. 

It's not like I just can't help doing embarrassing things, it probably doesn't happen more often with me than with other people, it's just that I feel very badly affected when something does happen.

I did wonder about further texting him that I can make it up next week if it is a problem, but don't know if that could further agitated the problem, as I wasn't sure about the tone of his text.

I'm sure it'll come up tomorrow when I am scheduled to work, and am kind of out of touch how I should go about that. It's the first time I've missed a shift (a shift I wasn't even sure I had) since I have begun working anywhere.

I doubt I'll get fired, as I work well and hard, and I don't mind making amends via working extra.
I am mostly worried about how to word and act about it tomorrow.

Any advice would be appreciated.",27Dec2019,1
566,"I haven’t had a relationship with my mother for over 18 years. The long and the short of it is that she was abusive physically and mentally, left my dad for another man when I was 12, and she did a lot of “crazy” things in attempt to gain custody of me and my two other siblings, but thankfully my dad was awarded full custody of us.

Growing up was not easy. I sacrificed a lot of things that I loved as a kid; I had to quit band and swim team in order to help my dad. Because my dad was a single father of three with no assistance from my mother he wasn’t around often. I made most of our dinners. Cleaned the house. Did laundry. Helped with homework. Put them to bed. I essentially ended up being the parent to my younger siblings because my dad worked so much to support us. 

Sacrificing my childhood built up a lot of resentment for the choices my mother made and now she’s dying from stage 4 pancreatic cancer. A family member contacted my siblings and I right before thanksgiving to let us know she had cancer but nothing was fully confirmed at that point. After testing they determined     it was stage 4 pancreatic cancer which had spread to her intestines and lungs. She is not a candidate for surgery because she had heart surgery a little over a year ago that was touch and go that she hadn’t told anyone about. They were going to begin chemotherapy this week, and it sounded like they were going to try to do it aggressively, but last night we received another update that she is opting out of treatment. She doesn’t want to prolong the inevitable and sacrifice whatever quality of life she has left. She’s getting her affairs in order and feels like a weight has been lifted. 

I don’t feel guilty for not really feeling much of anything or for staying distant throughout this last month, but part of me feels very sad for her. I can’t imagine being so alone and your children not being there before you die. 

If you were me, would you reach out? I don’t want to regret this or wish I did something more, but I also don’t want to put myself in a really weird headspace.",27Dec2019,1

568,"Hi all. So around 5 months ago I moved in with my best friend and her girlfriend (who is basically my best friend now too). From here out in going to refer to them as BF (best friend) and BFGF (best friend girl friend). So prior to living with them, I noticed BFGF coughs A LOT. It’s not some light cough either it’s a loud, deep, hoarse cough. I didn’t really think anything of it. BF said she was a smoker prior to them getting together (3 years ago). BFGF quit for my BF. Then BFGF recently had a bout of tonsil stones and has to have her tonsils removed. The coughing seemed to intensify after that. I kept asking my BF why she coughs so much and my BF said it’s a “tick” because she thinks there are more tonsil stones in her throat (?)..Fast forward to July of this year when I move in with them. The previous owners of the house they bought were legit morons and half ass renovated the house and did a shit job. The wall between my bedroom and the bathroom is two pieces of plywood.. no insulation nothing. So any noise in the bathroom I hear in my room (farts, piss, poop, you name it 🙄). So I started noticing BFGF would go to the bathroom for like hours at a time. BF would claim she is pooping but I can literally hear her in there coughing loud as fuck and turns out she’s also puking. BF finally admits she is bulimic. BFGF also tells me she is bulimic. BF will yell at her through the door to stop puking now and BFGF won’t. BFGF claims she’s been this way since high school (she’s 26 now), won’t seek any sort of counseling or therapist, won’t go to the doctor,  nothing. I tell my BF that my sister was bulimic and as a result my sister coughs all the time now too because her esophagus is essentially fucked from all the stomach acid and that’s exactly what is happening to BFGF. BF states there is nothing she can do and essentially ignores the problem. Now obviously I know this is none of my business, but when I’m getting woken up at 445-500 am to the loud ass coughing and barfing and going to brush my teeth in a sink with barf residue it becomes my business. I have made it known to both of them that her coughing wakes me up every morning. BFGF doesn’t care. Continues to do it every single morning. I even bought ear plugs and this kind of works but now I can’t hear my alarm clock with them in and I slept through it this morning. 

I really do not know what to do. I can’t move out. I can afford to live on my own but I’m trying to save for a house and living with them is super cheap and allows me to save. 

BFGF says she is going to get the bathroom renovated and walls redone but I can 100% guarantee I will still be able to hear it. And at the end of the day I care a lot about her and care more about her getting the bulimia under control than me getting woken up. I just don’t feel it is my place to push her to get help, and obviously she needs to WANT to change. 

Any advice is appreciated",27Dec2019,1

572,"So about two months ago I noticed that my Dad (60s) wasn't home when I came back from school. He was gone for 3 days before I actually decided to ask where he was. I learned that he had went to rehab to fight his alcoholism. I felt hurt that he didnt tell me, and I never got a chance to say ""good luck"" or a ""goodbye for now"". I can understand if he felt ashamed of how bad his drinking has gotten, but him just leaving has hurt me way more. I miss him every single day and I get so worried about how he might feel isolated from his world. He is my biggest supporter, and like a best friend to me; and I just feel miserable without him.

574,"TLDR - i’ve started speaking to and hanging out with this boys and have kissed him but i’m having doubts about whether i actually like him. i can’t tell if i’m just scared that he will break my heart, or if i actually just don’t like him all that much. 


hi 17F here, i’ve never been in a relationship nor even been close to one. i recently started talking to this boy and started to like him as soon as we started talking. we met on christmas eve and just hung out at my house for several hours, and kissed at the end of the night. I couldn’t stop thinking about him after he left, and over christmas kept thinking about him too but for some reason i woke up on the 26th with cold feet (not literally but figuratively lmao), he came over again that day and stayed for several hours again, we went to get coffee and i really think i like him but there’s this constant thought in the back of my mind that i don’t actually like him and i’m only doing this because he’s the only boy who seems interested in me for a long while. 

I’m really struggling to put my thoughts into words right now because i don’t even know what i’m thinking. I know i feel comfortable with him, comfortable enough that kissing him doesn’t feel really fucking awkward. I also know that i’m fucking terrified to lose my virginity, especially wo being in a relationship with him but i can’t tell if i’m so scared because i don’t actually like him all that much. I’m conflicted, i don’t know what to do because somethings telling me that i should just stop talking to him, but i know that i shouldn’t because i do really like him.

sorry if this didn’t make sense, not allot is making sense to me right now. i’m really confused about my feelings towards him and my doubts are almost clouding my judgement over my feelings towards him. he makes me happy in the moment and i love being with him in the moment but as soon as he leaves i’m just filled with doubt. even when we were making out i couldn’t tell if it felt right or not. i haven’t eaten in like 24 hours because there’s this pit in my stomach and i can’t tell if it’s because i feel really fucking bad or if it’s because i really like him. 

so this all begs the question, am i in love with him, or do i just love the thought of being in love?",27Dec2019,1

578,"Hi there!
My mom, since I can remember, has been over feeding my sister and me (but not my brother).
You name it, buying us chips and candy and all kinds of junk food, and when we try to eat healthy she teases us for it. 
One thing I’ve been noticing that’s been happening for years is that my mom but a lot of food; things we don’t even need. 
For example, we’d go to a restaurant, and I’d order a salad, and she’s order burgers, even though I said that I didn’t want any burgers. Then, when I finished my salad, she’d say: “Aren’t you eating the burgers? If you don’t, I have no choice but to throw it out. You don’t want any of this to go to waste, so you?” Since she knows I don’t like wasting food we don’t need, I think she guilt trips me into eating.
Even food from the supermarket; she lets them go to waste, even though she knows I hate it.
And when she makes a lot of food, I eat just fine, but that makes room for more leftovers. And since it’s a lot of food, I tell my mom to stop cooking, and we can eat the leftovers, and when there are none left, we can cook more food, and repeat the process.
She doesn’t listen; instead, after a few days, she throws the food out, and tells me that I’m throwing food out, that I’m wasting food, etc.

A few hours ago, I was staying over at my mother's friend's house. She has a daughter, who can be quite rude and violent. Now I have never been a violent person, and have never been in a fight despite being a 16 year old at the time of writing this. We were about to have dinner when this girl (let's call her A) started messing about and throwing random things at me e.g. tennis balls and pillows, and I was busy so I tried asking her to stop so I could focus. She then started pulling my hair, so I started moving into the kitchen from the lounge. A then backed me into a corner and proceeded talk shit whilst pulling my hair and pushing me up against a wall. I didn't want to hurt her physically so I never attempted to push back, (my father was abusive to women and a man I despised, I cant hit this girl) and I thought, she'll tire herself out in a bit.

She then straight up starts to push me against expensive shit like paintings and vases, so I hold her arms away from me and push back since this isn't my house.

She is anorexic and is apparently restrained to a table while they feed her, so this instantly sets her off.

She begins to get even more violent, kicking me in the dick and balls, and trying to push herself against me so that It looks like I'm sexually assaulting her. At this point I'm disgusted by this person I thought I respected, and start pushing her down on to the ground.

His sense of humour is more akin to saying something sarcastic with no wit whatsoever. For example, he missed our Christmas party and another colleague teased him about missing out.

586,"Alright Reddit, moral dilemma affecting the workplace. TL;DR at the bottom. I work for a company that has around 100 employees. The second in commands of two departments have been secretly seeing each other over the past few months. 

Characters:
F2nd : Female second in command of a department. About 30 years old. Boyfriend of multiple years and a young child.
M2nd : Male second in command of another department. About 35 years old. Recently broken up with his girlfriend of 3ish years. They still cohabitate while arrangements are made for one to move. No children together.
Me : Myself and I. I'm higher up than both of the afore mentioned, but I am not their direct report.
M1st : My (secret) partner who is higher up than me, but is not my direct report.

Great, characters established. So F2nd has slept with no more than four men in her entire life. She's a kind soul and has been monogamous up until this point. Her long term boyfriend is an ass who went with her to exactly 0 appointments while she was pregnant and is generally not supportive or respectful of her. M2nd is known to be a fuckboy that never has just one girlfriend. I'm closer with M2nd than F2nd, and couldn't generally care less who he's sleeping around with as a whole. Which brings us to our current situation, which comes down to two main problems:

1) It's impacting their work. Our place of business is busy. They're making eyes with each other on the clock instead of working, and today they finished their shifts and fucked around in M2nd's supervisor's office after hours. (It's a 24 hour establishment and although there is less staff after hours, they're still present.) It's going to start impacting things more, and when (not if, but when) he breaks her heart, it's really going to impact the workplace negatively.

2) He's promising her the world and she's falling head over heals for him... And he has no intentions of her being the only girl for him. How do I know? I tested it. 

M2nd and I have very little in common, but we have a positive working relationship and shoot the shit about our outside lives as well. I got wind of their secret relationship and wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt but cautiously. They would make an awesome couple, and who knows, maybe he changed for her. So what did I do? I got him drunk. Not piss drunk, but past tipsy. This boy got handsy as hell and tried to jump my bones without a second thought. Up until this point, we have been nothing but platonic. He's with her because it's fun and new and exciting, but will drop her in a heartbeat. She deserves better and I don't want her to get her heart broken because M2nd is a lying fuck boy.

So here's where things get complicated. M1st and I have been secretly seeing each other for the better part of six or eight months. He works in another branch of the organization in another state so we do not see each other often. We work professionally together and during working hours, and only spend personal time with each other after hours. There are private spaces to rent as part of the business we work in, and if we are going to spend personal time together at work, we rent a space accordingly.

If either of our employers got word that M1st and I were together, we would be absolutely fucked. I'll spare you the details, but it definitely falls in the 'no' category. I'm pretty sure M2nd would be discrete with my situation if he caught wind of it. 

I want to talk to M2nd with something along the lines of: ""I don't care who you fuck around with, but don't shit where you eat. When you break F2nd's heart, it's going to end poorly and is going to negatively impact the workplace. Stop fucking around and either break it off before things get serious and you cheat, or clean up your act and stop fucking around."" I don't want to call him out for his vehicle being around after hours when mine is occasionally too when M1st has work trips. So Reddit, how do I proceed? I recognize that M2nd breaking F2nd's heart isn't my business or my problem, but having a functioning organization and positive work environment is very much within my job description.

TL;DR : 2nd in commands of two departments of a 100 person organization are in a secret relationship. How do I approach them about it for the benefit of the workplace and her heart without negatively impacting my own workplace secret relationship?",27Dec2019,1

My boyfriend and I are very newly together - it has been about two months. We did get both monogamous and serious relatively quickly. I recently added him to Facebook and clicked on the photo section. He doesn’t post a ton to the site and has had chunks of time where he took a break from all social media for quite a while.

What he does have a lot of, however, are photos of him and an old girlfriend on facebook. This is an ex gf from like five years ago and they are not in contact. The relationship ended badly and he described her as abusive. So I did not think he has any kind of romantic feelings for her, but it really broke my heart to see him and another girl all over each other, in photos for me and all the rest of the world to see.  But, we are both in our thirties and I thought, well, maybe he doesn’t get on FB much.

I told him I was uncomfortable with the ex gf pics. I don’t mind photos that are like, group photos of friends at a party where they both were at or whatever. That’s life. What makes me uncomfortable are photos of them kissing, her sitting on his lap, photos with captions of him gushing over how in love he is, photos of them on dates that look just like ones he has taken me on. I felt not special at all. And I felt jealous for reasons that don’t even feel clear - I get the past is the past, but would you want to see a picture of your partner with your partner’s ex licking his face (this is actually a photo on there)? I was very honest with him and said that I felt stupid even being upset, but that the photos made me cry, I literally cried myself to sleep after seeing them, and I wished he had cared enough about my feelings to have taken them down (again, just the kissy ones and such) before adding me.

He said he would take the photos down. A week passed by and he didn’t. I mentioned later when I saw him scrolling through the app that I hoped those photos were gone bc if not, do not scroll in front of me bc I do not want to accidentally see them. He groaned and said he would delete them. Another week passed by and he did not delete. 

I asked him about it again. He gave a million excuses and finally said ok, I will delete. Which he did, but was clearly not happy about. I asked him why and he said I had basically asked him to erase his past. He said no other girlfriend he had cared about things like this bc they understood that “it’s the past.”

She has become overweight, her personal hygiene is horrible and she has depression (No surprise). She has pretty much given up. Every day is mostly the same. She's only getting worse. Not to mention she once tried to commit suicide by stabbing herself with a knife.

Yes, she went to a therapist, actually she went to a therapist several times.

The group consisted of Me, my best friend, a girl, this new girl from the party and my other male friend. Months pass and I carry on speaking to this new girl, I tell my best mate that I really liked her and wanted to ask her out however my lack of confidence and fear of rejection prevents me from doing so. 

My best mate then starts talking to her and after a few weeks asks her out (knowing full well that I still like her.) The girl says yes. I was very angry at my best mate for going behind my back and asking this girl out. Anyway after a 5 month relationship my best mate breaks up with her at the same time that I’m breaking up with my then girlfriend of two weeks (because of lack of trust and other unrelated issues)

Straight away, and purely out of support for each other the new girl (my best mates ex) and I start messaging again and then after 24hrs of breaking up with our ex’s I was on a date with her and then asked her out (I’m not being used as a rebound because I full on asked her! Because that was what I was worried about). She said yes and it’s a been a month now, I’ve truly never been happier to date the girl that I basically never stopped liking. 

However my best mate isn’t speaking to me and has turned all bar 3 of his friends against me. At a time when I’m supposed to be happy I have never felt so alone. I still have a few friends but have lost trust in so many people.

I’m stuck now because I still want to be friends with my best mate however I don’t want it to have an effect on the relationship with my girlfriend and she’s worried about people hating her, so what can I do?",27Dec2019,1

Now comes the real part,i got a job from my college campus and i am scheduled to start from next year mid Jan.My dad(lol should i even call him that) didn't like the fact that i got a job and is now trying everything to ruin it.He had asked me to vacate the house and take my mom along with me or there will be a ""bloodbath"".We have been in these situations before but now he is trying to jeopardize my career.For the job i have to travel for which i need money and there ain't any.How the hell can i pay for a new home.I still have my final semester exams left to be held on July 2020.I only have 50 dollars with me.I don't have any experience in anything.I am not a smart guy either.I am an introvert and 50% mentally retarded already.If i fail to join the company on time ,my job is gone.

I just want to get rid of him and keep my job and provide a safe place for my mom.After so many years of violence without any help, i am finally asking complete strangers in reddit to give me some advice(lol).My situation is very complex and i would be highly obliged if anyone can give me some advice.Thanks in advance.",27Dec2019,1

Every day it gets harder to get up and by the end of my day I'm so physically and emotionally exhausted I usually just fall asleep until the next day. It's not even that hard a job. It's just that I was doing the same thing for a different company, and that company would sing my praises and tell me I'm a strong candidate for promotion, then pass me over time and time again. I've realized that's a recurring theme in my work life and I dont know, I guess something in me just broke. I cant figure out what's so unpromotable about me. I'm a good worker, I take time to get to know my coworkers, with my last job, I got really good at building relationships with clients, I'm organized, I plan ahead, I can multitask like a mother f*cker, and I care deeply about doing a good job and actively improving myself.

I’ve looked it up on Google but not really found a direct answer as to why this started happening or what it all means.

609,"Before beginning this post, please don’t chide me about acting my age and about how I’m being a brat. I know that’s how I come across and I don’t want to be holding onto this more than a month later but I am and I want to try and figure out how to stop.

A couple of months ago, I (25F) had an outing planned with my friends, couple 1 and couple 2. The whole thing was planned so they could meet my boyfriend (32M). I’ve always been the single friend, which never bothered me before. But I was excited that I wouldn’t have to be the extra wheel. This outing was planned weeks in advance.

Lo and behold, my boyfriend ate something funny and had a few drinks the night before the outing. Leading to food poisoning the day of. I was crushed. And I cried all day. And even on the way to the outing. My friends felt bad and tried to reassure me there would be other times, but there couldn’t be. This was a couple weeks before I moved states for work. I’ll be living cross country for at least a year and we can’t just reschedule.

I even suggested to my boyfriend, how about I come over with some Canada Dry and Gatorade and I cancel with them, which he declined because he didn’t want me to catch any germs. When he was better, I told him how I felt and that I felt so embarrassed at having to fifth wheel and how judged I felt by my friends, who probably thought he was a figment of my imagination (no, they don’t think that, I’m trying to overcome my anxiety about it).

He genuinely felt bad and even apologized when he has nothing to apologize for. And he still does. He never complains when I cry about it even now, more than a month later. He does justify eating the funny food saying he’s never gotten sick off it before. He hasn’t eaten it since then. 

As for the outing, I tried to reschedule another one a month later, but despite it initially looking promising, it didn’t pan out. I’ve been trying to set the ball rolling for after New Years when I have a little bit more time here before moving cross country, but nobody has gotten back to me.

I just don’t know how to let this go and accept that it happened. The rational part of me knows that I’m the only one who cares that I was a fifth wheel and that I’m the only one who was even humiliated by that night. And that my friends do not think that he’s a figment of my imagination. 

I felt especially guilty on Christmas. I was home and we had a nice relaxing day, which I had to ruin by calling him crying about it when I got back to my place. In all this, he’s never gotten frustrated at me. And I know he doesn’t deserve this shit from me. I know that in a year, we may have this outing after all and I’ll look back and wonder why I was so worked up. 

Please, please don’t say in the comments that you hope he leaves me and comes to his senses. I really am trying to come to mine too and stop letting this one incident bother me. I want to be able to figure out how. I can’t see a therapist about it until I move. I will see one soon hopefully after I move. I just want to stop letting this bother me and I want to stop giving him shit for a shitty situation that neither of us had any control over.",27Dec2019,1

I was out for 2 days (it is a narcotic, so I can't get it a day earlier). 

Anyways, I was filling my weekly pill case this morning again and it comes out my mom (59f) took some of my Ritalin, which I use for my ADHD. My mom refuses to believe I have ADHD because ""I'm smart"", so she took it, in her words, ""to focus."" I was horrified and felt truly violated. My mom didn't feel it was a big deal because when I have panic attacks she gives me her valium (which is under her consent). But, I felt just violated. I told her how I felt and that I needed it to get through my life and she didn't. She brushed it off, yet told me to not tell my therapist or psychiatrist. Yet, I felt awful that my mom had taken medication I needed to help myself focus. My dad (58m) also yelled at me and told me it wasn't a big deal, but they are both recovering addicts (cocaine and alcohol). I'm nervous and I feel like some line of trust was broken, not to mention I know how addictive they are (I was worried sick about becoming addicted myself, but I take a really low dose and my physiatrist told me that as long as I take it how I should take it, I would be fine).

621,"I’ve been staying at my boyfriend’s mum’s house for xmas, and it’s been going great. We had one fight wherein he told me he feels like he comes second to my BPD and to my studies. He hates talking things out, preferring to just say whatever and see what happens. I managed to force that fight into a proper conversation, and we worked through it. Every day since I have been trying my best to show him I care and love him. At the end of each day, I’ve asked, “have you felt loved and cared for today?” and every night he has answered “yes, thank you and I love you”.

This morning he woke up grumpy, he called me ugly etc (which is our usual way of affectionately bullying one another) but he didn’t stop. Usually, we bully each other and 10 minutes later we say, “BAMBOOZLED I love u hehe”. There was no bamboozling today. Three hours after waking, I ask him if why he’s making me feel sad, and if he’s okay. He said “I don’t know if I love you. You have some traits similar to my ex.” He refused to talk after that, going back to play video games. I went over to give him a hug from the back and said, “I’m sorry, can we talk and explore what’s going on?” but he pushed me off.

Since we are at his mum’s house, we don’t have rooms or elsewhere to go to give each other space. He asked me to accompany him to the grocers and the little excursion was civil, but not affectionate. On the way back I asked if I can hold his arm. He said no. 

We are back home now, and he’s going out tonight with some friends from his hometown. I don’t know what to do. He doesn’t want to talk, we can’t talk really with his mum around, and I’m just fucking breaking inside. 

We have had our ups and down this year, but we always worked through them and came out together. This time feels different… it feels like he’s shutting off and not letting me in and there’s nothing I can do except watch the relationship disintegrate. 

I love him so much, and it hurts that he won’t talk to me about this. Not talking about an issue is sure to create a sore that festers in his heart until he turns sour, and I don’t want that. My mental health has been really struggling but I have refused to let it taint my relationship, and I'm scared that this will ruin me.

636,"So my coworker discovered around 3 pm that his 100 dollar bill had been stolen. This is in a workplace where everyone leaves there stuff out in the open. I came into my shift around 2:56, clocked in for my 3pm shift and saw this coworker come downstairs. We exchanged hello's, made some short small talk and then I went upstairs. 

A few hours later my manager pulls me aside and explains that they searched everyone's belongings, and only me and one other person had a 100 bill in their bags. They asked me if I stole it and then questioned why I had the money in the first place. I explained to them that I had that $100 because my bf had bought my airpods off of me a few days ago and at that time I didn't have my wallet so I stuck it in my bag (which I forgot about tbh). I'm not a very organized person. I literally had a $20 dollar bill in one pocket. And the $100 in another pocket. 

MY manager didn't really seem convinced and so they explained to me that they would record all of this and continue investigating to see if there's a pattern of theft at my job. I wasn't the only person that was working at that time, but I was the only person who came in that close to 3. But there's no telling if someone else had taken it before I had arrived or whatever. I guess I just feel a bit anxious because I don't want to be incriminated based off of having a hundred dollar bill. I love this job, I am treated well, and have always been kind to others. Is it possible to be fired based off of this one thing alone? If so, is there anything I can do about it? All responses are appreciated. 

TL;DR: someone stole coworkers $100 bill. There was a search conducted and only me and one other person had a $100 bill on them. I didn't steal and have my own personal reasons for having that money on me. But I am scared they may take action against me anyways, what can I do?",27Dec2019,1

638,My current boyfriend and I have been dating for a while but in all honesty I only accepted his date offer because I didn’t want to hurt him by saying no. I decided to give him a chance but he takes things way too fast for me and barely listens to what I have to say and it’s a one sided relationship I shouldn’t have entered. I don’t want to hurt him but i feel like it’s better if I just let him down so he’ll find someone better. Now I don’t know what to do. He’s a nice person but there’s just no love involved and I don’t know how to break up with him or if I even should.,27Dec2019,1
639,"Hi everyone,

Thanks for any help in advance.  To give some background, I have a dog, girlfriend &amp; am a very active person. I just finished an amazing 1 year job as a financial advisor to a biotech company, and am starting my masters studies in January.

I am happy on days I have things to do, on days off I walk my dog (happy for that hour) then go to the gym (happy there) then I cook &amp; clean (happy while doing these) but as SOON as I sit down at my computer/tv to game OR relax I get this feeling like im wasting my life away.

My parents where always hypercritical of not being productive &amp; are still super overachieving people. 

I have a few weeks off before my masters program starts and im not sure what to do. I was SO excited to relax as my job was a bit stressful (but fun) with lots of travel &amp; interesting projects. But now that im here, 2 days in - and my brain is going nuts.

Any advice on how to get over this?",27Dec2019,1
640,"For context: My mom (51 F) has been in an abusive marriage with my dad, up until this summer. I’m a teenage girl (17 F) so we’re bound to have problems.
She has made me feel this way even since I can remember:
For example, asking one of my siblings to give her directions, even though I know those certain directions. Once, I told her that I also knew the directions, she just brushed me off.
Or, for example, she’ll ask my siblings opinions about x things, and she doesn’t ask about my opinions, she hasn’t said
One last example, is that I studied nutrition (it’s an AP class where I live, and my sister also took it. My brother didn’t) and she’ll ask my brother questions about nutrition, when she knows I’m by far more of an expert than him.

646,"This is probably not the right subreddit for this but I needed to let it out. 

I'm a 25 yo female of asian decent living in Toronto. My parents are to put it in kind words dysfunctional. My dad is a professor and my mom teaches at private collages too. But the story to get there is kind of important so here goes, I finished high school and right as I was finishing I was told to apply to universities in Canada so I did and got in. My dad was a professor in a major university in our previous country and I had a spot there but they all wanted to make the move. I chose to cus that was the best for everyone, I had a life there. I had friends, I had a boyfriend, I was finally getting to a place where I thought I was happy. 

In Canada when we first moved it as absolute chaos. It was just my mom, my sister(12yo) and I. My dad was back home sending us money and around this time my grandmother got sick. My mom was devastated. She begged my dad to come so that she could go home and visit her mother and so he wrapped up things and came to Canada without a job. Since they were busy looking for jobs the house was always a mess, my sister was not taken care of and the fights were long. To keep the peace I was FORCED to help out putting my studies on the back burner as all I wanted to do as a young 18 yo was study or hangout with my friends but I was told to go to class, come home, pick up my sister from school, cook and clean. And on days when I didn't do it cus I had homework or was just tired I was gaslighted. I was told I was a disgrace and that the only reason everyone moved here was cus of my education and the least I could do was keep the house clean. And my failing grades obviously did not help. 

After 3 years of struggling to keep my grades afloat, I quit university. I found a retail job and I worked mostly to help with the financial situation of the house and later I learned to build myself as a person. I didn't realize I didn't know who I was until I started working. I had become a shell of a person and a retail job forces you to talk about yourself. It was a blessing in disguise. I worked there for almost 2 years to build myself up and then decided I was strong enough to go back to university.

My parents had found stable jobs by then and so now they had the time to gaslight me all they wanted. Calling me names while all I was trying to do was become my own person. Still throwing the insults that we moved here because of you and you can't even graduate. 

I am currently in my last semester of university, I'm actively looking for jobs in my field. It took my 2012-2020 (8 yrs) to finish my degree and my parents have started to throw this at my face. Everyday, I have to listen to them telling me I'm a disgrace as a daughter and oldest sibling as my sister is following in my footsteps and will probably take 10 years to graduate (she just started university). Yesterday they went through my wallet and found a letter from my boyfriend of 6 years w/o whom I probably would have been long dead and told me to end it and this was not their culture and doing this will make my mom a social pariah (asian + white). I don't hangout with my friends cus my parents dont like it, I dont go to parties, I dont smoke or drink cus my parents dont like it. I dont have sleepovers cus my dad hates sleepovers.

I can't do it anymore and i dont know how to get out. I dont have the money to move out, they dont trust me so anything I say will be held against me. I'm afraid I wont be able to finish my last semester that I worked so hard for. I feel hopeless.",27Dec2019,1

She is never happy about any good news I tell her. Only focus on the negative. Complains. I try to talk about her and listen to her, but it's all bad, and nothings good.

I immediately backed off because I in no way want to intrude on someone’s relationship or make anyone uncomfortable. I apologized to him and said I’ll let him go, to which he replied “all good, ttyl”

Is it too late to start a friendship with this dude or I am oblivious to the fact that he wasn’t even interested in having a friendship in the first place?

660,"TLDR: I need significant life advice and don't have anyone to ask. Who do I ask? Can anyone here lend me help?

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, here is the story:

\- For the past 3 years I've worked in a super toxic work environment. My boss was a narcissist and those closest to him were mean. I did my job and went above and beyond but was generally unappreciated and gossiped about a lot. Leadership were bullies who had favorites. Many of the parents/kids/teachers appreciated me (it was education) but leadership did not. They couldn't fire me because I was a good worker, but there were situations where it really looked like they were trying to find a reason to get rid of me. Little by little, they kept taking away my physical space and resources. They kept putting me in places where I had no choice but to mess up due to their guidance. They left me out of key meetings.

\- I left that job to take care of my sister, who was psychologically and physically sick. I knew coming back up north would not offer a long-term home. Once she got on her feet, it was unsafe for me to stay with her, but my father needed help with her in the moment.

\- I left the job with very little notice to find someone else. I wrote a very warm resignation letter but specifically mentioned that the next person in my role should get their office back and not be taken out of key decisions and meetings. I did that not out of spite, but because I feared the resources fo that position would be cut even more, which would hurt the students. I loved my students so much and loved the work, but not my supervisors.

\- When I left, two things happened. The woman I worked beside started screen-shotting my Facebook posts and personal texts to her, showing admin how crazy I was. I would write about how I missed the students, how sick my sister was and how hard it was up north. How difficult dealing with mental illness was as a caretaker. How hard it is to not be welcomed home but need to take care of people regardless. She screenshotted a fundraiser link I sent her to help raise funds for medical school after a tough life, to help kids. She used that to make a case for me being dangerous and crazy. She got my personal email banned from work. She did not even want me to visit school a few weeks ago, I later found out. They let me visit, but she tried to get security to keep me off campus. She lost her son to suicide two years ago. Clearly this has changed her a lot. This was a person I used to consider very very close. I was never mean to her, but after the loss of her son, things changed very much.

\- Second, most of the leadership has changed this year, so nobody knows who I am - only her stories, and her vendetta. Because of this, I don't have good reviews from that school, at all. There is one leader remaining that I worked with and she does not stick up for me. I am disappointed but not surprised.

\- I do have good references, but they aren't leadership. If potential employers call that job they will say they would not rehire me.

Because of all this, I am not finding work. I had that woman has a reference, not thinking she would be such a monster and that new leadership would give me a poor review based on this.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my options:

Option 1: Stay in New England for 1.5 years and take classes towards a pre-med certificate. I had the idea to apply to med school late in life. I'm already in a pre-med program program. here. Downside is that I don't have many connections up north, it's harder to find work period here, and this location is an every day reminder of how sick and abusive my family is. Can't find work. If that coworker decides to somehow send those screenshots to my family, I would be in even more trouble. I am sick of getting in trouble for people who hurt me.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 2: Move back down south to a new town my friend lives in and try to start a life there. I would give up my schooling, at least for now. I'm 35 so that bears mentioning. I'd be putting my school on hold for at least a year and a half. That friend can introduce me to other friends to find work. There are many universities there. I imagine I'd still get bad reviews from my employer but worst case scenario, I can live out of my car until I find stable work bc it's warm. Can't do this up north - it's too cold in the winter months. I can run down south year round. I can't here. It's too cold. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for any guidance. I don't want to give up this premed program. But I also don't want to live in a place that is cold and psychologically unhealthy. And I have to factor in that I am now getting terrible work reviews, so finding a job will be even trickier. I am scared she will send those screenshots to my family, further creating a rift. They don't want anyone to know about mental illness in our family. My job is not to hide problems but to help with solutions. My family is not like that.",27Dec2019,1

My mom started calling my cat ""Black Bean"" as a nickname very early on. Black Bean over time evolved into ""Little Bean"", ""Beanie Weenie"", and as you may already be suspecting, ""Beaner"" or ""Beaner weiner"". Years ago I realized beaner was a slur, but being a young teen at the time I didn't know what to say.

I've been thinking about it since and every time she says it I feel weird. I don't know how to bring this up to her?? How do I do that, and what should I even say??

Even when he let  me borrow (he even offered to let me keep it) one of his old textbooks  for one of my classes, I wasn’t touched.

In  my second semester, I was confused on a problem many times; Ben sweetly  smiled at me and said, “Don’t worry - we’ll work through this  together!” Another time, I thought I made a bad first impression on  other people on campus; when I reached out to Ben, he smiled at me the  whole time, eagerly declared, “I will be your advocate!” and marched out  the door to help me out; he came up with a solution the very next  morning. Ben’s smiles and dedication touched me - I cried a bit when I  was alone since he was just as kind as Harry.

Mom  also nagged me to let Ben know about my father’s passing, so Ben would  be “inspired” to help me if I ever need him in the future. I held on to  Mom’s words too literally: I wrote Ben a letter. I cried in front of Ben  for a few minutes as he read my letter; he was still gracious towards  me. I didn’t throw away the letter right away since I thought Ben was  very special - I wanted to hold onto this letter which reminded me of  him. Ben made me feel safe and taken care of.

One  week later, I received an email stating Ben would be promoted and move  to a different building on campus. I cried for a few minutes since I was  surprised. After I felt bad he would be farther away from me, I then  cried since we had nothing in common on the surface (even if were were  allowed to date, would he be attracted to me?). I’m now in the phase  where I’m comparing myself to his wife Becky who I never met but looked  up on Google/Facebook - she’s funner, more social, and more  intelligent/academically driven than me. I’m different from Becky.",27Dec2019,1
670,"I'm (f29) not sure what to do, so I'm posting here. My sister (f27) and her boyfriend(m30+) have been dating for less than a year, officially (unofficially she had been involved with him while dating someone else). This person has threatened suicide in the past if my sister left him. He also broke a glass and cut his hand with it while my sister watched. Red fucking flags everywhere. 

In October, I moved to the dorms, and he moved into the apartment (this is when my sister told me of the suicide threat and the glass incident).

I come back home today (December 27th), and I see my sister's room door violently punched in from the inside. I see 3 dents but it could be more. It was punched so hard the paint came off and the wood and the impact shows on the other side.

I have told my sister to leave him in the past. She will not listen. I'm worried this will escalate and something happens to her. What can I do in this situation?

**I'm mobile right now, but I can upload pictures of the door once I go back to my dorm. My dorm lease is ended so I'm moving back in fully by the 31st.",27Dec2019,1

Even yes/no questions like ""are you hungry"" lead to ""we'll eat if you're ready.""

When it comes to sight-seeing, I try to encourage some type of answer by reminding them that we live here and can do anything anytime. Or, I'll plan one thing and say ""pick something out that interests you for after that."" And I still get no opinions or suggestions at all from them.

I am a senior in high school and I have a car so when my boyfriend visits on the weekends I do all the driving. He recently came back for winter break and my parents had a talk that they were upset that I was doing all the driving. My boyfriend takes out loans so doesn’t have the money to afford a car and his parents don’t want him driving their car. He had a car he used this past summer but it is very old and needs repairs that don’t seem worth it because he won’t use it except when he comes back. When he comes back to visit he rides the bus that’s 4 hours (one way, round trip cost $40) because it makes various stops along the way. When I try explaining to my parents that he does a lot of work to come back here and he has come back a lot (for the first 2 months when he went away every weekend and then it was every two weeks). My parents do not listen to me and they say he’s not courting me and that he should find a way to get to my house and not make me drive. They think that he should pay to get this very old car fixed or ask to use his parents car. His parents are very strict about their car and won’t let him use it but my parents are strict and are tired of me driving all over.

I know that I am not special and not the only one going through this, around million people give this exam and to get top colleges people need to be in the top 10%. 

Its not like i hate the subjects I love attending the lectures and learn new things,when the topics are taught i am usually pretty good at it and have topped the class many times but as i am too lazy i dont revise it after few weeks,I never study at home but very good in class and this has cost me.

684,"2018 and early 2019 were great. After years of being single I got into a relationship, got promoted, we moved in together and started planning a life together, then got a better job with more interesting challenges. Life seemed to be getting better and better.

We had our ups and downs with my SO working too much and having little energy for anything else, both of us gaining weight and some dead bedroom stuff resulting in me fighting a lot of insecurities, but we were also best friends and faced everything together. He also changed jobs and things got better.

Now I'm really nearing 30 and I seem to be unable to be satisfied with anything. My SO, my job, my career, my friends... Nothing seems to make me feel good or happy. I kind of just want to leave. I have tons of anxiety. I'm even considering moving to another country!

685,"So I’m turning 16, and I’ve decided to play (American) football for my school this year. If you don’t know how the seasons work, the first semester of school, is when the football games are, and then the second is what we call off-season. Well there is one week left before off-season starts which I’m signed up for, and I have a very annoying slightly serious injury. About three weeks ago I’d say, I was running trying to get into off-season shape, I know the whole point of off-season is to get you into shape but my school is like the high school equivalent to the military lol. Anyways I’m running and when I’m done my calf is hurting like a BITCH, and I’m just thinking it’s sore because I haven’t run like this in so long, I run again the next night and same thing, I’m limping all over the place and it feels terrible, so I stop running, do some research and it seems like I went from out of shape to running miles a day wayyy too fast and strained my calf, now I can’t run, that was three weeks ago and I’m still limping around sometimes. Problem is like I said , off-season starts next week and all we do is run. What can I do ? Do I tell the coach? he might think I’m getting out of running and not like me off the bat, is there anything I can do the make it heal faster? Like home remedies or anything?

692,"Hello! I'm a high-school student that is currently feeling outright down. I hope that I don't come across as too melodramatic, but I just feel overwhelmed right now and need some advice on several points. I can't really talk to my parents since they are kind of closed off emotionally and get angry every time I share sad or anxious feelings with them, and I don't want my friends to think that I'm a \*\*\*\*\*\* with severe emotional problems.

1) My horrible procrastination issues

Right now I have a few unfinished college essays (deadline is 1 Jan, yay). The logical thing would be to type them up, right? But instead, I stress out over every single detail and it feels so hard to know what to write. I have an SAT score within the range of the schools that I'm applying for, but it feels like my horrible personality and lack of originality will nuke my whole application. Perhaps it is better to send in something mediocre than not doing anything at all - but it feels so hard... and then I hate myself because I'm such a big coward that I can't even finish a \*\*\*\*\*\* piece of writing about myself. It's like every time I come to a difficult point, I just... give up? It sounds horrible, but I wander off and just do something less mentally difficult.

2) It is really hard to stay healthy during breaks

My family is not taking any vacations this year, so we're staying at home. Problem? There are so many temptations at home  - I'm not joking. Chocolate boxes, games to play, stupid useless youtube videos and social media... it makes it so hard to focus on actually doing work. My parents won't let me get a gym card, so I'm stuck at home (I've been taking a few walks through, but during the semsters I walk a lot more), but I just feel so cooped up and stir-crazy from the lack of exercise. As a result, I feel so sluggish and unenergetic compared to my usual self, which only exacerbates the whole situation.

3) Uncertainty about the future

I feel like most people have a big passion or something like that, and that I'm the only one to not know what to do in my future. I have wanted to become some kind of academic since I like discovering new things and analyzing but then everyone, including my parents, says that it's like a sea of piranhas and that everyone is unhappy and only cares for publishing papers. I can't help but think that I should have my life better figured out at my age, and that I've wasted so much time on useless stuff like computer games and worrying while people I know are coding companies, doing astronomical research and earning $$$ on the stock market. 

4) Difficult teacher at school

Ok, so this is not really related to what I can do now, but I'm scared for the next term. We have gotten a new teacher in English, and she is a really harsh grader. I got back an essay with the lowest grade that I've ever gotten, and she refuses to give me extra opportunities or advice on how to improve. She just says that I've misused phrases really vaguely and I got so frustrated. 

Thank you for reading through this mountain of text, and well, this is my first Reddit post so I hope that I haven't violated any rules or something like that. I just felt so lost and hopeless, and wanted to write it out and for someone to actually listen.",27Dec2019,1

The only way I can do it is if I whisper which certainly isn't a good solution.

705,"Long story short, I am an online college student who was put in a position where I had to cut off my toxic mother and father. My sisters were taken into foster care last night and I am driving myself rampant about what could be happening to them. And the worst part is that I can’t control what might happen or protect them if something bad happens.....:( And even if they’re safe, I can’t imagine how scared and alone they feel.....😭😭😭😭 

I am currently staying with my grandparents so I can finish school (which will hopefully be next spring). However, I am not overly close with them. I only have two friends but since we are all adults with other responsibilities, it is very hard for us to meet up and hang out. I feel so alone and I have no one to keep me company for this difficult time. The only thing that is keeping me sane is my imagination, my love for cinema, and my Alan Rickman DVD’s. 

What should I do? :(",27Dec2019,1
706,"Growing up, my (31F) mom (65F) was abusive in every sense of the word. Aside from the abuse, she also manipulated those around her to get money, which she then spent on McDonald's food and cigarettes. If someone brought food to our house, she would pick through it and complain. When I started working as a teenager, she took my paychecks. That's just surface material.

As an adult, since she is unable to abuse my brother (28M) and I in the same ways she used to, she now uses manipulation. She was recently diagnosed with stage III lung cancer. Naively, I did everything I could to help. She is a hoarder, and my brother and I cleaned her apartment before starting chemo. She told everyone I stole from her. When chemo started, I gave her rides to and from, as well as getting groceries for her and lunch during chemo days. As soon as I would finish one errand, she would say ""well I need this, too,"" and keep me running literally all day. While getting her groceries, she rarely had money to cover the entire cost and so I would cover it, thinking ""It's my mom, she has cancer, she doesn't have food."" She never once acknowledged I did that for her or said thank you. Come to find out, she had people getting food for her, too, and she had food at home that she was just letting rot in her refrigerator. My brother signed her up for Meals on Wheels and she would just let the meals sit out on her table and go bad, then when people would come over she would tell them she has no food and no help. 

As chemo goes on, she obviously becomes weaker. I am a nurse, however, and I know my mom, and I know that she is exaggerating her weakness. I know this because, when I tell her to cut it out, she gets mad and all of a sudden regains her strength. She ended up with an infection on her hand and in the hospital, where she told therapy that she couldn't walk. The ended up putting her in a nursing home. At this point, she refuses to even use her walker and instead uses a wheelchair to get around. She never even told the nursing home she HAS a walker. 

Anyway, that's all back story. My problem with this is that I have her brother and friend down my back constantly. When she was at home, she told him that I don't help. My uncle (her brother) would text me and ask why I don't help her more. Repeatedly. Not only do I work full time, go to school full time and am pregnant, frankly, I don't WANT to help her. Now that she's in the nursing home, my mom told him that I haven't come to see her at all. I was the only one that visited her in the hospital and I visit her once a week in the nursing home. Her ""friend"" asks why I haven't been over to clean her apartment for her. 

I am honestly at my wits end. My ENTIRE life she has spewed crap about me to our family members. Things that aren't even true. Anything to make her out to be a victim. Even as children, she would tell them we ""trashed her house,"" when in reality, she's a disgusting hoarder. I am so close to just cutting ties with her. I gave her Christmas gifts and she never said thank you. She looked at half of it, said ""that'll work"" and put it aside. Nothing pleases her. And I think you have to be a special shit human being to use a cancer diagnosis to get things from people. I honestly think she views having cancer as the best thing that's ever happened to her. People bring her whatever she wants, and nobody wants to call out someone with a cancer diagnosis. 

As a nurse, I am one of the first people to try to make amends so that they don't regret it later. But I'm at the point where I honestly don't believe I will regret it. I don't want to expose my soon-to-be child to her. I don't want anything more to do with her. I know that this diagnosis is a terminal diagnosis, as she has stopped doing chemo (the doctor won't provide chemo while she's in a nursing home.) I just want to know if anyone has had a similar situation, where you cut off a toxic family member, and didn't regret it? I really don't know how else to find peace.",27Dec2019,1
707,"At first, sorry for my english, it is not my first language, I will try my best to explain this situation right.

So when I was 15 I used to flirt with boys a lot. I used to do ""sexting"", sending nudes, ocassionaly blowjob or one night stand. This was cause of childhood issues with my father who did not give me proper love, He did not showed me single emotion and he used to push me away when I tried to hug him. I did those things because I felt loved atleast for a moment.

I kept those things as a secret. No one knew about it. When I realized how those things were hurting me, I stoped, learned self love and self respect. One year of focusing on myself went through and I found a really sweet and good boyfriend. He is great emotional support, helps me in everything and he always cares about me. When we were together about 7 months, I told him about my history and all those things that happend. At first he understood it very well and even gave me a hug. Few weeks passed by and I noticed that he started developing some trust issues about me. Today he told me that he still thinks that I have this ""fake mask"" on and deep inside I am still that hoe as I was in the past. Because of all those things that happend, I developed somekind of aversion towards sex so we do not have sex very often, usually once in two weeks so I dont understand why does he think that I am still a hoe when my libido is not high anyways. I do not text with other boys, I do not talk to other boys, NOTHING. It really hurts me when he thinks that people can not change and they stay the same. Because I know people can change, I did change, I healed my inner child, my inner wounds and my emotions. I developed spiritualy. He all knows that, but he is still insecure and it drives me mad. Is there a way I can convince him that I am not like that anymore? We had a long talk about it, he doesnt believe me.",27Dec2019,1

709,"This is my first post for advice. I (39F) and my ex husband (47M) have been divorced for 8 years. We have a 9 y/o daughter together and we have a really incredible relationship. We co-parent really well, and always try to help each other when needed.
When we divorced we agreed to put our daughter first and give her the best life possible. 
To explain our closeness is if people meet us together for the first time at an event if my daughters they think we are together. We have no sexual chemistry whatsoever we just care for each other as friends. 
He does pay me child support because our daughter is with me more than him and he is terrible with managing money so this was a way to make sure her needs are taken care of. I make all money decisions for her because I pay for everything. 
Here is where I need advice. Over 2 years ago he got into a car accident. A pickup truck had tons of junk in the back and it fell out and caused a 4 car pile up. It smashed the front of his car, but it was still driveable. It looked and sounded terrible and not all the doors would open after the accident. It caused me great concern for him to drive our daughter in this car. The whole issue has been hung up in the legal system and he’s not received a dime for the repairs. He says that he can’t afford the repairs until he gets compensated. 
He had started dating someone and they seemed very serious. She seems like a good person and he said that he saw them together long term. (In our divorce decree we have a clause of not living with anyone else unless engaged, to prevent turnover of people in her life) I asked him if I approved to let that go and he could live with his gf, would he be able to save to get a newer, not trashed car?
He said yes and was so happy.
So they bought a house 🤦‍♀️ I thought they would get an apartment. I was so confused by this. Then he told me he invested all his money into the house and now for the past year has been house poor.
I was very disappointed by this because the point was for him to save money for a newer vehicle. His car has 229k miles on it and looks like trash. He picked us up at the airport today and I thought the hood was going to fly off and smash the windshield. 
I know that if I express my frustration on this he will get upset and I want to keep our relationship friendly. But I am very concerned about him driving with our daughter in the car. I need advice on how to handle. 
A side note is that he has ALWAYS been terrible with his money, when we were married I helped him get out of debt on his own by showing him how to manage his finances, he was so grateful for his credit score to buy the house and thanked me, but I am not his wife, nor do I want to be again and help him figure this out, but damn it’s frustrating!",27Dec2019,1

715,"Hi I’m 18f and I recently used a dating site and matched up with a guy and we’ve been talking since. He asked if I wanted to meet up sometime and I said yes. Since I’m in college, I’m on winter break until Jan 6, but I won’t even be back in my hometown (where my college is) until Jan 1. He lives like an hour away and I’m hoping he’ll drive to my town since he has a car. I can drive, but when I’m home, my mom keeps my brother and I on a tight leash when it comes to some things. My brother is 17 and has snuck out before, gone places with people my mom doesn’t know (but are from his high school), and done other such things, and she doesn’t seem to mind. However, she’s extremely overprotective of me even when I’m at the dorms. She is especially freaked out about meeting people online. For example, when I told her I was applying to be an ONLINE tutor, she was saying “we” need to make sure it’s legit and not just a creep. I told her I’m an adult and can handle it, and she calmed down after a bit. She also doesn’t let me take Uber (even when I’m with friends) unless she and my stepdad make sure they’re legit. She has Life360 on me and while I’ve “snuck” out of my dorm before, I wouldn’t be able to get away with being out of the house with Life 360 off. (By “snuck” out of my dorm I mean I went somewhere I’d only be able to get to by Uber, but turned Life360 off so she just thought I was at my dorm). Basically, even though she bugs me while I’m at college, I can get away with a lot that I can’t get away with at home. 
So the issue is, I’d probably have to wait around 15-20 days to meet up with this guy unless I can go out with him before break ends. Considering my mom is so paranoid about meeting people online, even if through a reputable service, should I lie to her about where I’m going, about how I met this guy, or should I tell her the truth and potentially face her being upset? What I mean is I could tell here I’m going to town to hang out with my high school friends, or I could tell her I’m going out with a guy from a different college that I’ve been talking to but lie and say I met him through a friend or something, or I could tell her I met this guy online and am meeting up with him but I’ll be safe. And if I tell her the truth and she says she doesn’t want me doing that, should I just go anyway? After all, I am 18 and she stresses since I’m an adult, I don’t have to do or go anywhere I don’t want to (mostly when talking about my dad). And when I told my dad I wanted to visit my friends on the other side of the country this summer but I didn’t think my mom would let me, he said I’m an adult and can do whatever I want. 
It’s worth noting that regardless of when I meet this guy, I’ll be going to the meetup place by myself, have FaceTimed him beforehand, pick a public place, and bring my mace.
Any advice is appreciated! Thank you for reading 😅",27Dec2019,1

So I'm in a bit of a pickle here. I'm currently a full-time college student with a full-time job. It wasn't an issue, as most of my classes were in the morning and I would have some time in between work and school. I live about 30 minutes away from my job, so it was a bit of a hassle. This spring, I'm going to be transferring from a community college to a university, and I'll be living on campus. This university is about 15 minutes away from my job, so it's a bit easier. The issue is, some of my friends and family have been trying to get me to quit and get a part-time job so that I can enjoy living on campus and making new friends. My parents are very generous and are always  offering  to assist any way that they can as long as I keep a part-time job. I hate needing my parents to pay for things, and it's bad enough that they've been helping with my student loans. The last thing I want to do is rely on them for money, hence the full-time job. But at the same time I realize that I've really been putting all of my friends off because of work, and if they weren't so close with my family I don't know if they'd still be around.

Another one of my friends who is good friends with my friend, let’s call her Friend A, claims and told me that Friend A told her she would never in 1000 years date this person, but she has also told me that his guy has been trying to hook up with Friend A and another friend, which he failed with the other friend. Us 3 have life360 because I guess we are good friends and trust each other and i noticed her driving to his house again today. While I have asked her about her intentions, she always promises me that he is just a friend, but this person at school has a reputation of being a “player” i guess you could say and I get very bad feelings from him. When i asked my friend what she was doing today she just said “hanging out with people”.

I guess what i’m asking is, because i can’t do much today, (unless i text her what she is doing there which would be crazy imo, what do you guys think?) is how could i get my mind off this to pass the day because i might be hanging out with her tomorrow.

TLDR: Is it okay to call out parents who let their children be a nuisance in public?

I was in a shop arcade (narrow undercover walkway) waiting for a store to open in the morning yesterday. While I was waiting, there were two kids probably age 5 playing catch with a frisbee.  This wasn't one of those light floaty frisbees but more like a hard solid plastic discus. It was heavy/solid enough to the point where it doesn't actually 'float' when thrown but just dropped.
These young kids as expected for their age, were so uncoordinated and were throwing this thing back and forth to each other in a very erratic way. This pretty solid chunk of plastic was being thrown left, right and centre, indoors in a narrow corridor, in what was a busy public thoroughfare with other shops that had merchandise set up in front, with no parental supervision that I could see...
So at first I was just giving looks of disapproval at these kids wondering where their parents were.. what if someone was hit with this flying object or what if private property was damaged? Then I was hit in the leg by a stray throw. One of the kids came to pick up the toy and I basically gave her a look that said stop. They went outside to play for a bit then after a few minutes they came back inside and I was hit in the head... If these weren't kids I would have lost it. I kicked the toy back to them and they ran off with their tails between their legs. No parents were to be seen and no apology was given. The parents were either completely unaware that their children were being a nuisance or didn't see me being hit was a problem.
Anyway, I was talking to a friend shortly after and I said that if the parents were there, I would have gone and told them to do a better job disciplining their children and keeping them in line, and that as things were, they were doing poorly. I understand that the kids weren't to blame since they didn't know better but I felt like the parents were irresponsible and inconsiderate to have let their children do that sort of thing in a public space. There was potential for someone to be hurt or property to be damaged... This friend then says me saying this would be condescending and disrepectful to the parents? Is it? Should you call out crap for what it is, or is how parents teach or discipline their children now untouchable? If the latter is true I feel like society has taken a nose dive...",27Dec2019,1

I'd rather just text it because that way there's a written copy and I'm hardly home to begin with). I'm pretty irritated at my current housing situation for the lack of structure and waiting this long to disclose this kind of information/needs/wants. Are these some reasonable things for me to ask for?

* Quiet hours between 9 AM - 9 PM. No laundry during quiet hours. 
* Have a chore list and everyone rotates weeks. There's 5 total people living there. Two couples and me. We'd rotate taking the bins to the curb and cleaning the bathroom and hallways every week.   
* I don't feel comfortable cleaning the kitchen (I clean my dishes after I cook and I can offer to chlorox the counters after I make a big meal) or the living room because I don't use it ever. I make an actual meal like once a week. 
* Communal items: Toilet paper is reasonable we can rotate. For dish soap, sink soap, they said to use theirs because there is no room for my stuff if they ask me to pitch in I'm going to just buy my own and ask for at least one drawer in the common area (no more for my dishes, bathroom stuff I have to use a caddy like I'm a freshmen it's disgusting). 
* I want a room lock. My room currently doesn't have one. 
* Laundry days. Everyone is regulated to doing their laundry on a specific day. Or at the very least a rule for laundry that's been sitting in the machine. 

I also want some advice on how to not be so irritable towards them. I live a very busy life so if it isn't penciled in my planner it's not happening. When I first moved in I asked about chore wheels, communal items, space heaters, the fact that I have to wear heels to work and there's really no way around them stomping.

Today some shit went down and I took my break to make a few phone calls.  I cried because it was bad.  I pulled myself together and came inside.  I was ordering lunch and she tells me she doesn't know how I'm going to be able to work here, I need it leave my stuff out there. She can't fix me. and I need to figure it out.

Every thing else is in emails except these lovely little pep talks.  How do I handle this?",27Dec2019,1
744,"MORE INFO ADDED 

Background: my bf (21) and i (19) have been dating about a year and a half. I go to college an hour away from home. I met some new friends in my classes.  My bf has lost his so called “privileges” due to past things that have happened that involved him messaging other girls to meet up (multiple times), signing up for dating websites, etc. I’ve never shown any sign or interest in cheating. 

So a guy from one of my classes asked if I wanted to go to a basketball game over Christmas break and meet a couple people there. I texted my bf and asked if he cared if I went to a game with some people from school. He replied with yeah idc. Didn’t ask me any other questions. So the guy picked me up and we went to the game and met 2 other people there (a boy and a girl who were mutual friends of him). Felt slightly uncomfortable but wasn’t going to let it ruin the night. The seats were in rows of 2 so I sat by the guy who drove and and the other 2 sat behind.  The guy knew I had a bf, didn’t try to do anything, never touched me or anything. We’re friends and that’s it. after the game he asked if I wanted to go to the bar I said no and he drove me home. 

I’ve never given any indication to my bf about cheating on him nor would I ever. I love him more than anything and he’s always indicated he trusts my judgement. But he’s upset that I would get in a car with another guy and sit next to him during the game. He thinks I should have called him to come pick me up once I knew the seating arrangements. He’s saying I disrespected him. I never even once thought about cheating. I’m naïve when it comes to guys hitting on me because I don’t care about anyone else only my bf hence why I’m dating him. 

I can see how he is mad about me going with another guy but I didn’t know the seating arrangements or anything like that. He also didn’t ask questions and he always said he trusts me. I thought it was going to a basketball games with friends and having fun. 

And the night I came home from it he didn’t really say anything so I told him it was good and he waited two days to bring it up and ask what I did. Then he got mad. Stating I practically went on a double date and that I’m disrespectful.",27Dec2019,1

748,"I’m 16 now. Last year, I went to therapy. My mom got it free with her benefits from work, and it helped me a lot to talk to someone who knows what they are talking about. I was diagnosed with anxiety, but never got around to the depression because of how my sessions got cut short since we couldn’t afford it anymore. I’ve now been struggling with depression, some days it’s better, some days it’s worse. It’s triggered really easily also. My dad believes that my reason for being mopey and an asshole is because of the influence of my friends. The worse thing I’ve done with my friends was snuck out to go to my girlfriends house. She makes me happy and I never get to see her since my dad doesn’t trust me. I used to smoke weed and do other drugs, but have been quit over half a year now. I’m sorry that this story is all over the place but my dad won’t let me spend the night at my friends house since he thinks we are going to do something bad I guess.

At least I took pictures but I feel like a complete idiot. Before you slash on me for being so irresponsible please hear me out. At the moment I was going through a moment where I was getting basically threats and that’s why what happened, happened. Still, it’s no excuse but that’s what was happening prior.

750,"Firstly, I’m a university student so I’m away for half the year. The few friends I have left, I was at school with, and live 5-15 miles away from my home address. The only time I can ever see them is if we agree to meet up.

I have anger issues, trust issues, and attachment issues. I am not self-pitying, but I realise that I have become a sort of burden. I am not a skilled conversationalist, and can come across as a bit boring. I am also prone to outbursts of anger, despite my efforts to control them. I depend very heavily on my friends for happiness. I have always preferred living alone, and would like to take time away to enjoy my own company, as well as releasing my friends of the encumberment I have become. 

My plan is to stop using my social media and messaging as of New Year’s Day. I’m not massively involved with any of them (I probably have 5 friends from home - one of whom is living slightly further away now - and 2 at university), so I don’t think they’ll be very worried. I don’t want to tell them I’m going away NOT because I am cowardly, but because I fear they will talk me round. I think it would just make it even harder, and I would like to spare us all some inarticulate and bumbling speech.

He's always worrying about his appearance, hair, smell, clothing, weight, personality, social skills, etc, etc. I've tried to talk him out of it, but my efforts have been to no avail. Recently, he's taken interest in a girl in one of our classes (Grade 11). The problem is, he has severe trouble talking to her without doubting himself. I've tried to convince him to just act normal, but he'll say no and then freshen up his breath, spend 20+ minutes in the school bathroom straightening his hair and then reapply an unnecessary amount of expensive cologne. Then he'll talk to her for about five minutes and come back overthinking it like hell. My theories are that his parents gave him these insecurities by being too strict and demanding. From what I've heard, his parents are apache attack helicopters over his life and watch his every move. He has to tell his parents two weeks in advance if he wants to make plans with a friend and isn't allowed to workout (his dad says it will stunt his growth), play video games or do anything else that a normal teenager would do. One time he came over to my house, I started blasting music and he became all scared. I asked him why and he said it was because he thought my parents would come in and yell at us. Additionally, I've noticed he does periodic checks outside my window when he comes over in order to be ready as soon as his parents arrive to pick him up. I've tried telling him to talk to his parents, don't care about what others think and just act natural but nothing seems to be working. Is there any thing I should know about helping someone with these insecurities?

755,"I'm currently a freshman in college who is double-majoring in Anthropology and Classics. I have this whole career path planned out that I thought I was passionate about: finish my undergrad at my state school, get a master's degree from some prestigious out-of-state university, find work as an archaeologist or museum curator, die happy. However, I've recently begun to come to terms with the fact that I REALLY do not want to go into massive amounts of student loan debt for a degree in a field with little to no job security, and I also I don't want a degree that will keep me stuck a couple of millennia in the past for the rest of my life. The ancient Romans weren't even that great, they wiped their asses with a communal sponge on a stick for god's sake.

Lately, I've felt myself being drawn to disciplines like Chemistry and Biology. Degrees in scientific fields are not only currently in high demand, but they also offer their students tickets into the exploration of new frontiers of human knowledge. The possibilities that a more STEM-based major would offer me have begun to seem far more appealing than the trajectory I'm currently on.

So why don't I just switch majors? I haven't even begun my second semester of school yet, I have my whole life ahead of me, what do I have to lose? The main thing holding me back is my fear of failure. I know that to switch majors from humanities to science would mean a heavier workload and more difficult course material, and as someone who has in the past shied away from taking AP Science classes, I am terrified of being academically left in the dust by my peers. In high school, I naturally excelled in literature, history, and art classes, which caused me to completely lose interest in math and science classes that didn't come as easily. As my friends took advanced physics, calculus, biology, etc, my low self-esteem and fear of failure dissuaded me from doing the same.

Since then, I've become more comfortable with my identity and my little role in the universe, and I've been able to recognize with more clarity what I want to get out of life. So my main question for anyone out there reading this is: Is it too late for me, a person with objectively no background in science, to make the switch to a science major? Or am I entirely overthinking this situation? Should I just be a philosophy major and move to the woods? Should I drop out entirely and launch a radical environmental protection movement? Sorry for this strange, disjointed rant. If anyone has experienced a similar internal crisis I'd love to hear how you dealt with it, or how you think I should deal with my own.",27Dec2019,1

757,"So recently I've gone through a rough patch in life and eating doesn't come easy. I haven't been too concerned because I was about 70 lbs overweight (now 30ish) I also have lost most appetite besides some social interactions where I'll get a burger. It's been about 3 weeks since everything started but one thing though to keep me peppy and awake during the day is I've been drinking 2-3 servings of gfuel daily. Sometimes (every three to four days) I have whey protein powder with water.

My questions:
Long term risks?
Short term risks?
Better alternatives?


This is a serious question aswell, I have enough trouble getting motivated for food and plus I enjoy not having dishes to worry about so the gfuel has been an easy alternative. I don't plan on doing this forever and I personally compare this to a fast.

758,"How do I condense everything into a title haha. 

I will start first with my bereavement. I lost my Grandma (through adoption) in October, 4 days after my 24th birthday. She was very close to me growing up, she got dementia and lost her battle 10 years later. My birthday is a very triggering time of year for me, full of a lot of pain from growing up in foster care and having parents who do not care about it so this was the cherry on top of a painful week. I then lost my biological Grandma's partner whom I very much enjoyed the company of, he gave me great advice, was very warm and lovely and made every hike we all did together an interesting one with all his tales. This was so sudden and very traumatic for my grandma, I supported her the best I can. Then two weeks ago, my partner of 6 year's Grandpa died. The whole family is devastated as you can imagine. On top of these losses, I have quite a fear of dying. In the past, I have had to go to counselling over it as it is a very real and consuming fear of mine. I saw my partner's grandpa's dead body and this has been quite traumatic for me. I lost these three amazing humans each month, 13th October, 1st November, 14th December. I felt like I haven't had time to grieve for any of them. 

In regards to feeling overwhelmed, well it is pretty obvious why but on top of the deaths, I have a very mentally unwell mother (through adoption). She is verbally abusive to me, makes me frightened to do anything in the house and makes my life very complicated and difficult. It is a secret life. None of the family knows what she does, how she abuses me, the mind games she plays. The only people who know are my partner, my neighbours and my friend. She has been particularly cruel to me for the last three/four months. She suffers from Paranoia, OCD (with cleaning and with thoughts about people being against her) and she is undiagnosed but she has very similar symptoms to BPD. She doesn't take her meds at the moment. 

In September, I decided to talk to my biological parents. The reason is quite complex but simply put, they were harassing other biological family members after I chose to include them in my life. I have formed quite the bond and my parents started harassing these people in order to destroy our relationships. I rang them and simply asked if they respect my choices and space and left my family alone. I don't think I have quite worked through the emotions this may have bought up. These people physically, mentally, sexually abused me for four years. They neglected my care and have been the reason for why I was in foster care and then adopted by my unwell adopted mother and emotionally unavailable adopted father. 

Finally, I am doing a masters in International Relations in order to enter into human rights work. Due to everything that has happened during this first term, I haven't done well at all and I have two assignments due that I just haven't done. I think I am going to be pushed to quit. I have asked for help and no one has been answering my emails. I'm sure people have been in similarly overwhelming situations and know that your concentration and motivation fly out the window. I guess I need some feeling of support from a collection of people that this would be the right decision. That I can make it in this world without the qualification. I'm terrified to enter the adult world. I feel like it will eat me up. I have several learning difficulties and not even my retail job is sympathetic towards that. 

TL:DR ... I've lost three people in three months, have a mentally unwell adoptive mother, been in contact with my biological parents which has messed me up and now I think I may have to quit my masters and join the adult world.",27Dec2019,1
759,"Tl;dr: 18, going to college next year, hate living at home and sharing a room with my sister, want to move but overprotecive mom doesn't want to hear it - what do I do?

I'm from southern Europe where the average age for moving out forever is 32. I'm in the capital city which is where all the good colleges are, meaning I either leave the country, or continue living at home for at least another 5 years.

Now I'm very independent and love traveling, and my mom is a bit of a helicopter parent. She doesn't forbid me from doing teenage things, but she asks lots of questions and thinks of me as the innocent kid because I'm her youngest, so I still have to be very careful with what she finds out in order not to hurt her.

Brother and sister are 22 and 23, both living at home, and I share a room with my sister. I hate this for many reasons, for one I find it very difficult to fall asleep because of anxiety/insomnia so I end up sleeping late on days off. My sister is pretty inconsiderate and very loud. In the mornings around 7-8 she almost always wakes me up which fucks up my sleep schedule even more. I try asking her to be quieter but she just says ""you should be up anyways"" and mom is on her side. I've tried numerous times to explain how hard it is for me to fall asleep as I sometimes lay down at midnight and fall asleep at 7 am, but they just say I need to get my shit together.

Another thing is because sister is older I basically don't have a say in anything that goes on in my room. My computer that I paid for is in my brother's room because my sister doesn't like the way it looks, and I'm not allowed to be in my brother's room while he's home. Somehow this is fair even though we have to share a room and he has his own room.

If you couldn't tell already, I hate living at home. However my mom is really panicky and protective of her children. She let me go for a year abroad at 16 but it took 5 years of convincing, and when I mentioned college abroad she got really mad and offended that I want to leave after just having got back 6 months ago.

Should I move out, go study abroad, or just suck it up and stay?",27Dec2019,1

I wanna give out a couple of small, simple gifts to some family members (the ages range from 10-50). I don't really know what they like, so I'm wondering what type of gift would be suitable for anyone, regardless of their preferences. 

The first thing that came to mind was stuff like some fancy chocolates/desserts, it's as simple and inoffensive as it gets, and everyone loves some expensive sweets. As for the kids, well, as long as it's chocolate they're at least somewhat content.

So like, last year, I started dating this AMAZING girl. Now to preface this, I’ve never been in a relationship Before this due to 1 being unattractive and weird innit, and 2 I have serious commitment issues. To anything. 

So, month of dating and we’re going to homecoming.

This is the night where I will make the mistake that will haunt me the rest of my days.

To cut it straight to the point I, I messed up. I left her, I partied with the “popular” kids. Then, I saw one of the girls who I found out liked me sitting on the bench alone. I felt bad for her. We talked and then I kissed her on the cheek. Holy fuck how that would ruin the next 3 months of my life. 

We broke up because of that night, and for the next 3 months everyone hated me. I wanted the hate, I deserved it. I wanted to feel so bad about what I did I asked people to call me a bad person, people who were my friends. I was in the darkest place I’ve ever been. Contemplated suicide but never could.

A few months later, we become friend again. Holy shit I was so happy. We become better friends, and now, a year later, we’re the best of friends and I help her with anything and everything and vice versa. I see her everyday in my classes.

Now throughout this year long period, I’ve “dated” other girls. And because of the commitment issues, none of them lasted longer than a week or 2.  But I’ve come to realize it’s not just my commitment issues holding me back. It’s that I still love her. 

I think about her everyday, wishing I could change that night, wishing I could do anything. I’ve loved her ever since I left her.

I’ve been extremely depressed these last few days thinking about it, because I really want to try again with her because I’ve never met anyone as amazing and... yeah, amazing as her, in any aspect. So, my question comes to this:

Do I tell her how I really feel about her and ask for forgiveness, and if I get rejected risk losing the friendship? 

Do I keep my feelings secret and hold on to this friendship?

The 23rd i left decorated cookies on drying racks to dry because some of them had a lot of frosting and had to dry longer than others. Christmas eve comes along and my mom is slamming doors and comes in my room yelling at me to wake up. She was in a bad mood and was taking it out on me. She yelled at me saying i didnt clean the kitchen when i had been so dutiful about making sure it was spotless and then yelled at me to clean the floor. I got on my hands and knees and srubbed the floor. My mom came by and i could tell she was looking for dirt when there was none. She yelled at me for not cleaning the kitchen table and i tried to tell her that i hadnt been able to because i just put the cookies away, she started to mock me. I yelled at her to let me talk and threw my wet sponge at her. I called her a fucking bitch and walked out. I was gone for 14 hours and didnt return until well past 1 Christmas morning. Christmas morning (930) she came into my room and coldly told me to get up because we were opening presents and thats all we spoke to eachother on Christmas.

765,"Hello everyone. I'm very new to the reddit community.

To start things off. I'm considering ending a friendship with a girl I knew for three year. Here's some context.

I'm   20 years old and in my second year of college. I knew this girl for   three years. For privacy sakes, we'll call her Sam. Me and Sam knew each   other since I was in Grade 11 and she was a grade below me. At the   time, I started to develop feelings, I brushed them off at the time   because I wanted to be a good friend to her. Over a year after I met   her, I told her how I feel towards her. She saw me as a friend. At the   time I was okay with it, because I really enjoyed her company. So we   continued being friends. A year later she tells me she likes a guy. But I   know this guy, he isn't kind at all and he causes destruction to the   girls he with. I told Sam what I thought about this guy, she told me   that my opinion doesn't matter. The relation ship lasted a month because   its high school. I'm also wondering if it was petty of me to bring the   last part up because it was just high school.

Anyways,   time goes on and she is now in college. We rarely talk unfortunately.   But when I did talk to her, I really enjoyed it. So about a month ago I   told her how I felt and she still sees me as a friend. I respect her  choice because I can't force her to like me and that we are human. Time  goes on, and I ask her if she wants to go hangout. I texted her and she   didn't answer. So I thought that was strange. Over that time, I started   to really review our friendship. I was always the one that texted  first  and tried to make plans to hangout. So last night, I asked her to  call  me when she has a couple minutes. I discussed about the feelings I  have  towards our friendship. She kind of brushed them off but realized  it was  very one-sided. I thought I could get some closure to see how I  can  better myself for the future, and when I meet another girl in my  life.  It seemed like she did not react well to that. She asked if I was  trying  to make her jealous. Those were not my intentions, I did lose  the crush  feeling I had towards her. One last thing to mention about  the phone conversation is that she thinks I'm a very kind person, a hard  worker and someone that cares about the people around me. This all  seems very misleading. I posted this on the relationship advice  subreddit.

Thank  you guys for  reading this. I'm more than happy to answer your questions.  I just want  to know what steps I should take next.",27Dec2019,1
767,"My mom lied to me about having ovarian cancer about 4 years ago. I was a freshman in college at the time and it sent me into a deep depression for awhile. Since then, she has continually tried to buy me by showering me with gifts and money. Throughout my life she has always been a pathological liar and a bit of a narcissist. She was a model when I was a kid and pretty much drilled it into my head that looks were more important than anything. Thankfully my dad is the complete opposite of her and I’ve lived with him since I was about 14.

I’ve tried to forgive her and have some sort of relationship, but I can’t get over the detail that she put into the lie. She would call me pretending to be in the hospital and speak in a sickly voice. Then she would tell me she had to get off the phone because there was a nurse coming in. I eventually caught her and demanded the names of her doctors and the hospitals that she stayed at. She eventually admitted that she made the whole thing up because she felt like I wasn’t calling her enough or paying enough attention. I was a freshman in college taking 15 hours and pledging a fraternity at the time so she knew I was busy.

I try to talk to her, but I constantly go back to those old feelings and it just pisses me off. For some reason I couldn’t come up with the motivation to text her back on Christmas which has lead to me thinking about this. Should I just cut her off? It’s obvious I can never trust her again and I truly believe I got all my negative traits from her and all of my positive traits from my dad. I just feel like it’s a chore everytime i have to speak to her or spend time with her. It sucks because growing up we had a great relationship. She was honestly more of a friend than a mom and I really loved being around her. It just hasn’t been the same since that happened and I don’t think it ever will be.

769,"I have two weddings that I have committed to being in. One happened two years ago during their engagement and the mentioning of it not happening till 2020 when the groom was out of med-school was thrown around. I am friends with both grooms of the wedding and we have talked about their wedding multiple times as the 2020 year approaches. I have known both people in this wedding party for seven years and have been part of multiple life events. Which includes work events, birthday parties, family weddings, family baby showers and productions shows (which the other groom produces). I committed to being in their wedding but without a date. 

During this period of two years in waiting. I met another friend in grad school. We are in the same school program and see each other twice a week which is more often than the other couple that I have known for longer. We have now been friends for one and a half years and she too asked me to be in her wedding which right off the bat told me it would be on Halloween 2020. This may be my fault but at the time I thought there was no way these weddings would end up on the same date. (I say that now but honestly I didn’t even think of the other wedding because It just didn’t even seem like a probability). Since then I have looked through bridesmaids dresses with her, helped her pick out her wedding dress and done wedding formalities till now. I also only know the bride well. The groom is sweet but we are not close on a deeper basis. 

Yesterday I received a package in the mail with all things I need for the first wedding (the two grooms) and formalities of it being on Halloween 2020 as well. I feel very stuck because I committed to being in the first wedding first, however I committed the date to second wedding first. This may in a weird way be my fault but how do I choose which one to go to and how do I break the news?

I am making a pros and cons list but I honestly know I’m going to upset someone and I don’t know how to have a conversation about it yet. 

TLDR: Made commitments to being in two different weddings without being given dates and now they are on the same date, what do I do?",27Dec2019,1

775,"When I started escorting 3 or 4 years ago my ex-boyfriend told my sister since I wrongfully hid this from him for 3 months before we broke up. My sister and I talked about this and she saw my ""fancy"" incall, knows I work during the day, doesn't see many clients, is drug-free, etc. Somewhere between sharing this she developed what seems like jealousy and since both of us moving out around this time we lost touch but every time we did hang out I would try my best to be nice and keep a good relationship. Recently, I've been happy because I met originally a client who became my boyfriend. We don't see each other all the time but it works because he knows my situation and that I'm in school.

I went to my cousin's birthday party recently with my sister. I lost some weight after taking Dexedrine for ADHD medication and would never recommend taking drugs without a prescription but mentioned this since we were on the topic that she wanted to lose weight. Again, this was just something I mentioned and told her not to take unless she felt she had ADHD. She went and told my mom about this along with me being an escort. She hasn't confronted me on escorting but she keeps starting arguments and it's become draining. I'm also getting subtle bullying from my sister and other family members.

I won't make this long but basically my sister, mom and I have not been getting along and I made the choice to take a break. I am going to change my number. My question is how do you handle family members who aren't accepting of what you do? I'm very disappointed, to be honest as my sister knows I'm going to school and I think she is jealous. I wish her and my mom would judge me based on my character and not the stigma. I've also been heavily screening my clients as they need to share personal information before booking.

This is just an example, he is just a bit of narcissist. The last time they all came round a couple years ago it ended with a boozy boxing match in my back garden in which someones nose was broken (he loves boxing)

They said they would cover everything since it happened on their time and under their watch. I quit the team during my exit interview after the season because I decided that was the last surgery I was going to get for a long time if I could help it. Now the trainer that all our information and bills go through for the surgery costs is not responding and we've scanned and sent many bills to him and no response.

786,"I get a pretty generous amount of PTO (paid time-off) each year. Problem is, any time I try to use it, I basically have to either ""get my work done *in advance*"" (which usually amounts to working extra anyways), or I'm left having to do work while I'm on vacation.

Now, technically they are willing to refund my PTO if I document what projects I was working on and for how long. Generally speaking, they don't allow out-of-office work, but if it's an emergency, they'll sometimes allow you to if you request in advance.

Well it's sort of difficult to document my time working, because I started working sometimes around 9pm Monday, and then... just sort of kept dozing off while trying to work. I finally decided to *actually* go to sleep sometime around 4am Tuesday morning, woke up by 11am, and continued working a few more hours.

Now, I've been getting texts today asking to have things taken care of remotely, and I've been putting in a solid 3 hours so far.

The shitty thing is, this work wouldn't take that long if I were at my office. But I'm not; I'm at a laptop while ""visiting"" my dad, trying to make due with one monitor and no mouse (incredibly difficult circumstances), not to mention the strain of *trying* to remain focused.

It's enough that I'm genuinely finding myself *pissed off"" with my job. This happened last month, too, where even when I tried to work ahead, I wound up having to work over Thanksgiving break.

Really not sure how to handle the situation.

Part of me just wants to approach upper management (which includes both the VP and the President of the company) and just say, moving forward, when I put in my PTO, I would like it known that I will not be doing *any* work while I am out, unless it is a legitimate emergency. My ""day-to-day tasks"" would *not* qualify as an emergency, and so either someone else in my department takes that responsibility in my absence, then it's simply not going to get done. I do my best to work ahead, but when *other* people cause my work projects to slow down, that I'm no going to ""work extra"" simply because others couldn't get projects to be on-time.

That, or just say ""I want to be able to work remotely for up to a month at a time, so that I can justify spending the money to set up an 'office' any time I travel"". So instead of taking PTO for a week and *also* having to work out of the office, that I would just work out of office for like 3-4 weeks, maintaining my normal business hours but without it costing me any PTO.",27Dec2019,1

Today we went looking for a vehicle for him so he can get a higher paying job outside of our small town.  We got lucky and found an old pickup. The guy said he’d help finance and would accept a $400 down payment. We were really happy about this. 

My boyfriend called his insurance to see about getting the car licensed and the insurance lady told him some bad news. 

His totaled car has been sitting in the lot for a over a month and we are just now finding out that his insurance doesn’t cover it like we were originally told it would. 

So now we owe the towing company $1,000. My boyfriend desperately needs a car for work though. I’ve been driving him but my hours have changed so I won’t be able to any longer. 

We applied for a loan to pay the towing company. But my boyfriend is really stressed right now. 

We’ll have the loan bill to pay, the new truck, and our current living situation. We both make $10 an hour working 40 hours a week. We were supposed to be able to move out by the end of January but I’m worried we won’t have the money saved for it with these new bills. We’d have nowhere to go. Neither of us have family that would take us in temporarily. 

We do have a friend who’d let us stay with them but the rent for the room would be $100 more than what we’re paying for our shitty situation now. I feel like we’re stuck. We’re losing money in the house we currently are in and with these bills on top of it, I’m worried it’s just going to get worse.

795,"Sorry for the long post 

So yeah, bit of a weird topic but I'm kinda freaking out here.

So backstory: My gf and I have been together 8 months now. We've had a weird and, to be quite honest, stressful relationship up till now. 

See I met her fresh out a divorce. So, I wasn't able to be there the way I should have. But, god bless her soul, she stayed with me anyways and has really helped me along. I am much better, and indeed I'm not depressed really at all.

The other thing that happened was she suddenly started having a severe and unknown medical condition that scared her a lot. So after doctors and er visits, she finally gets an answer, and the answer scares her even more. (Luckily it wasn't that but still). Her response, and understandably so, was to distance herself from everything and kinda try to control it and think. As such I was pushed to the periphery, which I get. I still tried to be as supportive as I could, and I'd say I succeeded. However, during this pretty much 2 1/2 month process, we've not had sex once. Cuddles and kissing? Yes. But no sex. Again, I understood it then, and I'm not complaining, Im just setting the scene.

The last thing is I'm a horny bastard who is a dom and likes BDSM. Well, sex started to decline (before the medical stuff) and I wondered why. This led to a large argument where I found out that apperently my dirty talking and desire for sex made her feel like she was just meat to me. Like I only wanted her for the pleasure, nothing else. Now, this couldn't be farther from the truth. I like BDSM because it opens up vulnerabilities and primal desires, and you trust each other with that side of you. I like that, and view it as very romantic, but she clearly didn't. So, I tried to express that but failed and from then on it was basically missionary with occasional doggy, up until the medical events.

So cut to now. Things are better. She's a lot happier and is being more herself, and she recently spent the hollidays with her family and she got some cool gifts and the like. So she's doing a lot better. 

I can feel the sex coming around the corner. I know it's probably gonna happen, but I need to talk to her about this because I am just not satisfied with vanilla sex. I need BDSM and dirty, rough sex, especially after such a long hiatus. I need the dirty talk and the name calling. It's just who I am. But I feel paralyzed because of that statement she made. I don't want to turn her off from sex entirely by making her disgusted with it due to my prevertedness, but I want and desire these things and I only want them with her because I love her. However, I'm not sure how to tell her this.

So, women of reddit, what would be a good way to begin this conversation? 

Tldr: I am a horny and perverted bastard and I view raunchy BDSM as romantic, but I have no idea how to express that to my gf.",27Dec2019,1

Our parents are not home. I called her close friend and they told me to bring my sister to their house so she won't be lonely. I told her about what happened when she returned from the market and she did was cry and sob. 

She did not yell at me or said any hateful thing to me. I brought her to the friend's house and her friend told me to stay too. I told her that i am worried because my sister did not yell at me or blame me and she said that its because my sister understands my intentions were not as such.

We have the exact same job. We have the same work ethic and attitude around the work place. Although I am part-time and she is full-time, I still have to work every stat-holiday and weekend, and I will have worked 22 days this month.  Plus I don’t even get paid time and half for working on holidays. 

In my employee review, my boss didn’t have anything bad to say about me. For more detail, this newer girl just turned 18, has no higher education, and doesn’t even want to go into the field that our job is in (we’re vet’s assistants at an animal hospital). But for me, this is the career path that I want to follow and go to school for. I already have 2 years of my bachelor of science and am entering the vet tech program next year. 

When she got the raise, she told everyone about it and I felt pretty crappy. I haven’t done anything wrong, I work hard here, and I don’t understand why she got a higher raise after only THREE months of being here.

It all started with my brother telling a story about work that my fiancé didn't like. She ended up calling him names (something along the lines of calling him a sociopath). My brother storms out of our house and after a few hours my fiancé realising she shouldn't have called him names apologizes. My brother then calls her a hypocrite and adds more fuel to the fire. They are both very stubborn people and will stick to their guns.

The main issue is we were supposed to all go on a friend vacation together end of December (my brother has not purchased a ticket yet). My fiancé is no longer comfortable with him going anymore and asked (without my knowledge) him not to  go (something I thought was very innapropriate) which again adds more fuel to the fire.

It is now too late for my brother to purchase a ticket so an apology and asking him to come again is kind of out of the question ( I don't think my fiancé is open to that anyways).

This situation makes me feel like I need to pick a side because of the way it transpired, which I don't think I can do. 

Is there any advice you guys can offer up to help them mend the relationship? Just time? Who do you feel is in the wrong here?",27Dec2019,1
807,"A little back story:
I live in an apartment complex in a downstairs unit in Arizona. Downstairs units don’t have a designated porch area, but upstairs units have balconies. 
Someone recently moved into an upstairs unit near us and they have a dog. They feed him, walk him, play with him (good dog parents for the most part) but they leave him either chained to their balcony fence or locked in a crate on the balcony. I have never seen the dog go inside. 
The crate has a bed (that the dog has taken almost all of the stuffing out of at this point) and they cover it with a blanket at all times. 
Now, it doesn’t get cold enough to snow where we are but it definitely hits the 40’s and sometimes 30’s this time of year, and I honestly don’t want to find out how this dog fares in our over 100 degree weather. 
My question is should I talk to the owners myself, speak to our complex management and see what they will do about it, or should I just call animal care and have them do a check on the dog? 
I’m not one for confrontation but it’s only been getting colder and they still leave him on the balcony and it just breaks my heart",27Dec2019,1

They are never doing anything for the company and cut people’s pay without any warning. I’m talking the day before payday told everyone they are no longer on salary affective immediately.
In the long run I would love to start up my own business but since my boss has so much power in the industry I’m afraid if I branch off on my own they will make sure I fail since I’m no longer with them.  It’s all very petty and I feel so stuck.",27Dec2019,1

810,"Alcohol is everywhere, in every household in every place, everyone drinks and its a social norm. Im 20 years old and I have an alcoholic mother, I was in a 3 year long physically abusive relationship with someone who drinks. My whole life I have demonized alcohol, and in trying to accept alcohol consumption I even tried drinking and joining people because I heard ""if you cant beat them, join them"" and that just lead to self hatred and disgust. I havent had a sip of alcohol in over 5 years and Its getting harder and harder to accept seeing people around me drink. I lash out at people and cry and isolate myself when they drink around me even though theyre not violent or mean spirited when they drink. Im in a relationship with an amazing guy and I was with him and his family this christmas, and of course everyone wanted to have some wine or beer, I ended up locking myself in the bathroom and crying not wanting to talk to everyone. They know the issues I have but everyone believes I need to just accept it and I cant. Ive tried therapy as well and therapy is how I found the root of the problem, but I cant seem to find a way to deal with it. When my boyfriends breath smells like beer I refuse to kiss him or hug him or anything. I refuse to talk to people who are drinking. I wont go into clubs or bars anymore. I just keep running but I cant run from it. Is there anything I can do? 
Does anyone have a similar issue? How do I escape from this and accept that I cant stop people from drinking? How can I become okay with it? Im so sick of the gut wrenching feeling I get when people drink. Im so sick of it.",27Dec2019,1

812,"I see this sub even has the suicide prevention hotline.  Great.  It's useless though.  I've been through three psychiatrist, five therapists, tried a whole range of medications, been ""talked to"" so many times.  None of it does anything. 

I'm just a college dropout drowning in debt who can't keep even a minimum wage job for more than a day anymore. People keep telling me ""find what you like to do"", but I'm only content when I'm asleep.  You can't get paid to just sleep all the time.  There's no ""friends"" here to care about, I have no family and have no desire to start one.  My only option is to be a wage slave.  

I'm desperate for someone to put an end to me already because I'm too afraid to do it myself but all these services they funnel me through simply refuse to give me a safe way to do so.  I'm even in a group-home (which btw is also piling on even more debt that the org. is covering until I ""get on my feet"" and can pay it back).  

They keep saying to ""take it one day at a time"" but each passing day is just another day where the world is shit and my employment ""opportunities"" just as insufferable.  I just don't get what it is I'm expected to ""look forward to?""  What is going to change in a year, or five years, or ten years?  You can do nothing excitable, see nothing of value, access no quality education, be nobody in this world unless you're rich or win the genetic lottery.  I don't know how to self-teach myself new skills, whether its lack of passion or sheer incompetence IDK.  College is out of the question, I've completely blown off my loans since they kicked me out and paying them back is an impossibility.  I've never managed to hang onto more than a few dollars at a time no matter how many hours I put in (thanks a lot cities btw for fucking up airbnb when it was the only thing I could ""afford"" even if it was my whole paycheck just to not sleep in the streets every night, assholes).

A hundred years ago someone like me they would just take to the back of the barn and execute right then and there.  Why not anymore?  Who exists in the world to deal with a person like me?  The so called ""compassionate"" mental health ""experts"" in the United States can't.  But I think that's the problem.  There's nothing wrong with me, I just see the world for how it is and where I'm expected to be positioned.  And I really just want out already.  The time where I'm expected to leave the place I'm at is going to come soon and then what?  Go back to the ledge and hope I can get the balls to finally jump?  They inject people with lethal doses literally every day, can't somebody just add me to that list?

When i met her she seemed kind, sweet, and reserved but as the months have gone by she has turned into a loud, clingy, obnoxious, sex hungry girl. I am still a virgin but i had to lie to her and create this whole elaborate story about how i lost my virginity to this one guy and “dated” him just so she would stop telling everybody that i was a virgin (the guy was 100% made up). She is so rude to everybody and everybody is beginning tothink i am rude because of the things she does (she will push people out of her way while walking, yell at my current crush to “get his attention for me” and continuously get so mad over little things and take her anger out on me. She is also kind of an airhead but is also a know it all (and when you criticize her she will change her tone to some kind of condescending yelling voice and talk down on you until you give up). She also never washes her hands, does not wash her hair, doesn’t wash her clothes, and smells horrible all the time (almost a fishy scent like what you smell at a musky dock at a beach). 
She also continues to date abusive, manipulative guys despite me pointing it out to her and trying to get her help. She loves the control they give her but they end up pushing me away from her and then she comes crawling back after they’re done using her as a punching bag. 
Anyways to get to the point i have no idea how to break things off with her because she has spent hundreds if not thousands of dollars on me since the beginning of our friendship (despite me begging her not to and paying her back for things i didn’t even want). There are times when she is an amazing friend but i no longer want to be seen with her in public because of how much she embarrasses me.  She has so many plans for our future that i don’t have the heart to break it to her that i wish she wasn’t in my life anymore.

827,"I’m a rather emotionless person, 99% of the time I am a solid neutral. Nothing really makes me feel happy but equally nothing really makes me feel sad. My girlfriend and I sometimes get into little spats over something relatively insignificant - often times it’s a joke I’ve made that hits her the wrong way - that blows out of proportion because neither of us can “settle it”. 

Of course the smart thing to do would be to just apologise and move on, but when an argument sparks from something I can’t understand / logically agree with I can become very apathetic and almost annoyed at her emotions. I know that it doesn’t really matter how it happened and all that matters is that I’ve upset her, but in the moment I can’t fathom how anyone could get upset over a joke and don’t really care that she’s upset by it. I logic the reasoning for her feeling upset away. I don’t deny that she’s feeling them but I find it almost stupid that she does over something so insignificant. For example I was on the phone with her when she was with her younger sister whilst they were getting ready to go out, and her sister said that I should hype her up even when I can’t see her, so I jokingly said “I wouldn’t want to lie”. I regularly compliment my gf and there is no doubt that I’m attracted to her and love her, so this is obviously untrue that I’d be lying in complimenting her - stupid humour I’ve likely picked up from my dad and how he jokes with my mom. This upset her, and we argued because I find it annoying that a joke can cause an argument.

I haven’t been diagnosed with anything that could indicate my lack of empathy or emotions in general but I also haven’t sought out a diagnosis or reasoning for it. I’m not sure if it’s just my personality / a bad habit / response to something, but I’d like to know ways that could maybe help me not react this way so we can avoid arguments. I know I can’t gain empathy since I seem void of it, but maybe there are some tips to manage the situation better?",27Dec2019,1

839,"Hi all, I've been having a very hard and stressful time during the holidays being back and visiting family, but it hasn't been once festive at all. I don't know what to do anymore. 

I'm a 29 F. I come from a very strict Chinese family, where my dad runs the household, and everything he says is a go or has to go. Since I was in university, I learned to hide my relationships... To give an example, I've hidden my last 4-year relationship away from my dad. My mom always knows, and so does my sister, but if we were to ever mention just his name, it would go down a hell hole for the following *few* weeks. Until I had apologized... for mentioning his name, and that it was wrong of me to do so. 

In 2013, I had a brutal car accident and my current boyfriend was one of the largest positive impacts I've had - teaching me new things, making me stronger, showing me the world, embracing in my imperfections, and most importantly, supporting me in everything that I want to do - in terms of being successful in my career and in life. My dad started off with a positive relationship, but one time, he saw us together in bed. To be VERY clear, we were on top of the covers, we were NOT doing anything sexual; he simply had his arm around me. We were watching TV in my room. My room door was wide open, and I had shared with my parents that we would watch a show upstairs. He shared that he was very upset, but young me didn't know and I apologized because we were in my parents' house, and I didn't see how this was disrespectful. I mean, I grew up sheltered but I guess being in university kind of made me more open. We were in 2013. 

My dad remained mad at him since then. I felt it was stupid and immature of my dad, and I told my boyfriend about it. He asked to apologize to my dad several times, but I said no because my dad doesn't want to see him, hear his name, or speak of him at all. He made it very clear that he wants to have no ties, no connections, no memories of my boyfriend. This continued for the next few years. Every time we went out, I had to use a different name, or say that I was hanging out with someone else. I was single in his eyes already. In 2017, I moved halfway across the country because I had an awesome career opportunity, a chance to prove that I was worth my own time, my education, and to prove to my dad that I would make him proud again. I have my masters and I legit have the best career in the world - fit just for me. I told my dad that I ended things for now, to pursue my career and to become more independent from anybody - a guy, them, and just do me. My dad was very supportive of this. I had a heart to heart with him and told him that I still love him and that my feelings would not go away. My dad was not the biggest fan of this but he said to me, ""it is, in the end, your life"". I left it at that, and I wouldn't really mention my boyfriend around him anymore.

Fast forward to now, end of 2019. I'm still living away, and I came back for the holidays to spend time with them, but also my friends. Since being home, my dad has asked me non stop who I am hanging out with every time I go out, hinting and probing me to say my boyfriend's name. I'm not going to lie, so I told him once that I was hanging out with him. In a group setting, with like 10 other friends. From that point on, my dad has limited his conversation with me to a mere ""yes"" or ""no"". He's limited his interactions with me and has been very obvious about his upset with his body language towards the family, about me. But he won't say it. My mom told me to stop mentioning his name because my dad has clinical depression. Or else, if I mention his name again, I'll throw the entire family dynamic into shambles and no one will ever be happy again. Legit her words. 

I'm 29 now... I want to be married and have kids soon. I don't have a particular timeline but I'm getting there. I want to give my dad enough time to accept my boyfriend and who I am, with or without him. I don't want this to end in an ultimatum where I have to choose family over love. What do I do? 

TL:DR - In short, my dad hates my boyfriend and doesn't want to hear his name mentioned ever again. It's been 6 years and he's still guilt-tripping me for it.",27Dec2019,1

843,"   I currently work in a Pediatric Therapy clinic. Meaning that not only adult employees, but children are filmed on the toilet. We signed various documents upon employment, so I'm not sure if I've somehow given some type of written consent. I'm sure that being filmed while in the bathroom would NEVER under any circumstances be okay with me, and I'm pretty confident that the parents of these kids would feel the same way. 

   Made the discovery today after opening the lobby door to return an office phone. The new desk attendant was away and there were three live camera feeds left on the screen. On one I could see kids playing, and one was an image of the inside of the bathroom. I've noticed a green light coming from a small gap in two of the ceiling tiles but honestly didn't want to believe that my privacy would be violated so harshly by my employer. (It's pretty well concealed)

Honestly, I just feel really hurt and disgusted, and glad that one of my co-workers wasn't using the bathroom when I walked up to the monitor. Definitely do not want to see that.

845,"Hi all, I'm one of those people who love to clean their ears out. It's basically an addiction. Qtips are ny prefered, but I try not to buy them because I know it's so bad for me. I have no ear wax (verified by dr and also I have a camera to look inside) and my ears get itchy and flakey. I then use anything I can to scratch the itch. Ear gets irritated and more itchy so I scratch more, then it gets infected. 

The infection comes in the form of very painful pus and fluid filled boils in the external part of my ear canal. The pain is horrible. The swelling pushes on my jaw and basically the whole side of my face from temple to jaw is tender and hurts to move. 

I know the obvious answer is to stop fucking with my ears, but I havent been able to do that yet. I have an anti fungal cream from my dr I use, but I forget sometimes. I have tried hydrocortisone with no noticable effect and also use vasiline to try and sooth my ears when they are most irritated.

Today he was very dull and didn't talk as much as usual. I know that he's very impulsive, but he's never been as much as today. When we came to our friends he stopped talking and started playing sad songs.
Firstly we joked about it, but he just kept getting more and more angrier. We asked what's the problem, he said that we know, of course we didn't.
Everyone was pissed at him, so I chose to leave and asked him to go with me. All way to our hotel he was behind me and didn't talk at all.
Now I've got a message that he added me to the black list everywhere, same with my friends.
Now I realise, that I'm scared of him, he's 2 heads taller than me and much stronger. I don't know what to do. I know that he doesn't have any family problems or so. But I really don't know what's wrong with him.

855,"Obligatory this post is kind of long and vague because housemates use Reddit

&amp;#x200B;

Three of us moved to an expensive city over the summer and alas, there has been some tension in the house that has only gotten worse over time. It came to a head around Thanksgiving, culminating in one housemate determining she wants to move out before our lease is up at the end of July. The housemate - let's call her Jen - said she wants to move out by January 31st at the latest. Myself and the other housemate - let's call him John - immediately began posting the room to various sites including Facebook and Craigslist to help find a sublet as soon as possible. We've had some interest in the room but not as much as we hoped as the room itself is very expensive due to the nature of the city we live in.

Recently, Jen reached out to ask the progress of the sublet search (she is not helping as we all decided John and I should find the sublet, considering we'd have to live with them). Jen also said she will be making her last rent payment on January 1st and will move out (and stop paying rent) on the 31st regardless of whether we find a sublet. My question is, is Jen legally allowed to just stop paying rent and move out whenever she wants? The three of us did sign a lease when we moved in and there is a ""Joint and Several"" clause in the lease, though I'm not 100% sure what that means. John and I are very nervous as we would not be able to afford the rent if she stopped paying which would cause a whole host of other problems. Any advice would be hugely helpful!!!

858,"Let me preface by saying that my father has ALWAYS taken care of me financially. He helps pay my bills, he’s bought me tons of things over the years, he’s bailed me out of jail when I was a teenager. He’s done a lot for me. 

However, my father is also not a good man. He is extremely racist, bigoted, and mean. He has hit me multiple times throughout my childhood and most of all, he’s extremely emotionally abusive if he feels insulted in any way. 

We are currently in Florida for what was supposed to be a vacation. We were supposed to go to Disney World, go sightseeing, and go to museums. None of this happened over our stay here, and we are leaving tomorrow. 

Most recently, on a car ride to a museum, we got into a fight because I asked him why we were going to this museum when no one else wanted to go except me. I even offered to go to another museum that was much closer. Along the way, I’d told him not to go because it was several hours away. I was ignored. 

Upon hearing me ask why we were going when no one else wanted to go, he flipped the car around and starting cursing at me. He called me a cunt, told me he hopes I get stabbed and die, and told me I ruined the entire trip because of my bad attitude and constant arguing. This is the first time I have spoken a word about anything we have done the entire trip. 

This is not the first time, however, that my father has emotionally berated me. This is a common occurrence if I say anything he doesn’t like. 

My entire family thinks I am crazy for wanting to cut him out of my life. I feel that it is absolutely justified.

I just found out I'm a covert narc.  
(Don't know what that is, neither did I, check out more on it here: [https://orgonomictherapy.com/2016/01/26/the-closet-narcissist-disorder-of-the-self/](https://orgonomictherapy.com/2016/01/26/the-closet-narcissist-disorder-of-the-self/))  
I   had no idea this was even a disorder/diagnosis till today and I'm beside myself. Its a bit of relief and a bit of a complete uprooting of  what I thought was my reality. I mean a relief in the sense that there   are people that feel the same way I do and it sounds like there are  ways  to overcome it. In true covert narc form though this revelation  has  left me feeling more disappointed, unsatisfied with myself and  wanting  to further withdraw myself from life. FUCK! &lt;- and there's  the anger.

I recently read: [https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/8uwufw/covert\_narcissism/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/8uwufw/covert_narcissism/)

and  I couldn't believe how this described me, my behaviors and the exact issues in mine and my partner's relationship (now realizing every   relationship I've ever had). I started searching outside myself for some   answers recently as I thought my partner brought up a very poignant   point: I am a narcissist.  
At first there was the defense along side justification but after I was able to step back and think on it more, he   couldn't be more right. In an effort to learn more (and in all  honesty,  hopes to prove him wrong)  I started looking in to narcissism.  I had  only ever known it to be like what is considered grandiose  narcissism. I  had no clue, no fucking clue, you could be a covert  narcissist and here I am, the very textbook definition.

Now knowing this about myself, I feel like I can do something to change. I have to in an effort to be a better version of myself. I don't want to be like this. Now knowing this about myself I can't continue to live and operate like this. I want to have self-esteem and find who I am  again. I  don't want to do this to my partner anymore now knowing this is what  I'm doing subconsciously:  
""As a result they avoid expressing themselves to avoid feeling exposed as  not perfect, preferring to  hide  behind those that they can look up to  instead. They rely on the   supplies of idealized objects to hold up their  self-esteem. They become   fused with the expectations of their partners,  while modulating their   behavior to act in accordance with their  expectations. While trying  to  impress them by being perfect in their  eyes, so they feel good  about  themselves.""  
And I'll be damned if I pass this shit\^ on to my daughter.  
My hopes in posting this is to find help and maybe there are  more of us self-realized covert narcs here who have found things that have helped you overcome this, what feels like, a monumental hurdle or  you're  someone who loves a covert narc and you have a story that would help me. I just need some guidance as this discovery has completely disrupted my view of who I thought I was. I've been so in the closet about my narcissism that I didn't even know I was in a closet all this time. The best way I can describe it is relieving but extremely terrifying, mostly because I am just now uncovering this about myself. 

I'm offered therapy through my work benefits so I'm looking in to finding someone to specifically help with this but any advice or anything anyone could offer up as help would be more than greatly appreciated.

869,"There are so many unknowns about the entire situation that it's kept me from eating and sleeping. She hasn't contacted me in days, and both members of my family and I are under the assumption that it is because they (my girlfriend and her immediate family) are being located to a safe place away from the step-father as he awaits legal action for what he put her and her family through. No matter what, there is nothing I can find solace in as I await for her word on what the current situation is. I don't know what to do with myself in the meantime, as I am on school break and have taken steps to spend time with family as I had a suicidal episode a few days before the 24th, which allowed me to break my silence on the matter at hand to my mother, who helped me contact DSS in order to get the scumbag. I couldn't live with myself for what I had been keeping secret, and it was a huge relief to get off my chest, as I couldn't bring myself to protect him any longer by being silent about what he had done. The only positive emotion I am feeling right now is self-affirmation that I did the right thing in exposing what he had been doing to her, but I can't help but worry about where she is now. Her mental state is similar to mine, as she is suicidal as well, and going days without contact from her has me worried absolutely sick. I don't know if I can do this for much longer. I am beyond worried about her mental state, and about both her safety and her family's safety.   


I can't help but feel like I've made her mental state worse off than it already was, and I can't help but feel like her mother is holding her hostage, as I think her mother blames her for causing their already fragile family system to completely fall apart, even though it was me who contacted DSS. The step-father threatened to kill himself after DSS showed up at their house, which caused my girlfriend to go into a panic of which I had never seen before. It is beyond me why, as he was the one who was manipulating her and doing all these awful things to her.

870,"Okay please bear with me here lol. As a 20 year old female I am realizing that I have been pretty spoiled when it comes to home life, not in a sense that I had a perfect childhood and everything was easy and I never got in trouble and could do anything, I got in trouble a lot and had a pretty over protective mother,  but I don't think I ever really learned how to fully structure my own life and take care of things. Punishment at home was a lot of yelling and verbal punishment and phone being taken away and certain privileges being taken away (a birthday party I could no longer go to, a play I was no longer allowed to be in things like that) . Because of this it's hard for me to make rules for myself and take action over a lot of things that matter and even now , just as I did in childhood &amp; high school, either lying about things  to avoid getting yelled at  or something. What I really want to do is add structure to my life and try to start taking responsibility for things and not be so scared of the repercussions or better yet, try to break the patters and habits that DO get me in trouble.  I know a lot of the impulsiveness and disrespect comes from my ADHD, which of course isn't an excuse but I can ignore that it's a main factor.
 
To clarify a situation I'm talking about here's an example: My parents let me have a credit card when I went to college to pay for groceries and the occasional going out to eat or going out for drinks etc. I wayyyy over spent during my first year (mainly my first semester) and so this year they tried to give it more structure by saying 60$ a week for groceries and about 30$ a week to go out to eat  with the rule that I send my dad all my receipts when I purchase things so he knows when I'm spending, what I'm buying, and making sure I'm not buying other people things. Now this was very generous and very fair but as the semester went on I kept justifying little things to myself that then turned into bigger things. I.E. ""Well I didn't need to buy groceries this week so I can totally spend more on going out to eat"" or ""Well I didn't send my dad those few  receipts and he saw the credit card bill and didn't say anything, maybe I don't have to send him all the receipts"" and that just slowly escalates to some reckless spending and not thinking of the weight behind my decisions and taking advantage of a privilege they've given me. Well you can imagine how that turns out when he finally catches on and they're furious, and frankly rightfully so, 

That's just one kind of example but I hope you see what I'm saying. The point is I don't like that I behave this when especially because it's mainly with them and I know bad habits carry and I don't want those habits in my adult life. I want to take steps to try and become a more structured and responsible person with them and in my real and future professional life. 

I'm taking some steps on my own like next semester I'm going to get a job and start paying for my own things as much as I can but If anyone has any advice for how to add structure and discipline into my life when it's really a struggle for me I'd really appreciate it.  I don't enjoy being this way, I want to have respect and care for my parents and I want to live a more structured life, I just don't know where to start.

871,"This is a long one and I’m sorry, but I’m going crazy here and I’m afraid of losing my loved ones. 

From ages 11-19 I was sexually assaulted by my father. My mom, Jenna, (fake name) wasn’t aware of this because they’re divorced, so this happened while I was in his house and I was too terrified of what would happen to me if I spilled the beans. When I turned 20 I threatened my dad to tell the police about the sexual abuse if he didn’t leave me alone. He left and thank God I haven’t seen him in 4 years. 

To start my healing process I decided to tell my mom and her sister who is a very, very close aunt (let’s call her Cindy) about my experience. My mom has helped me a lot to heal, and my aunt was a good listener when I needed to vent. 

Now, all went south when my aunt started dating an old friend of hers, Fernando. They fell in love extremely fast and in less than a couple of months they got married and moved in together. They’ve been a couple for about a year and and a half now. 

I didn’t know this, but my aunt Cindy told her new husband Fernando about my sexual abuse, and he went to other family members to say that “no wonder I was a troubled lesbian (I’m not gay, but he made it sound as if being a lesbian was a bad thing), that the sexual abuse explained everything, that he was afraid of being with me because he didn’t want to be accused of sexual assault, etc”

I don’t even know why he’d think all of that considering I got along with him and appreciated his presence in the family. Anyway, obviously everyone started calling me, asking if it was true, everyone is slowly gaining this knowledge and it’s extremely unnerving, because this is a very shameful and traumatic topic for me that I only shared with my closest family members. The only one who doesn’t know is my grandma because everyone is trying to protect her from the pain of knowing that I was sexually assaulted and because she gets along with Fernando. 

And I’m feeling like crap because my aunt, who is sorry and has asked for forgiveness, wants things to go back to normal as if nothing has happened. But my mom and I are extremely hurt by her actions. And Fernando isn’t sorry for the things he said. He comes to my house (I live with mom and grandma) to eat, he was in our house for Christmas and he’s planning a trip with the family for next year. All of this to keep my grandma and aunt happy. Meanwhile I’m uncomfortable being in his presence, I’m being told no to tell my grandma about what happened (to me and the situation with Fernando) to avoid causing her any pain and my family is ok with letting this happen because they also want my grandma’s happiness and my aunt’s peace of mind.

But what about me???

She started saying things like ""Jeez Damian not everyone hates you like yea people probably hate you but not everyone."" Yes, I did copy and paste that. I eventually told her it was a joke and it was cool. But today, I made a post saying that people should stop taking my jokes so seriously, because they just start to get mad at me for no reason. She then gets mad at me, by saying this; ""Why are you still with that shit like dude just ignore everybody and don't post this shit like keep your business to yourself."" Now, obviously she didn't read what I said. We eventually had an argument about how she does the same thing but worse and how she acts like a girl who had to move a while back because she was acting like that. I should make it clear that I don't fake depression or have it. She just assumes I do. On the other hand, she actually does fake depression for the attention she gets. I then tell her the following.
""And not to mention you say shit like ""Bye"" or ""Shut the fuck up."" Just to get out of situations you don't want to be in because you know that I'm actually right.""

And then we all walked over to other friends and she didn't even say a word to me for most of the rest of the day.

She's a really close friend and I dont want to lose her but at the same time I really feel like she doesn't value me as a friend nearly as much.",27Dec2019,1

I was thinking it could be a list of mental health mantras to repeat, or maybe an inspirational quote that would encourage someone to keep going. I know that a piece of paper isn't going to just beat her mental illnesses, but I just want her to have it on her wall so that she knows how much love and support she has and that she needs to always keep going. However, I'm rather at a loss. Could any of you fine folk reccomend me something fire to write? Thanks so much in advance!",27Dec2019,1

881,"I've been having this issue that by now, to be honest, I've spent far too much time and energy on. I recently returned an item and when talking to the agent during the return, I was told that I would be getting a full refund. I check the return, I see that \~$100 or so is missing from the return amount.

I call back and talk to a different representative that reassured me that I would be receiving a full refund for this item, even giving me a new dollar amount that I should be expecting. I go ahead and return it, only to see that the money is still missing. I give support a call and then was told about there being a restocking fee and that there was nothing to be done, I should have just known about this policy. I contacted support about 4 more times, escalating and talking to different people, with them essentially just telling me to suck it up. The last one also said that I was supposed to be informed that there was two options. I don't feel this is right.

Is it not their job to inform me of this before I send the device out? Am I not supposed to believe the words of someone representing the company? $100 is a lot of money (for me at least), if I knew about it I wouldn't have gone through with the return in the first place and dealt with it another way without such loss.

883,"My mother passed away 6 years ago, after moving from Ontario to British Columbia to start a new life with her secret (not great) boyfriend. She begged me to come be with her – I was 17, we were best friends, but I wanted to finish highschool in Ontario, and on my one trip to visit her it was clear that her boyfriend, and his 50 year old male roommate, were not people I wanted to live with. 
We spoke every day all day. She stopped responding to my texts one night and by the third day I was genuinely concerned she was dead, there was no other reason she hadn’t gotten back to me. The next morning my grandpa and aunt came to the house to tell us she had passed away. I got many conflicting stories from my family members. That she had passed away in her sleep, that she had a heart attack, that she died of cancer that she was hiding from the family, that she had been terminally ill, a hole in her heart, etc. To this day I can’t get a straight answer, I’m 23 now. Her boyfriend wouldn’t send me any of her things from BC, not one thing. He wouldn’t tell me what happened or what state she was in when she passed away. That place was no good for her, it was abusive and she was a recovering addict, the men there were violent drinkers. Me and her were closer than any two people could be and I need to know what happened to her - when she died, where she was. She had two weeks earlier moved from Surrey, BC to another city close by, but I can’t remember which. How does a person go about getting that sort of information? Are there records I could access that show the cause of death and any information about how/when/where she died?

893,"Over the course of the last week, I have been writing a not-to-be-read letter to someone from my past, getting out all of my experiences, feelings, and thoughts - most of which I have never actually taken the time to sit down and deal with since my falling out with this person over 12 years ago. 

The TL:DR of the my experience with this girl is that i knew this girl my whole life, and from a very young age always had a crush on her, which she periodically reciprocated until around age 11. In high school my feelings for her resurfaced and grew to the point where I was seriously devoted to winning her heart in a mature way and taking my time so as not to rush anything because I wanted to marry her eventually. She eventually expressed to me after a year of pursuing her that she had feelings for me too, but then 3 months later broke it off by telling me that she just wasn’t capable of transforming her “brotherly love” for me into anything deeper. 

So this letter at this point is going to end up being over 30 handwritten pages long, written on my iPad. It has been a serious roller coaster of emotions getting out everything I have been keeping silent for so long, and going back thru all the events that transpired to me ultimately falling in love with her and working very seriously over the course of a year to win her heart before having my heart ripped to shreds. I have never taken the time to deal with any of these emotions or thoughts since she broke up with me, but instead resorted to just being angry at her for a couple years until we finally called a truce before we ultimately lost touch. 

I need advice on how to finalize all of these things within myself in order to not have to hold onto these thoughts anymore. I wouldn’t say that it has caused me any stress or other kind of internal torture, but since I was only 7 or 8 years old up till now, not a month has ever gone by where I don’t have the same recurring dream at least once where she finally agrees to marry me, and I’m the happiest I can ever imagine, and every time I wake up depressed despite not having had feelings for her in over 10 years. I can’t keep having these dreams anymore, first of all because I have been happily married for the last 9 years to a wonderful woman, and also because before this week, I don’t ever think about this girl unless I have that damn dream. 

Do any of you have suggestions on what I should do with this letter when it is finally finished? I can’t give it to her because she is also happily married now, and I won’t be that person, plus I don’t think it would bode well for my own marriage if I did. I don’t want to hold onto it because I don’t want to have the opportunity to go back and read thru all of these experiences and emotions ever again. I have thought about Simply deleting it off my iPad, but I don’t feel like that will feel as final in my mind. I almost want to have someone read it to tell me I’m not insane for feeling the way I did because of what happened between us, but I would never subject another person to 30+ pages of my emotional blathering. 

Any suggestions are welcome.",27Dec2019,1

My grandfather passed in 2015; he suffered from dementia for a decade prior to his death. Before he was diagnosed, we were close and I loved him very much. I knew he was far from the perfect father, but he was a loving grandfather so the stories my dad told me never phased me.  
  
  
For Christmas this year, my sister gave me a gift certificate for a tattoo shop; we planned to get matching tattoos of the nicknames our grandfather gave us. My dad was very drunk on Christmas Day and told my sister we should rethink the tattoos. When my sister asked why, the truth came out. My beloved grandpa had sexually and physically abused his wife and both of his children. She did not press for details but I don’t think they matter - I knew it was true the second she told me.

903,"It's currently winter break right now and I am in the midst of a problem. I'm 14, my older brother is 15 and my younger brother is 12. My younger sister is 9. 

I am the sole cleaner of the house. I clean the tables, make the beds, sweep, fix the placement of objects, and I also clean the stairs. This is to help make my mom's job easier. No one really helps her at all. 

I used to do these tasks on my own, as my siblings wouldn't bother helping. Nowadays, I'm busier. I have too much schoolwork, so many exams, so many quizzes. On top of that, I need to clean everything. On a school night, I stay on the couch for at least 4 hours finishing up my homework and doing additional studying. I've counted. I get home at 3 and finish everything at around 7 or 8 with no distractions. This all seems really excessive, but my school is one of the best in the country (sorry, this seems like bragging, but this is a major part of my problem). It's challenging and very rigorous. I have to do well, or else I'll let my parents down... My siblings all go to our home school. They have a quarter of the workload that I have (I know this because our middle school was easy as heck and my older brother has even stated this before). As soon as I get home, I'm doing my work. But they're doing nothing- either laying on their beds and laughing at memes or procrastinating by playing games (for HOURS). 

Since they have so much less work than me, I ask them to clean. I have to ask them multiple times to clean until they finally do it. My younger sister makes the beds and fixes up our tables. I still have the duty of sweeping and organizing things. Since both of my brothers are really lazy, I split the task of cleaning the stairs BETWEEN them. Still, most of the time, they don't do anything... leaving the work for me. 

My 12 year old brother has cleaned the stairs ONCE since we set this rule down. I have done it the many other times. My older brother has done NOTHING. The lazy piece of shit is always in his room screaming out of frustration for losing a ""rank"" in his dumb game. 

Today, out of rage, I yelled at my younger brother. I've also yelled at my older brother for the same reason.

Him: ""I just don't want to do it! Why don't YOU do it if it bothers you so much?"" 
Me: ""Well, you idiot, I've been doing it for the last 4 times, if you haven't noticed. You only POINTLESSLY clean the stairs after I finish cleaning the stairs.""
Him: ""Well that's because it's dirty after.""
Me: ""That's because your crusty feet rub around everywhere, dumbass. Wasn't it dirty BEFORE I cleaned it, too? And you clean right after because 'I didn't do a good job' and it's less work after I've already cleaned it?! So you're a lazy bum then? Yea, ok.""

Childish, I know. I don't care though. I've been doing everything BEFORE his age while getting nothing in return. I still clean even though I ""don't wanna do it"". I don't plan on apologizing, but how do I MAKE the two dumbasses in my family start doing work around the damn house?? I could be cleaning the stairs right now, but I don't want to. I'm not taking up this duty when those two idiots don't do what they were assigned.",27Dec2019,1
904,"Hi, first post on here.

So two years ago, i had a girlfriend who i was in love with at the time. I trusted her with all my heart and i actually loved her. It ended really badly as i found out she cheated on me multiple times with different guys, and when word got out about this to other people after we broke up, she started telling people i raped her to make me seem like the bad one in the situation (which obviously i never did). This broke my heart and i was depressed as fuck for the longest time.

We broke up, i was heartbroken, i eventually got over it with the help of my friends and family, and fast forward 6 months later and i get into another relationship and i have a lot of trust issues with my new girlfriend. We don’t end up dating that long as it appeared i didn’t trust her and it ended pretty toxic.

I saw that i have really bad trust issues due to my ex cheating on me, so i spent a year and worked on myself. It’s been a year since my last relationship, and i finally met a great girl who i’m in love with and i feel like the relationship will actually go somewhere. The only problem is i still have trust issues somewhat, and i’m scared of being hurt again and i don’t want the past to repeat itself. I just wish i could forget everything my ex did to me, because this girl is amazing and i feel like i can’t love her to the fullest bc i’m scared of giving her everything like i did with my ex and getting hurt again. 

I never told her about my past and whenever i start to feel like i can’t trust her, i just shut down and stop talking to her. Should i tell her about my past and everything that happened so she might understand why i am the way that i am?

910,"So, I'm not really sure how to start what I want to say, because it's almost like a circle. I'm also sorry if it gets too long. 

I constantly have bouts of (I guess it's what it is) panic attacks, where I start almost hyperventilating and loud crying at super random times, and I also have feelings of suicide fairly frequently. This coincides with me having issues with working. I used to be completely ok with working, but when I moved out of my parents house with my then boyfriend, I got a higher paying job at a call center. I had been there for a few months and then my mental health just started deteriorating. It got to the point where I would freak out and start doing that crying and hyperventilating thing when I had to walk through the front doors, or even think about working(pretty sure that was when it first started happening to me). 

That's when my supervisor at the time told me to see a therapist about it to figure out what was going on. When I tried doing that, I was scared to tell her about my suicidal thoughts because I know that they have to legally let someone know and I didn't want to get involuntarily hospitalized or something like that, because I can't afford that happening. I told her everything else and she told me she thought it was just anxiety, and tried to teach me breathing excercises. Well, this didn't work, and I got to the point where I just couldn't go anymore, so I quit. After that, we started getting tight for money and I feel super guilty about all of this. I've been in and out of jobs since then because after so long in the job it just happens again where I can't bring myself to go. 

I feel like I've given up on myself and I've been feeling more suicidal lately because I feel like I'm ruining my now fiancee's life. I can't afford to go back to the therapist to figure out what's wrong with me, and I can't stay at a job long enough to get the medical insurance and have stable income to where we can use it for therapy. All of my jobs have been customer service related, but I don't know if that has to do with anything.

I guess the reason I came on here was to figure out if anyone has any ideas on what I could do? I don't really know what I'm asking for, I'm sorry. I feel dumb writing this out because it shouldn't be this hard for me to stay at a job, but I just feel like I'm at my wit's end.

I live in the Bay Area of California, and most of these texts have been coming from Stockton (or so says Google when I search the phone numbers) and seem to be related to buying drugs. I say ""seem"" because they mention money and picking something up (sometimes they say something like a dime or a gram) but nothing else. I have just been ignoring and blocking the numbers. I've also been getting scam texts with fake links directed at her - also just blocked and ignored.

However, there is one number that has been texting me more and more for the past several months that I never blocked because they were vague and weird, and I thought it could be somebody I know. Eventually I realized through some stuff that they were saying that they thought they were texting Jane. It was all very bizarre stuff, a lot of times barely coherent, and it was entertaining, so while I didn't reply I did read the texts.

This past month they've been texting me almost every day, so I looked up the number and it lead back to a bail bonds service - not as the main number, but according to their website: ""if nobody answers, text this number."" I finally responded to the texts: https://i.imgur.com/VG40cVV.jpg

As you can see, they basically didn't acknowledge me, so I just started ignoring them again. But... I got this recently: https://i.imgur.com/EvgdD9I.jpg

...which freaked me out. I know these texts aren't meant for me and that this person doesn't know who I am - but obviously it's still concerning. I looked more into this bail bonds company and found some odd reviews: https://i.imgur.com/6cu365C.jpg

Whoever is behind these texts is... kooky, to say the least, and I don't know if I should be taking this threat seriously or report it.",27Dec2019,1

918,"I’m female and I am 19 almost 20 and my boyfriend 
and I have been doing long distance from Canada to California for almost two years now.  We have been together physically for about 9 months until the begging of December. 
 
It’s important to know how important it is to be married to me. I know I am young but it is my dream to have a family and be a mom and give my kids the things I will never have and all that stuff. And I honestly feel like I could marry this guy. 
  
I’ve never seriously pushed him to marry me. Just a joke here and there. 
I love him and if he were to marry me it would help our relationship because it would help one of us to get a citizenship for the others county. 
 
He won’t move to California because he’s too scared to be away from his parents. My parents offered to give us a place to stay and help us (the both of us) through college if he wanted to do that. 
 
That is one of the only realistic ways we can be together because if I went to college in Canada as an international student it would cost an arm and a leg and in California community college is pretty cheap. 
  
So anyways we were having a discussion about marriage and stuff a few weeks ago and he told me he was ready. He told me he wanted to commit and was just waiting for the right time to purpose. 
 
I was over the moon. I was the happiest person in the world. Not only was I going to be with the one I loved. And start a live with the man I felt was my soulmate. Our living situation would be resolved. I asked him if he was sure and he told me he was. 
 
Skip over to Christmas and he tells me he doesn’t want to marry me anymore. He had a conversation with a friend and realized he was too young to get married. (21) 
  
I completely understand where he is coming from. We are both so young to be married so I’m not mad about that.  And I’m not going to try to force him to do something he doesn’t want to do. 
   
This would have been one of the only ways we would really be able to be together.  So it just complicates things further and now I have to figure out a way for us to be together. If I stayed here and finished out college I would have to do this online relationship for another 4 years and I’m not sure if I can do that. And it hurts. 
  
I’ve done nothing but put my 1000 into this relationship and I was willing to pick up my life and move to another country for someone who won’t do the same.  And in my head I know that’s not right but my heart feels another way. I’m really conflicted. 
   
  I’m hurt and I’m really disappointed because saying you want to marry someone and that you were planning to propose and is serious thing. And it really made me believe he was actually putting in as much 
effort as I am.  And that he was seriously seriously as committed as I am. 

He did the same thing with saying he wanted to actually move to California. And then he changed his mind.  This inconsistency is hurting me a lot. 
 
I love him so much and there is just this thing between us. I don’t know how to explain it. (This is not my first love and I know how that is.this is different.) normally I’m so good at being able to walk away from a bad relationship, this is not one of those. I feel like if I walk away or lose him somehow I would be making a mistake.  I know that if we were to not be together I would probably meet someone who I will love again but this kind of feels like one of those once in a lifetime type things. Especially because of how we met and how our relationship has gone so far. 
 
We talked the day after and we decided to try to work things out without marriage but I can’t stop feeling angry and hurt.  About it. I don’t know how to let this go. 
 
 Any tips on how to get over this? I don’t want to be mad anymore and I sent some text out of anger and I don’t normally do that.  I don’t think I’ve ever felt upset like this before.  I want to get over this.

921,"So, I have a bit of problem. An abusive ex of mine has been somewhat stalking me for two years now. He's violent, threw me across the room when we broke up, and knows kendo, self defense, and owns two short swords. 

He's been leaving me flowers on my front porch and even ordered me a stuffed penguin from Wish. He's called me three times despite being blocked, twice on the same day and drunk off his ass. He hasn't done anything to me. I haven't even physically seen him. He comes by late at night or early morning to avoid being seen. Leaves his ""gifts"" addressed to my initials and never placed his initials down until the flowers he dropped off yesterday. 

I know the whole document everything he does, go to the police but seeing as he's only done this six times in two years, the police won't classify it as stalking and I can't get a restraining order.

923,"Back story : Ok so I have a younger sister who is 23 and she is just a toxic person to certain people of our family and just has no respect for anyone except my mother( will get into that now) and she thrives on conflict or loves to make people angry so she can run to my mother and they can gossip behind peoples back. My mother was always a very judgmental person and would always make giant scenes if things didn't go her way and I mean like lose her shit completely like throwing and breaking things yelling and screaming and would always seek confrontation with my father.  My father is a chill, decent , loving , compassionate and well just the opposite of my mother. My father doesn't like to have uncomfortable situations like fights with my mother and would always seek peace. From a young age and I am talking about 10 years old I could see my mother is a bit on the mental side and would always take my fathers side and because of that I was basically ostracized by my mothers side of the family, which didn't bother me because they are a bunch of assholes anyway. My mother and I have a very delicate relationship as in we don't get along to well because in the past I told her straight she is crazy ect ect and of course  that caused a lot of shit which didn't bother me because I am immune to her tantrums. 

Ok so now the part I need advice with which will make sense. I am now married with 2 beautiful children and my wife is a loving , beautiful , smart person and a great mother. From the beginning my mother always made my wife feel like shit , making her feel inferior. My sister also does the same thing. Every time you try and talk to them about it,it escalates to a point where everyone is yelling like children. My sister talks down to my father and treats him like shit and we got into many fights because of it and the last one I almost punched her in the throat ( yes I know you cant hit a girl ) but god damn she is a bitch. 
My father just leaves it because my mother always takes her side no matter what even though everyone can she she is clearly wrong. My father knows that if he stands up for himself my mother would go bat shit crazy again and that he would have weeks if not months of shit. My father is at a age where he just wants peace and quiet. 

Now it was Christmas and the whole family was there and everyone was just sitting there awkwardly because you have to be careful not to say the wrong things or you would upset her or if you look like enjoying it more without her and then the shit hits the fan. No one likes her except my mother. She acts as if she goes around protecting my mother from fck knows what and she easily gets super defensive about shit that involves my mother. Like if you don't show the right amount of appreciation for the shit my mother does she loses it. If you don't show that you love my mother a certain amount then she loses it. If you play a song on the Bluetooth speaker that my mother doesn't like she loses it and its so crazy because the last time a I accidentally played a song my mother does like then she stood up and yelled at me "" mother doesn't like that stupid songs "" and proceeded to storm in my direction making a scene. 

Now we have new years at my fathers house and the whole family is going to be there again and its going to suck balls so hard because It always so awkward with her there and you cant say or do anything because she can do and say just what she wants without any consequences. 
She is fake and giant hypocrite. She is so rude to people. My wife was dragged along to the mall by my sister so she could flaunt her money and this guy bumped into her by accident. He was carrying his baby and proceeded to reach for my sisters arm just to tap her on the shoulder and say sorry. My sister made a giant fcking scene in the mall "" don't you dare touch me , you don't know me , get away "".  Like WTF?!! 

I really need advice on this because i have no clue how to approach her. You cant talk calmly then she throws a tantum because she is always right and you cant yell at her because that obviously has no affect and then she runs to my mother and everyone in the family has to sit with both their shit until my sister leaves and then sum.

924,"
Every single day I find myself to be completely oblivious, absent minded etc. I tend to lose valuable things to the point where my parents don’t put anything into my care. I also tend to be completely unaware of my surroundings and social interactions happening around me. I am also extremely disorganised. There’s also constant rumination socially, for example, I tend to embarrass myself or talk too much and impulsively say something I shouldn’t, then I begin to overthink any interaction with strangers. Did they like me? What did they think of me? 

I tend to always be shy with strangers but extremely outgoing with people I’m comfortable with, however I come off as egotistical/narcissistic when that isn’t the case, I actually tend to have a low self esteem, I just don’t portray it.

During my last job, I could only hold it for about a month. I’d make a mistake then lose all confidence as I’d get yelled at by managers. So I became extremely anxious before going to work, to the point where I was shaking, then I’d make more mistakes. Till I quit.

My teachers all tell me I’m intelligent, but lazy and disorganised. I’ve talked to my parents about this and tried to get myself a psychologist in order to get tested for ADHD, but my parents are not educated with mental disorders and believe it’s just stupidity/laziness.

927,"My friend (37/M) proposed to his girl (25/F) of 9 months this June. Ever since I met her last December, these feeling of unease has never gone away. My wife had an almost identical reaction to her when they first met. I have told NO ONE about my misgivings of her as a person to anyone. However, almost all the friends I know that have met this girl have said the same thing: there is something about her that is unsettling.

She isn’t rude. She isn’t aggressive or loud. She comes off very shy and even after knowing her for a year now, my feelings about her have only grown. The only thing I’ve noticed is her need for control (she signed the lease for the apartment without officially consulting my friend, her future husband supposedly, she has a certain way she wants the apartment to look so she won’t allow certain items from his place into the apartment, etc) 

My friend and her are just now moving in together this January. I’m assuming this will be a long proposal before they tie the knot. I’ve shared my basic feelings to my friend that I think it’s a bit soon to propose but obviously I am there for him but  there is something about his girl I don’t trust. I have never had these feelings before about anyone. I am an extremely cautious person and can usually pinpoint what exactly I will or won’t like about a person but this girl is an enigma and it concerns me.

I want to ask my buddy if everything is alright. I don’t know if he is exactly aware of what he is doing and who he is doing it with... or should I just wait it out and see what happens?

930,"So all the time I ask my friend to hang out, he says yes then I text him and it's ""maybe"" or ""I'll see"" are relationship starting with talking on Snapchat, playing a bit of Xbox then I bought a vape from him. I didn't start seeing him again until October we went to Wawa which people out of the country it's like 7/11 but a hell of a lot bigger and just better. A lot of Wawas offer gas to. We talked, Vaped together (his vape). Then I started to ask him to sell me a vape but that is not why he stopped hanging out with me. But around this time he started getting depressed, and he only was texting me. And he has a heart condition for like the past year (found out 2 weeks ago). 

So today he said ""yes"" to hang out then it was he'll hang out with me in a couple hours. Im honestly not sure if he is purposly avoiding me or not. He had a sleep over yesterday but I basically can't go and he knows that because my dad will require his grandmom to be home. I kinda was thinking he was avoiding me today because I thought he was still with friends but I'm friends on snap with his group and there all home. So what is happening with my friend? Is he depressed today, sick? How do I get him to open up more to me? 

He didn't want to tell me he started vaping again, then he posted a vaping vid, said it was from a long time ago, then opened up. This was before he told me about the heart condition. Then opened up to his depression then opened up to his heart condition. Should I ask him tonight is he feeling alright or will I be a pest because he will think I'm trying to hang out. I'm worried about him especially because he vapes, smokes weed and drinks energy a lot WITH a heart condition. People say teens shouldn't vape but I was gonna buy a vape off of him possibilty all of the ones he has because he needs to quit.

I was born and lived for 14 years in A and both my parents are A-iens. I love that country and will forever want to live there my whole life, but A  is a poor and not so advanced country so after my 14th bday I mooved to L with my brother to live with my grandma where I have access to a better education. (this was my dad's choice and we were all okay with it, it was also a strategic decision too because he had some financial troubles but it doesn't matter here) I went there to an A-ien school because there's a big A-ien diaspora in L (my dad lived half his life there and went to that same school) I loved the school I made more friends there than I had ever made in A and they were all A-ien. My big bro finished school when I was 16, he went to F to college and he left me in L alone with my grandma. My parents visited sometimes. 

1 year later at 17, 1 and a half years before graduating I started to gain feeling for this girl that I was friends with for the past 3 years. I told her, she said she likes me too and with some difficultues at first we built a very healthy and loving relationship. 

I was obsessed with science I wanted to go to my brother and do college in F because it was cheaper and better education. (Also I have F passport, long story) I talked about it with my family they all were okay,but I also had a gf of 1+ years that I loved with all my heart and was ready to spend all my life with. I told her, she said that she was okay with me going and that we could try long distance relationship, she was A-ien so her future would probably going to be in A too so we thought we could meet there when we both finished college.

 At 18 I moved to F and lived there for 1 year with my bro. I started studying like a maniac. We were financially covered by my dad and he was kind  enough to pay flights to L and A to see my gf and my family.

1 year later at 19, so 5 months ago, my bro finished his college which he hated and went to the US to do movie school. Everything is perfect with my gf it's been 3 year we are in a very loving relationship. 

I want to go to L all the time to my gf but also I miss A and my family. Idk if I should drop my school and go to A to work in my dad's business (it's not that bad... It's not science...) or go to L to my gf and all my friends. 

So now I'm in a country (F) that I hate, where I have no friends, no gf, no family and at this point I have only my classes to motivate me (doesn't motivate alot). I am unhappy here, but I know I love physics and all my life I have dreamed to do what I am doing now.

Essentially her Mom died when she was young and her Dad basically turned into an abusive alcoholic who used to beat my GF. I don’t mind this at all, because I was sexually abused by a woman (close friend of family) for years. So we understand each other in a way, and we are like an awesome duo because we both support each other and say cheesy things to each other to kinda act like we are a superhero team. 

Anyways my GF told me something the other day and it’s just been bothering me. She’s 19 and has been with 14 guys.... since she was 15. She said she often ran away from home when her Dad got too aggressive, and sometimes needed a place to stay and of course teenage guys would let her stay over but expect something in return. My girl is really cute, great body, she’s a hottie. 

I’ve only been with her and it just bothers me to think all these other sleazy high school dudes were up in my GF just because she was desperate and stuff. She said she often didn’t sleep with them, or she went to a friends house etc. 

She also said she had a boyfriend before me and also had casual sex she WANTED and initiated. Which brings her number up to 14.

At Max I would tell the person that I was interested and therefore I would stop talking to them, because it was bad and would inevitably end in heartbreak.

Just this christmas my aunt and uncle started screaming at each other at the dinner table over practically nothing (she didnt like his tone of voice). If we sat down like a normal family, watched a movie or even ate food (there is never even food at my family gatherings) i'd be totally okay with staying home,. But obviously that isn't the case. 

So this new years i want to go out for the first time. Im not going to like a party or anything, just meeting up with my girlfriend and 4 closest friends and celebrating the day. I tried to respectfully bring this up to my mom but she quickly got angry. Whenever i try to go see my gf or friends (i see them once a week) both my parents have a knack for calling me selfish. This time tho she took it up a notch and accused me of ""always choosing people i dont know over my family"" - like i dont know my childhood friends apparently - and saying im never home (not true at all, i am literally almost always home), rude, selfish, etc. Like apparently i'm selfish for wanting to see my best friends (who dont go to my school) like once a week. Apparently im selfish for wanting to celebrate New Years with my friends for once. I tried reasoning with her but didnt want it to turn into an argument so i left it alone

I would hate to celebrate the end of the decade - the only holiday that actually means something to me since we arent religious - seeing my dysfunctional family shout at each other. For more context my parents are outspoken racists and hate poor people as well. Ive been dating my gf for 3 years now but they still don't like her since she's indigenous. My best friend who ive known since i was 8 is white, but his mom smokes cigs and they're not that well off so they hate him too. In addition to him they're convinced all my friends are bums. Never mind the fact that two of them are pursuing careers as lawyers, or how good their grades are, because theyre either colored ( we are literally Syrian ourselves) or poor they're bums who aren't good for me

Sorry for the rambling post, i would just appreciate any advice",27Dec2019,1
953,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for 2 years, I’m 25 and have a decent job, 5 year plan, etc.

She was recently diagnosed with depression and we have both been working on routines and habits to mitigate and improve her lifestyle. I’ve been an active supporter of her, but always as a partner. I realize the age difference and have learned to be their for support and comfort and not to “dad” her with constant advice.

Last year though, was an admitted low for her (her words). She basically failed school and now has to start again from the previous year. She got a 3.0 this year and I have been boosting up that accomplishment because she worked her freaking tail off. She just realized though that even with her hard work, she still has 5 full semesters left and doesn’t think she can do it. I think she’s made up here mind about cutting her losses and taking an associates degree. I fully support any life choice she chooses to make. I’m just worried that she is taking a short gain that doesn’t have long term gains, not in terms of $$ but in terms of fulfillment and enjoyment. I think I’m just ignorant on what is possible with an associates degree and I don’t know what I should do?

I just want her to be happy, school is obviously contributing to that but she might not have found the pursuit that makes her happy? Any advice is appreciated.",27Dec2019,1
