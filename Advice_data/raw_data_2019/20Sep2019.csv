0,"About a month ago, me and my girlfriend broke up. We have been dating online for about 20 months. We've had so much fun with each other and spent mostly everyday with each other. She broke up with me on August 18th because we had so many silly fights but we always worked them out. We talked a lot and we still said that we do love each other but she wants to focus on other things. She took a 6 day break after that and once she came back, we decided to stay best friends. For the next two weeks after that, we've been having fun with each other a lot and have just been hanging out. Then on about September 8th, she told me that she needed a break and said it wasn't my fault. Before she left, I asked what was the reason but she said there was no reason and she needed a break followed by a goodbye. I emailed her twice since then and got no replies. I know she didn't block me but I stopped emailing her because I figured she needs some space. I'm assuming she is taking a break from me in reality because we've been having tons of fun as friends and it might be hitting her hard emotionally. I just don't know what to really do, it's been 11 days and I feel like I need to just hear a response from her so bad but I know she also needs space. She never told me how long she may be away for either so I'm just confused. I truly miss her.",20Sep2019,1
1,"These girls have been trying to start things with me for over a year, I was friends with a girl from their group and she used me to talk about me and get good friends with the group of girls and it worked. They said someone was after me and that was the first thing, now the girl I used to be friends with has told me on two occasions about  things her friends have said about me and lied about who said them.

She said “everyones saying you are a dyke” and I asked who said that and she tried to lie to me and say my brother and my cousin, then she said “I love your bangs, but everyone else says you are ugly and your bangs make you look like Dora the explora” I asked who said it and she again lied and said it was my cousin and his friend, after I called her bluff it was her friends, I told her I wasn’t interested in hearing what people say about me because it’s none of my business, people get talked about all the time and I’m not special either.

Anyway she’s trying to get me to talk about them and then get a fight on the go so they can have a reason to jump me imo, it’s gotten so bad that I can’t walk anywhere without being laughed at, talked about, humiliated all the time; I can’t even go out and buy or have a smoke anymore as soon as I go to the smoking grounds everyone looks at me funny and laughs at me when I turn to walk away. I feel so crushed and like less than nothing all the time.

Today a girl that I was friends with asked me to hang out after school and me not normally hanging out with people I said yes, well after school I asked her if we were still hanging out and she lied to me and said “my stepmom said I can’t” so I said right on and walked away and then she hopped on a bus with our mutual “friend” I asked them if I could hang out with them, and they said “I don’t know,” so I got off the bus and cried the whole way home. Everyone at this school hates me.

I would be lying if I said people didn’t want to hurt me because they want to hurt me and have tried to start things to have reasons to do so, I have no doubt in my mind people are spreading things about me, I have never felt this treatment before. Wherever I go people are laughing at me, and if someone has anyone else but me to hangout with they’ll take the chance and ditch me and then lie about it. I feel worthless sometimes, but tonight I got a full pack of my own king size smokes so we’ll see how it goes considering people won’t even sell to me anymore, even people I have been buying from for a long time.

What should I do about this?
How do I handle it?
How do I go from here?",20Sep2019,1

3,"I’m going through a very confusing time in life right now. I’m a 22 year old college dropout, unemployed and using up my savings. 
I had a good job but I (and my family and friends) felt that I was being taken advantage of. I worked for a small family owned business where we were constantly understaffed and overworked. The owners of the company are really great people and I know they really valued me but I just couldn’t handle all the stress anymore so I quit the moment I saw an easy way out.  I told them the reason I had to quit was because I was moving to a different state with my fiancé for his work and they told me I was always welcome back. 

I moved 7 hours away from home and all was great for a while but now my fiancé is also unemployed. We are back in our hometown staying at parents/friends houses just not really doing much of anything. I don’t know what the plan is or if we are going back to our home, 7 hours away, anytime soon. My fiancé says he’s waiting for a call back to get back to work but it’s been a month and nothing. I feel like he’s not taking any initiative and really just relying on other people to hand him something. 

If I come back home I can go back to my old job but then my fiancé might be sent out of state again and I won’t be able to go with him this time. 
I’m just really tired of sitting around pinching my pennies while my fiancé sits around playing video games waiting for someone to knock on the door and give him a job. 

I’m just really confused on what to do and starting to get discouraged. I need advice on everything. Do I come back home for good? Do I go back to my old job? Do I go back to school? Does anyone know what they’re doing with their life? How do I find something that I love doing? 

Any advice helps. Thanks guys.",20Sep2019,1

6,"Some backstory: my mom was a foster child so she never knew her family history. The only information we have is that her birth father was part of some sort of cancer society. My mom has had lumps in her chest for about a year but her anxiety is stopping her from getting it checked out. 

For about a year I've had lumps on my inner thighs and private area that just come and go and dont hurt. I told her today and she said they could be cancerous and I should get them checked out but I'm having the same problem as her. I'm scared.. Finding out I have cancer or that my mom has cancer would flip my whole world upside down.

also, they are not STD's. These are dime, nickel and sometimes quarter sized lumps that are not pop-able

I'm looking for ways to get past this. Maybe if someone knows what my lumps are that would be nice. I know we should both get it checked out but life is actually going nice and I have too many health issues. Help please.",20Sep2019,3
7,"Long story short, my (17M) friend (20F) started to see this guy and she told me that they slept together, I asked her how it happened, and here is what made me disturbed:  
She: ""He picked me up, and took me to his room and laid me on his bed, I tried to get away from him but I couldn't, so I finally gave up""  
Me: ""WHAT THE FUCK!""  
She said that she tried to stop him because she was ""shy"" I don't buy it however, I asked her ""would you have stopped it if you could"" winch she replied ""yes"" while nodding her head/  
note that she is comfortable sleeping with him right now, but their first time was at the very least ""weird"" to me, that's not how sex usually happens.

8,"Hello, I'm a 22F and my partner is 25M, I have been best friends with him for 6 years, and we have dated 2+ years so far.

I use to really enjoy sexual stuff with my boyfriend, he's the first guy I could ever do it with as before I was too scared and had terrible anxiety about it, we would do it once or twice a week and it would be great 95% of the time, we would try new things and have fun.

Recently thought the last 2-3 months I don't enjoy it anymore, It hurts when we have sex, I feel like I look disgusting.. I feel extremely anxious sometimes during it and I can't get it out of my head, then every time we are done I cry, I feel like I'm going to be left and I feel extremely scared, I don't know why this happens as I want to be intimate with him.

9,"Hey all, sorry now for my poor english, but I’m facing a bit of a tricky situation here. I am a freshman in college (F18) this year in the States and I have noticed some attention from one of the TAs (teacher’s assistant) (M19) in my anthropology class.  In the beginning it seemed like he was making up excuses to chat with me after class, asking me all sorts of questions that had no real reason to be brought up. Honestly, it was very charming as I definitely did (and still do) have a bit of a crush on him. 

Since this, he also has extended several invites toward me (asking me out to drink with his friends, suggesting we go to a concert together, etc.) and has complimented me in ways I am not sure a TA should. That said, I am 85% sure that he has said these in a romantic way. If this is the case and he asks again, what should I do? Am I even right in thinking it is romantic in nature? I am very much attracted to him and I would really like to go out with him, but I wouldn’t want to put him or myself in a potentially weird/negative situation.

Any advice would help!",20Sep2019,6

12,"My (m24) girlfriend (22) is amazing. I do genuinely love her. We've been together for two years. I love most things about her, but she's sometimes a bit babyish if that makes sense.

One example today was she was leading a group and I watched her and she was like a bit OTT. She was jumping around a lot and skipping around like introducing herself to others. Basically I could tell she was being replied with a polite laugh.

I tried to mention that she should maybe chill a bit when meeting new people and she's taken it really bad and it's made her self conscious. I feel like I kinda had to say it because she's not aware herself but at the same time I really don't want to hurt her feelings anymore. Do I just leave it or do I explain myself more?",20Sep2019,1
13,"I know why I feel this way, but how do I get over it?

It stems from my childhood because everyone, especially my mom, ignored me and paid more attention to my *perfect* sister. My parents, our relatives and all of their friends favoured my sister and I was forced to be sad and quiet in the background.

I was also adopted and felt so different and out of place next to her.

They started to think I was *shy* because I was quiet all the time, but the truth is I was just sad, unconfident and thought no one liked me because of how they treated me.

I am naturally an extrovert. I love being the centre of attention in social situations.

When I learned how to socialize, I realized that people were only ignoring me because I was sitting there solemnly, feeling like no one cared about what I had to say, expecting them to instigate conversations with me. This made me come off as like I didn't want to talk to people. But once I just started talking to people they were more than happy to talk to me about practically anything. Now I'm able to talk about almost anything to almost anyone.

I even found that I can talk to complete strangers about extraterrestrials and my spiritual beliefs and they are usually more than happy to join in!

Unfortunately, this is not the case with my family. In the past, my family really hurt me and let me down.

I was born with spiritual abilities that they didn't understand, plus as an adoptee, I really had nothing in common with them. They were not supportive of my spiritual beliefs at all, it scared them and they started to call me crazy. They sent me away to psych wards and medicated me. They didn't know for certain that I was metis, but I sensed spiritually that I was, and got involved in my native culture over the years, and they never supported that either. When I finally got proof after finding my birth family, they apologized for doubting me. This happened so many times, when I would get to say *I told you so*.

Eventually, over the years they ended up witnessing many paranormal things with me and got concrete evidence that I was not crazy. They all came a long way and started to believe me and became open to my spirituality. But even now, when my mom says she believes me now and I can talk to her about everything spiritual that is going on with me, she still clings onto some of the old habits, like the habit of avoiding everything I talk about.

And I don't think it's that the spiritual talks make her uncomfortable, because it happens when I talk to her about *anything*. At first, I thought it was just her personality type, that she couldn't sit still for long and constantly had to interrupt me to go do other things. But then I see her with her friends and other people, and she's able to sit and talk to them for a really long time. She will literally go out of her way when she's visiting me, to talk to someone else other than me, even if it's a perfect stranger. It was always this way. She always made me feel like talking to me was such a burden on her. Sometimes she'd use these excuses like ""Well, I've got to go and get my stuff done"" after cutting our visit super short. And back in the day when I didn't have my licence so she had to drive me around a lot, that was understandable. I'm a very extroverted person and like to talk and spend time with people I love, and she was always like, ""no i need my space"".

But that's not the case anymore. We rarely see each other now. I have a car and live on my own, and whenever she comes to visit me or I go to visit her, she only wants to see me for like ten minutes, and won't even engage in a conversation much. Like today, I asked her out to lunch and every time I tried to talk to her, she would change the subject, get up to do something else, and then she talked to the waiter for about ten minutes until my meal was finished. I didn't get to talk to her much. The worst thing now is that every time I see her I feel down and disheartened, like just seeing her now lowers my mood because I expect her to dodge everything I say, and then she does.

But then she'll happily mention something random and I will dodge it and not be interested. So it's creating a weird cycle. It's almost like I'm mirroring her back. It's like I get the sense from her that she's uninterested so then I become uninterested, but that's not like me at all, because normally I can talk to people about anything random and it doesn't bother me. Yet when I'm with her I feel depressed and irritable because I feel like she doesn't want to talk to me, and of course this doesn't make it any easier for us to communicate.

And what really upset me about today was that the thing she decided to talk with the waiter about was my sister. And they both just ignored me. And I just let it happen, because I didn't really know how to include myself in that I mean how could I start talking about myself or change the subject without coming off as jealous of my sister lol. The truth is, I don't want to be anything like my sister, I just wish my parents would stop bragging about her all the time when I'm around. They make me feel so worthless compared to her. I have so many accomplishments and things to be proud of, yet they never brag about me to strangers, just my sister. And the weird thing is I don't even think these people care about hearing about my sister. The waiter doesn't even know her. But he does know my mom and I.

I have no problem talking to other people, but trying to deal with this issue with my mom around is impossible. She just allows people to ignore me, in fact it's like she encourages it. I mean the polite thing for her to do would be to include me in the conversation but she doesn't.

Anyway, my sister is coming home soon to visit. And I am not looking forward to it because I don't know how to deal with it. I really want to be authentic and true to myself but they make me feel so crappy. She's the worst, she can be so condescending and she ignores me more than they do. I don't want it to be many days of everyone bowing down to my perfect sister and giving her all the attention like usual. It makes me feel so aweful.

And when I hear myself admit that I just want attention, and I want people to treat me like I'm special for once, it's like damn I really need to work on that issue because it makes me feel so egotistical.",20Sep2019,2

15,"Hello, for the past year I've been forming a long distance relationship with someone. We called it off a couple months ago due to some really bad irl issues but those were ironed over a while after.

Though, recently a lot of my suspicions have been proven right about them. I've already had troubles trusting them because they've lied about a lot of stuff to me. The first ones were pretty small, like where they lived etc. They said it was because they have dealt with people tracking them down and borderline stalking them, which I totally understand why it would be a reason to be a tad put off from trusting someone with their more personal information.

I'm not going to name every small thing they have lied about, since it would take a long time and wouldn't be that important in the greater context. Just keep in mind I already had trouble trusting them 100%

&amp;#x200B;

Recently they have lied about a lot more serious things, though. Lying, saying that they weren't talking to other people when I just asked causally what they were up to before we started talking. Another one would be pretending that they were away when they weren't or saying they had to go do something really important and then just go listen to music or play a game, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Today things got a little worse. They started sharing their screen because they wanted to show me something and they accidentally clicked into their ""friends"" discord. First couple messages I saw were ""Good morning beautiful"" which they replied ""Good morning handsome. ;)"" and other things like ""Missing you a lot"" and ""Thinking about you"" generic stuff, I know.

I confronted them about it and they started with again.. generic stuff like ""We're just friends"" and ""Oh, it's just a joke"" they kept changing their story until I found out that they were in a relationship before hand (supposedly not during the time we were together and that they called off really soon after) and that these kinds of messages have been going back a little over a year back.

To back track a bit, every time they shared their screen with me, they'd ALWAYS skip over their ""friends"" discord. I never brought it up because I believe in privacy and what'not.

&amp;#x200B;

I got them to tell the truth about a lot of things today (or at least hopefully the truth) but I feel like they are still hiding stuff.

They have always said ""I don't want to put a label on us because I do not want to get hurt"" but they were the one doing the hurting. Today they said they wanted to commit to me, but I have a feeling that's just damage control.

I don't want to be paranoid about everything they do, questioning if it's a lie or if they are hiding something from me. I do love them, though my love is being heavily strained here. They say they love me, but who knows if that could be a lie or not.

I need advice on what to do. Should I give them one last chance? or should I just call all of this off? or any other advice would be welcomed severely.",20Sep2019,1
16,Hello everyone! So right now i have my hair about medium average. It took me a year to grow it out and the thing is i have been going through so many things in my life that i have not been getting the proper nutrition and dont have enough money to buy the adequate food. Therefore i have been loosing a lot of hair. I wanted to cut it short like around shoulder length. Guys my question is do you find girls with short hair attractive. Its just i feel like with longer hair i will look more femine and pretty. But i have to cut it because i also dye it. I try to buy the hair dye when i have leftover money and i was thinking of dying it black. I would dye it brown but its too much dye that i have to buy every 6 weeks. So i would have short black hair. Is that something that you guys would find attractive?,20Sep2019,0
17,"Today there was this guy let’s call him Henry. 
Henry came into my place of work to get a service done, where I work we have a salesman who’s job is to give tickets but also to up sell. 
Henry was wearing his work uniform and he works for a cellphone company let’s say at&amp;t with his name tag on which is why I know his name is Henry. 
While he was paying he proceeded to ask me if the guy outside was a manager and I said no he’s our salesman. 
Then he followed that with “ well that guy out there is a fucken dick” 
So I just looked at him... so he started explaining that he was trying to sell him something and he was saying no so the salesman said ok and walked away grabbed his ticket and handed it to him. 
Now this guy is wearing his at&amp;t uniform so I proceed to tell him like I’m sorry but that’s his job to sell and he should understand if he’s also in sales( which I know why did I engage)  then I said you’re wearing your work uniform so I know you work customer service like it’s not ill intended we’re just doing our job. I also told him he shouldn’t call people a “dick” because that’s rude and uncalled for, he could’ve made his complaint in a nicer way and since he also works in customer service I did say he would probably get offended if someone called him a “ dick” so to give us the same respect he expects to receive. 


So once he left he decided to write us a yelp review under another name but since this just happened I know it’s him
This is what he wrote 
“ “The salesman was rude. He used a dry erase marker to write prices of different packages on my window while trying to upsell me.When I told him I only wanted a hand wash, he turned around and walked out without saying anything and handed me my ticket. 

I told the cashier he was a “ dick” . She defended him by telling me I shouldn’t call him a “ dick” and that he’s in sales and only doing his job. She saw that I was wearing my sales work uniform and told me that I would be mad too if I didn’t make a sale. No empathy at all from the cashier at all. She was more concerned with defending her coworker.”",20Sep2019,1

32,"Hello,

My current car is reaching the end of it's life and I am in the market for a new vehicle. While doing research online I read that it is beneficial to be pre approved for a loan when going to look at cars. I own my house and am looking to sell it in the near future but not before I get a reliable vehicle. 

When I am speaking with the loan officer should I mention that I plan to sell my house and turn around and pay off the loan? I'm not sure if that information should be shared. 
 I'm looking to get a loan for the car at 72/mo and the interest rate doesn't really bother me due to my intention to turn around and pay off the loan once the house is sold. 

Any information in regards to getting a good agreement on a loan would be helpful.

33,"Soo basically what the tittle says.. I am 19 (M) and have lived with my parents my whole life.. (moved away to uni 1 years ago)

What has brought this feeling to me? Basically my friends and I had 3 beers (in total) at this Pool bar... and we had such a great time that we eventually left the place at 11:30 pm ish.. and I realized at 2 am when I am in bed that we forgot to pay! My heart started racing and I couldn’t focus, I call my friends (which are still partying) if they paid the bills - negative... I quickly put on my trousers back on and immediately ran to the bar so I could pay the bill. Even called the place to apologize and tell them that I am running to get there before they close. 

Got there. Paid the bill. Staff gave me weird eyes but were great full. I was apologetic.

Now.. I know that what I did was the right thing. No questions about it, and I would 100% do it again.

But it got me thinking.. am I living on the “line” sooo precisely that I freaked out over not paying a bill which was 9 euros total? I have never done anything “adventurous” in my life.. ughh i cant explain how I am feeling over this.

Basically, is it healthy to freak out over things like this? Because I doubt half of people my age would have acted the way I did... maybe I am too obsessive when it regards things that are not “right”? How can I live life a bit more carefree? Because it got me thinking that I never done anything in 19  years.. and maybe that is the reason my friends are so far in between.. maybe that is the reason I never had a serious girlfriend? The reason I ruin relationships? How do I stop seeing black and white?",20Sep2019,1

35,"Background: I have a learning disability and ADHD, so I've met a lot of different people in resource rooms but not the best way to interact

I'm in a community college calc class, a certain guy sits in front of me. We exchanged numbers (i do that with several people per class to exchange support.) I helped him before once and that was it. Every now and then I get a 'hey' at random hours. (I have an overload number of classes and work in between, I don't have much free time. He knows how many classes I take). 

A few weeks later and he starts staring at me, after a while I've avoided (has my past with a guy with similar behavior and didn't end well). I can be on my laptop or taking to my friend about a class. A few days ago, he used my number to get my snap. Ok no biggie I guess. I didn't add back. Yesterday morning a few min before I woke up (6 ish for work), I get a Instagram request from him. I had never told him my last name not did my professor announce. I ignore, this can't be good. 

I spoke to the same friend that is in that class (has a better background with psych than me) and thinks that he may have autism. (I am trying not to convey this as a good/bad thing to you guys.)

I had that class tonight, with the only dialog with him was ""you left your headphones under your seat"" ""thanks""

15 min later I got a Facebook request. Never gave him my last name. (6:45 EST). 7:08 pm a poke on Facebook. 

What do I do? If he does have autism, how do I communicate to him properly to stop. Do I text him, wait till class? Advice? Error

(Remember how I mentioned that I have ADHD) He is typically on social media or youtube in the front row of a 30 person class and leans far back where he in close to me. Btw I'm short so i need to be near the front as possible. I don't know if this is any indicators or so. 

If I don't reply I have a big exam tomorrow afternoon. The class will meet again on Tuesday.

Me- 14F
Sis 1- 10F
Sis 2- 12F


My sisters have plenty of hobbies and activities to keep them occupied, i however usually only do one sport and one side activity. 

Sis 1: Soccer, violin, choir, tutoring
Sis 2: Gymnastics, Cheer (and a nasty attitude)

Both of my sisters are falling behind at school, (C’s and D’s mostly) I however am keeping nearly straight A’s, with the exception of a B

Every day my sisters have to make up work, they get yelled at for falling behind, and get yelled at for refusing to do work. 

My parents have begun using me as a model example. “u/tryna_be_wholesome can do it so why cant you?” 

Im worried that if my grades fall even slightly that my parents will lose it. They are both nurses and have worked hard for our life so they expect the best. 

How can i deal with the pressure being put on me? I feel like they are depending on me to follow in their footsteps. I’ve always wanted to be just like them and if i fail now something bad might happen.",20Sep2019,1

So I’ve never posted on here before, but I have quite a story and I need advice. 
A few months ago I had a friends with benefits relationship with a guy I really liked. When we actually got together to mess around, he stopped talking to me and said he’d rather be friends when I confronted him. I was crushed, I liked him a ton. Loved him, maybe. 

Then at work on one of the days following, I saw the guy who sexually assaulted me last year. I had an intense panic attack and after talking with my therapist, we decided to eliminate as much stress as possible to make healing from his abuse an easier process. I’ve been off of Instagram and snapchat for about a month and have two months left until I’m gonna log back on. My parents thought this was a good idea so they have the login information to those accounts until November. 

The thing is, I miss this guy like crazy. He was kind of an ass to me when we left things but I know that’s not the real him. He hurt me yes, but I loved him so much and I want to know if/how I should reach out when I can. I’m committed to my social media break and so are my parents, so logging into snapchat right now to text him isn’t an option. And I don’t have his number either. 

My worry is he won’t want to talk to me. Maybe he moved on with his life, maybe he has a girlfriend. I don’t know. Should I reach out to him? What should I say and what would happen? Someone said if it’s meant to be it will be, but I’m also afraid of getting hurt again.",20Sep2019,1
41,"I know at least one person will respond to this with, ""What the fuck is wrong with you, you sound like a whiny bitch, just pay your mom"" but please - emotions aside - what is an actual argument I have here?  
My brother and I are in our 20s and live with our parents. My mom has been nagging us about cleaning around the house more so we've been really improving our cleaning habits.  Really, we have.  
Well one day she was randomly like, ""A maid is coming tomorrow."" They came and cleaned. She asked to borrow $40 from me for a tip, which I gave her.  
Today I asked her for my 40 back. She was like, ""Actually you owe me $20 because your portion of the maid was $60. I was like wtf.. is my brother paying? She said he's not going to pay because he agreed to cook dinner for the whole family once in a while in exchange for the maid services.  
I don't think this is righg at all because 1) I have been helping my parents out with their business for a little while now as I have recently been trying to phase out of my fulltime job.  I help my parents' business for free. 2) The whole thing about my brother cooking for the fam once in a while is such bullshit because I doubt he spends as much per month as he would if he was helping pay for the maid. 3) I hate my bro's cooking - I usually never eat it and end up eating something on my own - not that this is a good point really because I guess that's my choice to not eat it, but still why should I pay for the cleanliness of his bedroom if I don't want to eat his shit fattening food? .. 4) If we're going to get all technical about the money, last night my brother used up my salad and TONIGHT my family is eating my expensive cheese that I use for quesadillas! 5) My parents are rich.. they dont need help with the maid.. I know this is some ploy to make me mad because my bro has always been the favorite which is another reason he's getting away with not really paying, 6) I agreed BEFORE this maid thing to clean more, and have been putting words into action by cleaning, especially the kitchen, every day, 7) I never even got notice about this maid service and I wouldn't have agreed to the maids she chose because they're kind of pricey, 8) My mom didnt even like the maid service - she said they did a crap job and doesn't want to use them again. So this should've been a trial thing on her part and not something we should've had to help pay for.. regarding this point I know you'll all say ""okay well since it's a one-time thing then just pay it and drop it"" but *no*, it's the principle of the whole thing and who's to say she won't just hire them or someone else again?  
So yeah.. I would be more than happy to pay by cleaning up a lot more than pay these maids. Not nails mention maids kinda stress me out too, i feel like i need to hide my jewelry. Do I have any kind of case at all?",20Sep2019,1

49,"Okay, so here's the deal,

I'm going to be fighting a school presidential election soon, and I fear that my social ineptness is going to let me down. I've gradually become more and more introverted during my school life, I don't know why it happened, but it's something I really want to get rid off.

Over 30% of our school are the kids who are actually fucked up and spend their time juuling in bathrooms and talking about how much pot they smoked today (or at least try to stay cool by faking it), I find it especially hard to talk to people like these because there's literally nothing in common between us. These guys are the kind of people I want behind my campaign, because 1. they bring a lot of votes, and 2. if you're friends with them they'll campaign for you and do all sorts of crazy shit. I don't know how to strike up conversations with these people and the large groups they're part of, I'd also like to state that these people are complete failures in their academics and are known to gang up on people who mess with them.

Secondly, there's the ""cool"" group, containing the people who're always at school parties *(note: I've never been invited to a single of them),* it's not like I don't want to talk to them, I actually do, but I just feel that I'll be rejected from their friend circle and just be a major embarrassment.

One of my other issues is that when i'm not sitting with anyone on a table, or walking with anyone, i tend to get anxious and feel out of place, for reasons such as: (i'll be perceived as a loner), i know i sound like a sissy, but the internet is the only place where i can express who i really am.

I'd also like to say that no matter how hard i try, i think i come across as cold and very skeptical, which I feel is true due to the nature of my studies and what I love(programming), i'm a person that relies more on his head than heart, and i feel this affects my socializing(including my luck with girls).

i'm sorry for giving you guys a god damn essay, but advice would be great, and i'd be really grateful.

thanks",20Sep2019,1
50,"I am F17 and my boyfriend has not been going to school for months now, to the point that everyone worries about him and he received a letter today that he is on truancy. He is hard to communicate with. He does not like to share what's he's feeling and what he's going through emotionally. He will only text me less than 3 times a week before I go see him on the weekends because I am busy with school. 

We also have some communication problems as he would like to push me and his mother away. He would like to say, ""Let's talk about this tomorrow."" As he is not planning to talk to me for days after that. He also says, ""I will try better,"" as I bring up the subject to him, but no improvement occurred on his end.

His mother is also having trouble to open up with him. His mother is a very nice person, and she and I approached him in different ways, but nothings working. He stays home and sleeps most of the time, and plays video games, his mother claims. 

I am ripping my hair off with this situation, as this is not the first time he has done this. He is a senior, and the school told his mom he cannot be in homebound this year since this is his last year and he abused the power of being a home and does none of his work last year, as a result he is behind on classes already. 

As his girlfriend, what can I do to be his support system? How can I approach to him and talk to him about this without him pushing me away? How can I bring him to school? How and what to do to strengthen our communication of our relationship? I am despite needing advice.",20Sep2019,1

52,"i (17F) am friends with a guy (17M) that i used to date. we were friends for a long time and he was probably one of the closest people to me. a couple weeks ago i found out that—long story short—three months ago he had cornered a girl i know and demanded a handjob from her, which luckily she got out of without getting hurt or anything. after speaking to a couple other girls i found out this was not the first time and he had done the same thing with another girl. i read up on sexual assault and realized he was doing the same thing to me while we were dating, which was almost a year ago. i didn’t realize it at the time because i blamed everything on myself. another friend told me she thinks that he, consciously or unconsciously, is preying on insecure girls and manipulating them. i confronted him about it and told him not to talk to me again. 

so why do i still want to be friends with him? by my standards he’s a bad person and i can’t forget what he did to me and two other girls. i don’t know if i can trust him with everything he’s lied about. but i don’t have a lot of friends and i really miss hanging out with him. i feel really lonely. we do the same sport and i see him at practice every day and it sucks. i know he wants to be friends with me still. i don’t want to be so weak that i forgive him so easily. i don’t know if he has learned anything. i just feel really betrayed—he didn’t ruin my life or anything with this, honestly i’m more mad that he did this to other people than me. should i try to make up with him? is that a horrible move? there’s only one year left until college, but there’s also a chance that we could be going to university together as well... what should i do?

55," 

Im a female 18 yrs old, with a odd body shape/weight. I was always a very skinny girl when i was young, which was not appealing because i was pretty boney and had no curves whatso ever, i was also bullied for being that skinny, which led people questioning if i was anorexic. i really hated being skinny but did nothing about it, i was trying to be content with myself but i have self-esteem issues. When i turn 16 i noticed that my hips were starting to become wide, it was subtle really, but ive been such a square body type i could notice it. though i didnt think much of it. then i turn 17 and not only do my hips become even more wider but my bum (sorry) aslo becomes more bigger and chunkier thighs, i was actually really surprised and thrilled! it was like that for a long time till i turn 18, and it well it concerns me: i havent been eating well nor sleeping the hours i should, mostly due to insomnia, which is something i never had before, and i look paler and skinnier, But really my upper body is just bones and really skinny, i really dont like that, But actually my lower body is, pretty thic. my thighs are really thick my hips are pretty wide and my bum (again sorry) is actually really nice and big. so it baffles me on how im skinny from my waist to the top but chunky/thic from my waist down. and um its even more weird because i had weighed myself and i weigh: 88 pounds. thats not good at all. But it baffles me more because how could i be that weight but still have a peach body? (i have small boobs so i do not qualify for a Hourglass body)

so pretty much what im asking is: is this normal? should i seek a doctor, to understand why my body is like this? do you think that even though this may or may not be normal, its something i either shouldnt worry about or actually be happy for?

btw i dont work out at all, no matter if i do eat i feel full after 8 bites, i sit on my computer all day because i have school work and i sleep alot during the day.

im sorry if the fact is im not taking care of myself as i should be, ive always had trouble doing so, i do want to change that but its really hard.",20Sep2019,1
56,"I'm 29 years old and 5 foot 3. All of the women in my family are tiny. My great grandmother was my height and never broke 100 pounds. My mother was in the 90-98 pound range into her 30's. She's now in her 70's and only 117. My aunts are the same.   


In High School, I was teased about my weight. Some teachers accused me of being anorexic and wouldn't believe me when I said I ate a lot. It became a joke with my friends because they knew how much I ate. But, I was always super self-conscious and hated my body. In High School my weight went between 100 - 104 lbs. This led to me adopting really unhealthy eating habits in an attempt to gain weight and, eventually, I just started eating crappy foods because it felt good. At my worst, I was eating a LOT of calories. I'd start off every day with the sausage egg McMuffin at mcdonalds with two hash browns. I'd then snack on chips and junk throughout the day. For lunch, I'd make a ton of pasta and then continue eating snacks until supper time when I'd usually have seconds and thirds. At night I'd eat ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, etc. It was like I never felt full. I was eating the equivalent of a full dinner as a ""night snack"" every night. I remember once I went through a really bad during graduate school where dinner a few times a week was a BigMac with fries, McNuggets, and ice cream. The weird thing? Even at my highest calorie intake I never got beyond 117lbs. However, I recently got blood work done. Everything (thyroid, liver, kidneys, etc.) was good. My cholesterol was another story. It was SUPER high. It scared me. It scared my doctor. I adopted a healthier lifestyle. Now, I eat in the mediterranean style; plenty of whole grains, legumes, fish, poultry, olive oil, nuts, and vegetables. I allow myself one ""junk"" treat per week but otherwise I eat very healthy. I still eat HUGE portions because I'm always hungry, but it's healthy stuff and my cholesterol has gone down and will continue to go down. I've never been one for exercise but I did start swimming once a week. I feel like I have more energy and I'm happier.  


However, I've dropped back down to 107lbs without even trying. I thought maybe I wasn't eating enough calories but I counted for a week straight and I'm averaging about 1,500 - 1,600 calories per day. Sometimes more on days when I allow myself to have a treat. Colleagues have asked if I'm ok, if I'm eating, etc. It makes me feel terrible about myself. I almost want to go back to eating junk so I can look normal.  


It's like, either I eat like crap and look normal or I eat well and feel good but everyone who doesn't know me assumes I have an eating disorder. :(",20Sep2019,3
57," Hi everyone. I'm going to keep this as vague as I possibly can in hopes that nobody I know finds this. It's not something that anybody in my family has told other people yet because we just found out the biopsy results this afternoon. I apologize if this is rambling.

About a week ago, my aunt (we'll call her Carol) had a biopsy done for a mass that doctors found in her brain. My aunt's friend and neighbor (we'll call her Anne), after not hearing from her that morning, went to check on my aunt and found her with her head down in her dining room chair. When Anne tried calling my aunt's name and shaking her, she wasn't responding, but she was breathing. Anne got her husband and they brought my aunt to the hospital and called her sister (my aunt Beth).

For reference, my aunt Carol is usually a very energetic, but pretty aloof person. She lived alone, but had visitors all the time and always left the door unlocked in case if anybody wanted to visit (not the safest idea, but I'm glad she had the door unlocked when she did). For her to be completely non-responsive like that is absolutely bizarre. When she got to the hospital, they did a CAT scan and found a mass. They did a biopsy, and this afternoon we found out that not only is the mass cancerous, but she only has around a year left to live.

My aunt Carol and I are not close for a lot of reasons (my family can be pretty dysfunctional) and I don't know what to say to her when I go to visit. Even though we aren't close, this is my aunt. I want to see her before she passes and make her final days on this earth the best. I've been trying to keep things as normal as possible during all of this but I'm not going to lie, it's hard.

Midway the ride these two guys kept looking at me and asked me for my Instagram , I declined politely just because I’m not really interested in anything as of now .

I’m over what I thought him and I could have been because honestly it was full on infatuation . But I still have to see him around school which makes me feel horrible .

We occasionally talk about sex and have sent / asked for a porn picture, whether it be to show something funny or something sexual. This feels off when we talk because I know she has a boyfriend that she loves dearly.

Yet, she has been a big help to me. Currently my only real friend and happily talks to me. I'm also invited to her upcoming birthday. The biggest thing she's done is say she believes in me and I can become a better person. For some reason I gained feelings and its become increasingly hard to push them down and ignore it.

71,"I live on a rural road. It cuts through 120 acres of farmland, and my house is right in the middle of that. I share this road with 3 other houses. At the very end of this road is a development, and they tend to cut through my portion of the road to get to where they’re going. The problem is, they comes through here FAST. It’s always the same cars that come through multiple times a day. The speed limit is posted at 25 mph, in my opinion that’s too much. You can kill a child at 25 mph.  Hell, you can kill an adult. I have 2 kids that play here, I also have a dog and free range chickens. Some other points that I think could be relevant are that the road cuts my property in half. Crossing the road is necessary all day long. And the sidewalk from my front door to my barn is right at the bend of the road. When the cars come around that bend, they can’t see me (or my children) until they’re right on top of us. So my first question is, can I get that speed limit lowered?

75,"tl;dr: BF wipes dirty mouth on clean towel for drying hands--what do I do?

Hi r/Advice, I've got a minor issue that I need feedback/recommendations on what to do. I am not sure if there's a better system people usually use for their kitchen towels, but this is the system within our apt with my bf:

All the towels are on the oven handle:

Towel 1 is for drying CLEAN hands (e.g. after washing hands with soap in the kitchen sink).

Towel 2 is for wiping up random spills of food or whatever else needs to be wiped in the kitchen that isn't clean hands.

Problem: BF wants to wipe his dirty mouth (like after eating) onto towel 1. My logic is that if he eats whatever the heck, it gets on his mouth, he wipes that gunk onto the clean towel, the next time I wash my hands and dry my hands, I'll get gunk on my hands--defeating the purpose of the towel in the first place.

We have paper towels! We have napkins! I told him to stop! He says it's nbd.

79,"Howdy!

So basically whenever someone has wronged me in any way, I have hard time getting over it, even years later. 

For example, a boy in early-mid middle school asked me out during class as a joke (I had severe acne, was very insecure, had no fashion sense, was a giant nerd, and had only just moved there) and all his friends laughed at me. Now in mid-late high school, I still can’t stand him and every time I see him or his friends, I remember and I want to tell him how awful that made me feel.

But that was years ago, so shouldn’t I be over it? Ive changed so much physically and mentally since then, why does it still make me feel so bad about myself? And that’s just one example, although that is the most extreme one that I have. I guess I’m just looking for tips about how to let go of my anger towards people who’ve done me wrong and forgive them even when they don’t deserve it and/or haven’t apologized

I’m reaching out to you because this is a side of me that I can’t really express to anyone I know.

I’m a bit of a free wandering loner. I’m a very helpful person who just wants to help make this world a happier place by making everyone happy where I can make it happen, but I really don’t have anyone to talk to about deep shit.

I’m still getting over some heartache from a breakup, and I haven’t let it affect my personal life... But genuinely that girl might’ve been the closest thing to companionship I’ve had in a very long time. Someone I can really trust.

I commute to school about an hour away, I live in the middle of nowhere so there isn’t much fun to be had around here. And I also work by myself each shift. 


And I’m kind of stuck. 




After the breakup I put myself into overdrive, I completely turned my work life around. I’m on top of all my schoolwork this semester.. but I feel like something is missing. It’s been so long since I actually asked myself “Hm.. what to do..”

I feel like it maybe might relate to the loss of my girlfriends emotional care.. but I really just don’t know what to do with myself sometimes when there’s nothing to do. I play video games but sometimes it feels like I’m just wasting my time.

88,"Throwaway because reasons. TLDR at the end.

The issue:

I work for a medium sized utility in the US that recently went through a large reorganization. One of the moves involved a very inexperienced person being put in charge of several highly important engineering teams. 

Background:

The person in question graduated college with a generic engineering degree (not mech/elec/civil etc). They worked for just under two years at a major finance/investment corporation prior to joining the company I work for as a long term planner/project manager in one of three planning engineering groups (they each serve very different purposes and require very different experiences and training). Less than two years later the reorg happens and this person is now in charge of all long term planning, plus several other highly technical engineering teams (effectively skipping two levels of leadership experience). This is a role that typically belongs to someone with over 10 years experience and at least 2 successful stints as a supervisor/manager. This person is not related to an executive, and the statement is that they worked hard and deserved a reward.

Question:

How do you deal/cope with effectively being told your several years in the company working tirelessly is worth less than this persons 18 months. That each of your coworkers and other leaders 5-15 years of hard work (each) is worth less because this person was ""in the right place at the right time"". I will be honest; I am in no way prepared to take that role, but I know plenty of others who are. Meanwhile I have been passed up for promotion more than once because I ""don't have enough time on the job"". I have been told in repeated performance reviews that I am a fantastic worker, coach/mentor. I have been told many times the only gap I have is years of experience. Is this all a lie? Luck? Conspira-theory?

TLDR:

-Unfair promotion

-Unapreciated employee

93,"My friend browses reddit too and he might come across this post, so in a way this is not just asking for help but also a blunt message to you, you know who you are

So the title is rather self explanatory, but here’s some backstory as to the what and why, firstly my friend grew up moving a lot, we have that in common, and I’m probably his only real good friend. But before we met, what commonly conspired at home was much arguing and that drove him away from being home and away from his parents. Eventually his dad went to prison for a non-violent crime. And it really left the rest of his family in a stuggle because his mom was a stay at home mom, so now they move a bunch and she has to work long hours, but she does work from home. She spends all of her time doing something not a resting moment. She goes out of her way to make him lunch for school, we’re in college now, and she still does his laundry and cleans the house and everything, she is a real phenomenal mom. 

But for some reason, he treats her like garbage. Now she was a kind of parent at one point that you would find on r/insaneparents , like if she had the smallest idea that you were sexually active, like thinking about sex or masturbating or anything, she would just take your bedroom door, even to late teens, she’s not like this anymore and I don’t know all of what she did, but I don’t believe my friend experienced the most of this. But I do believe his siblings fed him the idea that treating her like shit is a good thing

So basically in some things as simple as her mishearing someone or making a small mistake, he will give shit about it and an attitude and get upset and pretty much just treat her like shit. Me might yell at her or something. And overall very little patience with anything that has to do with her.

His mom calls me and says I’m the only one that can get through to him, and she doesn’t know what to do. This is really all at the wrong-doing of my friend and she was crying and asking me to talk to him and help, and she’s super nice and a great mom she goes out of her way to make him happy. So I don’t know what to say to him exactly, or how to try and help, but I do sympathize with his mom and think things need to change. So I’m just trying to figure out how to help them out without ruining our friendship.

99,"Okay, so. Tomorrow, I’m moving to university after years of waiting to finish school and finally be able to leave home. I’m so happy that I’ve made it to this point.

For years, I’ve fantasised about becoming a stripper; everything about it appeals to me. That sheer power of fully implementing your sexuality... I wish to learn that power too. Also, I’m an exhibitionist and I really love the idea of being nearly naked in front of so many people. I’m sure the feeling would get old soon enough, but then I’d just move on to a new job. It’s not a big deal. 

Now I’m leaving home though and I’m finally 18, this dream can be realised. I’ve been offered positions at two really fancy strip clubs in my university town, and I’ve thought through every possible problem that might occur in my head. For example, people from university seeing me: I wouldn’t care. I’m proud of my body and I’d love the chance to show it off. Future employers seeing me: I’m moving abroad for work straight after graduating so it’s not a big deal. Also, it’s unlikely they’d recognise me outside of the flashing dark lights of the strip club and in less extensive makeup.

The only problem I really consider a serious threat is just... whether I’m right for doing this. I have some fears. I don’t know if it’s normal to have fears before going into it, but hey-ho. I could raise the money to pay for my master’s degree and PhD with other jobs; I don’t NEED to go into stripping. I’m not desperate. There’s no real ‘need’ situation going on here forcing me into it, and I know most people don’t go into it willingly. I’ve also been offered a job as a receptionist at my uni, so it’s not like I don’t have options. I just really, really want to do this.

Am I crazy for wanting to do this? Will I ruin my life? I’m hoping to go into science. On the low chance that future employers see that I was previously a stripper or waitress in a strip club, will I be fired, or will they take on somebody else instead of me? How likely is it that they’ll find out?

Honestly, any advice regarding this will be HIGHLY appreciated. I’m both excited and so scared. 

Thank you and I hope you all are having nice days!",20Sep2019,6
100,"So, i'm 24. i've never questioned my sexuality since i've always had crushes on girls and i masturbate normally, i had never had sex before because 1- every i would start something with a girl i liked we would end up just friends and 2- the girls who did like me were not my type, 3- i wasn't in a rush and never felt the urgency to lose my virginity, i could just cope well with masturbation and move on with my day

well i met this girl close to were i work, she is ok looking, i would say average but not really my preferred type, we went on a date and then she was pretty straight forward, we agreed to meet the next day (today) at a motel

we met there, she was very nice and all, i was a bit nervous about not lasting long enough or not being good at first but she was very nice and relaxed so that help me get over it.

nothing was at all like i imagined, she started giving me a blowjob. it was fine, just a warm feeling kinda nice but not better than masturbating imo,

then she got on top and i was a little surprised, because i expected it would be a lot tighter, i don't have a small penis,i would say above average, but it just felt a little bit loose and it was very hard to finish, it took me like 30 minutes

the whole time i was thinking, this is fine but not worth the drive and the $50 for the room

the girl seemed to be enjoying herself, it was actually a little awkward because she kept trying to talk dirty, ""oh yeah like that, i'm gonna cum, etc""   i was just quiet trying to focus on what i was doing, we tried a lot of different positions but it just felt like a lot of extra work compared to just jerk off

i'm confused because i think i might be asexual  and i'm disappointed because i had placed a lot of goals around sex, make good money to date hot girls and eventually get married, but if this is what sex is, i'm just not interested, there are so many things i enjoy more, eating a donuts, playing video games, watching a movie,etc

however i still have romantic crushes and find women attractive, i still enjoy women's romantic company, go on dates, cuddle,etc

any woman i date will want sex and even tho is not unpleasant, i did find it boring, i don't think it would be fair to date a woman if i'm not interested in sex.

Now, I made a resolution several months back to not say negative things about other people and I have honored that resolution. The problem is, since I'm refusing to stoop to my coworkers' level, I feel like I've become a bit of a pushover. Because I've started to realize that the amount of shit they're saying about me is starting to affect how other coworkers see me. And I have never once said anything about them to anyone. So a lot of shit being said about me, none being said about them.    
Since I always knew I would be leaving, I just let things happen. But I plan to stay at my new job for a long time and I know there'll always people like this wherever I am so I need to learn how to deal with this issue.   
I'm having trouble understanding the line between badmouthing people and defending myself. I never took an interest in the 2 coworkers so I have no idea what kind of people they really are; so if I wanted to talk shit about them I wouldn't have much to say unless I made stuff up. At the same time, if something like this happens in the future, how do I best prevent everyone believing the shit people that don't like me say about me?

106,"My bf and I are in college. He has a ton of friends, mostly guys but girls hang out w them all the time. I used to always get invited to hang out with them, I got along with them. I don't talk a lot, but I always enjoyed myself when I was with all of them.

There would be some days when my boyfriend would try to get me to not come, saying subtle things like ""you can come if you want"" when he said this I asked him why he sounds like he doesn't want me there and he said its because I don't talk. Tonight he told me he had to write an essay, and actually had his friends over.

This was really embarrassing for me, and I beat myself up about being like this all the time. He knows this too. He's amazing, and really cares for me.

I understand why he doesn't invite me, and it's okay for us to be friends with different people, but it really does embarrass and hurt me. How do I cope with hating myself for being quiet? I really wish I had friends, but I don't besides him and the people he's friends with (we're more like acquaintances, but I love hanging out with them)

TL;DR: My boyfriend has a lot of friends, I am shy and I don't have any besides him and the people he's friends with (we're more like acquaintances, but I love hanging out with them) he told me the reason he is not always wanting me to come is because I do not talk. He lied today about writing an essay and had his friends over instead. It's okay if he wants to hang out with people w/o me, but I hate myself for being so shy.",20Sep2019,1

But yesterday,  I came home and my stepmom and my dad both started yelling at my boyfriend and I. He claims we ate his cereal when I obviously didn't and says that we've been mooching off if him. To set some things straight:
1. He offered to let us live here
2. I tried to pay rent but he refused to let me and told me to use the money to get my own place. 
3. He told me we're welcome to anything in the kitchen.
4. We've been actively working and saving to move into an apartment 

Well we've used a little bit of their groceries because we're still struggling but we buy the majority of our food. Well my dad was literally screaming at my boyfriend and I, calling us liars and saying that I'm disrespecting him. We let the argument die out then went on a drive, trying to stay out of the house. 

Today, I was in the bathroom and I heard him talking to his wife. He was yelling at her for apologizing about  the argument and explaining their financial situation.  He then said that my boyfriend had better not test him or ""there'll be some random white boy dead in the street""

I'm now terrified that my dad is going to harm my boyfriend but I'm scared to say anything. I feel like if I tell my boyfriend he'll get mad and something will actually happen. I don't know what to do.

117,"Hey Reddit, so I have a male friend of mine (Let’s call him Reese) who is having a *bit* of girl problems. By girl problems, I mean that he has been talking to this one girl romantically for maybe a month and a half, and she’s been saying some pretty...odd things. Things you simply wouldn’t say to someone you’re not seriously with. 
First off, after a week of just talking, she tells him that she’s in love with him. I personally found that weird but totally blew it off, as who knows. It wasn’t until today that I’ve become suspicious. 
Today, Reese told me all the weird shit this girl has been saying. Things like, “I want someone to father my kids.” Correct if I’m wrong, but normal people don’t say that to someone their not even REMOTELY serious with. She also told him that he’s “the last dick she ever wants to have.” I would say that’s a MAJOR red flag. That sounds weird as all hell, and just super suspicious. Like what is she planning? 
And I know you’re probably wondering, “OP, how do you know they’re not super serious? Maybe they’ve discussed this sort of stuff.” No. Reese told me that his game plan is to, “stick around until he catches feelings.” That is not the words of someone who is in a serious enough relationship, to talk about fathering children and whatever weird things she’s talking about. I know my opinion, but Reddit, please answer this: Should Reese make a run for it and get away from this girl as fast as possible, or should he stick to his game plan of just waiting it out? 

Please Reddit I don’t want my friend to end up as a skin suit.",20Sep2019,1

I'm an 18-year old male and I have an attraction to a 19-year old female. I first saw her at the gym I go to. I noticed her complexion and looks first. When I was waiting for my ride to come get me I decided I would talk to her until then.

We talked for about maybe only 10-15 minutes until I had to leave. We talked and I asked questions, making the conversation about her to learn about more about her. This is where I noticed she was sweet, kind, and humorous. She even is a college student who wants to go into health, same as me. She even mentioned that she noticed me there all the time even though I'm not there during her shifts, most of the time. Before I left I asked her name and she asked my name. 

Anyways, I want to know if I should come into different times whens she on her shifts to get a better chance of talking to her more. Her shifts are afternoons on weekdays, and morning on the weekends. Also, how should I make it seem like I'm interested, but not making it obvious. I know I will have to continue making that connection with her to have her perhaps become interested in me. What questions do I ask?",20Sep2019,1

There's a girl that I dated online for a year and a half, she's a Canadian right across the border. We broke up, she said she cheated but later said that she only said that as an easier way to break up than actually breaking up the direct way. I don't know if I believe that she didn't cheat, as I'm fairly cynical about everything now. Doesn't really matter, just self pitying. We talked on and off through the rest of high school, and recently things have flared up again. She said she loved me, then a couple weeks later said she thought she did at that moment, then ""clarified"" and said that she did love me but didn't want to let herself feel it as she can't handle online dating again. There's another guy in her life that she's not dating because she's afraid to commit, but he's down to commit. 

We talked about me taking a bus to her town and renting an air bnb for a couple of days over winter break. Her schedule is busy so I would spend a lot of the time alone. I'm fine with that, as i can legally drink in Canada, and alcohol is something that I've wanted to try but don't have the connections to prucure any for myself and haven't wanted to try drinking around other people. It would be an 8-12 hour 4 bus trip and cost around 500 dollars. Part of me wants to go because I love her, part of me wants to go for alcohol, part of me wants to go so I can be alone and have my own space for a short period of time. Im having doubts about whether I should. I'm aware that I have near 0 self evaluation, so I'm turning to reddit for help.

126,"      So I'm friends with this guy at school, he used to be the person I talk the most to and we would talk about everything and anything. But he has stopped talking to me few days ago, after he started hanging out with that transferred student. I don't know if it has anything to do with that but they won't stop talking and seem to get along very well.
      But back, when I noticed him spending less time with me than usual, I thought it was just something in my head so I just tried not to care that much. And well I've decided to write this thing aftet what happened today. And it was like that:
      -I was at school with my group friends (that's also his group of friends) waiting for class to start, when he arrive, greeted everyone, except for me, and just started talking to everyone and acting like I wasn't there at all.
      - First class the teacher was handing out our test, he got his and I then poked his arm gently TWICE while asking how much he scored but he just pretended he didn't hear me, I got angry and slapped his arm and said ""hey, I'm talking to you"", and then he angrily pushed his paper to my face without even looking at me.
      - Fifth class we were working on a group project and we were in the same group and whenever I said anything he would just ignore it and even interruped me when I was sharing an idea like it was nothing to say something very irrelevant.
       - The other classes and lunch time he just did not talk to me at all.
       - Hanged out a lot with this new guy but also was still normally talking to our other friends.

       I got very sad after school today because he was my closest and most reliable friend and it hurts me a lot that he's being mean to me out of nothing. I am very down and don't feel like talking to him to ask what happened because I think he will just ignore me again. I don't really know what to do.",20Sep2019,1

129," We are all sophomore’s in high school. 

So last year this girl that I liked straight up asked me
“do you like me?” I said yes and she said she did too but she didn’t want to date or anything and just wanted to be friends. I got the message, she didn’t like me, but I was glad just to be friends. From then on I stopped liking her because I didn’t want to like someone I knew I’d never be with. She had a close friend, Olivia, that I started to have interest in toward the end of last school year. (Olivia and I were friends too) This was months after the fact that she decided that we were going to be only friends. Then I learned soon that she was moving to Missouri (from California). I was super sad, we hung out for the last few days before she left. 
This was the beginning of last summer.

Fast-forward to now: I’m dating Olivia and she tells Bella that we’re together. Bella gets angry and starts insulting Olivia. Then Bella calls me and I ask her why she can call me and not her, then she gives me a bunch of bullshit excuses. She said something to Olivia, to the effect of: I want to date him more now. I understand that moving is hard and that she had to give up her friends, and we still had each other, but this to me feels really unfair. Olivia and Bella were super close friends, but now, Bella said that they were mostly just school friends. Olivia is sad about it all the time, and Bella gets sad talking to Olivia because we’re in a relationship. Bella is even dating someone else and implied that they were doing it. (she’s very religious so she must really like this guy) I just don’t want to talk to Bella anymore. I told Olivia that if she wants to move on just let her have it her own messed up way and leave her be; someone that drops that close a friend that quickly isn’t worth it. Olivia adamantly refuses to let it go and now she thinks I’m being mean. I don’t know what to do.

133,"So some background, I’m a senior in college and play for the schools rugby team. I started second semester freshman year and fell in love with it. I wasn’t the best at it in the beginning, but over time I got a lot better to where now I consider myself above average (rarely drop the ball, make people miss when they try to tackle me, if the ball is kicked my way I can usually return it for 30 meters if not take it to the try zone). I’ll admit in the beginning I was a little sloppy, but I think I developed pretty well. Throughout my whole time playing we would have a lot of older guys so I alternated all between first and second string. I’m always apart of the 23 players teams are allowed to bring. I get playing time, but I’ve never been a true starter. This year I thought though would be my year to start all the games, but I get blind sinded with the news that I will not be the starting outside center. Instead they got this underclassman from the forwards to replace me. All the hard work I put in for nothing. When they said the starting line up for the game at practice I just walked away. They told me, “you’ll definitely get playing time, but we just want to try this guy out at the position.” I basically was like fuck off.

135,"Age: 65

Sex:  Female

Height :. 5'5

Weight: 100lbs or less

 Race: white

Existing diagnosis:. Her low back has severe disc issues. And she has a lot of nerve pain in her head and arms.

She smokes

 Duration of complaint......idk 10+ years but it got really bad past few months.

 Issues:  she is in constant pain from her back, so she takes a lot of opiates.  A lot.  Like, more addicted than in pain (maybe?) although she seems to often be in excruciating pain.  She won't eat hardly anything, she thinks she is allergic or not supposed to eat, or something is wrong with her body and can't accept rice because it will get caught in her stomach....crazy stuff like that is what she says.  She is withering away.  She also says she can't ear because she's so stressed.  But then she gets stressed about losing weight....

I could admit her into the hospital as someone with an eating disorder but from what I understand she is free to leave after 72 hours of being admitted aaaaand she's gonna need at least a few weeks of care to help her get to a healthy weight.  She is so frail I am afraid she will die soon if I don't intervene.  Neither of us have money to help fix her back.  Apparently she has really good insurance though.

Is there anything I can do?  Can I have her admitted some.how until she is healthy and not just 72 hours?  Is there a treatment method at the hospital she can choose on her own to do where they monitor her and help her get back to proper weight?  I don't think she will want to stay though, because they probably won't let her take as many pills as she is going to want to.

I know this isn't exactly minor, but I don't know what to do.

136,"Okay I want to start of by saying that our relationship was extremely abusive he manipulated me and abused me and rewired my brain that no matter what my gut tells me I keep doubting my reality. I apologize if I sound stupid in this but it's just really hard to trust your feelings/thoughts again after dating a person like him. 

Okay so I met my ex when we were both 19, he always seemed off. He told me he lacked empathy he told me that he mirrored people's feelings, he told me that he lacks the inability to cry. I was obviously weirded out about this but I geniuenly didn't know what to think I have never encountered anything like this before so I gave him the benefit of the doubt. He is an compulsive liar and I found out he lied about a lot of things. 

One thing I always found very very weird is that he had younger friends like when he was 19 and they were 12 at the time. I knew it was wrong but I also had people tell me that it was not a big deal and he would pretty much manipulate me and abuse me any time I said anything bad to him. Things got worse when he told me that a 13 year old friend of his had a crush on him, he was 20 then. I expected him to be creeped out, I was but he liked this attention and when I asked him if he liked her back he told me ""Well I don't not like her"" and then later told me he might like her in another way that wasn't platonic. I was incredibly grossed out and I didn't know what to do or think. I know I should have done something or blocked him but like I said he was very abusive and would threaten me any time I wanted to leave.

Time went on and we began dating in November 2018. Prior to this he had first gave out a ""Good Christian Boy"" persona, then one night he suddenly told me that he had sexual relationships with two of his exs he was very descriptive and this also felt off to me because I didn't really ask for detail and I didn't want to know any of those things. He first told me that he only did it once with his second ex then he said it was with 2 exes and then it was only the 2nd 5 times. I obviously felt like he was lying but I'm pretty sure he is a narcissist so any time I would speak up things would go to hell. He also mentioned that his ex had force him to do it and told me this sob story.

While we were dating he was *very* sexual I told him I wasn't really into sex and it made me uncomfortable but he groomed me into having a sexual relationship with him (this was all long distance so he would just be very pushy about asking for nudes and would send me unsolicited pictures). He became very controlling and when he dumped he took advantage of me when I was having a psychotic breakdown and coerced me into doing stuff I wasn't comfortable with. This would later happen again.

He blocked me about a month ago after I found out he was cheating on me. He did a smear campaign against me too. I also found out he completely made up his 2nd ex girlfriend and lied about the first one, he lied about many things. A few weeks ago a friend of his (who is 15 years old) messaged me to check up on me, we got talking and she mentioned how he would talk to his ""sex life"" to her, she told me that he told her how he would 69 and he would go into detail on how he would pleasure his exes. This didn't happen this year they have been friends since she was 12. I feel so sick. I don't know what to do. This feels so so wrong to me. Is this pedophilic behavior? Should I try and talk to the girl and tell her that she sould stay away from him and tell her how wrong this is? I feel like most teenagers probably don't see bad in it, I know I did questionable things at that age and regretted it later. But he is an adult he should know better. He also has a history of wanting to hurt other people and  I'm geniuenly scared and I don't know if I can prevent him from doing more harm.",20Sep2019,0

My most recent one was that if someone seems avoidant, and have bailed on plans last-minute three times in a row that I will cease contact with them, and instead wait for them to contact me. If they don't then I've dodged a bullet, if they do then the confusion continues I guess. 

What processes/rules do you have in place to help yourself avoid these kind of negative relationships with other people?",20Sep2019,1

148,"Hello Reddit! (Obligatory apology for being in mobile and formatting)

TL;DR: Do y’all think someone “bad”at using social media could try to improve via a new account and also work on their self image? 

Little background: 

I’m a 24yo guy who has always had a slightly poor self image and has always been skinny fat. Because of my self esteem I never really found social media (primarily IG) very appealing. 


Earlier this year I was fired for the first time and evicted from my apartment shortly after that. I’m now back at my parents house and have gained 40lbs. I’ve been thinking more and more about getting into the gym and improving my physique but also have been thinking about making new social media and trying to get better about posting interesting things and more about my life, ie hobbies. 

My rationale for the social media is basically to start over (not have a bunch of people from high school and college I don’t talk to following)  and try to motivate myself to do more interesting things and improve my looks/habits. 

What do y’all think?",20Sep2019,1
149,"My girlfriend of almost four years broke up with me suddenly a few weeks ago and I just don't know what to do with myself. Her reason was that we were really serious and she's never dated anybody else (we're both 22) and she has never had the chance to be on her own. She also sort of has hinted that we might get back together one day ""but it wouldn't be for a long time"". I just want to die. I love her so much, so fully. I love her in a way I never knew I could. I was so sure about her. And I keep telling myself that if it's meant to be then it will be but I just don't know what to do and I think she made a huge mistake. I treated her great, and we were happy together. We were still in love when we broke up and I think she still loves me now. She says she wants us to work our way up to being great friends again and that that needs to come before us talking about being in a relationship again. We went to college together and dated the whole time, lived together for three years. But she has one extra semester and I just graduated. So she's four hours away at school and I'm alone back home. I'm so miserable even though I have two new jobs that I really like. I'm trying so hard to be happy but I just don't know how without her. I guess that's why we broke up in the first place.

150,"Any advice, fellow Redditors? I'll keep this concise; I've always had anxiety, but I've only been officially diagnosed since my early twenties (I'm 31) and my PCP has me on the typical meds; Prozac, Valium, Ambien for insomnia, primidone for the shakes. I survived a suicide attempt in 2012 when I bottomed out. I still have manic and depressive episodes, and I tend to go spend crazy when I'm manic. 

Lately it's been getting worse and worse, so I talked to my doctor and I start therapy Tuesday. After describing my symptoms (nightmares, constant agitation, panic attacks triggered by most everything) he threw four letters at me I didn't expect to hear: PTSD. My family is currently embattled in an estate dispute and we're probably going to lose our house, and we'll have nowhere else to go. It's been weighing on me hard.

The thing is that I would really like to open my circle of friends and Jane is very popular and has many friends, I’m always asking her to invite me to hang out when she is with more people but she never wants to and use some weird excuses to not invite me. We both hang out a lot but only by ourselves, for example today we were having dinner and I ask Jane if i could join her to a party she was going later, request that was completely ignored.  I have met her other friends on special events, like on her birthday and we get along pretty well. I have heard from other people that I’m nice, funny and interesting. 
So I truly don’t understand why is she like that, do I embarrass her?  Have anything like this happened to you before and what have you done? 
I don’t know if I should confront her, cause a couple of years ago we got into a big fight cause a confront her about a similar topic, and it made me lose some other friend.

153,"Don't get me wrong, I really love my boyfriend. We have been together for 5 years now, and we are at that stage where we are starting to save for our future (marriage, house etc). 

Back when we first started dating, I was this innocent girl who wanted to save herself for marriage. Mostly because I was christian and I was raised with certain values. Then when my boyfriend wanted to have sex, I kept saying no. And of course I could tell he was unhappy, so I compromised by giving him oral even though I didn't want to do it and cried myself to sleep many nights. And then when he really started asking for sex, I really really really didn't want to do it. I wasn't ready. I wasn't comfortable. I was afraid of the possibility of pregnancy even with protection because I don't want to disappoint my family (Christians lol). But yeah.. eventually I said ok. Even though I wasn't ready. At first we did it only on special occasions, such as his birthday. But it became more frequent (we used protection) and we have sex normally.

Of course, now I'm ok with it because I myself enjoyed sex with my boyfriend very much. I really do. There are times when I would be the one who would initiate the sex. But occasionally, I would think about how all of this started. I feel quite upset and angry that we are what we are because I had to give in to his fucking selfish desires and I felt like I had no say in it at that time. Then whenever I try to bring it up to tell him how I feel, he always say ""well, aren't you enjoying it now?"" ""you initiated too a few times.""  LIKE HELLO, THIS ISN'T ABOUT NOW? IT'S ABOUT HOW YOU EMOTIONALLY SCARRED ME BACK THEN AND ALL YOU CARED ABOUT WAS SEX SEX SEX. And even until recently, he wanted to try anal and I said no. But he still went ahead and try to eat my ass and I fucking broke down. I needed to have an emotional breakdown in front of him to make him change his ways.

Now he doesn't force me to do things that I don't want to do anymore but I just can't help but feel affected by it. I don't know if you guys have any advice for me but I just want to put the past behind me and move on. I forgive him but I find it difficult to forget.

154,"I’ve lived in my apartment building for about 2 years, I love it so much. My landlord is the coolest guy I’ve ever met. I needed a place to stay very quickly and he let me in because they were just looking for someone who “seemed cool”. I was psyched that I was able to move in quickly with no credit check because my credit is terrible. I’m in an area I love, and rent is cheap compared to other places. But I noticed quickly that he sort of just lets anyone move in if they have the cash upfront. This results in a lot of shady people and families crammed into 1br apartments (I once had neighbors who had 2 adults and 7 children live in a 1br, that was interesting, but besides the point.) The last family that lived below me was a train wreck, so I was excited when someone new moved in. This was another family, a mother and 2 young children. I still don’t know why he keeps allowing families move into 1brs, and understand why a lot of landlords have tenant limits now. 

When they first moved in about 6 months ago, I realized that I was being awoken everyday at about 8 am to the sound of a crying child. No big deal, but this crying would last for literal HOURS, until 1 or 2 pm. It took me a while and a few conversations with friends/ family to realize that this child might be being left alone while the mother was at work. I was advised by a few people to call CPS to do a welfare check. I never did because I felt uncomfortable that I didn’t really know the situation at all, only that a kid cried a lot.

I spoke to my landlord and he let me know that one of the children is severely Autistic. I spoke to a girl I know who also has a severely autistic child, and assured me the constant crying was normal. However, I still felt weird. The fact that the crying continued for hours everyday at the same time and never heard any other adults present was concerning to me. My landlord agreed that they might be being left alone, and to let him know if anything else seemed weird. 

Since then I really got into paying attention to the family, and I no longer think the kid is being left alone. The crying continues, but not for nearly as long and I can often hear another adult present. I think the mother got wind of the suspicion over her (especially since I called 911 when the kid was screaming bloody murder at 2 am one night). But I still just get a weird feeling about their whole situation. 

This woman has a different guy over pretty much everyday from what I can tell. I’m not against sex workers, but it seems to me like she’s leaving her children alone with these potentially random men.. and I just don’t know how I feel about sex work going on in a home where children are present. I’ve heard a lot of yelling between adults lately, and one of her “boyfriends” even got arrested for domestic abuse when our maintenance guy caught her getting choke-slammed through the window. This just does not seem to be the best place for two young children to grow up, especially if one is extremely autistic. Yet again, I feel like being with their mother would be better than going through the American foster care system. I’m just not sure what to do anymore. Do I just ignore it, or should I get involved more heavily? 

I should mention that there are a lot more details and events that I’m leaving out for the sake of not having a nasty text box.

162,"I've been a huge video game addict my entire life, my parents actually got me into when I was about 5. I used to play zelda and mario with my mom, and some computer games with my dad. Recently at 26 years old I've finally got my act together and quit video games. My mom has nagged me for years to focus on my future and give less time to the PC games I was addicted to.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently my dad got the switch and got botw for my mom mostly (even though she hasnt gamed  in 10 years aside from solitare or a mystery find hidden object game once every few months). She nags me everyday to come kill a boss for her or finish a quest. While I recently got over my video game addiction and have been working everyday to build a business, she doesn't really care? To her it's more important she gets the next item in the video game.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is where I'm stuck. I thought she'd finally be happy after years of nagging me to play games I had quit and started doing some productive for my future? But it seems the nothing matters outside of her getting the next shiny object in the game? Is she just being irrational because she's really into the game? It makes me wonder if my position in life really affects her mood at all. Maybe she's just worried I'm going to leave soon because I still live with her and this is her way of bonding? My  mom isn't really a ""bonding"" type person or someone who asks their children to spend time with her ever.. So I'm not sure.. I used to blame my lack of success in life for her unhappiness.. I thought my video game addiction made her ashamed of me and kept her unhappy... But now I quit and everyday it's ""come here and play"" and I start to get sucked in and all of the sudden I'm playing for 2-3 hours and resenting her for asking me to do this? 

&amp;#x200B;

Tough problem I know, being forced to play video games. But I guess I'm just curious why she would dangle heroine in front of an ex addict?

165,"First off - i have no idea what to title this. It's a weird situation. I'm so sorry this is so long and thank you in advance for reading.

I (30f) am a woman in the tech industry. I have worked at a small-ish tech company for 18 months. 

About 6 months ago, my boss (35m) gave me some ""constructive feedback"" that struck a nerve with me. He said: ""You look miserable all the time. Sometimes I walk by your desk and your body language is awful.""

I work at a computer all day. I'm not customer-facing at all. I had no idea where this was coming from, as I had perfectly polite interactions with him and my colleagues, smiled and laughed a lot, etc. I didnt quite know what to say to him. Having my male boss tell me my face and body didnt look how he wanted was off-putting to me. It also just struck me as a super rude thing to say to *anyone* that they ""look miserable all the time."" 

I went to the main HR person (also a woman) and told her what happened. We had a nice conversation wherein I just said it struck me as an odd criticism, I felt a little weird about it, etc. She said she understood why that would make me feel that way, but that he probably didnt mean it like that. The company is small enough that our HR person often operates as a sounding board in situations like this, so this was not out of the ordinary for her. I did not file a report of any kind, and it wasnt pursued further. 

I briefly discussed it with my boss and we cleared the air. In the 6 months since, I have had many interactions with my boss that were perfectly fine and it has not been an issue again.

Recently, my company hired an outside consultant to help the company work through some issues (essentially the company is growing very fast and needs to shed some of it's archaic structures etc)

My department had a closed-door meeting with this consultant wherein no managers, HR people, or anyone outside of the department was allowed in. This meeting was a completely safe space - it was our opportunity to freely discuss company-wide issues without fear of retaliation from anyone higher up. 

We discussed A LOT of things in this meeting that would get us fired under normal circumstances. But that was the point! The consultant was adamant that nothing from this meeting should ever leave the room.

Toward the end of the meeting, I spoke very briefly and carefully about the issue of sexism in the company. I did not say any names. I did not name any specific incidents besides saying ""things I would consider inappropriate have been said to me multiple times from people at all levels of the company, from engineers to bosses to marketing people.""

This was completely true - it has happened multiple times, and not just to me. There are very few women at the company and they all have had something happen to him at varying levels of severity.

The consultant noted what I said, and the meeting ended shortly thereafter. 

Just today, I was called to HR. Someone told my boss that I was going to file sexual harassment charges against him because of what he said to me in the past, and that I had told everyone in that meeting AND in the company as a whole that he was a horrible pervert. My boss was obviously disturbed and distressed by this. 

I had to talk with him and assure him that that is NOT AT ALL what happened. I have worked things out with him the best I could given the situation. Things are weird and rocky with him but will maybe be ok.

However, I have NO idea what to do about the person from my team who told him this outrageous lie. 

*Nothing was supposed to leave that room.* And on top of that, his name was never said, I never once said the words ""sexual harassment"" and NEVER said anything about filing a claim of any kind. There were roughly 10 other people in the room to verify what it is I actually said. 

This has created a horrible dynamic for me in the office. No one would tell me who told him this. I feel I can rule certain people on my team out. I have a feeling about who probably did it, but no one will confirm and I dont want to cause a bigger problem by accusing anyone, obviously.

Both my boss and HR agreed that it was a horrible betrayal of trust and a huge problem, but they didnt offer anything concrete as far as what happens now.

I have no idea what to do, or if I can do anything at all. I am very very lucky that I haven't been fired over this. My boss and I will seemingly be ok. But I dont know how I can continue to be on this team after this.

I have been through actual sexual assault situations before and they caused permanent damage to my reputation and made my working life miserable, despite being the victim in that situation. 

If this person told my boss this lie, I have no idea how many other people they have told the same lie. I like this job and I dont want to quit, but I have no idea what to do going forward. 

Any advice on how I should proceed would be greatly appreciated. What recourse do I have here? What options, if any, make the most sense? I'm extremely lost.",20Sep2019,1

167,"TL:DR- Title
(Question at bottom!)

Backstory: For 6 months, I was working at a very small produce store. Only a handful of employees, and I got to know the store and the customers well. A few months into my employment, my mother suddenly and tragically passed away. After that, my job performance was not poor, but it was definitely impacted. It was hard to focus and even smile, I lost the energy I once brought to the job. Little things would slip here and there, but my boss assured me that they weren’t real issues and I shouldn’t worry. Then, in June, after a particularly good shift, I headed home with my purchases of the day and then went to the beach with my aunt. The next day my boss told me to call him, and he proceeded to fire me over the phone. He asked if I had taken home a box the day before (which I had, and I labeled it with my name and placed all of my items in it because I try to limit my use of bags). He accused me of taking more strawberry units than I paid for. This store has digital and physical receipts of my purchase, a camera in almost every corner, and multiple people watched me leave the store confidently. He didn’t ask me to explain what happened, he /told me/ what happened and proceeded to let me go. Our conversation ended, and I cried for an hour outside of a restaurant in New Jersey. When I returned from my trip, I drove to the store and strongly laid it out for my boss. I am an honest, hardworking, intelligent, and kind young woman. I do not tolerate this kind of ignorance and it’s appalling that he could treat me this way with no evidence and no chance to redeem myself. I was admittedly a little too nice during our conversation, although I did raise my voice. 

If he was that fricking suspicious of me, he should have stopped me on my way out. Simple as that. By the way, I DID NOT STEAL! I swear on my deceased mother. 

Flash forward to today in September. I still have nightmares about getting fired or approached by my old boss. I lose sleep at night with obsessive thoughts about what happened (btw I have diagnosed OCD). It hurts me to pass the store and even think about it. I couldn’t eat strawberries for a while and still get nervous around them. These are not choices, I try hard to shake these feelings. 

So I’m asking, what could I possibly do to heal from this? I don’t know how to help the nightmares. I have a new job that I LOVE! Sadly, it does not help the damage done. Any advice is appreciated! Thank You :’)",20Sep2019,1

I came out to him when I was 20 years old and we ended up having a screaming match where he said a bunch of hurtful things I don't even want to write down. He decided he wouldn't pay for my college tuition anymore unless I stopped being gay. I decided that I wouldn't take his money, took out student loans and graduated from nursing school 2 years ago. Even though our relationship went downhill after I came out, we still had a decent father-daughter relationship. He even surprisingly bought me a new car after I graduated from college. He made good money as he was a nurse practitioner, but a few years ago he was caught stealing illegal drugs and lost his license. It shocked our family, and things started to quickly go downhill from there. He started openly doing drugs, and became addicted, he didn't try to get better and my mom who's also a nurse ended up having to take car of all the bills and payments for a house that costed too much for one nurse to afford. Overtime my Mom was just getting stressed out and decided to file for divorce. They officially divorced 6 months ago, splitting $100,000 between the both of them, I haven't heard or received a call from my dad since then. All of a sudden today he called me from a hotel and asked me if he could live with me temporarily until he could get back on his feet. I asked him what happened to all of the money he acquired from the divorce, he told me he ended up gambling most of it away at a casino. And that he only has about 3000 dollars left. I don't mind helping my dad out, the main problem is that my dad has always refused to meet my girlfriend, and has insulted her plenty of times. I think it would be wrong of me to ask her to let him move in with us, even if it's just temporary. But at the same time he's my dad, I love him and I can't allow him to live on the street.

I told him i'd call him back tomorrow after I spoke to my GF and that I needed some time to think about it. I had a talk with my girlfriend about it and she was surprisingly understanding about it and said she would do it for me. I went to lunch with my friends and I brought up how my dad will be living with me and my GF temporarily.

There is a college in Wellington, New Zealand called Massey university. I was at a college fair today, and stopped at the table to check it out. From what the representative said, it seems to be exactly what I want in a program. Everything described feels like a dream come true. It even is closely connected to Weta workshop, a New Zealand based studio well known for film media, entertainment design, and everything else I’m interested in.

It’s... well, it’s really far. And there is a crazy time distance. All of my friends and family live here in the USA, and I am notoriously bad at long distance relationships. 

Additionally, the schooling system is different there, so I’d  start semesters in July and February instead of September and January like we do here. I would have so much less time around my friends, even less so than just going away to a non-international college. Our vacations would only overlap in a small window, which is really sucky. We have had a long-running D&amp;D campaign that I would hate to abandon, so we’d end up having like, 2 sessions a year. I hate the thought of barely seeing them again, but it gets worse. If I did end up at Weta, I’d basically be moving to New Zealand. I’d have my dream job, but I’d rarely see my family, and probably lose my friends. 

Writing this has definitely done my mental state good already. Based on the fact that there are definitely entertainment design jobs in America, on the west coast no less—and heck, if I still wanted to check out Massey, I could just take a summer term there for fun— I’d probably end up deciding not to go there full time, and just stick with the people I’ve grown so close to over my lifetime. I don’t want to be someone who’d abandon their life and their loved ones just for a job, but still, I’d like to hear what anyone else thought about this.",20Sep2019,1
177,"Ok so idk if this is the right sub to ask about this.
But
I burn through shoes like nothing else

By burn I really mean burn

I run about twice a week
But when i get done with my run, my shoes smell like burning rubber
After about 3ish weeks I get burn holes where my two middle toes on my feet are in the shoe

This happens with all my shoes, Nike or walmart, expensive or cheep.
I take care of my shoes apart from this

Any advice to help my shoes last longer?",20Sep2019,1

After the first week it happened, I went to my building's ""boss"". He sent me the link for how to change the amount taken each week to 0%. The next week, it happened again. I thought maybe it just took a week for the change to take place. I waited until the check I just received and it was taken out a third time. I'm unsure as to what to do.

181,Has anyone found a balance between healthy weight loss foods and taste? I've decided to stop crash diets and have given myself about a 9 month goal to lose all my extra weight. I plan on getting my gym membership next month as well. I just will not succeed if I only eat chicken and broccoli. Since I have such a long time and only need to lose about 50lbs (say only because of my long deadline) I'm open to pasta and potatoes and stuff. What do you eat in a day to be healthy? What are your favorite healthy snacks? What *doable* rules do you set for yourself? I often will eat 600 cals for a week and then binge for a whole week following so I'm excited to actually be HEALTHY and not just over restrictive. I'm also excited to stop trying to fill the void with food until I'm sick.,20Sep2019,2
183,"A little backstory, I 22(F) met this guy in college from tinder a little over four years ago. We hung out a few times, but nothing romantically happened which is fine because he was a nice guy and someone I could really get along with. Eventually we drifted apart as he left college to study closer to home, and I stayed behind to finished my schooling. The next few years he would randomly pop back into my life and we would message each other for a few months before it once again became silent between us. Once I graduated, he started messaging me and conversations between us remained consistent. There was some light flirtation and innuendos throughout, but for the most part everything was pretty platonic. We met up once at the bar he worked at before he asked me to attend a party hosted by his friend. I went, against all my fears and anxieties, because honestly I did have some romantic interest in him. There was drinking on both sides of course, and eventually later on in the evening he started to make some romantic gestures like putting his arm me and pinching my waist. When he walked me out to my Uber, he kissed me and I was ecstatic. The next morning however, I knew immediately that something was off based on our messages he seemed less engaged. I messaged him on a day I knew would be slow at the bar he works at and told him that if he wanted some company to let me know and he hit me a ‘sounds good’ and never extended an invitation. Now he’s acting very distant and not reaching out to me like he usually does. I trust my intuition enough to conclude that he probably regrets kissing me. I’m pretty hurt, not only because I feel rejected but also because I feel like I’m about to lose a friend at a time when I need one the most. I’m also pissed that he was the one to kiss me and doesn’t seem to have the balls to fess up and rather sweep this and our friendship under the rug. What should I say to him? Should I say anything at all?",20Sep2019,8
184,"I am a 16-year-old trans dude, and after several years have finally mustered the courage to come out to my father. My identity is something that I've finally come to terms with, and now I'm trying to heed my mother's (admittedly cheesy) advice and live my life as my ""true, authentic self"".

I told him last Thursday and it went a hell of a lot better than I thought it would, and I explained to him that my mother is trying to get an appointment with a psychologist so I can get an official diagnosis and begin Hormone Replacement Therapy.

The problem lies with my stepmother.

She's a brilliant, strong woman, and I love her. I've known her for a good two years, and she's quite honestly an enigma, except when it comes to things she is passionate about. She hates, or at least, disdains transgender people and my stepbrothers (17 and 19) feel the same way. Several times they've had conversations over dinner openly mocking trans people and calling them (us, either) delusional and making fun of our attempts to pass as cisgender. My father has informed me that recently he's taken a spin class taught by a lovely trans woman, and since finding out my stepbrother(17) and stepmother have mocked her and refused to join her class.

Now, I've had a rocky relationship with my father in the past, but I feel like he finally understands me. I'm wanting to tell my stepmother this weekend before I return to my mother's house. My father has said that he'll pretend that he doesn't know, but there's still a problem. I don't know what to do if she tries to shut me down or tell me that I'm never going to be a man or something like that. I'm down for a civil debate, but I have a feeling that civil debate is not something I'll get. I will be willing to answer any of her questions so long as she is not condescending or cruel.

What should I do if she doesn't accept me?

I know my father is happy, and I don't want to spoil that for him. I know that I can't just not tell her because I think she'll figure it out when my voice fucking plunges in tone and I begin to look like a guy. If this goes badly, should I give her some space and stay at my mom's house to protect my admittedly terrible mental health, or should I stand up to her at the risk of destroying my father's marriage?",20Sep2019,0
186,"I’m a senior in high school and tomorrow is Friday so usually my classes don’t do too much, but the bane of my existence this year is my public speaking class/speech class. My teacher decided last week that we were going to to karaoke this Friday and everyone got into groups and started practicing. 

The teacher said it’s supposed to be a “fun Friday thing” just so we get to know each other better, but this is an entirely new high school for me and I don’t know anyone, I can barely get up there and tell the class stories about myself without my hands shaking like crazy, how would I be able to do KARAOKE IN FRONT OF THE CLASS?

I already told him I didn’t want to do it and he got mad and tried to assign me a whole poem to say in front of the class instead, but there is no way I’m memorizing a long ass poem and reciting in in front of the class while everyone else has fun doing karaoke with their friends.

188,"He's not actually my adopted father, but one of my gaurdians. Today, we were laying in his bed while I worked on a project. It came up that he wants me, and no matter how small the part of him is, he wants me. He asked me not to tell anyone, but I have no idea what to do now. I'm an assault survivor, and I still struggling with the effects now. His love language is touch, so he often times holds my hand, or cuddles me, or kisses my cheek/forehead. I always found it uncomfortable, but I thought that is was because I didn't trust father figures and was never one for physical contact so I delt with it. But now I'm very confused, as I'm still under age, I was starting to view him as a father figure, and I was finally adjusting to this new lifestyle of not living with my biological family, since it was only recently that they had gotten gaurdianship of me. I haven't told his wife, my other gaurdian, because I don't want it to end our relationship and I don't think I have anywhere else to go. About a year ago there was a CPS case about him and I to see if we had a sexual relationship because multiple people have reported it. No, nothing happened but I'm just terrified now. I don't have anywhere else to go, and I'm too scared to talk about this with anyone else. Is there something I could do? Or someone I should talk to? I don't know if I can keep this in.

189,"Hi reddit, I desperately need advice/help with this issue I'm having. 

I have a lease in Chicago until May 2020 in a house with 4 people total. They have been super passive aggresive and weird to the point I was living in my bedroom (eating, watching tv on my laptop, etc, spent $600/mo on food because I was so uncomfortable cooking). So on Sept 1, I told my roommates that I'd be leaving the house at the end of the month. They were super pissed, and became extremely hostile. 

I immediately made posts on craigslist, spareroom, roomsters, and posted a few times on facebook. I havent gotten many decent replies. There was one awesome candidate, but my roommates were ""busy"" and by the time they could meet her she found another place. This happened again with another person. A great, third person loved the place and was willing to wait nearly a week to meet my roommates (yeah, a week). They met her tonight, and they really like her but want to see other people for comparison. I explained that they didnt meet other people because they were unavailable and the other people went with a sure thing.

Now they want me to show them more people, but I dont have anyone to show them. I have men, and women under 23 (roommates are all 30-33 and want someone in that range). I have made ""significant efforts"" legally and my landlords are on my side and love this new girl, but they want approval from the girls...technically their happy encounter with her to me was good, so my landlords hand-gave her an application. The ""idk"" attitude came after being super nice to her face...obviously. 

So reddit, how do I get more better responses to my posts for a room? Or how can I tell my roommates the girl they met (who's a great fit) is the best option? 

Current idea is to say yes to everyone and show to the men and young women they dont want, but I KNOW well lose this great person because of their inability or refusal to just say yes. I do have connections to lawyers, but in NY where I'm from (they're all from Chicago) and they all say finding a replacement is the best option.

191,"There is a feeling you get when you loose someone important to you, A feeling that will never go away, and the more you try and fight it the worse it gets. That's what i have been going through for the past while. I'm 16 just turned this month, same day as Freddie mercury, and its only then that i realize my this feeling was only going to get worse. I had a group of friends i knew for basically all my adolescent life, For privacy I wont say names but i'll mention only a few for the sake of a more clear story. These group of friends were my everything, my rock, We all treated each other like family and never spent a day apart, and when we did it was usually pretty boring. Our trust, our bond, was inseparable  of course we get into a few fights here and there but nothing bad. Besides, that's what keep friendships together, at least in my opinion. If i can remember, last summer was the hardest time of my life. I had horrible anger issues, and out bursts of rage i could not control (thank goodness not reoccurring). Seeing I was left alone most of the time i had nothing to vent to, no one to go to, and unfortunately I was only manifesting more and more hatred towards everything and everyone around me as i continued to bottle up my emotions. I resent my self for even typing this but of course. I took it out on my friends, it only got worse and worse as the months rolled by and as they were forced to endure and tolerate me spewing acid in forms of pure rage. Enough was enough, they were to not take this abuse anymore. And of course with all good judgement they cut me off in hope i would get my self the help i needed. And of course to get a break from the constant torture that was my presence.   
These months without anyone happened to be the worst months in a long while. My Dad passed away when i was pretty young so i never really got to know him much, and at the time my Mom was halfway across the state with a new boyfriend, So the next few months were spend in isolation, that isolation turned into addiction for playing the bass till my fingers were shredded (I'm still amazed how i didn't feel the pain at the point), seeing i had no one to talk to, nothing to do, and felt nothing but remorse, I felt hated, I felt like pure human garbage. I felt the worst emotion. Loneliness. Fast forward a  while i ended up taking the path of recovery, I found my self through Practicing Buddhism to an extent, Making my self a better person so hopefully my friends would accept me again.  


 I no longer felt anger, I no longer had an addiction to drown out whatever depression i was feeling. I was feeling better as i was a changed person. After plenty of talking with my friends, they were more than happy to accept me once again, Well of course for a few, And that's what this post is entirely about, One of my closest friends I trusted with my life (let's call him Jeff) seemed to hate me entirely, we were inseparable, but He just didn't see me now as he once did. Weeks of talking to him and i get no where, He made it clear he hated me. He not only hated me he resented me. My mere presence disgusted him and that made me sink inside. I have everyone else of course but Jeff was more than a friend, he was a brother. We co-exist on the same discord server now, but things are not the same anymore. Of course Things were going to change a little but everyone else forgave yet never forgot. I have felt nothing but remorse, resentment, Regret, all those lovely words that start with R, Stab me in the heart and gouge out any feeling of hope of ever being friends with Jeff again. I'm lost, My actions were by no means excusable and i'm more than grateful to have everyone with me, but it feels like a part of me died inside when Jeff decided to not Even amuse my existence or humanity. Maybe he was never my friend to begin with but, it's hard to say, I spent every waking hour with him. We started the friend group we share, We had Dreams that we were determined to accomplish together and it pains me to see us torn apart like this. Funny too Since his birthday was yesterday and that made me sink deeper into this state of agony. I'm just not sure what to do anymore, Without him i'm... Nothing?  


 I know this was pretty lengthy but I just needed to get this off my chest and finally get some advice about this matter. I probably sound entitled but I just need to hear what the best thing to do about all this. A piece of me was taken when we split and I've been hollow ever since.

I started my sophomore year of Highschool 6 weeks ago and my first hour class is all boys except me.  I sit by myself, while all hour I have to listen to them commenting on my appearance.  I’m currently recovering from a mental illness that caused me to drop to almost 90 pounds, and I’ve gained weight since then, but it’s been hard and feels like an uphill battle.  I’m thin, and they find every way possible to rub it in my face, and it’s been triggering mental stuff I thought I was over, I already look at myself every day and have to think about the fact that it was my self destructive behavior that caused it and that’s it’s my fault, I don’t need to be reminded of it anymore.  

Going to the school and reporting them doesn’t work, neither does slapping them or telling them to stop.  For some reason the teacher never seems to hear it.  I’m barely into the school year and already feel like I’m taking steps backwards in my recovery.

197,"I recently came to the attention of a disturbing, very NSFW, and depraved website that is also flooded with illegal content. Basically, the main ""purpose"" of the site is that users post images of women they know (99% of the time non-consensual) and then other users ejaculate on the images or ""cock"" them (taking photos of their penises next to the images). They also do ""fakes"" (similar to celebrity nude fakes) as well as making sick comments about the images; in some cases the victims' full names are revealed and social medias linked with users encouraging others to harass them. These images typically seem to be taken straight off of the victims' social medias without any kind of permission whatsoever.

The site is poorly moderated as well because although the terms of use clearly mention an 18+ policy as any pornographic site should have, there are tons of images of children and it's very disturbing what the users are saying about the images as well as doing to them. I do not understand how this website continues to operate and how it has yet to be shut down or seized.

Victims of the site, from research I have done, claim that after finding their images on there and contacting the administrator they were told they would have to pay $50 for each image to be taken down. That is extortion.

Many other ""revenge porn"" websites have been seized and taken down before and I am hoping this one is the next to go. It's an actual cesspool. I have already reported the site to CyberTip. What else can be done?",20Sep2019,1
198,"I honestly feel really trapped, for a couple reasons. I’ll get the biggest one out of the way here because it’s the most relevant and it’s the one messing me up most. 

My friend is... risky so to speak. She skips school, smokes, and is likely already an alcoholic. She’s been to the psych ward at least 3 times (twice for suicide, once because she got caught vaping in the school bathrooms) and been kicked out at least twice. I don’t know if she’s experimented with harder drugs but I’m willing to believe she hasn’t. We’re both freshmen. In high school. 

I’m not a prude. Let me get that out of the way. MANY of my closest friends smoke or vape, and that honestly doesn’t bother me a bit. Maybe I’ve even done a little too, but I can’t really come out and say that can I. But she in particular just stresses me out. Maybe it’s because of the way she talks online, because I know from experience she’s way mellower in person. I saw her at a football game and we had a good time. But it’s her friends that scare me. 

They remind me of people who put me in a really, really bad place emotionally and I’m still trying to work all that out. It’s not really working because I don’t have a therapist, but I’ve make progress that I’m proud of. I’m gonna see her at the upcoming football game and homecoming dance, but I really don’t want to see her friends. I don’t even know if they go to our school, but i’m still stressing out and it’s kind of sad. 

At this point my life has just become outrunning stress, from multiple things besides her. But I was hoping for just one stress free event, maybe see my crush, maybe see some old friends. I go to a small, essentially accessory high school with a whole attendance one tenth the size of the main school, so we just go to all their events because ours is too small to have our own. That’s why I haven’t confronted this issue yet. To be honest, I don’t want to. I just don’t want to see her.

I don’t know why I haven’t just dropped her irl. maybe it’s because I have some sick fascination with seeing how her life turns out. I hope not because i don’t need another thing to fix or work on.

201,"Hi, i'm not sure where to start. My parent's marriage broke down pretty early on during the early years. 

My father was the one whom filed the divorce and took custody of me after being hearing me beg him to divorce my mother so that the abuses that she left on me will stop. That was nearly 13 years ago. 

The divorce went through and I stayed with my dad since.

Just earlier this year, my mother dearest decided that she needed to their former marriage registered in the church annulled. 

So as she did, she filed the anullment, paid a token fee to have it annulled. They needed her to write everything about what she went through from birth to her new marriage with my stepfather admist missing out details about her habit of cheating and dating her night pub clients etc and accused my dad of cheating.

And no, I can swear to god, it wasn't true. My dad was running a large media printing business and had often have to stay overnight to make up for the time that he'd lost printing this big media over and over again.

That's when I realized, that my mother dearest was really cunning. She didn't want me to be the witness for her or my dad because she said that she didn't want to drag me into their marriage issues. But honestly? The whole storyline that she had told to the archdiocese was one sided and moreover so supported by her siblings whom then became her witness (without them even realizing that her dearest sister has been physically abusing and neglecting her own daughter)

My father refused to approach the archdiocese about the annulment as he felt like the marriage was already over and they would be no need as correctly mention, there would be no civil effects.

Just weeks ago, we received the letter stating that the annulment has been done along with an attachment of a vetitum against my father prohibiting him from registering his marriage with the church again. 

That really made me seething thinking about how my dad has made the choice to just not bring up this matter and took only received this as a sanctions against him (not that it matter to us anymore as we're not longer with the church )


As much as what is already done, should I speak for the archdiocese to clarify this issue on my father vetitum and also to seek a re-tribunal proceeding again?",20Sep2019,1
202,"Long story short I've been struggling with both an eating disorder and not being able to buy food regularly. I'm drowning in debt and the only way I've been climbing out is to sacrifice my food budget, which only makes me restrict more and it's been a problem for the better half of 3 years. By the time I get time off from work/have the energy to go, the food banks nearby are empty. 

The last time I almost got accepted to food stamps but I missed the deadline due to my memory problems/lack of knowledge of how it works. Currently I'm trying again but I'm stuck on the proof of residence/rent expenses/household composition. Last time my landlord (I have a different one now) never responded to my calls and I was afraid he would call my uncle asking why I needed to apply for food stamps. My uncle would verbally abuse me about needing help despite being physically and mentally disabled(I use a cane and have trouble understanding many things sometimes) and while ""helping"" me get on my feet, made me stay in a shed that had no heat or electricity in the winter. He would've made everything even worse so I never actually got the help I needed then. 

How would I ask my landlord for the proofs I need? I don't want him to judge me. I'm deathly afraid of him mistreating me like I have been in the past. I'm just terrified of confrontation and need to get help buying food because I need to afford my medicine, especially my anxiety meds.",20Sep2019,2

204,"I need to give a background of everything I remember as this is something I want to read to my boss as well: 

I got invited to the bar from two friends after work so I met up with them. I’m newly to 21 so the bartender probably thought I was cute and was giving me shots left and right. Tequila &amp; whiskey.

1/2 friends decided they wanted to leave so the both of us decided to head to another bar down the road and that’s where I saw my friend from work. 

I ran up to him and hugged him and he said to be careful and be safe and to call him if I needed a ride. My friend who I came to the bar with ended up leaving abruptly so I was alone. 

Luckily two girls offered me a ride but I was super drunk and incoherent and must of told them to bring them to my exes apartment. (I still have the keys because I lived there not too long ago).  

At the apartment I’m by myself I guess and I apparently called my friend who offered to give me a ride and asked him for one. I just did not want to be at my exes apartment or have him find me lol. 

THATS all I remember. This is where it gets fucked up. 

The following morning I wake up startled because I  forgot I called my friend and I ended up at his house. He’s right next to me but thank god I am  fully clothed and he is too.  I asked him to give me a ride to the bar where my car was.

On the way to the bar he said “do you remember we had sex? I woke up to you rubbing against me without pants on and my dick was hard and you were trying to stick it in you” 
I started crying because I did not want to have sex with this man or let alone do anything.

We both kind of felt weird about it but passed it off as nothing and we wanted to sweep it under the rug. I told him in a joking manner that I’m sorry my drunk self was making moves and he said it was fine and he was glad I was safe. He told also told me that he never came and the “sex” was maybe 30 seconds. 

I asked him how I even put it inside of me and he said he didn’t know? I asked if I got on top of him and he said no. So I don’t know. Not to mention I am on my period and have endometriosis. 

I was incoherent and blackOUT drunk. How could I take my skinny jeans off, unzip his pants and focus on getting his dick hard as he is waking up from sleep? And me putting his dick in me? 

I’m sorry for all the question marks but as I am typing this- this still does not make sense. I just don’t know what to do. 

ANYWAYS, at work later that day we were fine and we were not talking about it. And yesterday at work, he comes in and I run up to him and I yell his name because he is my friend and I was excited and he told me to basically fuck off.

Then he proceeds to go outside and I follow him and he yells with all his might and at the top of his lungs “ do you know what you did??? You raped me!” X 100. 

I was in disbelief so I ran inside and told my managers this exact story. One of them ended up talking to him and they are telling us to “nip it in the butt” 

SO WHAT DO I THINK OF THIS? What even is this? I do not remember anything from that night except from when I was at the bar. 

There was no blood on me or my hands, the bed or the sheets, how does someone who’s incoherent put all their clothes back on after 30 second sex? I just don’t get it? 

Can I hear some wise words.",20Sep2019,1

207,"So I had a really weird conversation with someone and I’m conflicted as to who is right in the situation so I thought I would share it with you so you could tell me what you think. I was directly involved in this conversation.

So I called a girl who I knew from a class in which we had a group project together. This was after the semester had ended.

I called her and she got mad at me for calling her. She said “I don’t know what you’re talking about, we just had a group project together. I don’t ever want to hear from you again, you’re talking to me like you’re my boyfriend.” I said “Ok, that’s why I called” and I hung up on her. Then I got a call from some guy (not her boyfriend). He said “You need to leave [girls name] alone, she has done nothing to you and Jesus will come in to your life and you will bow before him” I hung up on him at that point.

Am I in the wrong for calling that girl and what got them so angry?",20Sep2019,1
208,"So basically I have this dillema since I was in elementary school. I've been diagnosed with ADHD when I was a kid, but when my parents looked for a second opinion, the Psychiatrist said that I was just a normal kid, then they looked for a third doctor and again he said I was just a normal kid doing normal kid stuff.

Then I never looked into this question anymore, since I was basically ""solved"", but the question if I really was normal or if i had a condition came back to me a few years later (Basically Highschool), but at the time I wasn't able to explain to the new psychiatrists how I felt. 

And I always had some anxiety problems, since I was a kid and it only got worse as I needed to become an adult. 

I will describe my symptoms and I want you guys to try and help me pinpoint what I may have

I'm not looking for a diagnosis, I'm going to a therapist every week and I'm going to see a new Psychiatrist next month, and I just want you guys to help me clear my mind so I could explain whats going on with me to both of these professionals.

So, I'm basically a very pessimistic (not actually depressed, but my previous therapist said I had a tendency to depression) and Very, Very anxious person. I can't focus on an activity that I don't like for more than a hour, I'm very disorganized, I tend to overthink a lot, I have a very hard time trying to sleep (mainly due to my anxiety), I'm fairly agitaded person when I manage to get enough sleep, I consider myself lazy, but when I like something I really put my back into it.

So now that I described everything, my main question is, Is this ADHD or its just my anxiety that produces symptoms similar do ADHD ?

214,"I have an awful phobia of dentists.

It is to the point where I can’t get a teeth cleaning without crying through the whole thing. Just typing this out is making me tear up. 

The idea of touching teeth absolutely disgusts me. Like I get a hot flash all over and feel nauseated. This coupled with my depression has led to my oral care being much fewer and far between than I would like to admit.

The biggest problems are that I’m afraid of being judged by the dentist when I do go in (seen as a baby, gross, ridiculous), and I have no dental insurance. I really can’t afford a big expense but I also can’t afford to keep putting this off.

224,"I am a 15-year-old teenager. I went to a summer camp where I was trained on how to be a member of horse staff. Basically, they trained us on how to care for the horses and how to teach kids how to ride. The assistant equestrian director was the one who wrote my evaluation and said beforehand that it would be constructive criticism. Before I get into stating what's in the letter, I just want to say that I was not as skilled as the other people getting trained. I also wasn't as skilled of a rider as they were. When it comes to hobbies, usually the more advanced people look down on the beginners; however, with horses, this is more prevalent. Also, I do recognize that these are areas I need to improve on. I'm not saying anything in here is wrong.

Here are some of the statements in my letter:

""livingtheloserlife rarely engaged or interacted with campers unless they really had to. And when they did it often came off as a bit forced.""

When it came to teaching children my letter said, ""They didn't demonstrate any enthusiasm or any willingness to progress or grow at this stage.""

""livingtheloserlife was very defiant or negative when he was given any help given to her in order to help herself progress and often gave up and just got off the horse, dismounting early as she had no desire to progress or develop her skills. This was a real shame as she was given several opportunities to practice and just had no passion or willingness to grow or progress their own skills."" 

""When it comes to paperwork, livingtheloserlife often did the bare minimum and sadly it became clear how little she knew her riders or how she helped them progress. I often had to get her to rewrite her daily lesson notes and evaluations due to the rushed effort put into them. 

While apparently, I underperformed in this camp, I did try my hardest to improve and learn. I unfortunately have a huge issue with negativity and defiance, which I had been trying to get rid of. The real reason I dismounted early was that I was at the point where I was going to throw myself off the horse in an attempt of self-harm. I was riding with two other riders who were much better than I was and I almost crashed into a better rider and I could see the frustration on her face. That made me want to hurt myself. I felt like a burden there.",20Sep2019,1

The big issue is that I have been singled out in my community, but secretly. There is a free for all where people can say whatever they want about me, and I am not allowed to know about it. 

But I know, if not the specific content of what they say, the general gist and the fact that they are saying shit. I can know this based on what people say to me(passive aggressive, snarky comments that make stupid implications) and how I am treated(shunned, for no clear reason). 

I’m not oblivious, but attempts to address it directly have led them to gaslight me. I believe some of what they say is based on information that was passed around illegally(think, just for example, a police officer leaked information from a young offender’s case that should have been expunged), so they are protecting themselves and the perpetrators who violated my rights.

I can’t know for sure without seeing their words in writing, but I am certain most of what’s said about me is incorrect or extremely exaggerated. I’m scrutinized and judged in the most negative way possible, and this exhausts me mentally and emotionally.  Yet they act like their words and actions have no impact, like psychopaths who lack empathy. I feel dehumanized.

Since school started about 3 weeks ago I’ve only gone two days. That means I’ve skipped 5 full days of class, since my schedule is every other day. 

I didn’t skip because I’m “thug” and “cool”, I’m actually the complete opposite. Up until early junior year I wouldn’t even think about skipping. But a lot of shit happened to me and my family which devastated everyone in their own way. I’m just a wreck. I don’t take care of myself anymore.

Lately I've been a bit more depressed due to reconnecting with an ex, as a friend, but still wanting to be in a relationship with someone again. It was a standard break up my ex and I went through, she broke up with me and there wasn't much to it other than ""I want to see other people"". I talked with my friend about talking with them.

He reminisced for a bit about the relationship and talked about how he missed them. I reminded him about what she did to him and tried to get off the subject.

235,"I won't get into all the details, but I've been with my partner for the past 6 years and I have expressed concerns over a number of things over the years. Some things have been taken on board, some not.

My partner got a driving licence about a year ago, and also happened to start back into smoking pot again (used to before we got together). I think the use is a bit too regular but it's not heavy so I'm trying to make my peace with that but I'm not happy with it as I find him difficult to be around when he's high so it cuts down our time together. 

So he's saving up to buy a car but borrows his aunts car for us to take trips every now and then. Just the other day he took it for a trip by himself. When he came back I thought he seemed a bit funny, I asked if he was high, he said he had some on his trip but it'd worn off by the time he drove back which would have been maybe hours max. I had a think, and said that it's a dangerous thing to do because of impaired judgment, slower reaction times ect. but I can't help if that's what he chooses to do. Just that he's to never do it when we're driving together. Not phrased like that exactly, he wouldn't take that well. 

I've been thinking about it since and I am not sure if I can leave it at that. Like, I consider it to be very dangerous and irresponsible, but not only that, if he got into an accident he'd be held at fault and while I don't know what the penalty is I can't imagine it'd be too lenient if you get into an accident. 

I tend to be a bit of a worrier but I don't know if I'm comfortable with this. His whole life could potentially be ruined because of this risky behavior and I don't know what to think. He doesn't take things well so I'm not inclined to just discuss it with him further. I just don't know how you can think so little of such a low benefit yet potentially extremely dangerous behavior.

That friendship lasted a few years, but we drifted apart as the years passed by. The only moments we EVER talk now is in some classes and at parties .We did not talk and did not chat like we used to for 2 years if not more.
The thing is that we do not have the same friends, she gets along with my friends, I get along with her friends (except for that one guy that has this passive agression against me, but thats another story), it would be weird to just start trying to be friends with her again. I'm scared of it for some reason. She is sometimes looking at me with that look in her eyes that just tells me she feels something similar (maybe that is just me wishing, but I know for a fact that she had interest in me in the past).
I just don't know how to approach her again.

I don’t currently own a cat but I’m practically living alone and I don’t have many friends. I’m often struggling with my emotions and I desperately want companionship. Sometimes I just need a hug you know? Plus I genuinely love animals.

My ideal cat would be an adult that has a lower energy level. I don’t know if this changes anything but just in case I guess?

I don’t want to be selfish and not consider if it’s unfair to keep a cat contained to my bedroom only. I’m already guessing it is and I’ll just need to wait a little longer. Does anyone have an opinion or any advice for what to do even if this isn’t a good option?",20Sep2019,1

243,"So I've worked full time at a nursing home for about a year and a half. For the last 2 months, I have told my boss that I am starting nursing school on September 23rd (which is this Monday) and that starting that week I will ONLY be working weekends. Every time I reminded her she said she understood, respected that and supported it. I only want to work weekends so I can focus on school during the week. I don't want to be too exhausted from working I don't have time or energy to study.

So my problem is that I start class Monday, the 23rd. My boss scheduled me Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday from 2pm-10pm. I went to talk to her and said Monday I have class from 8am-5pm, Tuesday 8am-3pm, and Wednesday 8am-3pm. She said, ""okay, I'll take you off Monday"" but she still wants me to work at 3:30pm-10pm on Tuesday and Wednesday and I agreed to it. However, I am becoming extremely stressed. My nursing program is intense and I am sure they will have us start of the program with a ton of information. I am regretting saying I will cover those shifts. Another important thing to consider is that I am scheduled as a supervisor for those shifts, so we only have a short number of people that can work those shifts. The reason she threw me on is because another supervisor is sick. However, my issue is that she never asked me before assuming I would work those shifts when she threw me on the schedule. I am sick to my stomach with nerves of starting my program. I'm wanting to put my 100% into it from the very first day, and am nervous that even working those two days might put me slighty behind. Should I go back and tell my boss that I can't work those shifts afterall as I have been straightforward about my availability for months? What should I do?",20Sep2019,1
244,"This may sound like a very petty concern compared to some of the other vastly more serious posts, but I need some advice just the same.

I go to a decent public highschool with strong academic pressure. I am currently a junior, and I just don't see myself succeeding in the future. My grades are lackluster for the top colleges that my parents want me to get into and my test scores are not anything special. After getting a B on my physics test, my parents yelled at me saying that I needed to drastically shape up and start taking responsibility for my actions. I have decided to do at least 3 hours of physics every day to bolster my grades but I feel like I am making the effort for them, not for myself.

On one hand, I feel like that I am content with a mediocre lifestyle and position in life but on the other hand, my parents are pushing me to do be something more. I do not think my parents are pushing me harder then other parents are pushing their kids, but I also lack the same ambition that some of my peers have. I like physics and feel guilty for getting a bad test score, but I also do not have much ambition in terms of my future. What am I supposed to do?",20Sep2019,4
245,"Today I went to the dentist after not going for about a year and a half. I usually go every 6 months, but I’m 18 and have had good teeth all my life so I wasn’t really prioritizing it. I went in to get a basic cleaning and the first thing my dentist commented on was how clean my teeth were (I often brush them 3 times a day) and that they looked “perfect”. Then after a little more cleaning she said she was going to get a light to check for cavities. This was surprising to me because I had been going to that dentist for almost my whole life and have never had my teeth checked with a light for cavities before. I know that that dentist used them before because my sister got her teeth checked for cavities with a light a few years ago, but that was only because they had suspected she had a cavity in the first place (she ended up not having one), so I was surprised that after my oral hygiene was complimented they were doing that. 

The dentist used the light X-ray thing (sorry I don’t know the name of it) and then called another dentist over to review the images. I heard them talking about it for a long time (using a lot of technical jargon so I’m not quite sure what was said) but it sounded like they were trying to figure out if it was actually a cavity or not. After awhile the dentist told me I have a small cavity in one of my teeth that should be filled as soon as possible, and 3 other problem areas that could develop into cavities as well. I was surprised because I have never had a cavity before, not even during the high risk stages for getting one (childhood to about 15) but now I had one and the possibility of having 3 more. I asked my dentist why this could be when I had been brushing my teeth more in the past 2 years than I ever used to and eating less candy and sugar, basically I was doing less of all of the things that caused cavities but had more cavity problems in my teeth than ever. She said sometimes things like this just happen and that fact that I hadn’t been going to the dentist as frequently as I used to could contribute. 

I don’t know if it’s even a thing to get a second opinion from another dentist about a cavity, but I just feel a little unsure about if I actually have one, especially after I heard the 2 dentists going back and forth on it for awhile. If I were to go to another dentist and ask about that would that be a good idea or just excessive ? I’m not an expert about cavities or how obvious they are and maybe if my dentists say I have one then there’s no need to second guess. I don’t want to waste money but I also don’t want to get an unnecessary filling.",20Sep2019,1
246,"So me and this girl:

We’ve been at college for less than a month now, we went to the same high school, and flirted hardcore on and off for three years. We were best friends before this, and me and her twin sister are very very close. Years of flirting finally came to a climax as we got drunk one night and made out. Since then we’ve been hanging out almost everyday, and having sex just as often. We’re constantly talking about our future, and how much we love each other, and we’re always talking about the details of our futures (how many kids we want to have together, our house, career paths, etc), and I’m definitely falling for her hard. I’m always talking about cuffing and how I want a relationship but she is super unmoving, so I’ve stopped trying to change her mind. I respect her opinion, and I’m just glad she’s in my life. However it truthfully feels like deep down she’s really into us and I just feel like doing this over and over is going to get me hurt, but I really don’t wanna stop. I think I love this girl, and I don’t want to let go. But I also want a future with her. What do I do????",20Sep2019,0

256,"This semester I am taking anatomy for the second time (I got a C before). In the beginning of the semester i tried to make an effort to make a study group because i know how difficult this class can be. I finally had the urge to ask my lab partners for their phone numbers to set something up. One week before the lab exam we finally meet up.

Since I have taken this class already, I am happy to help the rest of my lab partners if they dont understand. The lab exam was about the bones, I did horrible the first time, but I remember alot of the stuff and different memorizing styles. One of my lab partner (jennifer) that is willing to spend the time to actually study and not slack off was  someone I felt like I could rely on. Last week we (me and jennifer) met up 6 hours before our lab starts to go over the stuff she didn't understand. 

I was so happy when she got excited teaching other students and I was really proud.  I even told her that I was really proud of her and impressed that she  caught on so quickly and teaching other students. The other lab partners did not put in the time, It was noticeable, but I put in the effort to teach them because I felt the pressure that they are going through. I didn't mind at the time.

Last night we stayed up pretty late in the library studying. When I went home, I stayed awake immediately studied and sent them all of my  rewrote my diagrams/drawings and materials that help me memorize the material.

So today, again, 6 hours early to study, i felt like I knew 85 percent of the material. Other students begin to show up to the school library and we went over some of the material.  I was shaky on 3 bones, so I asked them if they can help me. And I didn't get help. They just continued going over stuff that I thought they were solid on. I asked again and they all stopped and try to explain it. The way they were explaining it was so belittling. I felt pissed because I took the time to help all of them but when I need help, it seemed like they dont care. Whenever they had questions I would try to draw it out and even show them on the actual bones.. and even go over the terms that help with memorizing the bones.  So when they were trying to explain it, I could not get over that they had the nerve to be like that after I helped them. 

Out of anger I just said I will memorize it myself. I spent 3 hours on these bones before and i could not understand them or the features.  So I thought I would try again by myself because I didn't want to hold the group, so i leave the group and try to find another table in the library but they were all filled. So I go back to the group and Jennifer asked me what was wrong.. I snapped a little. 

I said calmly ""you know I helped you guys understand almost all the material, i dont know these bones, I am asking for help and you guys...""

 I stopped mid sentence cause I didn't want to cause any trouble and to keep everything not hostile. So I smiled and I just stayed quiet trying to study. Then I finally gave up because I couldn't understand it.

When lecture is about to begin, I told them I am going  not go to class because I want to study more for the lab exam (lab exam is after the lecture). I asked Jennifer if she is gonna go to lecture, i told her I can go over the material that she will miss if she misses the lecture to study the lab a little more. She said no, she will go to lecture with the other lab partners because she was scared she was going to miss material. I tried to convince her but she wanted to go and I gave them my good byes and luck for the exam if we dont see each other again before the exam.

So an hour passes and I walk to the restroom and to the water fountain. When I am walking back to my table i see the group  studying at a different table.  As i walk by, I just say hello, and I quickly walk away. I feel confused, and immediate anger. I sit down at my table, by myself.. and I start  questioning everything. I am angry but ultimately it ends with me feeling hurt. My heart just sinks and I'm confused. I put so much effort while they showed no effort. I did not want to walk over there and confront them. So I left the library and walked around campus. 

I felt so shitty and I felt like my anxiety is making me forget some of the material. I ended up texting Jennifer 

""Hows class? lol""

Jennifer- ""it was last minute decision and then other lab partner is there taking notes for everyone."" 

I said ""You guys told me you guys are gonna go to class and I was trying to convince you to stay so we can study.."" 

Also 

"" I feel like im being left out. Which is fine, I'd rather have you guys tell me straight out""

She replies that she was just following and I could have joined them and I didn't need an invitation to join.


During the actual exam I felt shitty, anxious and hurt. I feel like I made stupid mistakes because I kept thinking about it.  Jennifer looked very confident and so did the other students. 

Now, I am here in my thoughts and I feel like I dont want to talk to them or to help them anymore. I know my messages were passive aggressive,  but I felt hurt. So what should I do?",20Sep2019,1
257,"I made pretty good friends with a girl who recently started at the place I work, it’s still in the early stages of friendship and we’ve never talked about anything too deep before. She always makes jokes about how she’s burnt out but always laughs it off. Today we closed together and she worked at her other job before she came and she kept talking about how tired she was and how she gets an average of 4-5 hours of sleep. She works 70 hours a week with no days off because she’s supporting her parents and her sister. I texted her when I got home I make sure she didn’t fall asleep at the wheel and I made a joke about her getting more sleep. And she revealed that she feels like she’s running from her feelings by working so much because she has people that rely on her. She’s in her early 20s and works for 4 people and she feels like she need to get used to it. But I’m really worried about her and I want to help but I don’t feel like there’s anything I can do. I’m usually good at talking to people and trying to help with their problems, but tonight I’m just drawing a blank.

259,"I'm a 17 year old guy who has never fallen in love or even had a crush in my life.

I honestly don't know what to do at this point. I've tried dating men, I've tried dating girls. It always ended with me realizing I don't love them the way they love me, being an asshole and pretending to like them for a few more months because I was scared to leave them, then us drifting apart. I hate it. The people I've dated were such nice, kind people who never wanted to do anything wrong to me, and I couldn't even love them back.
I try to be nice to them and do what a boyfriend should do (though I'm not very ""romantic"" just because I'm awkward and I get embarrassed easily) and I tell them I love them and compliment them and talk to them about things we both like, what am I doing wrong? Why can't I love anyone? It's not that I don't want love, it's the opposite actually. Like the thought of someone unconditionally loving me and me feeling the same makes me really happy. Due to personal reasons I've never had any real strong emotional connections to people, and i just want to know what it feels like.

And please, nobody say ""Maybe you're asexual/aromantic?"" I'm fully aware of that possibility and I hate it (no hate to any aromantics or asexuals reading, I support you guys I'm just not sure if I want that kind of lifestyle) but this is already rambly and venty enough so I'll just drop it.

And if it matters... I'm on the autism spectrum (I'm high ended; I'm able to function physically and mentally) I'm not saying it for attention or to be a special little snowflake, I'm just saying because I've heard that they can have emotional struggles.

(Also please please don't think of this as just another ""I'm sad because I'm single"" post. This isn't my way of asking for a relationship. And btw I apologise if i sounded like an asshole here.

260,"I'm apparently too energetic and friendly when I make friends, and that's bad. No joke, 99.9% of people point it out and push me away, or take it for granted and let me lead all conversations. The 0.1% think I'm a freak even if they don't say it directly so I'm losing all desire to be myself.

Most of it is probably fat as I have little to no muscle on my calves and forearms. This is just the physicality that I’m considering when I think about joining this boxing club. Basically I’m worried about being super out of shape and not being able to fit in with all the boxers.

My next point is how much it will cost me to join. I have to buy boxing shorts for dress code and am assuming I need shoes as well which seem to be pretty pricey from what I looked at on google.

Pros: 
Good way to become fit
Can possibly connect with dad who boxed when he was a kid.
Have always respected combat sports and considered joining wrestling before.
They are currently offering free classes h til the end of September for beginners that will teach the basics of offensive and defensive fighting.

Cons:
Currently unfit and will be definitely out of place physically.
Requires training and dedication which may distract me from my schoolwork.
Already involved in another time consuming club.
Have to spend large quantity of money to join club I don’t even know if I will enjoy.
Dues 70 dollars, shorts ~30 dollars, shoes ~100 dollars.

My main options are a university and a local community college, both campuses are pretty close to my house so thats not really an issue. My main issue is the money. I want to go to a university because i want to enjoy myself and get way more involved than i did in high school and make some friendships ill have for a lifetime. Which means i will also be dorming for 2 main reasons, 1. Have the full university experience and have a ton of fun meeting new people and having fun with friends that i knowgo there, and 2. To get away from my family. My family and i  dont have any issues now but we did in the past that i wont get into, but basically there is still some occasionally recurring bad blood, and it gives me really bad anxiety and makes me really sad at times. I want to get away. But the cost of living on an university on campus is insane. I plan on going either way eventually its just weather i go straight to a university to get away or to go to a community college first to get some basic studies out of the way to save money but still have to live with my parents.

265,"I’m 32 years old, female, married. 

I was always shy and quiet growing up, and as a result people in school and the adults in my life got away with treating me like garbage because I would never defend myself. I was just too timid to say anything back. I spent a lot of time isolated, even though I did maintain a few friendships here and there since I’m quite friendly and well meaning. 

Flash back to a few years ago. I was going through a rough patch in my marriage and my in laws were, at the time, against me. They basically confronted me one day and explained to me how shitty and worthless I am. 

Simultaneously, I worked for a company whose owner was a bully and would take great delight in telling me that I was the reason why things went wrong. Even if I had nothing to do with what was wrong! He singled me out although he wasn’t exactly the greatest boss to everyone else. It really stung that he would harass me mentally. I was doing my best and always did my work thoroughly and got lots of compliments from other bosses and clients. 

At that time in my life, with both my boss and in laws mentioning how terrible I am, life became a blur. I felt like human garbage; just existing in this world until life ended. I felt numb and dead inside. 

I did get a new job and things dramatically improved with my in laws. I love my husband very much and he helped me through these dark times. 

However late at night, I wake up with feelings of worthlessness. I don’t trust people easily. I really am a kind, compassionate person but I wish people hadn’t made me feel: dumb, ugly, disgusting, worthless, weird, gross. It’s easier for me to handle loved ones’ deaths and other crises than it is for me to process attacks that are personal in nature. 

I sometimes go about my day feeling like a piece of garbage not meant to exist in this world. I do have good relationships with co workers, family and friends but it seems like nothing is enough to erase the past.

   About a year ago I realized what I went through with my mother's ex husband was grooming and my mother helped by making me think the inappropriate behavior was just my OCD making it out of proportion (one of my biggest fears since early elementary school was being raped)  unfortunately this led to him molesting me and I said something to my mom but she kept making me second guess myself and was like ""Are you sure?"" over and over until I thought it was in my head (if it was now I would've stood up for myself. I saw a psychiatrist growing up and I am sick that I showed a lot of signs for a child going through abuse, sudden personality change, drastic behavioral changes, and isolating myself, I also read somewhere that UTIs can indicate sexual abuse which I had a major problem with as a young child.
   Today I realized a conversation that made me feel uncomfortable that I had with him in high school. We were alone and he started saying very suggestive things. I started getting uncomfortable and asked him straight up if I was still a virgin.  He said. ""Yes but you almost weren't"" the event he was talking about was when my brother was like 2 or 3 and I was 7 or 8. Brother was sitting in front of the bed playing video games and I was laying on the bed watching. He came in the room and laid in the bed next to me and started to get a boner (I don't remember this this is the story he told to me and later my mother after I told her but denied he said I almost wasn't a virgin) when my mother started yelling at him he told her ""It doesn't matter if it's a little girl or an old lady, if a man lays next to a woman he's going to get a boner."" I realized today that he admitted to me he almost raped me and my mother knew about it but stayed with him. The only reason they broke up was when he sent explicit texts to me a week after I graduated from high school when I had physical evidence it wasn't in my head. 
   I now can't stop sobbing and I feel so empty and alone. I don't know what to do and I'm worried I'm heading into really bad irreversible territory. I honestly don't know what to do or how to move forward.

269,"I am a DCP at a residential facility where we go hands on with clients. I work with a client who aggresses on clients very often and me (particularly women are his target if staff). He is high functioning and has HI/HT. He has been placed on a unit with vulnerable autistic children and its been very hard for them, which brings me to my story and need for advice. Today this aggressive client attacked a client. The client ran to be for protection. I called for staff support as I was alone. The aggressor is much bigger than i am but I attempted body proximity. This caused the client to push me to the ground. He continued running after his target. I tried to initiate a bear hug unsuccessfully. Staff were taking a while to get to the unit, which put me in a dangerous situation. I opened the door and yelled for the staff to run up. I saw that the aggressor made his way to his target and initiated a restraint with another staff successfully. The aggressor was taken off the unit to regulate and process and I proceeded with structure. 2 hours later, I am brought to the director's office and asked to hand in my keys and badge. They placed me on administrative leave. They told me I was being investigated by child protective services...they left me in the dark and refused to tell me what the accusation was. I left very confused. I read a work email stating that I am being accused of pushing the aggressor and digging my nails into his arm. Apparently nursing saw red marks on his arm and I am getting absolutely no support, advice, or protection. I have no idea what to do. I'm not even so much concerned about keeping my job -moreso I am concerned that I'm about to be investigated for abuse with absolutely no lawyer. I know I did what I was taught and I absolutely did not dig my nails into his arm- at least not intentionally in any way. Sometimes in restraints children and staff end up with bruises and scratches. I have never had a child report me for any type of abuse. I have no way to protect myself in this investigation other than telling the events as they truly happened. Our facility has no cameras and I am just nervous and scared that this investigation could ruin my entire career by coming up on a background check. 

Any advice would be great, as I am recieving nothing from absolutely no one.",20Sep2019,1
270,"So I recently started senior year, I started to hang out with a certain group of friends I have been hanging out with ever since late 10th grade. We are a group where we can joke around, but never really take any of eachother seriously. 
I used to weigh 225lbs at 15-16 years old, this brought a huge tease and roast on my appearance. It didn’t do any good to my self esteem, I had hated myself, but the words combined with having a goal led to the weight loss journey. So I started working out and eating proper, during which, I’m still being teased about my appearance everyday. 

I then get all the way down to 170lbs, I feel so proud of myself, I’ve worked very hard to get here. Surprise surprise, the people who roasted and teased me barely gave it attention. If so, it was such a backhanded statement. To this day, those same guys, one of them looking “fatter” than me, and the other being super super skinny are the ones who still tease me about being fat despite trying to look better and losing all the weight. 

I may come off as a sensitive cuck, I don’t care if I get compliments, I don’t like the attention but why bother teasing me if I don’t treat you that way. I’d like to note, I told one of my “friends” that I don’t like the way they treat me and he told everyone in the group so they started mocking me; it’s very confusing and I really need advice, I’m young and I don’t know exactly what to do? Do I just suck it up and “joke” with them or stop hanging out with them. My emotions are mixed, I can’t really trust any of them, but at the same time, it seems like they are cool and funny which leads me to hanging out with them. 
I may be asking for much? I’m just confused, when I think of a friend, I think of someone who can at least support you. I don’t see that in any of them, all these guys do is roast me, they bring no value yet I hang out with them, I also feel scared sometimes to be around them since all I can feel is negative energy but I do it for some reason. I just need advice on what to do, are these just a couple of bros just fucking around or are they actually toxic?",20Sep2019,1
272,"I'm 15 and I'm homeschooled. I can't leave my house unless I'm with my mom because I'm not allowed to walk anywhere and I don't have a license or car. I'm overweight and I feel awful. I genuinely don't think there is a single thing about me that is beautiful. I feel like I'm being selfish for not loving who I am because so many people have much worse. I have an amazing mother and some wonderful siblings. (Even though my siblings get on my nerves sometimes) I should be happy. I love my family and I will never stop loving them. But I feel empty. I'm unhappy. There have been so many times where I just cry and I don't even know why. But theres sometimes where I feel nothing at all. Like I mentioned before, I'm homeschooled. I'm always by myself and I have nobody to talk to. (None of my siblings live with me) I do have goals but for some reason, I only have motivation for some of them. Sometimes I have random bursts of motivation for everything, then within a few days, I break down and lose it all. It's hard to explain but it genuinely feels like theres a hole in my chest, like I'm missing a part of me. There have been times where I thought about self harm but I told myself I would never do it because I love my mom too much and I couldnt do that to her no matter how much I hated myself. I still get the thoughts all the time though. I love cooking and video games but I just stopped doing both of them for some reason. I just dont feel like doing it. I dont know what's happened to me. I used to be the smiley outgoing girl that wanted to be everybody's friend but now I can barely order my own food at a restaurant because I'm scared they are secretly judging me. I'm scared everyone is secretly judging me. If I hear people laughing, I'm scared they're laughing at me. I'm scared of so many things. I dont know what's wrong with me. I have pretty much only one friend but shes never been the type of person to give advice and I'm going to be honest, not a great listener (shes still an amazing friend and I am lucky to have her). I've never told anyone about this but I just feel lost. I really just want a hug. There have been times when I fall asleep hugging my blanket because I needed SOMETHING.  I'm an outgoing person but I lost the motivation to be outgoing in the past few years. This is actually my first year of being homeschooled. I had to literally cry to my mom begging her to take me out if school because it was so bad. I literally had no friends there and it was miserable. I sat by myself at lunch every day. It's my fault for not talking a lot I guess but it's so difficult to. Everytime I talk to new people, I just want to shut down. I dont know what's wrong with me. I'm sorry if this is stupid I just don't know what to do because I just cant bring myself to tell anybody about it.",20Sep2019,1
273,"My sister and I have an 8 year age gap. I'm 20 and she's 12. Regardless, we have a very close relationship. She doesn't like to get into her feelings much and I tend to respect that. Instead, we bond over video games and funny videos.  


 My little sister has been on and off various different  ADHD meds her whole life. When she was in 5th grade I went with her on registration day to meet her teachers. A few of the kids recognized her and immediately started warning their new 5th grade teacher about my sister, telling her that she often times doesn't listen or pay attention in class. If my sister heard them then she pretended not to.   


She's recently had her 7th grade wellness exams, where she reported to her doctor that she's been feeling depressed. She's now in counseling for it during school hours. She also shows bits of anxiety, going so far as to avoid asking her friends for help when she forgot her textbook at school today (my reasoning was that maybe they had the same homework and could take pictures of the question for her). She also doesn't like taking her medicine, despite the fact that it helps her focus in school. She doesn't have a good history with ADHD meds anyway. They've disrupted her appetite and made her flat on emotions.  


 I saw her behavior sheet for the first time and asked her if other kids in school had them too. She got defensive and quickly went to hide her behavior sheet from me after telling me ""NO!"" I feel like a lot of her issues stems from the fact that she feels she doesn't fit in. And especially with her going through puberty and transitioning into a teenager herself, this probably doesn't help. I don't know what to do or how to make her feel normal. Any advice?",20Sep2019,1
274,"So I work at a video store in Dallas Texas, where we close at eleven on weekdays, anyways it was just the three of us, me and two coworkers one male and one female, leaving as we normally do at about 12:03 as if usually takes us an hour to close and clean everything and straighten up, all that jazz. 

So as we’re walking out of the store, which is on  a fairly trafficked street, and well lit, when I look to the left and notice across the street there were three dudes who looked like they definitely weren’t there to make friends. It takes about three seconds for them to IMMEDIATELY start walking towards us (four lane street) and at a damn quick pace. 

I’m not paranoid and I’m street smart enough to know what’s up when every alarm in my head starts going off at the same time at max volume. So I instantly tell me coworkers to get to their cars as fast as they can, sprint to mine, and proceed to grab my S&amp;W MP shield 9mm with a full clip of +P hollow point ammunition and put a round in the chamber so fast it would make their heads spin.

Now my female coworker got the message and saw what was going on, so she made it to her car pretty fast, got in and left. My other coworker got in his car and turned his Brights on as he was facing their direction.  And I stand there with my pistol in my hand. And as the three get closer I see a shiny metal bar like object in the front guys hand. And as they got closer I saw that it was a knife. 

As far as I’m concerned that’s enough of a reason for me to start lining up a shot, and as I’m raising my gun and preparing to tell them to immediately back away or face the consequences, one of the guys on the side notices and instantly stops his friends and they start backing up and duck off behind some of the stores across the street. 

I informed my coworker of the extent of the situation and we both left and didn’t stop to give them the tail lights. 

I don’t regret my decisions and if it had come down to it I would have unloaded into them without hesitation or remorse. I know what I saw, and that area where I work is no stranger to crime. Not notorious for it mind you, but certainly no stranger.  

I don’t carry a gun because I want to shoot anyone. I don’t. The thought of having to make that kind of decision scares me and still does, and definitely did when I had to decide between my safety and that of my friends and coworkers, and the lives of three people. 

Did I make the right decision? I didn’t want to, but if they hadn’t stopped and if the main person had gotten any closer with a knife in his hand and two other people with him, I would have taken the shot. I was shaking when I got back in my car and I just feel angry and upset that the situation even happened. I hated the feeling of pointing a gun at someone. 

But at the same time I want to know if i did the right thing, and I want to be sure that if I hadn’t done what I did, something far worse could have happened.",20Sep2019,5

280,"So I’m a 17 yr guy. I got caught with weed and stuff at the beginning of the summer. I smoked weed because I was miserable due to depression and I couldn’t handle being sober. That’s another story though. So anyways, after getting caught my parents were ok with it. I was forced to tell them I was depressed and didn’t want to be alive etc. so they took it easy.  They never really mentioned it again, but lately I’ve been getting questioned about every single thing I do. Earlier today I forgot I left a shoulder bag out in my car so I went out and got that and my mom said “what’re you hiding, let me look in it” and she opened it, it was completely empty, like I told her. Whenever I get a call my mom asks me who it was, why they called, what they said, why they said what they said etc. If I ever get stuck in traffic and come home from work 5 mins late they think I’m doing drugs. They accused me of doing heroin last week. They constantly tell me how fucked I’ll be if I ever do anything drug related. When my friends get off work late and I want to go hangout with them my mom always accuses me of going out and doing drugs. I’m constantly being told how my mom has no trust for me. Constantly being questioned about every single thing I do. If I lock my door to change my parents think I’m smoking in my room. If I’m tired my parents think I’m high. It’s been 4 months and my parents don’t trust me. I have to think through everything I do to make sure nothing looks sketchy. I have to spend so much time trying to think “how do I tell my mom this without sounding sketchy”. It’s exhausting. I’m miserable, I don’t want to be in my house. I fucking hate it. If things go according to plan, I’ll be moving out once I graduate, and go to Oregon to a community college for 2 years to save money then go to the school I want. My original plan was to stay in my house for two years to save money but I just fucking can’t.

287,"As the title suggests, my issue is that - in its simplest form. I’ve always been a bit ‘dopey’ and ‘airheaded’. I was told that when the store is quieter I do a good job, but get quite frazzled when we get a surge of customers. I have a really hard time remembering what customers ordered, and the different prices with extras etc. it’s almost as if my mind just freezes and I go into panic mode and make mistakes. But honestly, I can wholeheartedly say that I work my ass off and always make sure I’ doing something. I ask questions and make it known to my boss/older co-workers that I want to be there and actually give a shit.

Whilst I was still dopey with my last job (bricklayers’ labourer - quite hard work) I was doing a really good job. The boss was so impressed that he offered an apprenticeship to me because he wanted someone with my work ethic in his crew. A couple of months later and I was on my way to work in the morning and edged out to get a view onto a T-intersection (two lanes to turn right, I was in the outer lane and I couldn’t see because a huge SUV) and smashed into a car that was going 70km/h. Luckily no one was hurt but the policeman told me that I was lucky that I didn’t seriously injure anyone. My car was basically ruined up to my windshield, and I just missed the other person by a metre. That was the scariest fucking moment of my life. I know I could never live with killing someone. Anyways, the weeks after that working my attentiveness declined significantly, to the point where my boss kept drilling me putting my under the pump and screaming at me that “You’ve dropped the fucking” and “you’re good for nothing” which hurt. I quit 2 weeks later because I couldn’t keep getting treated like shit. I was literally going at 110% and I was at my breaking point for a couple of weeks there.

Now, when I was told today that I am getting one last shift to prove myself, I put on a brave face. But it really fucking hurt. That feeling of absolutely giving your all and it’s not good enough. I’m going to go to study the hell out of the menu so I know it in my sleep, but is there any advice that I could have?

Now, we no longer see each other but we still keep in contact.

The reason why I put (?) to friend is because things got slightly complicated when we were in our last year, we went through a whole bunch of conflict and many people have told me that he did not treat me right as a friend. Long story short, it's more like him putting me as a second choice and he definitely led me on and told me nothing was up.

He has made me feel bad often tbh, but I also feel very sad about abandoning a 4 year friendship.   
Nowadays, I started not putting in effort to responding and he also definitely puts me as a non-important priority, and I just don't really know if it is worth talking empty words and mindless conversation. I think what's holding me back is really what we had.

What do you guys think? Is it better to stop this completely or is it better to ride it out for a while?

Yesterday I really made an effort to go to school. I started to cry on the bus and struggle to breathe to the point where I was turning heads. By the time the bus arrived at school I got myself together and was headed to my favorite teacher's room before class to get caught up, say hello, and ask him for a letter of recommendation.

He said something like ""I don't even know how many days you're been gone or the last time you came to school."" I started to tear up and he asked if I was okay and I told him I was just tired. I didn't even get a chance to ask him for a recommendation because I quickly left. I ran in the bathroom and sobbed some more feeling mortified. Eventually I calmed down enough to go to my guidance counselor's office. We both decided, with me still crying and embarrassed, that the best thing for me would be to drop out and and take the HiSet (Basically the GED).
It's been about 20 hours since this and I've spent it: sleeping, crying, and writing this post. I've had my heart set on moving away for college since I was young as my family dynamic has greatly contributed to my mental health issues. Both my guidance counselor and my mom think the best thing would be for me to attend the community college down the street for 2 years staying with my family. I feel incredibly trapped and scared right now. I not sure what I should do. I really want to leave home for school but I'm broke and my academic history is completely trashed now. 
I would appreciate any advice you guys could give me.",20Sep2019,0
302,"My friend at the time had stopped going to school and was living with him and his parents. She was working as a part time baby sitter during her nearly 1~2 years living there. She wasnt really motivated and he was running around working and school so he was often busy. Suddenly her boyfriend had her move out. He said it was his parents who wanted her to move out, then changed it to so ""They can both grow in life and needed some independence."" I didnt think that was the actual reason and I turned out to be correct. The night she moved out he dumped her over text. 

She thinks it's because they were living with his parents, but I dont really think that was the case. I wont go detail about it. 

Now it's been nearly a year and she tells me she still thinks about him every day and she still loves him. The thing is, he has a new girlfriend and they got together relatively quickly. I think he was emotional done with the relationship long before he dumped her but he didnt want to make her move out because it was a really difficult situation. It ended pretty fucked up still because there was issues of expensive gifts being accepted even though he was already planning on dumping her and having her move out. Then promises of repayment and not following through. 

I get being hung up on someone, but holding on to them doesnt sound healthy. I got dumped around the same time as her and was over my ex after a while. 

I want to help her, but I dont really know how to go about it other than saying ""Just fucking get over him and move on. It's done and in the past. You cant do anything about it."" That would be fucked up to say, but she does need to move on and I dont really know how to help her. What can I do?",20Sep2019,1
303,"hello everybody.
so, it just happens that I have some psychological issues that prevent me from living my life (codependency, unhealthy attachments, uncontrollable emotions, self-destruction &amp;sabotage, weak boundaries, no sense of self, addictions, etc.). I've always been aware of that, but now it's getting out of hand and affecting 90% of my daily life. I don't want to go into details, it's irrelevant. the point is, it's getting worse, and if I don't do something about it soon, it will destroy my life.

so this weekend, I want to do something that will help me move out of the mindset I've been stuck in. I know it's not gonna be something you can deal with overnight. but I want a direction, something to help me reset and start dealing with the problem, instead of running away from it.

so what can I do for a start? 
my thoughts so far:
-read a book about my problem (don't think it could actually help, since I'm already aware of it's existence and I don't think going ""bruh that's me!"" will actually help me to change)
-schedule a session with a therapist (I'm low on cash &amp; I'm scared I'll get a bad therapist who will make things worse. also I'm not sure I'll be able to tell a therapist all my problems, because they're just too personal)
-drugs (jk, I know people reported lsd/psychedelics as having tremendous effect on dealing with anxiety and depression, but I don't have access to such drugs right now)
-break off an unhealthy relationship (it's gonna be better in the long run, but in my current state it's still the only thing that keeps me going)

what can you advice? is there something radical I can do/use short-term to put a start to longtime work of getting better? I'm not really coping anymore, I need to do something before I go past the point of no return. all suggestions are very appreciated.",20Sep2019,2
304,"idk what to do now cos some guy came up to me and i was sitting down, idk why i was so frozen to even get up from my seat to refuse whatever he was trying to sell. He started talking about like hair treatments and discounts, which hit my heart cos my mom really wants to get her hair done for a wedding next week. now i am not a particular rich person because i am a university student with no income. i had 190 dollars in my bank and the member cards were worth 60 dollars. but after peer pressure to give him 60 bucks, i went to research online that a few people were reselling their cos it wasn't a free treatment card like it said it was and you would still have to fork out a significant amount of money for the hair treatment. tbh i am so embarrassed and disappointed with myself i wanted to throw the cards away and not tell my mom how stupid i was. I'm trying to resell it online too but i dont think it will sell.

What should i do? should i tell my mom and potentially go there to spend hundreds of dollars even after i paid 60 or should i not burden my mom (because she doesn't earn alot too) and just chuck them one side to be sold or expire and fucking throw my stupidity out with them?

308,I’m having a difficult time recently endlessly wishing I had someone to share my love with and to hold. It feels like a need that is unfulfilled and like time is just slowly passing where I don’t get to experience this love that so many others do. I look around and see all these couples and wonder why I don’t have this... I know people say “just love yourself” and I believe even if I did love myself completely... I still would want to experience love and have someone to offer support and care to. I do try... I am not just sitting here doing nothing. And each time I try it just makes me even more hopeless because my efforts fail. I’m sick of doing depressing things like dreaming up scenarios of a future boyfriend- it seems like the closest thing I have gotten to love was the guy I made up in my head.

315,"I went to uni to talk to a kind of a counselor. Wasn't a lot of help. They just said either work or make sure to pass atleast half of the exams. Maybe take less classes. Other than that not much. Came home and I got like really shakey hands. If I grab something and give a bit of pressure my hands just trembles. I'm guessing this is stress related.

I already have a bachelor in accounting and tax. I thought before starting work why not get another bachelor+master on commercial sciences (to make my whole family proud and be one of the first person to get one). Because I failed all of my classes if I want to study on then I'll have to pass atleast half of my classes or else I won't be allowed to go on and have to wait for atleast 3 years before I can go to this university and study this subject.

My brother had a small car accident with huge consequences. Because of that I had to get to a lot of hospitals even had to go 1 outside of Belgium. And that with my slight stress with some other family things, I wasn't able to concentrate on my studies a lot. He is better now but there is always a chance that it could go wrong (probably his wound wil never get fixed). I started to take some night shifts after classes so I could help my mom out. But still these things shouldn't have been excuses, a lot of people with all these stuff still pass their exams. Maybe I got burnout from studying or it was just too much for me, perhaps it was because university language is maybe too hard since I'm not a native Dutch speaker. I even blacked out on some of my exams because of so much stress of getting good results.

When I told my mom about my results, she wasn't angry like I had expected, she was let down. Skyped my dad and told him, the pure disappointment on his face, still see it before me. Now they kind of have accepted it and are pushing me to make a decision. I promised them that I'll make a decision by tomorrow.

Anybody got any advice on if I should look for a permanent job or still try uni. I really want to do it but I'm just really really scared of failing again and then wasting time that I could have used for earning money. If I were to study on I'm probably going to get a tutor for the maths related classes. But the others I'll try to keep them up at home, with some kind of supervision because I don't trust myself fully. Any advice on how to study better and keep lessons in check would also be great.

316,"This may be long because I tend to babble so apologies in advance.
I'm a 21F with a solid plan for my life. Before having kids there are a number of things I have planned; finish uni, live overseas, get my career in place, get married, and either purchase or be very close to buying my own home. I've been dating my boyfriend for almost 3 years now, and we do see a future together. Marriage is not his priority, but he has said he'll happily get married one day if it is important to me (which it is). He also wants kids eventually, but none of this stuff is important to him right now so he doesn't really care about it or think about it. I wish my attitude was the same as his.

Here's the problem; I am insanely clucky. I used to dislike kids wholeheartedly, especially little ones, because I didn't know how to interact with them, but I always knew I would eventually want them, I just didn't know it would be so soon. About a year and a half ago, a lot of my friends started getting pregnant and having kids. This flipped a switch in my brain and made me really want my own. At first, I assumed it was just herd mentality, and the human need to reproduce and all that instinctual stuff, but it just won't go away. My attitude towards kids has really changed too. Now I appreciate the wonderfulness of kids at every stage. I find babies and toddlers insanely cute, older kids clever, interesting and funny. Teenagers and preteens, I have a desire to help with their troubles and give them guidance. It's like my maternal brain has taken over completely. I threw myself into my hobbies and studies hoping I could subdue this until I'm ready. I've hoped it would go away in time, but it's been about a year and a half and the maternal need is so strong. I've tried to think about all the things having children restricts you from doing. I've tried to think about how much hard work it is, physically, emotionally, and financially. Not one of these things has me even a little perturbed, and not one day goes by that I'm not thinking about what it will be like when I have a baby of my own.

With all my plans however, it is still going to be at least 5 years before I am logically ready to have kids, and that isn't counting how long it will take my partner to be ready (which I can safely assume will be a few years longer than me).
With this in mind, how on earth do I put my maternal brain on the backburner until I'm actually ready to have kids? These emotions have been so strong for the past YEAR and I can't take it anymore. H E L P",20Sep2019,3

I'm talking; as a kid of 7 or 8+, I would steal chocolates (from my siblings lunch as they would get one bar a day), sweets and crisps, hide them to eat later, then hide the wrappers. Behind my bed was littered with chocolate and crisp wrappers. It was worse in my teenage years when we were very low on money and food, we did always get dinner and breakfast but I always felt some base level of hunger. My day's food from 8 until 5 or 6pm (I walked/ran to and from school) was the same ham sandwich every day, an apple, a chocolate bar and that's pretty much it. It was always the same food because we were on a tight budget and it was cheap. Some people might laugh but I feel like I really need to get a handle on this. 

My parents made sure I never had access to that much sweet stuff, which I can understand wanting to keep your kids healthy. We did get junk food, it just wasn't that often.

During those shifts, after I got done with my rounds, cleaning, and other tasks, I would work on my 'hired for' work, and to keep myself awake I would listen to YouTube videos or podcasts as background noise, or casually surf the net to keep myself up.

During this beratment I received, I was yelled at for my excessive usage, was told by this woman, 'I don't like you. I don't like the way you look. And I don't like your attitude.'  Throughout the 'meeting' I was apparently shown a stack of papers that was my internet usage, though when I asked to see this evidence, I was denied. I was also told to 'not expect to be here past Monday.' She said that if I were to use the computer for anything other than work related things until she talked to the executive administrator, I would be fired immediately. As she went to leave, she asked if I had any questions, I asked if I could get these directions in writing. She responded with 'NO!' When I asked as to why, she said and I quote here... 'Because I said so.' 

Monday came and went, that next Tuesday I was supposed to have my yearly review which didn't happen... Fast forward till the 29th when I finally got my 'write up' for this issue. Of which several other accusations have been added to the write up, as dereliction of work, not doing rounds, improper use of my personal cell phone, and still the improper use of the internet. When I received this write up I was in a meeting with our 'head' of HR and the administrator, I told them that due to the other issues that were brought up I refused to sign the write up, I was then told by HR, that whether I sign it or not, it didn't matter it was still going into effect. I reluctantly signed it telling them that I would be filing an appeal to our managerial company about this...again fast forward to past labor day, and I was called into a meeting by the administrator again and was told that due to more improper internet usage that I was being fired. 

The dates that I was given regarding the new 'improper usages' were the Sunday after the initial yelling I got, (I did go in on this Sunday at 0200 to print off some concert tickets that I forgot to print off) and the other date was the Wednesday immediately before I got the full write up, (I went in to help with our EHR system being down, and during my time there I was asked to administrator a medication that one of our CNAs was not trained on yet. So while waiting I printed off a syllabus for my class that started that Monday.) Both of these dates that were recited to me, I was off the clock for both instances. But apparently that didn't matter, and I was escorted out of the building.

Now I never once argued or fought that fact that I did use the internet for non-work related reason, in fact I fully admit that most of it. But I did never neglect our tenants, I never didn't answer call lights, I never missed rounds, and I never went to any sites that were 'dangerous.'

However, doing stuff that literally everyone else did while they were working, some of which I have evidence of, in my opinion is a bullshit reason to get fired, especially considering the fact that the instances given to me were done while I was off the clock, and before I was actually given my formal write up. It just smells like they were looking for reason to get rid of me...am I crazy? Dumb, yeah I won't deny that. But did I deserve to get fired, especially for printing off a syllabus for school!? Or to have my unemployment challenged? I don't think so, but what do you think?

Am I crazy? Am I somewhat in the right here? Did I really deserve to get fired? I just feel so conflicted and depressed for this whole issue...

337,Ok so recently I was able to finally physically hit in my dreams where all my life I couldn’t. So last night I guess it was a vivid dream and idk why I was beating a cat with a bat and I just remember its face as I was hitting it and where I was hitting. It felt and feels so real rn. Idk why I was beating it but the point of having the bat was to beat the creep in the closet in the next room which I did very angrily after the cat was dead. Is there a reason for the cat? It was black. I feel like crying every time I think of it’s face it made while I was beating it. Pain and hurt. I would never do that to any animal ever. Advice ?,20Sep2019,1
338,"I have to get a flexible sigmoidoscopy on monday and I am terrified of being ""put under"" I don't like giving up the control and I know it's unlikely but the thought of adverse side effects (including death) terrifies me as well. It doesn't help that I have a lightheadedness/vertigo problem that happens when I tilt my head towards the ceiling, it is such a horrible feeling I can't do it for more than like 2 seconds. Still undiagnosed so far.

Anyway I've taken Halcion before (which did temporarily prevent the vertigo issue) but that isn't really the same, as you don't ever really go ""under"" you just get sleepy and end up forgetting parts of the thing afterwards.

I'm not sure why as when I looked it up it appears most flexible sigmoidoscopy are done with no sedation. But the place I am doing it at insists they must use sedation as the procedure will be traumatizing if they don't, so I'm going to have to.",20Sep2019,8

341,"I recently finished high school and I don't know what to do now. I'm currently living at home with my parents, unemployed (looking for a part-time job) because I don't know what I want to study. I find so many fields of science very interesting and it's difficult to choose. I feel like I need some counseling, but it's basically impossible to find a student counselor when you're already out of school. 

That's not really the main part of my problem though. The thing I find really difficult is that I don't want to move away from my boyfriend, but the college in my hometown is not interesting to me at all. My boyfriend wants to study robotics in our home town, and does not want to move away from his family. I want to study chemistry/biomedicine/biotech, and those fields of education are only avaliable to me if I move to a different city. I also fear that when we both have finished our education, we still wont be able to find work in the same city. It makes me so sad to think about choosing between an enjoyable career or my boyfriend, who I love more than anyone in the world. 

I don't know what to do about this and it makes me so anxious. I'm sorry that I don't have a more specific question, but I just feel like I need some advice and reassurance from someone older and wiser.",20Sep2019,6
342,"Started when I was 7 ended when I was 14, my brother who was 3 years older touched my dick, kissed me (cheeks by force), touch my ass and show me his dick, he would always say it was a joke which apparently nullified that it was sexual abuse despite him doing it against my will during times where I was young and vulnerable, he was much bigger than me which is why I could never shrug him off, that was the abuse in a nutshell without going into other details

I'm 16 now and confronted him today about it and he sais it was a joke and there was no sexual undertone therefore he didn't sexually abuse/molest me but I feel like he did because I have to live with the fact that he touched me that way at such a young age even if it was a joke, a brother should never touch another brother that way. He completely dismissed me and said the #metoo movement is messing with my head and that if it was a joke it does not mean it wasn't assault if a private area is touched without consent. I'm too scared to tell my parents because of how it would break the whole family but I just din't know what to do, I feel so ashamed and disgusted with myself",20Sep2019,987

345,"Hello eveyone.

As people know, abuse is never easy nor ever recoverable. Its stuck there. 

Well, here it goes.
I was 12 at the time, I was out with my friends and happened to come across a group of teenagers hanging about with an older man. I went and sat down for 20 mintues tops, even know I was in a terrible place at that time, I still managed to see what was happening. So i left. About a week later, we crossed paths again. Only this time, he seemed different. All 5 of my friends left me that night with him. 
Thats where it begun. My while life went up in a puff of smoke, not only because I was in a abusive household with my mother having mental heath problems, and my father being controlling and very abusive. 
When I got to 15, i was unrecognisable. I was drinking at least 7 days a weeks, I couldn't even go to school without having alcohol. I got into fights, stayed out all night, disappeared for days at a time, hanging out with much older men(including my ex) 
I was about to be put in a secure unit not just for my safety. But for the people outside. I had to beg 3 strangers behind a desk to not put me away. So that being said, I ended up in foster care. 
It Got a whole lot worse. And you'd think how could it? I had doctors, CPNS, social services. You name it, I had them. Not one of these people protected me. 
I'll spare the rest as I've written way to much already.

I would of rather of had broken bones than having to live the life i'm living right now. I've tried to commit suicide on 8 occasions. I've self harmed and its a terrible reminder because I know why I did.

We're now 10 years down the line and I only just happened to end things with him 5 years ago but up untill 4 months ago ye was still in contact. 

I'm in a fantastic new relationship and i couldnt be more happy in my life. Its only coming up for 10 months but i honestly don't know what i would do without him. 
He knows bits and bobs but not everything. 

Reason for me posting this today is because I'm feeling hurt. I cant explain it and I feel I'm going to go into a deep depression and i dont want to go back there again.

I'm now 24 and i feel my ex has just forgotten I have existed. Maybe it's because I'm older? I don't really know. My hate and anger is rising to the surface. Hes did things to me that people know about, people knew I was 12 and that abuse went on for years. 8 years tops, even know I've know him for 10. I'm struggling to try stay on track.

Not really sure if I've explained myself right.",20Sep2019,5

347,"So I’m asking this because my family wasn’t super explanatory about this sort of stuff and I was pretty much M.I.A all of grade twelve because mental illness 😑 but I never got to apply for a scholarship because I knew I wasn’t about to graduate. 
So the following school year comes and I am put in the adult education centre in my city (I’m still only 17 when put into it, but it is a good alternative for me because it’s at a school alternative for even youth I guess ) 
but anyways I was wondering..... 
am I able to apply for a scholarship if I haven’t graduated yet and am still eighteen? 

No one ever explained this stuff to me and I’ve done my fair amount of googling to try and figure it out and I can’t get a specific answer.

348,"Took me a long time to work up the energy/courage to type all of this out so here goes:
Im 23 years old, I just turned 23 on the 11th and my anxiety has been flaring like crazy. 
I don’t know what I want to do with my life, well I don’t know how to get into my life (if that makes sense). I started college fresh out of high school, now that I now the things I do now I probably should have taken a break before starting college to think about my options and other crap, but I didn’t. I panicked, partially jealous of everyone else going to school because they knew what they wanted to major in and went for it, I on the other hand had no clue.  At the time I was pursuing a BSN, both my mom and sister are in the medical field and would always gas me about the kind of money i could make, they had stories about what went on and their love for the medical field so I just guessed I’d develop a love for it as I studied for it.
Wrong. 
My first couple of semesters (3) were somewhat trash, I felt like I had no discipline or time management skills, so I struggled to stay in because I did NOT want to be the college drop out failure. I stayed, took semesters off because of suspension rules, wrote appeal letters for financial aid to try to keep going, etc. Later went on to find out that I’m actually ADHD (which explains a whole hell of a lot) and my anxiety with the fear of school in general, failing, studying, homework, work I didn’t understand, and sooo many other factors made it terrifying. It got to a point where I would drive across town to campus, park in my class building parking lot, and have a whole episode in the car freaking out about how Im a failure and somehow everyone in that building knew I was a failure too. 
Then I met someone, completely changed how I saw myself. He was such a force in my life I never thought someone like me would have the opportunity at a relationship like that and I am still so thankful to have had him in my life.. 
He died in front of me at our apartment march of this year and that sent me.
I haven’t been able to focus since, I was in the middle of spring semester at that point and was so optimistic, I had took a semester off and was back enrolled. My financial aid was reinstated and I was ready to finish my classes but when that happened I couldn’t stomach anything, I tried to keep up with work and explained my situation to my professor but in reality I didn’t have the energy and I couldn’t expect them to just pass me because of a loss. So I “dropped out”.  
6 months later I’m better, but now I’m left with the aftermath. School is on the back burner now obviously, I need to make sure I know what I want to do before I put in the work to re-enroll right now and  I’m just working on paying off the few student loans I had.  I didn’t know what I wanted to before going to school and I should have accepted that then. 
Moving on, I don’t see myself with a everyday job. I’m very creative, love talking with people, I love making people feel good about themselves and in general. I love make up, fashion, etc. anything that has to do with the dynamic of self image both materialistic or naturally, I would love to delve into something like that. I guess part of my issue is I don’t know what majors are offered and what all you can do in those majors I know some things are so vast it’s hard to list everything. I have a fear of working a boring job or settling for the bare minimum when I know that just isn’t me.  
What should I do when it comes to school? 
What are some majors you think might interest me?
Any other recommendations?",20Sep2019,3
349,"I met my boyfriend about 2 years ago, and ended up making friends with two of his friends who were a couple. They're super nice people, and we have loads in common, but they have the worst time management I've ever experienced. They're always late when we make plans, and not because they have a good excuse. Last week, we were going to meet up to have a game night at theirs, but they were having company during the day. So we said we'd meet up around 17/18, after their company went home. We message them at 17 and they said the company is just about to leave, so we say we'll come over in 20 mins. As we go to leave, we get another message from them saying they won't be home until about 19 because they decided to go for a walk. We tried to say well, we made plans for 17/18, etc. but they didn't see the problem because they were telling us now that they were going for a walk (I think they thought we'd only be upset if we got to their place and they weren't home).

And today we had made plans in the evening to go to bowling/an arcade after they got off work (we made these plans last week), but they text us this morning saying it would be better to go next week on the weekend so we have more time because they get off work at 17 and just realized they had something to do, so they wouldn't get there until 19 and it closes at 21. This really irritated us, because we discussed time when we made the plans, and they didn't ask if we were okay with the change, they just decided to change it. 

They're constantly doing stuff like this, changing plans without consulting us or just general lateness. I've lost track of how many trains we've missed because they needed 5 more minutes. 

I'm getting really fed up. I pride myself with being on time and feel highly disrespected when people treat my time like it's unimportant. How can I tell them that this is getting to a be a real issue, and is making me just not want to see them anymore without starting a fight and damaging the friendship?",20Sep2019,3

352,"I will use fake names for this, there is Bella and Jasmine. Jasmine also let me post this. 
So we three are both K-POP fans, and unfortunately Bella is a bit of a cringey one (I got over that stage) but that’s okay with me. And you see, our favourite group is obviously BTS. So it started Jasmine saying how she heard BTS is in New Zealand and how she wishes they could be In Australia (this is where we live, and this is the main argument). She also states how she finds it sad that Australia isn’t that popular. Then Bella comes in and gets mad that Jasmine said that Australia wasn’t popular. She starts going on of how beautiful Australia is. Jasmine agrees with this, but she also states that she thinks London is more beautiful. Bella flips off, like really bad, and starts getting really mad at Jasmine. 
So here is this argument they are having, and Bella is really mad that Jasmine thinks other countries are better than Australia.
I come in at this point, after Jasmine told me that Bella blocked her. I say things like ‘London is very beautiful, I honestly prefer it, but Australia is also very beautiful’ I try explaining that and how we all prefer other countries and how each country is beautiful in its own way, and she still gets mad. Jasmine and I keep trying to resolve things but she just won’t stop. This continues on for about 5-10 minutes. 
Then it all calms down but it is still ongoing. After a few minutes of no text messages, Jasmine texts me saying that Bella was just texting her. She then sent me a screenshot of how Bella was talking about how she wishes she could be like me (this really surprised me). I linked it below as Screenshot 1.
Now here is the part I’m worried about. A year ago, Bella told us that she had depression. She still has it, I can tell by the way she acts. And then Jasmine left as Bella had texted her. Jasmine came back and told me what happened. She gave me another screenshot (Screenshot 2) and I’m so worried I’m crying while writing this. I love her, she’s been one of my best friends for years. I really want to help her but I don’t know how. I’ve never had depression before, I don’t know what she is going through. I don’t even want to assume either. I really need help.

356,"So I'm a (F) 23 and about one year and a half ago I got this job at my college campus. I got the job simply because my previous job was too far from my campus and I couldn't make the hours. 

When first starting out this job my boss was very nice (as they all seem in the beginning) and very friendly. She would be interested in knowing about her employees social lives and personal lives and would be like a go-to person to call or talk to if your life felt like it was falling apart. 

After working there for a year, I was offered a management position but she treats me more like her assistant that is supposed to do her work for her. When she has a bad day she takes it out on me and starts telling me my ""bad qualities"" and what I should improve for no reason. Half the time the bad qualities she says is just based off her personal opinions and not work related. For example: she told my that one of my bad qualities is that I would rather learn new information myself, than to call up someone from a different department and have them give me the answer on how to do something. 

Anyway, she constantly picks on everything that I do and never recognizes my work but will recognize another co-workers work, which half the time is something I taught them. I have gotten the company up to 13% in sales because of my idea and she took credit for it when telling the regional manager. There have been other instances where I have worked my ass off and succeed and she took credit for it and never put my name out there. If she does notice something I do, she will take about 2 weeks to notice and then give me a compliment. Most of the time her compliments are followed by something that can be improved as well. 

She thinks that she is my mentor and that she is trying to ""make me better"" in the business industry but she's really just affecting my mental health. 

Yesterday was the straw, I get mandatory two weeks vacation every year and when I asked her to take one week off in January she told me no and that if I leave who is going to do the work.. and then when I went to answer her back she dismissed me by turning up her radio volume louder in my face. These are just some of the things she has done, but she has been doing this months into my position. 

I don't know if these are all valid reasons enough to complain to HR and I don't really know if this will solve the issue instead of making things worse. I don't want her to know I am complaining and I can't leave the job until June because it is mandatory for me to stay in my management position for a year. (I've only been working in my position for 3 months) I don't really know what to do besides look for another job when the time comes. I don't know how to go about handling the rest of my time here and that's what makes it miserable. 

What do you think? Am I just being a baby? Or do you think I have a reason to feel the way I do? Any suggestions help!

They got divorced three years ago, he left her for a much younger woman. She is so distraught and feeling so guilty about my childhood. The thing is I’m quite strong minded and feel my upbringing made me who I am today. My story is actually quite interesting because I had to fend for myself from such a young age. I’ve travelled the world and been in experiences that people could only dream of,  what I’m saying is - even though my childhood was not pretty, I wouldn’t change it. How can I express this to my mum and have it stick. She is riddled with guilt due to her conditioning and the Stockholm syndrome of being with this monster. She’s disgusted with herself for letting him push me out.  What approaches can I take to free her from her guilt and help her move forward, especially now she’s free of him and I’m back in her life.",20Sep2019,6

Last Sunday she said she just didn’t feel the same anymore and she said she doesn’t know if she still wanted to keep trying. I’ve been so fucked up over this, at every day one point this week I cried and it’s got me so depressed. I can’t help but think about her in everything I do it’s got me so unmotivated for anything and it hurts so much every time she leaves me on read. What really fucks me up is that I’ve never been in a relationship before and I reminisce about all the things we talked about, how we she wanted to go to the beach with me or how nervous she would have been to meet my parents and how she said she loved me and it’s the small things you don’t miss until they’re gone, having someone who asks how your training went or wishes you a goodnight sleep or even just having someone to look forward to talking to the next morning it just really hurts me, I’m gonna sound even worse because we only ever met once and cuddled and laughed that whole time.

For a year now his girlfriend became depressed and sucidal. He comes to me and cries that he can't do this anymore.

His mental state is horrible too, he is depressed and stressed out all the time.

to start things off, i'm here bc i'm concerned for the well-being of a close friend. 

she used to date this guy in JUNIOR HIGH. they didnt last very long but ended up going to the same high school as each other.

for the next 4 years, she moved on w her life and he became more and more obsessed with her. he would desperately try to win her back and talk to her, but he did have some (temporary) success in other relationships. we've all graduated recently and she's currently oos (thank goodness).

over the last few months, before she moved, he'd show up in her neighborhood. and most terrifying is showing up at her house, even in her backyard. she didnt answer but he waited outside until someone else came home. he even applied to the job she worked at. now, he's become extremely delusional and has made it seem like theyre in a relationship online. he has her pictures posted on his account, posting things about future dates and waking up next to her, explicitly calling her his girlfriend.

thankfully, i'm glad she's physically away from him. but she does come visit home often. im concerned for her and i want this to stop. i dont feel like its my business to confront him about it, and it may only exacerbate things but i dont know what to do. is there any legal action she can take? are there any policies on social media that can address this situation? 

any help and advice is kindly appreciated.",20Sep2019,3

376,"Hi Reddit, first time posting here so I apologise if I this is the wrong place.

This has been frustrating me for a while and a friend suggested I post it here.  

**Context:**

I (20m) am currently at university and started a small events company with a few friends in early 2019. All we do is host events on interesting science related things. We get speakers, sponsors, and partner with organisations to host a cool event. We are now backed by the University Careers Department which provided us with a legal office space to give us the opportunity to spin out and become completely independent if needed. 

(Note: This enterprise has always been completely student-run and while it has had university departments provide advice and support, all decisions are made with an internal committee, with all students having one vote.)

The idea behind this “STEM events company” has always been recognised to be mine, which is something I take great pride in. I set up the basic framework, and decided to bring on about a dozen other students to help me out. After 4 successful events, one of which was 1 day long, things were looking good until we all came together to decide who was going to be on the next committee. 

**Situation:**

This is where things get ugly. While I have always been recognised as the de facto “Founder”, and “President” constitutionally, the students I worked with were divided on my leadership style. I always assumed that I would continue as the head of the organisation. So I was surprised when I was challenged and in essence trying to be booted. 

Things got ugly, and both sides (myself and my supporters), and their side did stupid things to throw fuel on the fire. (e.g. I got personally blackmailed to give a context of how serious things were getting.)

Once all the chips had fallen, I literally had full control over all assets in the enterprise’s name. Think our personalised email, website CMS, social media accounts, even all shared documents and physical merchandise like banners and other freebies. The only thing I didn’t have control over was the money we had left over from our events.   
 

All of our events are free so the way we made money was through sponsorship by either the university, or companies. As we didn’t have any bank account when the sponsorships were coming through, all money went to a friends account until such time we could have a private, business bank account – it was a quick fix to a problem that was delaying our operations and always meant to be temporary. 

As you may have guessed, the fallout happened before we ever got around to finalising a bank account. So now, my “friend” has a substantial amount of money (in £100s), and refuses to give it back because as he states “I technically don’t understand who is entitled to the money”. 

I am the only one who can do anything with the business, If something happened to me, then the business would be gone, and nobody has access to anything.

Honestly, just confused and need help on my next steps.",20Sep2019,1

390,"Not sure if this is the best sub but feel free to direct me somewhere better. 

I recently got a second job at a franchise bakery. The job, at first, sounded amazing. Being a Baker with good pay and near me. At the interview they mentioned that they were a ""Christian place"" so no swearing or drama. I understand not swearing in a professional setting and I also think drama is pointless but, I'm not religous. I thought maybe they mentioned that just to say the no swearing and drama point. I dont care that the owners or other coworkers are religius as long as they dont try to convert me. I decided they most likely wouldn't and accepted the job offer the gave me.

I just had my first day of training yesterday and the owner and coworker were super nice and never mentioned religon to me once. A few times when customers came in that the owner knew he would talk about church and spirituality with them. But it's not me, and they all seem to be very religous as well so didnt bother me.

Later, while cooking next to the owner, a guest picking up an order comes in and they start talking about a church event they are holding tomorrow. They start talking about what they plan on teaching the kids attending and then somehow the subject of tolerance came up and then the subject changed to Jewish people. The owner said he refused to call them Jewish and would only call them pre-christans, for some religous reason that I honestly didnt understand. He then said that although the bible says ""love thy neighboor"" he can only tolerate jews. He can only tolerate THEM because ""they believe in the same god"". Somewhat implying he did not 'tolerate' other religions. Along with his comment about jewish people, the store only plays very religous music and as far as I can tell the original company is not connected to religon at all.

They have not said anything directly to me about my religion which is great, but they probably assume I'm Christian. 

Should I contact the main company about this store? Should I do it annonmysly? Or should I just keep my head down and ignore it? What if they find out I'm an athiest, should I just quit?

391,"My niece has been in an on/off relationship with her boyfriend for a few years. They were recently 'off' for an extended amount of time, and she decided to move on a bit, but very recently she's gotten back with him. This, combined with it coming out that she does cocaine, has caused a rift with her mother (my sister), her father, and her younger brothers.

Her boyfriend made her take a pregnancy test yesterday as she ""was acting off"". She got one of those fancy ones that can detect it early. It came back positive, 3+ weeks pregnant. She knew it wasnt her boyfriend's, and he knew it as well. He hasn't taken it well, and has accused her of doing this on purpose to mess with his head and is just being horrible. To clarify, she didnt cheat on her boyfriend as they weren't together at the time of conception. The father doesnt know, and she knows he wouldn't be interested.

This girl is new, but she’s a temp, so she’ll most likely be leaving in a month or so, but he’s already gotten close to her. No, they don’t call each other or constantly text (unless it’s work-related), but sometimes he’ll send her the occasional joke or meme which I don’t really mind. What I do mind is that he will randomly bring her up during a conversation like “did you know she used to run cross-country?” or “she’s really into video games, you two would get along!” and I respond nicely with just a tinge of jealousy that just seems to go unnoticed. He noticed and asked what’s wrong, but I shrugged it off.

He keeps trying to get her hooked up with one of his guy friends since they’re both single and they’re looking for a relationship, but I just get so upset whenever I overhear him talking about her and her interests to his guy friend as if he’s known her his entire life like “she loves this, she loves that.”

I know they work together Monday to Friday, 7 hours a day, so it just bugs me to know that they’re probably chatting each other up during their 30 min break. I asked him how long she would be working there for, and he said “probably for another 3 weeks. I honestly don’t want her to leave, the person she’s covering for is honestly so boring and I don’t imagine myself working with anyone else. She’s so fun to talk to.” At this point, I’m silent. I’m just listening to him ramble on about her, and he just stops, he once again asks me if I’m feeling okay, and I say “yeah, I’m just tired,” and I think he’s already starting to catch up with why I’m upset. He didn’t touch on the subject, but he’s toned down the conversations about her.

I really want to talk to him about this without coming off as a psycho. He knows I’m the jealous type, but I always do my best to keep it shut because I know how destructive jealousy is to relationships. We have serious plans in the future, we’re even moving in together when I finish college in December (I dual enrolled in college while in high school). Should I just talk to him about how this makes me feel? I really want clarification on what he feels about her. She may be just like any other friend of his, but I’ve never been in a situation this. I’d be happy to hear your perspective on this and what you would do if you were in my situation.

We called the police, but in the few minutes it took them to get here, the suspect was long gone. We emailed our leasing office and they responded with a ""Sorry, let us know if we can help."" I figured the best way to deal with the situation was motion sensor lights/camera. We asked the leasing office if this was possible, and assured them it wouldn't have a view of our neighbor's property. They told us we couldn't do that, because ""it would open up a can of worms."" They said it would be a modification to the property, which would prompt others to want to do the same.

402,"Recently, my mom and I have been **ARGUING** about premarital sex. I think that it's okay and she thinks that you need to be married before you do it. Whenever we discuss this, we often get pissed at each other because we don't see eye to eye. We talked about it today and she shouted at me for not listening to her saying ""Good luck! I hope you don't get hurt after giving yourself to a guy! You really are stubborn and I'm telling you that you'll feel wasted and like dirt after doing that! So, don't come to me when I've already warned you! If you want to go around and give yourself like an animal then fine!"" I was really **annoyed and pissed** after she said that because I told her that I will only be doing it with people I **trust.** I made it very clear. Then, she goes on explaining ""You're not gonna get anything from giving yourself to a guy you're not married to. Your virginity should come with a price and you're throwing away your self-respect. Think of it as a business negotiation."" I was even more pissed because shouldn't you be doing it for love, trust, and bonding, and not some financial shit. Basically, we can **NEVER** come to a compromise because she's conservative and traditional while I'm from the new generation. 

I already asked people about what I should do and they told me to avoid talking to my mom about it. I totally understand them and really **really** want to listen but I can't handle **NOT** saying anything. I don't know if it's the inner feminist in me or me just trying to defend myself but I always end up saying things like this :

* ""You're not admitting it but you think that a girl gets devalued after she does it. You don't understand, but a girl who makes those choices does not become less of a person."" 
* ""A virginity is not a part of a girl and she definitely does not lose a part of herself after she does it."" 
* ""I'm not gonna throw away myself to a guy I just met. I'm only gonna do it with people I know and trust."" 
* ""You're just too old-school to realize that people don't really care about virginities anymore. Sex is a part of life and most people don't judge other for doing it. Everyone should mind their own business."" 

So, I can't stand listening to my mother without making my point clear. I have a very hard time containing myself and just saying ""Yeah, I understand."" Yes, I know that I don't need my parents permission before I do it. I have my own life and I am free to make my own choices. It's more about letting them understand my beliefs and educating them on the new generation.

However, I don't think its worth it and I really want to stop discussing it with my mom because I just get really **bad energy** after the argument. It's not not good for my mental health and I do not want more things to stress about. The problem is that she keeps bringing it up and I can't contain myself. 

So, please give me tips on how to contain myself, practice shutting up, or how to avoid controversial conversations.",20Sep2019,2

411,"Hello Reddit. This is more of a ""what would you do in my shoes"" type of question.

My and my wife (just got married 3 weeks ago) been working and living in London for 5 years now. We are originally from Romania (Brasov-Transilvania, gorgeous place) and we just returned back to London after a 1 month off (wedding stuff). We havent been back home in a long time and in this month over there we fell back in love with the place and we want to return there sooner than later.

 Problem is, in London we earn around 3000 pounds each. Back home we could never earn half this money and we got used to it. But apart from the money i feel like everything else is better back home. The air, the food and drinks, traffic, weather, etc.

Not long ago we were making long time plans like starting a mortgage for a house (250.000-300.000 pounds), having kids, cats and dogs, etc. But lately we are very confused and we dont know if we wanna stay here another 30 years to pay mortgage. 

We were thinking in buying 2-3 apartments back home (50-60.000 each) and rent them (they go around 400£ each) so we can afford to go back home (work and living of the rented flats) but that means at least 15 years of hard work in London while still paying the rent here. 

This basically messed up our long time plans but it might be a good investment for the future and if works we can finally retire back home. 

Toughts and advices greatly appreciated.",20Sep2019,1

Right, so the problem is, every time I arrive at school and there's someone waiting by the administration door they look at me like I'm just another student, by the time I greet everyone and  get my stuff and call the new guy by his name I already know what look will be at his face.
I dunno if its just them thinking I am unqualified or mocking me but its always the same.
I have grown a pretty decent beard some time ago and it helped a lot(people started guessing that I was 23/26yo that time) but when I shaved it people started felling uncertain about it and began to LITERALLY interrogate me about all kinds of uncomfortable themes.
And the kids? Just because I don't look that much like a adult they think they can disrespect me, if I tell them to keep it quiet or focus/do they work they challenge my authority and try to play the as the cool kid who doesn't care.
Those students don't even do the homework I give them or listen to my orders.
I didn't mind that much since I could always pass the trouble to people higher than me and leave it to them to solve it, but principal is getting angry over it, he says I should ""honor my position as maximum authority inside a classroom""
I don't want to rise my voice or be aggressive to my students, the majority of then are really sweet and hardworking and the best: they respect me.
I don't feel like ruining my reputation as the ""nice teacher"" for all of then just because of 20% of the classmates.
Here's how it has being :

Me : hey (student), can I correct your homework now?
Son of Satan: no
Me: may j know why? 
S: I dunno can you?
Me : (knowing where this paths leads and visibly losing my patience) did you even do your homework?
S : no
Me: why?
S : I didnt wanted to * looks around for acceptance *
Me: well, in that case I'll have to fill a note for your parents since its the 3rd you didn't bring
S: doesn't matter, ill just throw it away
Me: so I'll write it on your book
S: ill set it on fire if you do it man(yeah, they call me bro too as I were one of them)
me: do it and ill have your mom coming here to have a talk to the principal(is that the word?)
then he proceeds to talk about how he'll turn off his mom phone and all kinds of things, all that with what I believe he thinks it's a agressive voice
He is 14 if you haven't guessed.
Listen, I love my job, there are amazing kinds there, effortworth ones, people that I call friends out of the job and even people who admire me for achieving this at such young age. But when its those classes period I don't even want to go to work,nor enter class.
Nevermind the fact that they talk a lot and ruin other peoples attention to what I'm trying to teach.(guess what they say when I ask them to shut...)
What do I do?

417,"So basically the rundown is that for the last 4 years. My mum has been spending more time with ""friends"" doing drugs, than spending time with her 3 kids and husband. We have tried everything. Being nice. Offering to move across the country to another state to help her. Admitting her to rehab, even me threatening to leave her, and basically disowning her as my mother. 


Shit just gets worse, she gave us all false hope earlier this week. By saying she would be home on the Thursday (19th of Sept). Then proceeded to spend the night with her drug dealer bf. Which as you'd expect, hurt my father a lot. (Punching walls. His knuckles have been in a constant state of bleeding for the last week. Luckily he is using a boxing bag, not walls anymore. But it's not healthy..) and I'm a bit the same. Punching shit.

*TL;DR at the bottom.*

My girlfriend has had mental health problems for years; I’m pretty sure he has some sort of severe depression. He also deals anxiety, struggles with self harm and suicidal thoughts/attempts. I am fucking *terrified* to lose him, and of course you’d know, he doesn’t believe me when I tell him this, nor does he trust me. (Understandable, given our history.)

He has taken two breaks from talking to me so far, and the first time he told me that he nearly killed himself two days before he came back, but his favourite band stopped him. I try so desperately to remind him he is loved and that I need him and all that Jazz, because I’m no stranger to anxiety (I have severe anxiety, have self harmed and also dealt with suicide before) and I know how it affects you, but I just don’t know how to help. He has told me flat out that he doesn’t want help, and I know that feeling so it’s not like I can say “just get help”, I can only suggest he get it, but ... honestly I’m so stressed out with this. 

I have suggested that he see a therapist besides the one at his school, but he won’t. He figures they’ll only make it worse, or assume he is there for attention. He also doesn’t want to go on medication because he won’t be able to drink alcohol.

I don’t know what to do, I’m so fucking scared and I can’t help him. He keeps telling me he is fine but honestly that’s what I said right before I tried killing myself, so I’m not taking chances with him. 

Please, can anyone give me some sort of advice on how I can help him, or just be there? I know it entirely depends on each person how they can be helped, so your advice can only do so much, but I don’t understand depression very well and all I know is that all my attempts to help him have either annoyed him, or he shuts me down and says he is fine.

I’m also sorry that this is a total mess but I’m typing really fast and not even sure how to word this because I need help. What the hell can I do...?

*The fraternity crew (college) (as I just wanted quick friends as quick as possible)

*Pickup artist crew (Post college)

**In all instances I found myself unhappy.** The comp sci
crew had intelligent qualities, but they were often socially inept
or were just too nerdy always trying to one-up each other. 
The frat crew was 'cool' but they mixed this in with immaturity.
They seem to put a lot of people down for not being at a certain
level in life and I didn't really vibe with that. The pickup crew was
the same. I thought, well, maybe if I joined a pickup crew I know
they're at least not scared to talk to girls maybe and maybe we
have a lot in common - but man - these guys just say the craziest
things with regards to girls and numbering them as if they have
no value unless ""they're a 10"" - I get what they're saying, but the
extent that they say it is just ridiculous? Just my opinion.

While she made it very clear how to format, it was still very confusing how she explained. She didn’t grade based on content whatsoever..... on this grade, I got 18/25 for having an extra space. This was okay because I recovered well and wanted to come back stronger than before with my formatting skills.

435," I’m a junior person in my field. My former boss is reasonably well-established. For the 6 yrs. we were in the same company, we had an amazing professional/personal relationship. We had lunch together daily, regularly went out, and talked intimately about our personal lives. Even back then, however, we had some tension including disagreements that got too heated, misunderstandings, and a perception on my end that he treated others more favorably. Sometimes this just led to passive aggressiveness but at times included yelling or hurtful insinuations. Usually this resulted in us being annoyed at each other but getting over it or me initiating a conversation about how I don’t understand why we get into these arguments. (He usually blame it on me or say we should just forget it.)

Fast forward a couple of years after I naturally left my job, on good terms, due to my contract expiring. At a gathering, we got into an argument which did not cool down because I refused to admit I’d said anything wrong. The day of, he intimated that he cared a lot about me and that part of the reason we got into these arguments was because of how much he cares about me. The next day, I wrote to him about how I found the way he treated me at times to be unacceptable. We tried to set up a time to talk but it did not happen. I wrote him a very long letter because I felt he was avoiding me (&gt; 1 month). In it, I detailed what I thought was wrong with our relationship (e.g., he often think I am criticizing him and is always trying to correct me). I also said he infrequently apologized and when he does apologize he often takes it back. He responded that he agreed with my letter and realizes that he needs to treat me better. Now, my response to his e-mail was a little flippant which caused him to take back his apology and tell me that he wanted to “take a break” from our friendship. 

We had no communication for 2 months (vs. talking weekly) until he reached out to tell me he would not attend an event if I was attending it. I got him on the phone for us to talk but he did not give me any new info. and said if he ever mistreated/disrespected me that “it must have been” that I “deserved it.” I said if he had nothing to apologize for then it’d be best we don’t talk personally and only interact professionally and if needed. 

Now, I’ve left out an important part of the story, that I only found out how bad it was months after the fact. His wife has a neurodegenerative disease and when our argument was happening they were figuring things related to the disorder. He has tried reaching out to me and we’ve had a couple of communications recently but I’m semi-over him/it.

As I've grown up, I have been dealing with an illness that has just sucked all the life out of me. It's been a long time since I've been with anyone in a romantic sense, and I'm actually terrified of meeting new people in a romantic setting now. I don't know when it happened or how, but it did. Has anyone been through something similar? How did you get your mojo back?? Feel free to ask me questions and I appreciate anyone taking the time to talk to me, thank you!",20Sep2019,1
437,"My friend (18M) recently entered college, is doing alevels and also is basically clubbing everynight of the year.

 Honestly I don't care if he clubs or not it is what it is but I'm not sure what to do because I don't want him to fall into bad unhealthy habits but simutaneously I also do  want to accept that this is who he is now and he is living his life the way he wants, it really is not my place to dictate who he is and what he should do just because I have beliefs on what is right and wrong.  

Not only that some of my friends have consistently reached out to him on this and he listens but reverts back to his old habits after a couple days. This has lead to alot of my friends just giving up and cutting him off. 

So what should I do? Do I even have a right in telling him not to do this? Even if I do have a right how should I even go about it?",20Sep2019,1

441,"I'd rather not fill in all of the gritty details, but I'll do my best. Here's a decent sized backstory, which hopefully will give you a better idea of the situation I'm in.

I'm now 21, but still very reliant on my family. I have aspergers, major depressive disorder, anxiety, and problems with addiction and self-harm. On top of all that, I also sometimes feel great gender dysphoria, making things even more confusing. I've seen therapists and psychologists many times over the past few years, and have been and am still on medication for depression. I've also been involuntarily held in a sort of psych ward after a suicide attempt. Quick backstory on my dad, he has been in the past, and still is at times, emotionally and at times verbally abusive. He's never been physically abusive past the point of doing something like strongly twisting my arm when he thought it appropriate, so, though I wouldn't say he's never hurt me, I don't really count that specifically as abuse. He used to be a teacher, and was my 5th grade teacher. I've always feared him, and never seen him as a friend or even someone I can talk to. I've always avoided him whenever possible. There were many times when I was younger that he made feel like hell.

Here's what I've done for the past few years. My family had lived overseas with the DoD for 12 years, and after my dad retired from that, we moved back to the states. I was a senior in highschool when this happened, and when we came back, I finished school through homeschooling. I'd done that for a few years when I was a kid before I started going to public school, so it wasn't foreign to me. While doing that, I also worked nearby for that year. After that year was over, I started college in another state, alone. Surprising enough, I actually did well in my classes, but my mental state was at an all-time low. By the end of the year, through a social media mishap, my family found out how I was feeling, as I'd tried to keep it a secret previous to that. They were naturally very worried, and took me home(to where they live). They 'recommended' that I take a year off to try to figure things out, and I had no real objections to that. Long story short, I began my long running list of therapists I've seen, the majority of which have given up on me. My dad started bearing down on me, pressuring me into getting a job again, the last time being during my year in college. I did, and all that really did was serve to worsen my mental state, which was still not improving since being here. By the time the next school year came around, my family and I agreed that not enough progress had been made to justify me going back to school again, so I stayed here longer. I eventually was able to see a psychiatrist, as I felt the need to get accurately diagnosed, since there's clearly something wrong with me. I did feel relief knowing these things, since I'd always felt them anyway, just without knowing the reason. I was put on different medication a few different times, trying to see if something would help my mind. But still, things continued pretty much the same way as before, except I started to care less and less about myself, drinking more and doing more drugs. Eventually, I OD'd on opioids and ended up in the hospital, before being held for a month or so in a psych ward. Nothing good came from being there, either. After a little bit, my dad started pressuring me to get a job again, and as it did before, it didn't do much but serve to worsen my mental state. Eventually, I basically told my parents I was as ready to go back to school as I'd ever be, so I went back. Ironically, this time around, even though I kept myself sober at least around 90% of the time, and wasn't working so I had more time to focus on school, I was set to fail almost every class I was taking. I felt awful, just like when I was there before. I told my mom that, and she had me withdraw, and I did. My parents wanted me to go back to \[where they live\], but there was no way I was immediately gonna go back after being there for more than a year, so I went to live with my sister. Moved in with her, and did my best to job search, but couldn't find anything for a pretty long while. I still felt really bad, and soon fell back into the same bad patterns. Things still didn't really improve any, if anything they only got worse. I was there for probably about 6-7 months. I did finally get a job, albeit an awful job, which I'd done before. But after a couple months, I quit and told my parents I wanted to try school again, since it felt like I had no future doing what I was doing(which was basically nothing). They came and brought me back to \[where they live\], which is where I am at the moment. I got signed up for school online instead of going to a campus. At the moment I'm staying on my parent's property, but the plan was to eventually be able to find me a roommate and live nearby with him. If you know anything about depression, you'll know that it can greatly effect your ability or motivation to take care of yourself in even the simplest ways, and it's had that effect to a great extent with me. I've been majorly depressed for literally years now, and during that time I've gotten worse and worse about doing simple things such as showering or brushing my teeth. It's been a focus of my parents more and more lately, and I'm getting slowly better with it, but I'm not there yet. I also like to stay up late at night, for a couple different reasons. The main ones that come to mind though, are that it's when I feel like I can be alone, or sometimes the opposite, in that it can be the only time I get to talk to the few people I know anymore, those being people online. I don't really know what the other reasons are besides those, though. So, my dad is very adamant at this point that I need to sleep at night, and shower daily, etc. Well, like I said, I've slowly been getting a little better with it, but like I said also, I'm not there yet. Two nights ago now, I was up fairly late at night, browsing subreddits about being transgender while watching youtube. At this point, watching comedy in some form is one of the only things that can make me even smile, so I watch channels on youtube that help me do that. So since I was up late still, while I wasn't really supposed to be, I guess my dad saw my lights on, and sent me a text. It basically said how what I was doing wasn't healthy and went against my 'goals' of being in school, and how it hurts me. As always, he reminded me about how hard him and my mom are working to help me, and finished by saying how I'm too old to be doing that. When I saw that, I had a sort of small snap in my mind. Him saying that made me really depressed, with those even small amount of words snowballing into a crisis in my mind. I texted my sister, who, like many people, has said she's there for me. She left me on read. Don't get me wrong tho, she has helped me a lot, but it still hurt that she didn't even say anything, since I already feel like I have almost no one to talk to about these things. Only other person I could talk to about it was my mom, so I did. As always, she was reassuring and positive, trying to make me see it in a better light. Idk why I thought it would be ok, but she said she'd talk to him, and for some reason, despite how that has gone in the past, I believed she would be able to talk to him and make him see sense. I thought it was ok, until this morning. I tried to go to sleep a little early, but wasn't able to sleep for very long, so I got up for awhile and watched the Area 51 livestreams. By the point that I found people streaming it, I was too interested to want to try to go back to sleep again, so I stayed up awhile. After a couple hours, I heard my dad opening my door, and he came in. He basically started flipping the fuck out about the fact that I wasn't asleep. He kept going, and basically ended up saying how I have nothing to be depressed about, how all this stuff is my fault, and how I'm selfish and hurting my family, and how I need to wake up(figuratively, obviously). He's said something similar before over text, but I kept myself sort've contained at the time, but now that he's said it before, I know it wasn't like a spur of the moment thing. That's really how he feels. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry about the wall of text, but I felt the need to give at least some backstory so you can maybe see a bit of where I'm coming from with this. If anyone has questions, lmk. So, my question, what can I do to get away from him? At this point I don't really care if it takes me ending up homeless, I just can't be around him. I probably would just kill myself, but he would just end up using that as more fuel to say how I'm selfish and don't care how my family feels, so I'm looking for other options. Thanks.",20Sep2019,0

We’re only close friends, but she’s developed some on and off feelings for me over the years and I grew to really care for her. I was smart enough to keep us strictly platonic, but that’s it. She’s 18-19 and I’m 17. However, when we first met in some old forum I forget the name of, I was only 12 and she was 14. Being the dumbass 12 year-old I was, I thought it would be fun to have a fake name and a fake age. I gave her a name that wasn’t my own and said I was 14 at the time. I was super young. Never did I ever think I’d talk to her for this long and I never thought it’d get this deep.

However, I have never shown her any fake photos of me. Every picture she’s seen of me have been real pictures of me and everything else I’ve told her about my life has been completely honest. The only lies I’ve told is my name and my age. 

She’s a real sensitive girl, and I know if she found out this person she really grew to love has not been who they said they are for the past 5 years, it’d be really shocking. I care about her and I don’t want to hurt her, which is the reason I’ve pussied out in telling her the truth so many times.

I’m guilty to break our friendship without any honest context but I’m also guilty to tell her the truth. But I also personally don’t want her out of my life. It’s selfish, definitely, but please try to understand. I really don’t know what I should do. It went too far.",20Sep2019,1

So this girl has a past of chronic mental illness, to the point of being in a mental asylum. She came to my school this year as a new student without notifying the school about it. On top of that, she doesn't seem to be better. My friend who told me about this said that E has tried to kill the nurses at  the asylum before, thinks about killing people at our school and even my friend herself. E literally straight up told her that she's thought about killing her. My friend also told me that E hears voices in her head telling her to do such things. (my friend heard about this from E's close friends)

E is in my homeroom. We have homeroom everyday first period. She's been absent for more than 4 weeks before, and the last time she came to school was about 2 weeks ago.

I'm so fucking scared and worried for the people around me and myself. I don't know what to do. Virtually no one knows about this apart from me, my friend who told me and a few of E's friends. I promised my friend that I wouldn't utter a word about this to anyone, but I couldn't sit still because this situation is so serious and concerns me so goddamn much. My friend said not to tell, not even the school because it'd be bad if it spreads and people would start avoiding E, and you can imagine how that could probably not turn out well. But I feel like it's only going to go downhill if nothing is done. I can see so many horrible scenarios happening and I seriously just can't sit around and do nothing.

We're both in our late 20's, work in different departments so I figured I'd message her on social media..

We began talking online and realized we had lots of deep things in common.. soon after I asked if she wanted to get coffee, she told me she's busy with work..

So I asked about getting lunch on break.. she agreed and a few days later we met up. Conversation went great, so a couple days later I asked if she wanted to spend time outside of work, maybe go to a carnival or something, when it's a better time for her..

I received no response, and over the next few weeks began to slowly drift away and ignore my emails, no more conversing.

Much to her surprise, I was completely respectful and didn't show any frustration whatsoever towards her... 
I never have been dramatic at work, I'm very civil and casual.

It's been like this for weeks, and lately she's been going out of her way to say something to me...

For example, at the end of the night I'll be working in my dept still, she'll be on her way out and she'll walk by me and say ""night Mark!"" with a smile, and has done this a couple times.. nobody was around, the store was closed and she had no reason to say those things.

and another time I was at checkout, she rang me up and she said ""Hey Mark!"",
and I said the typical rhetorical ""heyyy what's up"", and she came back and said ""not much""...

usually people don't respond to someone saying what's up..

she's gone weeks without approaching me and greeting me when she walks by, and never has responded to me saying ""what's up"" ever...

I feel like if they are equally as interested they will at least make the effort to meet you half way, maybe say hi or SOMETHING. 

Nope, not in this instance. She ALWAYS has her headphones in too, as if she is closed off and don’t want to be bothered. If that’s the case I would expect her to sort of avoid being near me when she sees I’m there, don’t you think? But she doesn’t avoid me at all. 

I can understand not wanting to be bothered cuz I’m sure women get hit on a lot. Especially at the gym but I’m just super confused because I find her near me just about EVERY time we are both at the gym. She is always coming to machines or equipment near me as if she wants to be by me. 

I used to catch her glancing at me, stealing looks, and vice verse which is what interested me in asking her to work out in the first place. I sort of felt this connection.

458," Hi Everyone,

I graduated from college just a few years ago and am currently employed at a great management consulting firm which I need to leave for a variety of non-performance based reasons. I've interviewed at another firm and have received and accepted the offer, slated to start in a decent amount of time (more than a month). Therefore, I already turned in my two week notice at my current company.

However, the pay they offered is not very appealing - it's within a few thousand of my current position in a lower COL area, but I was hoping for at least a match if not a raise. The day after I accepted - I got several more recruiter emails from firms that potentially pay up to 20% more. I plan on interviewing with them to see how things go.

My questions:

How do I approach the prospective employers? I told them I have an offer outstanding, and plan on accepting unless something amazing comes up. Therefore, I'm on a tight timeline but I can try to get it extended by a few weeks.

However, by the time we get to the background check phase, I will have already left my current firm - I'm concerned about the problems that may arise from this.

Is telling them I have already accepted another offer and quit my current job acceptable? This seems highly unprofessional. **How should I go about handling this situation?** I have no moral qualms regarding leaving the job I already accepted if I get a 20% raise.

She’s beautiful and all but definitely not a person I would be in a relationship with. I’ve actually told one on one that I love her but not in love with her. She’s actually said that her guy friends usually make a pass at her and that it’s unusual that I haven’t.  I love her like a sister. I treat her like family. She’s doesn’t have any brothers or male figures in her life other than her dad.  

She’s moving on from our office soon. I definitely let her know that I love her always and it’ll be really sad but it was for the better to pursue her dreams and goals in life.

Her:“What if I got married while I was away.”
I said I’d be pissed that I wasn’t invited. She’d be a groomsmen at mine!

465,"This old interest pretty much friendzoned her 2 years back, recently he appeared from the nowhere by asking her simple questions, then insisted to go for lunch to talk about what happened recently in their lifes, personally I didn't like the idea of her alone with a man she used to like having a meal together but I told her it was okay, she went and told me every thing he said and detail.

After some weeks the guy kept asking about when will be the next time they will go out again and she showed me the convo of her saying she wont be around during summer because she needed to go back to her town.

The guy started to upload instagram stories where he posted old pictures of them hanging out (when he friendzoned her) and obviously kept asking how she was and how was summer, texts she never replied during summer, because she doesn't want to be around him anymore at all.

After summer the guy started to reach her via her friends asking them how she was and if she was alive mainly so that leaded her to reply the guy she was alive and her summer was okay.

I read the texts he send and he kept asking her to go out in  a very friendly way let's say, so I said I was absolutely not okay with another meeting, she didn't speak to him about me because well he is not someone who has to know and tbh if someone texts you are not supposed to say ""I have someone"" right straight.

She agreed on my request of not meeting with him again and we openly talk about it, but it stills bother me a lot, he keeps texting over and over in a ""very innocent way"" I told her the guy wants her.",20Sep2019,1

I'm humble about the praise it's just important to state it's a constant thing that everyone regularly mentions how much they like me.

Since May I have been trying to change the department I work in. I am miserable in the current position I hold and want to say ""fuck you I quit"" to my department manager nearly every day. Every month I get told by the company director she is trying very hard to move me into the other department. 

I am fed up. I'm tired of hearing ""I'm trying"". I dont want to leave this company because besides my department, which is the worst, I love everyone here. I've gone multiple times and told the ED that I am miserable and need to change positions. She keeps asking me to hold out a little longer, hold out a little longer, hold out a little longer. Since may I have not seen one person come in for an interview in my department other than part time high school kids who cant fill my hours. 

I'm asking for personal opinions and advice on what I should do from here? Should I apply to other jobs? Can I use a two week notice as leverage for my position? I dont want to hurt anyone's feelings or get on anyone's bad side because I dont like doing that, even to coworkers who have a minor impact on my life.

It’s been fucking amazing, nothing weighing me down, no big group dramas.

473,"Hey Reddit.

I'm 26 and hopefully soon done with my BA. Once I enroll in my master's programme, I think I'll take a semester (~5 months) or an internship (~2 months) abroad. I'm in the EU so it would be with Erasmus+.

My girlfriend has to take a semester abroad for her studies (next year, September - mid January), so I figured that, for the sake of not going to be apart for longer than necessary, I'd take that semester at the same time.

The issue is I'm fucking *terrified* of it. I don't _want_ to go abroad for a time but I feel like I _have_ to. It's gonna look good on my CV and I might have some new contacts afterwards, that's the only reason I'm even considering it. 

I'm afraid cause so much can happen, and if something happens she's in butt fuck nowhere. Or I am. Both of us could spend the whole semester, all five months of it, as friendless losers. We wouldn't be able to see each other every day (we live together, that only makes it harder). Even if we do manage to get it running, Skype etc. Just doesn't cut it. We wouldn't be able to see friends or family properly. It's expensive. We'd be all on our own, lost and afraid. Our Erasmus buddies or roomies could hate us (both of us aren't the easiest to get along with when you don't know us). And so on and so forth.

I lean back just a tiny bit (Like you are sitting on a chair) and realize that suddenly I could feel my butt more involved in the walking, and that my back seemed straighter. Asked her about it and after looking at me like I was crazy she said that she is pretty sure that is how she has always walked.

He's really understanding and patient with me, I've never dated before and I'm completely out of my comfort zone but I really want this to work. We spend quite a bit of time together but have never gone on a 'date' and he just asked me. Now this is no big deal, I'm completely comfortable around him but just because it's now been labelled a date I'm panicked. He's really in touch with his emotions and shit like that and he knows what he wants then there's me that doesn't have a clue and can't articulate myself when it comes to these things. I'd love to take the relationship forward but I can't shake that awkward feeling, which is the biggest reason I've never dated before. My mum always took the piss out of my sister when she dated and got all mushy and shit so I think that's put the idea in my head that love is bad? And showing it is even worse.

482,"I'll try to keep this short. I work at a company with 2 offices: Riga and Moscow. It's a millionare owned private business which I joined 2 years ago at the lowest position (data entry clerk). I rose quickly and last month my Latvian boss noticed me and offered to move me to Riga so that I can learn from him and in a year become head of marketing department. He also said that I can take my soon-to-be fiancee with me and she will even get a job as well. 

Yesterday we returned from our 2 day visit and we have 3 days to give the reply. We made a list of pros and cons with about 15 points each...

Major pros are:

+ moving to Europe 

+ International job experience in CV 

+ living 15 minutes away from work (currently I drive 1.5 hours each way, it's terrible)

+ working closely with a millionaire 

+ he offered my GF 700€, which is 200€ higher than her offers in Moscow (she just graduated so no experience)

+ we won't regret not taking the chance (both my parents whine all the time they didn't leave USSR when they could)

Major cons:

+ My salary actually goes down from 1700€ to 1600€ while living in Latvia is more expensive (probably?)

+ Living our families behind (both our mothers are single and need help/company)

+ total reliance on our boss who can fire in an instant

+ I don't enjoy marketing at all. 3 months ago I offered my help with running our Instagram page and my boss took it as a sign that I'm god's gift in SMM. However my girlfriend is actually studied for this and it's her dream job (we'll be a 2 man marketing department).

+ Russians aren't welcome in Latvia

Literally the hardest decision we ever had to make and we both can't choose. We wish we could save at this checkpoint and then reload if possible :)

484,"It’s not that I’ve NEVER moved out. I went away to college for 4 years and also lived with roommates for about 3 years after that. I only moved home with my parents about 6 months ago as their city is a very central location in my state and it was a reasonable commute to my place of employment as well as the various locations in which I was applying for new jobs. I figured it would be a good idea to live there during this transitional time and keep my name off of a lease until I was certain of the city I’d be working in.

I recently started with a new company where my pay is double what I was making at my previous job. After having roommates for years, I was excited by this opportunity to afford my own place while also putting money away for graduate school which I intend to begin in the fall of 2021. However, apartment hunting in the city where I work has left me totally discouraged. Even in the surrounding suburbs, shit’s expensive! Not only that, but I'd need to furnish the place, too. I’ve considered roommates, but the price drop doesn’t seem worth it when I factor in the inherent discomfort of living with strangers (I’ve done it multiple times). 

After months of searching online and touring a multitude of places, I’m beginning to wonder if I should even move out of my parents’ house at all and instead, take advantage of the opportunity to put away even MORE money for graduate school. My parents are kind enough to basically let me freeload – aside from car insurance and my phone, I do not pay bills and I’ve never been asked to. Mom and Dad are happy to have me and would love for me keep living there for as long as I’d like. 

I feel very lucky, I appreciate my parents immensely, but the downside is that I feel like I’m “waiting” to really start living my life and being an adult until I move out and have my own place. This will inevitably happen in the fall of 2021 when I’ll likely move out of state for school. So should I just wait until then and get over these feelings in favor of saving as much money as possible? Would I be wasting an opportunity to save enough to avoid student loans by paying rent when I don’t NEED to?",20Sep2019,1
485,"I’m just wondering if anyone can relate with my symptoms. About 6 years ago I started making random, uncontrolled, super loud hiccuping noises. They happened about once every 10 minutes on a bad day and only a few times each day on a good day. They didn’t feel like hiccups. Right before they happened, I would feel a pressure in the center of my chest, behind my sternum, like someone was sitting there. They progressed to sometimes sounding like gasps or even screams. I was diagnosed with Tourette’s but then went to a bigger hospital where they weren’t sure what it was but were certain it wasn’t Tourette’s. They thought more like myoclonic jerks or seizures. I have to go to an even bigger hospital soon but it’s been 6 years of not knowing and I just wondering if anyone else has experienced this, has any medical knowledge at all, or has received an accurate diagnosis. Also, while I was compiling my medical records from all the tests I’ve gotten, in one of my chest CT’s it said there was a soft tissue density in my mediastinum and said I should get a short term follow up CT.

A girl  introduced herself. Lets call her Monica. She sent me a selfie and a short bio. She found my profile randomly ( we have a friend in common)  and said she would like to get to know me. I have to say, this sounded really weird to me. Am I getting catfished here? I had to make sure. So we chated for a while. Then some days. She sent me more pictures as we texted. We had a lot in common .Then we started to have these long phonecalls. I still could not believe that a cute girl would just sent me a friend request like that. But it started to feel real. There was just a small problem. She lived 200 km away. At the same time she actually bought an appartment in my city, where she wanted to move for a long time. This seemed also like a huge coincidence but I went with it. So we arranged our first date. The day came along. I was really nervous but felt confident. Maybe like 4-5 hours before our date a I got a phonecall from her. Her father had an accident. Car crash with a woman on her phone. She fled, so without CPR, he didn´t make it. Now the date obviosly was not happening.  Monica said I have to forget her and move on, but that felt wrong. I said I will stand by her. So we postponed our dating. From this point, we just texted and from time to time talked on the phone. It was nice to have someone  to talk to..for both of us. After maybe a week she felt better. We arranged that date again. But this one did not happen either. Her mother tried to take her life on the day of our 2nd try. Man, is this really happening? I totally understood why her mother would do that. So just like before. I stood by Monica. With her mother now in hospital she still wanted to meet me. We waited another week so her mom felt a little better. Monica had to relocate her mom to my city. So she can finally move here and visit her regularly. But her mom didn´t want to relocate to another hospital. On the day of our 3rd try she unsuccessfuly atempted suicide again. This was so heartbraking. But if I left then and there I would really  be an A\*\*hole. So I stood by her. Even she said I should leave, as her mother will stay in hospital for a while. One day Monica talked about the hair she looses almost every day and she was not eating anything allday. She felt really weak. I thought it was all the stress from whats happening. And I literally had to make her eat atleast something. Is all of this worth it? I really like Monica, but, man, I dont know. Now another week goes by. Today, we were supposed to have the date.  4th attempt. As I was on the bus home from work. I got a text from her. The hair loss. No apetite. Yeah, she got stomach cancer.  this morning she recieved the test results. Now she is totally broken as it seems. No date. No nothing. She says I should find another girl. She thinks I would date her just out of pitty. We never met. But she seems like a great and wonderfull person. She doesn´t deserve this.  Now  Monica doesn´t want to drag me in to this even more. But just leaving her now feels so wrong. but at the same time my life would seemingly change a lot. if for better or for worse I don´t know ...and there is still that possibility of a catfish as my mother and friends are really skeptical about Monica.

I’ve cleaned the bathroom five times over the course of four days until it finally met their standards (at one point I just started shifting stuff around and they stopped pointing out mistakes).

They seem intent on kicking me out regardless of what I do. Again this morning I was threatened that I would be kicked out for not cleaning ( I cleaned in front of them yesterday). In our last “talk” they said I had until this weekend before I need to start looking for somewhere else.

We don’t have a dishwasher (rent) at either of our homes.

Last night, we ate fish and had a minor argument.  I cooked (he caught the fish on a trip) bc he insisted that he needed to get ready for his 24 hour shift the next morning.  I had just gotten home from work at 7pm.  He had worked 28 hours (he went to a training that morning), then got home at noon, napped and then went surfing.  We both got to the apt at 7.  

It was easy to cook so I did it.

Well after he insisted he wasn’t going to clean up or do the dishes and actually said “it’s woman’s work”.  Before we argued bc he said I had interrupted him when he was talking and he said it’s a bad habit of mine.  I disagree, he tends to monologue and I’m just trying to converse.

Anyway, since neither of us were going to be back at this apt till Tuesday, I figured leaving fish out wasn’t a great idea, and put it all away a couple hours later (he went to sleep around 10).

493,"Long story short, my wife and her supervisor do not get along. Many people do not get along with this supervisor. Every time there is a meeting between the two to talk about how things are going, this supervisor constantly only brings up the negative things, never trying to suggest a positive solution. If my wife gets upset or emotional (due to stress, anxiety, depression, low self-esteem issues) her supervisor then makes comments about her getting emotional like ""here we go again."" She always focuses on what she hears but never asks for my wife's side of the story if something goes on at work.

Another factor is the scheduling. My wife is constantly overbooked compared to some of the other healthcare providers and then asked why it takes her so long to finish notes and be done for the day. For example, the other available workers may get assigned 2-3 people whereas my wife will have 3-5 people. Her supervisor does not do the scheduling herself but possibly has some influence/friendship with the person who does.

I've asked her to document everything unfair that happens and go to HR, but she's worried about either losing the job, being disciplined for it, or being the ""black sheep"" of the office so to speak.

497,"How do I deal with stress? You don't have to read the huge paragraph, but how do I manage highschool w/ AP and Honors courses, college classes, two jobs, studying, clubs, time for myself, taking care of my mom and little brother, and chores along with moving away from my boyfriend in less than 2 weeks? I'm a 15 year old girl.

In summary: Moving away in less than 2 weeks, will only see boyfriend like once a year, will be taking college courses along with AP and honors in highschool, I have no idea what I want to major in and will have to figure it out soon, will get a part-time job + a side job like walking dogs or something, mother is in bad health and just had her oxygen machine taken away after we weren't able to pay health insurance, mom won't quit smoking, mom won't look for a job because she is also super stressed, we have basically no money, little brother has anger issues and keeps getting suspended, and I'm already depressed and have anxiety and therapy never helped me so I have to deal with it by myself along with the stress of everything else",20Sep2019,1

500,"So my ex (well that's wrong I suppose since he's my boyfriend again) and I broke up in mid June. I was expecting us to break up as a month prior we decided if we couldn't get a spark again we'd just part ways. The relationship before the breakup was just a vacuum of love and affection and we had lived together for 6 months (until he pushed me to move out) and we were dating for about 7 months. Any time I'd show him any type of affection beyond, ""I love you"" I'd get brushed aside and he'd never reciprocate. His priorities were *video games, his best friend, his cat, and then me* in that order. It was all fine the first two months we lived together and we were both extremely passionate but then his friend moved in in January and it all went downhill from then, we didn't have sex anymore, we didn't spoon at night like we used to, I could be out of the house the whole day and come up to him to hug him and he'd say he needs space or he'd just flat out stop me by putting his hands on my stomach so I couldn't get closer. It hurt so much I cried about it so often to the point i couldn't get upset about it anymore because I was so over it. 

After we broke up I started just living my life as usual. I missed him sorely the first month and a half afterwards. I cried because I missed him. I wanted him back. I texted him asking him if we could please get back together because I loved him still and missed him. He said ""I'm sorry but no I don't see us having a future together."" I accepted it, we wouldn't get back so I just kept living my life. Started college, hanging out with my friends more to the point I actually have a social life and some self confidence because the relationship destroyed whatever confidence I had coming into it because the constant rejection made me feel like I was ugly, shameful, and that something was wrong with me because he was so apathetic to it all. I was about to starting getting into the dating game again I had my eye on a cute guy who I would talk to during breaks between classes. And then my ex messages me Tuesday last week saying he wants to speak. He sends a long paragraph explaining and apologizing for EVERYTHING and says he still loves me he wants to get back together he blames his friend moving on because he found it hard making time for me, video games and his friend which isn't really that hard to tell his friend ""Hey im going to go spend time with my girlfriend."" I'm in awe over it because it seems like he really thought about this and made changes to himself. We hung out this past Monday and we had sex again. Things were passionate and just how they at the beginning of it all. But the thing is I feel so strange I feel like this is an injustice(?) because I was ready to move on but I also felt love towards him. I just feel incredibly conflicted. I still feel a little bitter about what happened because why didn't me crying right in front of him (multiple times) about how callous he's being towards me kickstart the changes he made to himself? Why did it take me moving out, us breaking it off and me asking for him back only to reject me make him finally look into himself and makes changes? I feel so weird because I just wanted to keep my living life as it was but I also want him back. I know if I ask most they'll just say ""Follow your heart "" but god dammit I don't know what my heart wants right now so that's why I'm posting here.",20Sep2019,1

503,"Hello! Thanks for reading. I want to start off this post by giving some background info . Me bf and I have been together for about 3 years and we have had the most amazing relationship . It’s been different ever since we started , from the beginning we both knew it was something special and we just clicked and got along like we’ve known each other our whole lives . We’re really good at communicating and we talk about our future and getting married and being together forever . He was also a virgin before he met me and saved himself for someone special (he doesn’t believe in being with someone you don’t love and sex to him is special ). 

So in high school I dated someone who turned into a drug addict and was extremely manipulative and abusive (i was to young to know any better and he always lied about what he was doing ). The relationship scarred me off of love for a long time . Since then I’ve developed OCD and PTSD. Sometimes I get into catastrophic thinking where I obsess about the what if of something happening 

So sometimes I look at his phone (wrong I know ).  About 1 year ago probably more I briefly saw a conversation that went back a few months with his female friend Anna that he’s known since grade school talking about her thinking about breaking up with her bf and she discussing not wanting to rush into anything with anyone else. this is the same month one of his friends was interested in her and asked if she was in a relationship and he tried to set them up since things weren’t going well in her relationship . The iPhone conversation only went back so far (so he must of deleted it at some point ) . I never brought it up but always worried that something happened between them or someone admitted feelings and that’s why she broke up with her boyfriend or she was talking about them getting together etc. I tried to tell myself I was being ridiculous and pushed back those thoughts . Especially because my bf had told me they had been having problems and she was talking to him about it , and he was trying to set her up with someone . Past forward a year and a half I glanced at their conversations casually , he has never been secretive with his phone or suspicious . 

A year or two later he deleted a conversation with her again and I noticed a few months later and I got really nervous and started thinking catastrophically. It turned into a fight that was months long talking about trust and who we are as people . Turns out I eventually found out he told her I was in the hospital when I asked him not too and he deleted it to avoid fighting . He wasn’t fully honest with me about the details of a few things so I lost trust in him a bit . But he says he withheld information because I was really angry and anxious and he wasn’t sure it was important and he didn’t want to rock the boat 

He’s tried to be really understanding for months talking about my fears and specifically what I’m worried about. They tried dating years ago and ended up kissing once and deciding it wasn’t for them. He talked about how she’s like his sister and there just not compatible. And we have a spark he’s never had with anyone else and he would never do anything to jeopardize this . And you don’t cheat on someone you love and there friendship is very platonic. He also got offended I questioned anything happened between them and told me it seems like I don’t know who he is.  

Long story short he told her I thought something happened between them (long story) and she was shocked and talked about how she loved him and me and us together and she just wants us to be happy and nothing has ever happened between them and she doesn’t want me thinking anything happened when it didn’t and offered to talk to me and messaged me saying that they have been friends for a long time but only have ever been friends and he loves me so much and she would never ever do that to me or anyone. 

I feel so awful for being so jealous and thinking like this . I know this is another episode where I obsess about something really bad happening  . But I’m scared to let go and for shit to hit the fan . I’ve started therapy and medication . I feel like I’ve already done a lot of damage that hasn’t made me the best partner. If I had to base my feelings on his actions with me I would never ever question our happiness. He is so so good to me and is always kind loving and understanding , he’s never acted distant or weird or anything . It’s just the deleted texts that make me worried of worst case scenario .

504,"Hey Reddit; I'm in need of some advice preferably from some couples.

I've been dating my girlfriend for about 3 months. Not a long time, I know. She's slowly building up stuff over at my house, but I dont mind. We get along great and my house is huge for just me. She has spent every night at my house since we'll started dating; she has her own  key and hangs out there when im not around.

Anyhow.

I'm 27, I fully support myself. Mortgage, 2 vehicles, utilities, taking care of 2 dogs. I make it work, but damn it's a struggle sometimes. I have no family around to help with anything, although my pride makes it hard to ask for help regardless.

My lady helps out a lot. She'll clean the house, she replaced my vacuum with a new one and always keeps the fridge stocked with stuff I like. She covered my last 2 dogs vet visits (she works at the vet office). She never hesitates to get dinner, she really is a wonderful woman.

I would love for her to permanently move in, and it seems to be going in that direction.


Although I have to admit, it would be such a stress relief if she picked up a few of the bills. Cheaper ones that stay constant and dont fluctuate, internet, water, ect (because she doesn't make a lot).

I just dont really know how to bring it up? She still technically lives with her parents, although that is basically just showering in the morning before work and getting dinner before she comes over. Weekends she is with me the whole time. 

Like I said, I love and appreciate every little thing she does for me. Nothing goes unnoticed; I lived ny myself before this and it's pretty easy to see when things are being done.

But how/when do I bring up the possibility of us splitting some bills?
She basically pays for her phone and car insurance/gas, from what shes told me. Her parents pay her student debt and dont charge her rent. 

I've cut down on all my bills that I can. Cheaper phone, cheaper insurance, everything I can.


I feel odd asking this. I always prided myself on supporting myself. But I'm the only one I know who solely supports themselves. All my close friends and family have dual income households or support from their parents. Both my parents are gone, otherwise I know they would help me. 

I dont want her to feel like I'm not appreciative of the things she does for me. And I know the proverbial beggar can't be a chooser. But how would I bring up ""hey baby I love how you help me like this, but it would really slow my aging if you were to help me like this instead?"" 

She doesn't owe me anything. We never have a ""well I did this so you should do this"" moment, at least not yet. I'm not the type to try to hold leverage over someone. 

I just dont know how to bring it up, or if I should yet.

Please help.",20Sep2019,1

507,"My fiancé and I are planning our wedding. It’s a second wedding for the both of us after years of believing that we’d never again get married. For this wedding we are going a very non-traditional route, foregoing a boring ceremony, bloated catering budget, huge guest list, etc. etc.

We are renting a very large house and inviting 15 people for a wedding weekend. All guests are hand picked and mean a lot to us. The weekend plans involve brewery crawl, bonfires, hot tub, open bar, chef prepared meal and lots of board games.

Only one couple we have invited have small children. They are my fiancé’s nieces ages 5 &amp; 7. They are at the center of every family get together that we have. The oldest is special needs, unaware of personal space, hyperactive and needs constant attention. Due to this, the youngest gets attention from tantrums. They are not terrors by any means – I do not hate my soon to be nieces. However, due to their constant requirement of wrangling and soothing, I have been unable to have many meaningful, adult conversations with my soon to be brother and sister in-law. I would like to get to know both of them better, but it’s kind of impossible for any of us to get a word in edgewise when the children are around. 

With this in mind (as well as our venue and adult activities planned), my fiancé and I decided that our wedding weekend is to be child-free. My fiancé approached his brother, explained that we wanted an adult weekend and he totally understood. They’d find childcare and we’d have a relaxing, adult weekend where no one is relegated to childcare. 

Enter the grandparents, my soon to be in-laws. My fiancé and I did not involve them in our discussions because they are not the parents of our nieces. They only found out about the child-free nature of the wedding this past weekend and approached us about it. We confirmed that the weekend was adult only and his mom burst into tears. She called us selfish, uncaring and excluding important family members. She was personally insulted and wondered why we didn’t consult them about it. Dad hinted at putting the girls in our ceremony as flower girls and when we reminded them that our ceremony was maybe 10 minutes tops and not traditional, he said that he didn’t like disappointing his grandchildren. Mom said that both nieces kept talking about the wedding and how they couldn’t wait to see their uncle get married. We really didn’t know how to respond to that. I don’t know about you, but when I was 5 – 7 years old, I couldn’t give a rip about a wedding. 

They pushed to the point of my fiancé becoming angry, raising his voice and giving specific examples of how the children are always the center of attention at family gatherings where someone is always having to tend to them and not be able to socialize or get a break. This ONE weekend is a chance for everyone to not have to deal with a Disney movie at full volume blasting in the next room.

Unbeknownst to us, grandparents took it upon themselves to come up with a plan with the parents that includes the children in our wedding weekend and also keeps someone on childcare duty. They tell us their plan and expect us to agree to it. We do not.

We reiterate that we will be speaking to the parents of the children directly and working it out with them. That talk is supposed to be tonight. 

I do not want to compromise – it’s our wedding that we are paying for and have a vision for. It’s not a rejection of our nieces, though my in-laws are taking it that way. 

How to discuss this with the parents in case they have changed their mind and want their children there? How to smooth this over with the in-laws? I don’t want a strained relationship with them. Any way to involve the kids without having them there?",20Sep2019,2

510,"Hi Reddit, creating a new account for this post to ensure anonymity. I’m wondering if anybody else has ever felt that they disproportionately attract negativity. Nobody gets along with everybody, I know, but it seems like I encounter a disproportionate number of people in my life who REALLY don’t like me. Often, these are people are barely know/interact with, which makes it more confusing. I know common sense dictates that if I’m the common denominator, I’m probably receiving such reactions because I’m somehow an unpleasant person, but after years of introspection and growth, I still don’t think that any potential personality flaw I possess accounts for the intense animosity I sometimes receive. 

Here are a few examples of the type of stuff that I’m talking about:

1. A few years ago, two coworkers were separately fired for harassing and threatening me. One was dumb enough to text me (so I could easily bring it to management) that nobody in the office liked me (untrue—I am still in touch with several of my coworkers from that job). The other coworker was hired after the first was let go, and when we were working alone, became irate and told me her brother would be “really fucking angry” when he heard about me, so I should “watch my back.”

2. I was fired from a job at the beginning of this year. I had a boss who changed my entire position and schedule with no explanation, so when I asked about it, she accused me of stealing company time and lying about the work I’d been doing (an accusation she had never approached me with previously or tried to talk to me about). Prior to this, she had called me “sloppy” and “lazy” and referred to things I was doing as “disgusting.” When I tried to resolve these issues, she would raise her voice and become extremely passive aggressive. She commented on how many calories I ate at lunch in front of all my coworkers and joked constantly about me being an alcoholic, even after I asked her to stop. After my schedule was inexplicably changed, I contacted HR, and I was fired the next day.

3. At that same job, everybody liked me (when I was fired, six coworkers texted asking to hang out/keep in touch, and one even came to my house and brought a pie). One girl, though, hated me. We’d worked together for six months and she was always super quiet/non responsive to my questions. One day, though, she mentions her stepdaughter—and I ask “how have I worked with you for six months and not known you’re married and have a stepkid?!” And she says “because you only talk to people as an excuse to talk about yourself and whine about your problems.” I was kind of shocked and just said “that’s not true.” And she said “it is, and you know it.” Keep in mind I had spoken to her maybe six times, and when I asked anything like “how are classes going?” She never responded with anything more than “fine.”

These are just three examples of the types of situations and interactions I seem to encounter frequently. I once had a woman inexplicably get angry at me and refuse to give me my student ID after telling me I was ineligible for financial aid and telling me I wouldn’t be allowed to enroll in classes (neither of which was true, nor would
It be the responsibility of the student ID photographer to inform somebody of that). Stuff like this happens every week or two.

Tl;dr people often become angry/hostile towards me, and I feel like it happens disproportionately given my attempts to be friendly and cooperative in social situations. Is there an explanation or solution for this?",20Sep2019,2

513,"Hello all, I'm in need of some unanimous advice! 

TL;DR at bottom 

      About a month ago, a very close friend of mine passed away. He was like a little brother, and I cared about him very much. This month has probably been one of the most numbed feeling I've ever experienced, but I feel all too much at the same time. I'm seeing a therapist already, and getting some help with grieving. However his birthday is next Thursday. And the closer it's gotten the more I want to shut down. We all have plans for this birthday together, a group of 20 or so people. All mutual with one another. And I am very close with one of his family members. His aunt, who took custody of him a few years back, and has since the day he was born saw him as her own. 

      They've always had a much stronger bond than him and his mother. I don't want to get into detail, but abuse was involved. Hence the custodial change in his late teens. I took him in when he was 16 and he lived with me and a few other friends since May of 2019. He moved back in with his aunt until his accident in August. He had a dog he loved so much. We got him when he was a puppy a little over a year ago and those two immediately bonded. We're getting a picture of the two together etched on his gravestone. All paid for by his horrible mother and abusive step dad. They lost him years ago, not in the accident. And a lot of us are upset with how things had played out with that part of the family leading to the burial.  (A VERY long story.) 

     As I said earlier, his birthday is next week, and he hated his birthday. Until this year, he wanted to celebrate it. He was happy, and in a good place. We celebrated last year, but it was very mundane. This year we're all going to visit him, and go to a friends after. I wanted to get something special for his aunt, she still has his dog. And they are both heartbroken to say the least. 

     I want to try and find someone to do a drawing of the my friend and his dog for his aunt as a gift. To always have, the two of them together. Not so much the advice part, but if anyone knows or could recommend any artists I could commission would be very appreciated. But part of me feels wrong doing it. 

      His aunt; who cared about him, loved him, and listened to him when he came begging for help; was the closest thing he had to a mom. He told her everything, they were so close. And he loved her so much. He loved his dog the same if not more. I think she would appreciate it a lot, but I guess I'm not 100% sure and wanted to get some people's input on whether it's a good idea or not. 

    I also don't want his bio mom to find out and get upset she didn't receive anything considering it was her son. The way I and most others in our group look at it, she lost him years ago. Not in August like we did. She didn't know him, what he liked or who he was. She was the first one to leave after the service. We were the last ones to go, it fucking hurt watching her walk away so easily. We're angry, and sad. Are we wrong? Would I be wrong to give a gift to his aunt only? Maybe get some copies for friends if they want them? 

   I'm just having a hard time making decisions like this, it's been very hard. If you read everything, thank you for hearing me. If you comment, thank you for helping me. I'll be sure to follow up with any responses.

514,"i cant make friends. like at all 

joining clubs is scary, and there arent any for me to join that i even like. 

i can't walk up to someone and start a conversation, i don't know what theyre like, so i can only make friends with my (becoming distant) friends' friends.

its hard, i find social interaction just hard in general. like, what do we talk about? how do i know for certain we have something in common? ive asked about your favourite colour, animal, ect. but what are your interests? 

compliments are awkward, so if i try to make others like me by doing it, itll just come out as ""uhm.. your hair is, nice? i mean its cute today, yeah that's it.."" 

how do i find friends that dont only talk to me when there's nobody else to? 

i dont want you to say youll pay me back and never do it. just say thank you and accept it, or actually pay me back.
if you say youre going to, do it. its scary to ask for it back. there's this one friend i have, and i really dont want her to hate me. she has an army of friends (used to be super popular) and like,, shes almost the only one i have. today, i just felt happy for her to talk to me after she didnt for like hours when she couldve. 

talking to others is so intimidating, and so is reading people. i cant tell if theyre bored, unhappy, fake laughing, generally happy, ect.

i want someone who i can act myself around. i have my best friend (who now i can barely see, we try to but it's hard) but we go to different schools, so how does it help there? i always have to act not myself, pretend to like thingd others do, be calm like 24/7, watch everything i say like 99% more carefully. 

acting around others to make them like me is hard. ill always slip up here and there. i just want to scream. how do i know they dont hate me? so they just tolerate me so they arent bored when theyre lonely? 

( i cant make friends easily, complimenting, joining clubs, talking to people randomly i cant do, and people i sit near in school are annoying. im not sure if anyones mean or nice, and if they even like me. only have one friend who i cant act a bit around )

518,"I consider myself to be a very friendly and easy going person. 


But now I’m realizing I think I’m too much like a guy when on a date 

I make light of a lot of situations. I’m not good at being affectionate like hand holding or saying romantic things - even pet names like baby or babe sound weird to me. 

When I go on dates, usually the dates are fun, usually dinner or drinks but I think I make everything too casual with my humor and/or laid back nature. 

I watch a lot of comedy and smoke, so that tends to happen to with these guys and then I think I’m seen as one of the guys or a bro if that makes sense. 

How can I stop being seen as that? It’s my personality so it’s kind of hard to change it??

519,"So, I've been told by everyone around me that being in a relationship is great and that its so much fun and all that, and my family puts a lot of pressure on me to be in one. (Such as when I went to my high school prom alone, they gave me a whole lot of flack for it). 

In concept, a relationship sounds great, but whenever I consider asking someone out, the same thought always plagues me. ""What if they say yes?"" I know i want a relationship eventually, but the thought of one scares me as of now, but if I don't do it now, i feel like I'm blowing my best opportunity. (For reference I'm in college and probably won't interact with people in this capacity ever again once i graduate).

525,"Gf’s ex fwb is her godbrother. She has told me she absolutely despises him. 

He used to live with her family and that’s when they secretly hooked up. And he still visits her house whenever he wants. 

Now he doesn’t live with them but they follow eachother on social media. Which is whatever. But recently he texted her that he had a dream about her. She replied that she wasn’t interested. Then he told her that he wanted to be close again. She said “no” 

The next day she texted him wanting to bring something to her house. 

I told her “this is getting weird for me. You can’t keep contacting this dude who wants to bed you” 

We had a fight and she blocked him. Well the next day I apologized and told her “I didn’t mean to come off strong I just got jealous” she got mad and said “I knew you would start again. Just drop it. Jesus”",20Sep2019,2
526,"Okay,  so this is my first ever post on reddit. Bear with me as English isn’t  my first language. I hope I didn’t break any rules by mistake (don’t  worry I read it already).

A close  friend of mine seemed to be out of it lately and snapped at me even  though she had never done that before. Mostly because she’s usually a  nice person and would keep things to herself and also the fact that I have severe anxiety, so she knew that doing so would make me overthink  for days or even weeks.

Lately,  she has a lot of pressure from both uni and her personal life. Lots of  reports due and her grandma was diagnosed with cancer (can’t remember  what type) and was left at her place for her to take care of. She did mention the reason she was on edge all the time was because she  couldn’t do work at home and have to take care of her grandma (she’s a  bit of a workaholic, but even some people have limits).

She didn’t talk with me as often as usual. Previously she would randomly ask me how I’m doing and some stuffs to check on me, but nowadays I get  none. Which worries me a lot since she would’ve spared some time to  asks no matter how busy she was usually.

She  likes cheesecakes and ice creams, but she doesn’t seem to feel like eating those desserts. Also, she heckin loves music, jazz to be exact,  and would stop on her track to listen to those kinds of music whenever  we walked. I would take her to concerts, but she can't go anywhere since  she needs to take care of her grandma. So I’m thinking of giving her  maybe a gift? But then again she’s the type of person who’s reluctant to  receive gifts. I did draw a dog picture and tuck it somewhere in her car, and she loved it and hung it in her car. I also got her a streaming  platform subscription since she loved listening to music at the  beginning of the year for further information.

Since she’s still isn’t doing that good, what should I do to help cheer her up dear redditors?

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you!

530,"Hello,

So my bf and I have been together for nearly three years. We have a lot in common, he is sweet, funny and smart and I really enjoy spending time with him.

&amp;#x200B;

There is however a problem. I feel like he is very poor at handling even minor inconveniences and he doesn't take important issues very seriously. 

Every time there's an important event coming up, I'm always the one in charge of money, organizing or any other formal stuff (I don't mind doing this). But when I ask him to do something, he usually forgets so we must deal with new complications last minute. I wouldn't say he doesn't care, he starts to care when it's too late.

&amp;#x200B;

He also makes his problems bigger than they actually are, he complains about them but never does or even tries to do anything to make the situation better, which makes him look childlish.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe that his behaviour is a result of childhood trauma, so I don't blame him that much, but I don't think it's an exuse anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: how can I help him improve and/or how can I deal with this myself? Or should I just give him more time to be more mature?

531,"I have 3 kids. My neighbor has 2 kids. Our properties are small so we are on top of each other as far as yards go and sharing toys with kids and such. Its a very pleasant set up and we enjoy each others company.

However. Often times I get the random text message form one of them saying ""Hey are you around right now?""

My car is in the driveway so there's no lying. And when I say ""Yes"" It goes right into ""Would you mind picking up my kid from school when you grab yours? Im going to be late at work, behind about an hour."" 

Its always things that I can do but that are very annoying. Like I have 3 kids and wrangling them around a bus stop is hard enough. 

""Good morning are you up right now?""

They know im up even though its 6:30 because I get lunches ready for everyone in the house and they can see my lights on. When I answer that I am up they ask ""Im in a pinch and have to leave for work right away! Is it ok if I drop the kid with you until school in a couple hours?""

Its hard to say know. both kids go to the same school. But I have a routine and have to shower and get them dressed and a million other things.

532,"Me and my best friend have been planning to move out together since college. We both graduated, and as soon as I start my job in a few months, we’re going to start the process of looking for places. We wanted a 3rd roommate to make things cheaper, but none of our other friends want to move from home anytime soon. So we decided to just get a 2 bed/2 bathroom apartment instead.

Last year, he started dating this girl. She’s cool &amp; they seem to get along well, but I don’t know a ton about their relationship. He has since suggested that she be our 3rd roommate, since then we’d be splitting the place 3 ways instead of 2. Apparently moving in together is something they’ve talked about before and she’s on board with the idea.

I don’t want this for obvious reasons. Again, they seem to get along very well, but I think that’s a big financial commitment to make to someone that you haven’t even been dating for 1 year. I have a girlfriend of 3+ yrs &amp; we have no current desire to live together. Normally, it wouldn’t be my problem, but now it would be. If they were to suddenly break up, he &amp; I would have to pay 50% more rent each. Also, since they’re a couple, I pretty much lose all leverage in any type dispute. If I have an issue with something she’s doing, he’s never going to side against her &amp; vice versa. Lastly, it’s just awkward. I’ve met her a few times, but she’s basically a stranger to me. She’s not my friend &amp; never will be. She’ll always just be my friend’s gf, and being around her is always gonna be awkward on some lvl. I’ve lived with girls before &amp; the boundaries in a mixed-sex apartment are a lot different, in my experience. Her being the gf of someone else in the apartment exacerbates that even more.

I think that IF I agree to this, I should have the master bedroom. I’m somewhat of a loner. If I’m not at work, with my girlfriend, or at the gym, I spend the large majority of my free time in my bedroom on my PC, watching TV or playing games. Both of them are more social and spend less time at home anyway. The 2nd bedroom is plenty big enough for 2 people, and they still have their own full bathroom. 

It’s also about the principle. If they want me to compromise my quality of life by living with a couple, I think they’re compromise should be giving me have the better bedroom. I think that’s a fair trade. If I took the smaller room, I’d be sacrificing everything &amp; they’d be sacrificing nothing. I’d have a worse bedroom, less use of the common spaces (I’m not gonna hang out in the living room while they’re having a movie night on the coach &amp; making out), less say over decisions, AND guests would be using my bathroom.

So what are your thoughts?

TL;DR: Me and my best friend have been planning to get an apartment together for years. He now wants his girlfriend of 10 months to be included in the plans. 

A. Should I flat out tell him no? That his girlfriend isn’t moving in with us or I’m out? (This would mean all my plans that I’ve been making for years are down the drain &amp; I’d have to find a new roommate)

B. If I do agree to it, do I have a case in demanding the master bedroom? In the spirit of compromise, and bc I am a loner &amp; spend more time at home in my room than they do, I think I should get the better bedroom",20Sep2019,0
533,"I just started seeing a girl, Hanna, It's not close to serious but it's the first date I've gone on that has gotten me really excited and we've pretty much been chatting non-stop. Although I know it could easily fall to the wayside, rn I'm really into her. Last night though a really good friend of mine, Allie, asked if I wanted to go on a date. I said ""yes,"" but didn't really think of the implication that this is probably more than a casual date. Allie and I have been real good friends for a while and do have a strong connection/chemistry. So if we went on a date and it went well, I'm not sure how the relationship wouldn't start very fast. Being in a real relationship with her scares me because she's friends with a lot of my really good friends, so if it didn't go well or something happened that'd always be a situation to navigate. I always have liked to separate my dating life from life with my friends for this reason. Also I've never really though of her in a dating way, so I'm not even sure if that's what I want or not, but feel as though I'd have to make that decision fairly quickly with a lot of factors in mind.

Anyways, I'd go on the date with my Allie but here's the main problem is that she asked me because she thought I was not currently seeing anyone else.

535,"One of my best friends has been very distant over the past 3 months.  
Over this time she’s left a broken relationship and started dating someone new.

A little background: We became very close about 4 years ago when bonding over our anxiety and depression. She lives about an hour and a half away from me so we don’t get to see each other very often.

I’ve seen her only a few times in the past 4 months, and only have met her new boyfriend once. He was very nice a they seemed like a good match, but he’s bailed on all of our other plans. A part of me feels like he might have just wanted to make a good first impression and then doesn’t feel its necessary to get to know her city friends (like me lol).

She’s been hanging out with his friends a lot, which I’m very happy about because she doesn’t have many close friends in her area. However, I’m feeling a little replaced. We had plans which she bailed on a few times, explaining she needs a mental break and time to herself, which I completely understand. But then I see photos of her hanging out with them instead.

When I generally message her, sometimes I don’t hear back for a week or two at a time. Meanwhile, I see her posting on Facebook, Instagram and interacting with other people. Whenever she does get back to me it’s always the same apologetic response. I appreciate that she’s aware she hasn’t been responding to me, but I’ve never seen any attempt of changed behaviour. Lately the responses are even less frequent.

She seems to be a person who attracts bad energy, she’s fallen out with a lot of our mutual city friends and her family and her don’t get along. There always seems to be some sort of drama or issue about every month or couple of weeks. Whenever this happens she calls me at all hours of the night crying, having panic attacks, etc. I’m always there and I’m always answering my phone helping her through these situations. Our phone calls can typically be 4-5 hours of me consoling her and providing advice.

Whenever there’s some sort of get-together with the few friends in the city that she hasn’t fallen out with, I get a text or call that day asking if she can crash at my place in the city, since she lives so far away. I’ve discussed how I have a problem with this short notice planning to her previously. I do have a lot of anxiety and do need to mentally prepare for social interaction with anyone.

There’s party in the city this weekend and I’m anticipating her asking to come stay with me the day of so she can attend. I haven’t heard back from her in a week and a half after trying to contact her. Not sure what to do if this happens again.

I’m feeling a little taken for granted and feel unimportant.  
I would like to confront her about this but she’s incredibly sensitive and I want to tread very lightly.

I would appreciate any advice on how to handle this.  
Am I overthinking this or does this seem like a problem?  
How do I confront her?

I am 16(M) and I am really good friends with this girl, we have been friends for about 1.5 years and the first time I saw her i thought she was the most beautiful girl ever(she still is), then on friendship continued

About 3 months after we became friends she started dating this other guy, It crushed me but i thought oh well I'm not the one. I tried to stop liking her and out friendship kept on getting stronger. 

They broke up not to long afterwards( there were many red flags since the start) but then she was single again. My feelings for her started again. Our friendship became even stronger. I eventually told her that I like her and what not, and she said some shit like blah blah blah, she really didn't respond to what I said. 

Fast forward to today, she broke up with this guy 5 days ago, and after I thought I was over her my feelings for her came back again, and these feelings I have never felt towards anyone else, my whole chest just feels ..... happy I guess to say. And she has been really flirty with me( that what it seems like to me) more than before, like a lot more

If the actual topic matters, it's old books for children and young adults. And adults as well, but mainly the first two groups.

544,"Hi there, I don't know how long this is going to get, so I will put a **TL;DR** for you at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

Where I live, the school started recently, at the beginning of the school year, my class was introduced to two new guys, the first guy is not a problem and I wont be writing anything about him, as we have a mutal friend and he seems really nice. But let me start from the beginning, after that things get even worse:

I wish, that I could say the same thing about the other guy, (sadly) he is like the complete opposite of the first one, to start things off, the first time, I realized, that something was wrong with him, was when our teachers introduced themselves to him, he didn't say much and avoided basically all contact. He is vietanamese and he got a rather strange name compared to the names, where I live. One teacher asked him to write down his name on the board, he silently cursed and only wrote down the first name and then went back to his place, he left the teacher questioning about how to spell his last name.

After that, in English lessons my teacher wanted him to read out his results from a little exercise he had given us and the guy just said:""Fuck off"" and after some waiting he read out his very short answers. The teacher didn't say a thing as if he hadn't heard it, but the whole class was sure, that he heard it, it was pretty loud.

During the break he was staring at our calendar, me and two  of my friends very kindly introduced ourselves to him, he replied very disinterested, I asked him when his birthday was:""December"", he replied. I asked him, if he wanted to write his birthday down on the calendar, like most of our classmates already did. ""No"", was all he said and then he left us.(That time I startet to really get doubts in him, but I still kept reminding myself, that this was only his first week at our school, he came from another school, but he didn't tell us more, so I just thought that he was insecure or I had picked a bad time with talking to him. We don't know how old he is, most of us are 16 and he is probably around the same age)

During the rest of the week, not much happened, aside from the fact, that every time when he was sitting next to somebody, he completely ignored them and only talked if he had to. He sat next to me one lesson this week as well and I can confirm, that he didn't want any contact or what so ever. And most people also don't really enjoy sitting next to him, obviously.

Here comes the most scary incident: It happened yesterday, when we had PE, in a stadium, a group of friends was waiting outside, to waste some time, he was there as well. One of them found a little grasshopper and wanted to put him out  of the way, that no one would accidentally step on it. The guy just said that he wanted to step on it, at first these people wanted to stop him, until eventually one of them got weak and allowed it. He stepped on it, but as I heard, in a way, that it wouldn't immediately be dead, but have a slow and suffering death... All he said after this was:""I like annihilating lives.""

A girl  asked him for his number, to put him in our whatsapp class chat group. At first he said he didn't want to, but later on the day, she must have convinced him to give her his number. After school, he got added and thee girls welcomed him, he just wrote:""Dafuq"". Another guy greeted him. One girl jokingly replied to his text:""you couldn't have said that in a nicer way"" Another girl asked him if he didn't want to be welcomed. He left them on read. 

I discussed everything with a good friend of mine, we didn't find out why he is behaving like this, we think, that it's most likely him being insecure and trying to be cool or what ever. Another one said, that they thought, he was a psychopath, mainly, because of the grasshopper and him kinda wanting to be alone all the time. Basically, no one knows for sure what   is wrong with him.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**: New classmate is disinterested in any social contact, even teachers and he said that he likes annihilating lives and made a grasshopper die a painful death.

&amp;#x200B;

I, myself have struggles with being shy and a little socially anxious, but I really wanted to be nice to everyone this year. So, should  I just try talking to him on Monday, although there is a high chance, that he will just avoid any conversation + I am not really sure yet how  I should word it. Another friend of mine suggested talking with our class teacher, because the guy is 0% interested in anyone of our class and not being particularly nice, so he thought that the teacher could organize some sort of class council or that the teacher could help conveying between us.

I just want to find out what is wrong with him, I have to admit, that I don't like him anymore, but I feel like, I should at least try helping him.

What should I do about this? I would be thankful about any advice or suggestions!",20Sep2019,0

Given all that, his he is still a happy child, will laugh and smile, plays with his toys (in an odd way but he seems to like it) loves to be picked up and he has hit all his motor milestones on time. But when i bring it up the other stuff to anyone they dismiss it with he is too young to know or.. ""He just looked at me then!"" For a whole of 2 seconds.. And ""see! He just responded to his name"" .. After shouted it at him over 20 times.

546,"My husband's parents are divorced. 

My mother-in-law and dad-in-law, however, paid for and bought a house for their son (my husband) to live in. 

We now live in this house. Me, my husband, my father-in-law and my two young children.

I explicitly told my husband that I did not want this house even if it means that we don't have to rent anymore. 

Fast forward 2 years, I now have a grumpy dad-in-law in my hands who is passive aggressive and whines to his other grown children (who are living in a different country) that my husband and I don't care for him and that we treat him unfairly in his own house. That we are ungrateful. He doesn't know that we overheard him whining to his other children about it.

I juggle a business at home, rearing young children, and other day-to-day tasks. My husband helps with the children and the chores while juggling a demanding job in finance. 

My father in law is not bedridden, he's on some medication but can still travel if he wants to or walk to the park but he doesn't do all those things and just smokes cigarettes at home (another issue for another day).

I think he wants me to be more caring and take him out on coffee dates and trips outside or whatever but I don't have the energy left to do those things and sadly, the fact that he badmouthed me to other people just made me even more distant.

I feel stuck, helpless, and depressed enough to contemplate suicide. I am back on medication so no worries re: suicide.

548,"From the title, you already know it's that cliche story of being in love with your best friend. I initially met my friend brian 3 months ago on Grindr, a gay hookup/dating app. At first, I was hesitant to make a move/hook up because I was just getting out of a relationship. He and I just talked about anything and everything. I got to know him so well, learning his fears, accomplishments, goals, etc. He is so funny, charming, relatable, and is even in the same profession as me. I am afraid to make a move or tell him how I feel because I don't want to mess up what we have. What we have right now is such pure friendship where he calls me his best friend, says he loves me, we sleep in the same bed when I come over, we talk about boys that we like and go on dates with. 

I realized that I had feelings for Brian when we started talking about boys. I was going on dates and seeing other guys but as soon as he started telling me about the guys that he talks to, I felt awful inside. I think that I was initially filling some void I had after my ex-boyfriend so I was talking a lot of guys but I was only getting close to Brian. As I said, he has so many attributes that I adore about him. I am just afraid that the feeling may not be reciprocated. Please give me advice about what I should do about the situation and what I should be looking out for that I'm missing. I want to tell him but im just afraid that it would come out wrong or be poor timing.",20Sep2019,1

So I did have a very traumatic childhood, most of which I don’t remember. It was traumatic because I witnessed violence and just soooooo many things. Over the past couple of days I’ve been having flashbacks of random things from my childhood. These are memories I didn’t even know I had. I remember inappropriately playing with my teddy bears when I was like 7. Like I would touch their “genitals” and other things. I also remember being very interested in sex at a very young age. I’ve never thought about this before and it’s kind of messing me up. My older sister was molested multiple times and I lived in the same house as her every time. This is all making me think about the fact that sometimes after I have sex, I just cry. Like I feel very guilty and disgusted with myself and I never associated it with anything. Maybe this is all just a coincidence or something.... I really don’t know. If y’all have any similar feelings please share. I just had to get it off my chest.",20Sep2019,1

554,"I have a younger sister (let's use S for clarity) and we are between 20-25 years old. I've never been able to get along with S, since we were kids. I've been able to avoid S for these past couple of years as we have been at different locations because of jobs/studies/relationships. I now live with my parents once again (for a certain reason) and S has also moved closer to them, which means we see each other almost on a daily basis. Ever since S came back, daily life has become much more stressful. 

It started out with S making comments about the way we do things around the house. Calling us (me and one of our parents) pigs, assholes and morons when we do something S does not agree with. It can be as minor as putting a cup in the wrong place in the dishwasher. S also becomes angry several times a week when S doesn't agree with someone, throwing things or shoving things off counters and onto the floor before dramatically walking away and slamming doors on the way out. S will also do things in the home such as emptying the dishwasher, but will hide specifically my things (certain cups or kitchen equipment that I've bought and nobody else uses) in different places around the house. Apart from that S constantly nags about me and my life, even though it has no effect on S own life. For the most part I have been able to ignore this, but I have complained to my parents about this and they just shrugged it off or told me ""that's just the way S is"". One day S fought with one of our parents so bad, that parent kicked S out and said that if S wanted to come back S was to conform to the household routines. 

S didn't come back for several months, but now it seems as though our parents have forgotten S previous actions and S is now allowed to continue bullying (which is what I believe S is doing).  Last week I had a confrontation with S because S came and made comments about how certain things in the house weren't taken care of (by me) as S thinks they should be and S keeps making my life harder (hiding things where I can't find them, using things and leaving them in a worse condition than they were etc). S doesn't live with us, but still comes here and does things the way S thinks they should be done I asked S why S needs to comment about everything I do and asked S to stop as I don't make comments about S decisions in life. S came up to my face and started yelling saying ""it's none of my concern as the comments made were not said to me"" and how ""ungrateful I am for not appreciating everything S does"". Our mom got between and told S to stop screaming, causing S to storm out. S keeps coming back and continuing the behavior. Apart from that S will call relatives and tell them lies and spread rumors about me. One such lie she told was that our mom had called S and told her ""that I didn't help her clean the house on a specific day and that I was fat and lazy"". I cried because I had in fact rescheduled my entire day to help my mom deal with both cleaning as well as her business, sitting on the phone for hours sorting out issues etc. I confronted my mom, but she denied calling my sister and telling her anything. My mom did call S and tell her to stop spreading lies.  I have talked to my parents about it. My dad laughs it off and deflects when I bring it up, while my mom says ""she's tired of being put in the middle of this"" as well as acknowledging the fact that S constantly instigates fights. 

I honestly have no idea what to do and it's taking a toll on me. I have so many other things to think about (work, university, volunteering, etc) and just want to have a safe space to go home to and not constantly worry about what's waiting for me at home. I suffer from anxiety, which I'm able to manage very well thanks to therapy, but drama and toxic situations (such as this one) always cause me a lot of anxiety and panic attacks. I will be moving away in less than a year, but I'm unable do it before then. I have no problem speaking my mind and confronting people on issues, but it has not worked with S as S will instantly start screaming and getting in my face (think housewives of beverly hills type of confrontation). Does anyone have any advice for me for how to go about this? I'm in need of some serious help.",20Sep2019,1

556,"Hello, as stated in the title, I’m a 21 yr old female from Georgia, USA - I realize the title comes off as “my parents don’t understand me”, but I already went through that phase 7 years ago, I’m genuinely stuck in my current situation. 
A little backstory for reference: 
On New Year’s day 2018 , I was arrested and placed on probation due to my abusive ex boyfriend, my license was frozen/inactive for 6 months, ending in October 2018. As of May 14th 2019, I am no longer on probation and my license is valid. I turned 21 on September 2. My parents have a very rocky relationship, having been divorced since I was 12 and my dad continuously providing financial support for my mother, despite it recently coming out that she’d been living with another man for the past 6 years (not relevant to me, just setting the scene). My dad is a kind hearted man but is incredibly overbearing and refuses to let me be my own person, my mother is not a kind hearted woman, and expects me to *continuously* be grateful for even being born and having a home (basically worshipping them because they did the bare minimum for a child they planned to have) because her childhood sucked. To emphasize the situation here, I cannot shave my legs without being asked why I’m doing so, I get ridiculed for wearing makeup and false eyelashes, I’m not allowed to not wear pants in my home, and if i wear anything other than a t-shirt , i’m told to cover up. Not only this, but my car is currently out of service, and has been for almost two years despite my dad saying “i’ll fix it”, he’s a cheapskate and will not allow anyone else to work on it (despite making 6 figures a year). I live in a very remote part of GA, and am unable to walk to a job, and my parents are *terrified* of other people or an uber taking me to a job, so I’m currently unemployed. I’ve been told some people go to college to get away, but I’m not allowed to live on campus anywhere, if I were to go, I’d have to live at home- and even then, my dad insists he drives me to and from campus instead of fixing my vehicle. 
To add to this mess, i’m not an only child, though I am the oldest and the only girl. I have one brother [16] and my dad waited until one month ago to take him to the dentist for the first time, resulting in what i’ve been warning him of for years- health complications. My brother now needs two root canals and has an infection in his jaw. Not to mention, he’s incredibly antisocial, and is allowed to come home from school and go straight to his room and sit on his PC for 12 hours a day (not an exaggeration!). My dad is NOTORIOUS for procrastinating and putting off very important things such as doctor visits. I suffered with a vaginal infection and chronic yeast infections for years because he refused to let me go to the doctor (also partly my fault because when it’s anything personal like that, he assumes i’ve been sleeping around). 
To negate the advice to just leave one night and not come back, I used to breed snakes and have quite a large collection of reptiles- all can be moved if necessary though. 
My parents used to harp on about how they let me be myself by letting me dye my hair and get tattoos and breed snakes, but will not allow me to do anything on my own- everything is paid for by them, and when it comes to anything progressive (ie. me working, going to school, paying my own bills, etc) they tell me i’m not ready. 
I cook, I’m the only one that cleans and does dishes/laundry etc, I take care of my PLENTY OLD ENOUGH brother, i take out the trash, and many other things. I’m essentially the housewife of the family, and I need an out. 

Apologies for this being all over the place. Ask me any questions if I left anything out, any any ANY advice is welcome. 
Thank you all ❤️

558,"Hi all, Reddit newbie here. 

I was recently given two job offers. I know, lucky me. I am very thankful but this decision has been more stressful than I thought!

A little background:

My fiance and I are getting married in less than two months. I hadn't planned on seeking new employment during this time but we unexpectedly moved for a job offer he was given that would allow us to live in our dream location. So, the job hunt began.

 Here is my dilemma:

First job is only part-time with no benefits. Money has been tight, but that's mainly due to supporting ourselves off one income. I think this job may be just the supplement we need. We can work around the lack of benefits. This job, while not ideal right now, leads into a position that I am strongly pursuing. My chances of obtaining this position go up quite significantly if I take this offer. Basically, I'm trying to think long-term and look at the bigger picture. I think if I take this job, I can land my dream job in 1-2 years. This job would also be a new learning experience and better fits my lifestyle (is not a sedentary desk job). Lastly, perhaps least importantly, or to some, most importantly, my gut feeling has been to pick this job. I don't know how much to trust intuition though. 

Second job is full-time, amazing benefits, and not only pays more because of the hours worked but the pay is nearly $5 more hourly. My fiance and I would be extremely comfortable if I took this job. However, this job is not at all in alignment with my career goals. It's just something I have a lot of experience in and am good at. It would not present any kind of challenge at all, which is both a good and bad thing. It is shift work, I would be required to be on call, there is mandatory overtime and possibility of working short staffed, and the work is inherently stressful. So it's a tough job, but I am used to it and the money would take some personal stress off. 

Basically, it boils down to pay and benefits. If the first job was full-time, had benefits, and paid the same as the other job, I would accept it without hesitation. There are some other minor pros and cons I haven't mentioned, but this is essentially the most pressing issue.

So, with that said, I called back the part-time job and accepted the offer. The full-time job was very understanding and said the position is there if I want it at a later time (I'd have to go through the application process again, which is like 6 months, but the option is there). So, if landing my dream job doesn't work out I can easily change my mind on this. I am a bit of an anxious person though and I guess I am seeking validation. So what do you all think...did I make the right decision? How can I convince myself to feel more confident that I made the right choice?

Thank you all in advance...between planning a wedding, moving states, and job hunting, I've been having a harder time keeping a level head about things like this.",20Sep2019,2

561,"I have a roommate that happens to be my brother's boss. The dude is just a bad roommate to start with but he leaves his puppy in a kennel at least 12 hrs a day if not longer, with no access to food or water. I work nights, and I've been woken up tons of times by his poor dog barking non-stop or the entire house smelling of dog shit because she's had to hold it too long. She's a puppy.

 We have a basement house, 3 bedrooms on the main floor, 3 bedrooms downstairs. The dog's kennel is in the downstairs living room. We keep the two floors separated by baby gates because my dogs do not get along with his unsocialized dog. My dogs have access to a doggy door, water and are not kennelled at all. His dog is also not potty trained, so she can't be allowed to roam around downstairs. 

I have my own dogs and responsibilities and do not want to take on another dog. Sometimes when I'm not too exhausted from working nights, I take pity on his poor dog and let her out to pee. But most days I come home with enough energy to just pass out and sleep until my next shift. My dogs are cared for between my husband and I. Also on days I know we absolutely cannot spend any time with them, I have a pet sitter come by to walk them or play with them at the local dog park. I have 3 dogs, and the service can get expensive, but I value it a lot. Most days my dogs are night owls with us. 

I've told our roommate about this service and how it would greatly benefit his dog, but he won't listen. He won't even consider it. He easily makes twice as much as my husband and myself combined. I feel terrible for her because she is so neglected but my brother told me to stay out of it. He doesn't want me saying anything to his boss. 

I finally had the last straw with him and he's moving out at the end of the month. Again today I was woken up by the horrible smell of dog shit. His poor dog is downstairs in her kennel covered in feces and I have to be to work in 2 hours and so I've lost sleep and I'm going to be late (my commute is an hour) because I can't just leave her there. He won't be home for another 8 hours because he drove one state over for work. (AZ to CA) 

I'm at my wit's end. I seriously want to take her to a shelter or a rescue and say she ran away when I was bathing her out front. I'm a dog lover and the situation is both infuriating and horrible. She's a beautiful purebred German Shepherd puppy and she doesn't deserve this life. The neglect will just continue when he moves out.",20Sep2019,1

564,"I am a junior in high school and I need some advice on how I end this ""friendship"". Okay so just a quick summary, I've known him (lets call him Bob) for two years. Before last year, I kind of only knew his name, but I knew who he was. He was only a distant acquaintance because he knew one of my other friends in the past, that have became distant. So, it was the beginning of the school year and since we knew each other, even though it was just a little bit, it was a familiar face so we sat together and it stayed like that the whole year. 

I don't mean to sound like a complete d\*ck, but he is very socially awkward and I am really his only friend. He only talks to me, and when I went to go hang out with my other friends at lunch or gym class he follows me around everywhere. I have no problem with him joining us for lunch but when he won't leave my side, thats when I though it was ridiculous. If I go to one of my friends, he'll be there too right behind me. If move around to some one else, he's there! I've kind of grown tired of it because he's not the best person on the planet. His sense of humor is very odd, because it's somewhat racist and homophobic and kind of dark and I don't like that and he's constantly making these kind of jokes and I don't want to be associated with that because its not like he's conscious that they're not always appropriate (whether he believes in what he's joking about or not I don't want to be part of it). He doesn't talk to my other friends because they are mean to him in a jokingly way but he doesn't ever say anything back. We all make fun of each other, and joke around, but nothing is personal and I usually don't get involved in that but I know that their intentions are not bad. I don't make fun of him so I guess thats why he clings to me. Also, when we were in the same class last year, I entertained the idea of friendship and he took it and ran with it even though we never hang out outside of school, he compensates for when we are in school.

This year however, he is in two of my classes. He doesn't sit next to me, but I'm sure he'll manage somehow. So a quick summary about me. I'm pretty shy, so I keep to myself most of the time but I have no problem making small talk to the person next to me in class. I don't put myself out there, even with my friends because thats just not what I do. I am bit socially awkward too but definitely as not as much as him, so I care what people think of me and my reputation. I know I shouldn't but I get in my own head and think about that too much. I don't know how true this is, but one of my other friends told me that when he was talking to some girl that she said that Bob kind of harassed her, and wouldn't leave her alone no matter how many times she told him, and my name came up somehow, and that is what motivated me to make this post. That makes it even worse for me because I don't want to be associated with that one bit. I want to make friends in these classes that he is in, but he doesn't give me a chance to because no matter where I go, he is going to be there, so if I wanted to associate with someone else, he is definitely going to be there.

I want to distance myself from him and that is really hard to do for me. I'm not one to be a d\*ck to somebody face to face for no reason and I would feel guilty because I'm his friend but it's hard to say likewise. Again, I'm not trying to bully him and make him be alone, I just don't want him to keep doing what he is doing and thats not going to stop unless I say something. Sorry about the long post but I would really appreciate some advice on what to do and how to handle this situation. Thanks",20Sep2019,1
565,"I have a neighbour/friend who keeps ‘asking’ for favors but without asking. She would hint at things that she needs but wouldn’t straight out ask.  So when the favor is done, it always felt like I didn’t do her a favor at all. 

It began feeling draining and I stopped offering my assistance to whatever she needed, be it child care, pick up/drop off at school, inviting over to dinner because it has never been reciprocated. There has been hundreds of hints but I didn’t bite to any of them. She has the same financial status as me and is a stay at home mom.

I’m sure she’s noticed that I haven’t been offering to help anymore and she’s become standoffish to the point where I feel like she’s annoyed when she talks to me in social situations. I could sense a different vibe from her, in that she doesn’t even care to make small talk since I’m useless to her. She has even bad mouthed me with a mutual friend. All Fine with me, I know where I stand. Kicker, she messages me today to ask how my day was going (strange)but I’m easy going and will talk to whoever wants to talk to me.

572,"I’m going to spill out a situation and I need advice on if this is me or not. I’ve felt like these past three years have been abnormally hard.

-I graduate college with a 3.9 making the Deans list. 
-My clinicals I received a reward for going above and beyond. The nurses at the clinic cried when I left and showered me with love. 
- The job I got after school was a medical office owned by the doctor. I did a good job and loved our patients. Constantly called out for doing a good job. But a nurse there rubbed the manager the wrong way (and all of the staff), so the manager left and I was going to be stuck doing this nurses job, the managers job, so I found a job in insurance. On the day I gave my two weeks notice I was alone in the office with the nurse that had created a lot of drama. It was the weirdest experience, but she called out to me from the front (I was in the back by myself finishing up some work) and she said “_____, I have a gun in my purse and I’m about to shoot you.” I high tailed my ass out of there, told the boss, filed a police report. Sent the messages to the manager and owner she sent me after saying “it was a joke. I didn’t mean to frighten you.” I still think about it today and it creeps me out. Also, I need to note, this girl and I were friends before this. Honest to God this came out of the blue. 

- I start this job in insurance out of obligation to make more money since my husband mentioned he would break it off with me if I didn’t start making more money (granted, he was at my graduation. Etc. and it was super dumb of me. He now regrets ever having said that, and is more mature. He wants me to be happy, and has seen his douchebag ways) 

So I start this job. Everything is fine for a year. Then shit hits the fan. The networks start growing, they refuse to hire more people, and on top of a million other things they only have four people manning the whole country on escalated issues for a Fortune 500 company. Management starts putting everyone on PIP plans which is a nice way to say “shape up or we’re firing you.” and as of right now everyone is talking about finding new jobs. It’s gotten super weird lately. I can’t help but think it’s me? 

Is this shit my fault? I just feel like this crap keeps happening to me. There comes a point where I have to ask myself am I the one attracting or causing this. My life has been HARD, but was going good for a while. It was steady. Then crap hits the fan. I’ve been so stressed it’s affecting my mental health and my body. 

Outside looking in does this seem like my fault.",20Sep2019,0

Im a 21 year old guy and a few months ago i went on instagram and looked a bit and followed some people from elementary school (i dont know if that if the right comparison because dutch school system is diffrent from US, but the basisschool for any dutch here). So i also added my elementery school crush, and she followed me back. 

A little bit of background: i know she liked me back in the day, she send me a hand made card two years in a row on Valentine's Day the last years of elementary school (we were around 12 the last year). But nothing ever happened between us, as soon as we went to the next school (middelbare school) we never really stayed in contact even though she lived at most 10 minutes away. 

So now present day: She posted some holiday pictures on instagram and apparently she was at the exact spot i was a week before her. So i messaged her what a coincidence that was and blabla. She replied and after that i send her a message back, but at the last one she never replied. 

So now my problem. Probably some of you know, you never forget your first crush. I love to meet up with her to see her again, but since she never reacted i don't know what she want. So i dont know what to do... Should i message her? And if yes, what should i say",20Sep2019,1

591,"As I come to the end of my 20s I've been reflecting a lot lately on my past. I've started to quit or at least tone down certain habits I used as escapist tools, such as porn and alcohol; quitting has made me more introspective and willing to look back on my life.

My 20s have mostly been a complete failure. I have only made one friend this decade. I was isolated in college and mostly hated it even though i got my degree. I've been highly neurotic, socially anxious, and at least mildly depressed the whole decade. I've travelled solo to places like Budapest, Cambodia, and Vietnam, but I mostly kept to myself unlike other travellers who meet tons of people.

It's only recently that I've snapped out of a daze and questioned the influence of my childhood and how it shaped my anxious, irritable, and neurotic personality. 

My Dad, due to no real fault of his own, has very low IQ. He is severely dyslexic and he stopped going to school when he was 11. 

I have lived with my Dad and Mum most of my life (I lived in Thailand for 6 months in 2016, 2017, and this year). I bond with my Dad over football (soccer) but that's it. I am of well above average intelligence so it is difficult to relate to him on practically anything else. 

My mother is also not the brightest but she is not regarded as the village idiot, which is a term I know would be used for my dad. While growing up, I never really saw my parents happy together. 

My mother married the first man she met to get away from her own mother, who was controlling and negative. I am the reuslt of that marriage. I've always known there to be unhappiness in the relationship of my parents and it's pretty obvious my mother stayed with Dad assuming it would be best for me.

My Dad is a very irritable person who is highly strung. He tried his best for me though and he has a good heart. But he sits watching television from 9-11am and 3pm-11pm every single day. He sometimes claps at the tv or makes stupid noises, which annoys the hell out of me. When i ask him to be quiet, his highly strung nature then leads him to become upset.

My mother is a gentle kind-hearted person but she is also on a cocktail of sleeping meds and strong antidepressants. She was emotionally abused as a child but she has never been able to open up to me about it. I can talk to my mother about some things and ask for advice, but still, she is overall an unhappy person.

My mother and father rarely had huge arguments as I was growing up; it was just a constant bickering that's lasted my entire existence. My mother mostly stays up in her bedroom while my dad is glued to the tv.

Anyway, the influence of all this on me is starting to take its toll. I mostly ignored it during my whole life so far. I don't know why I ignored it. What really grates is when my parents wonder why I'm a stand offish person, a moody person, an irritable person without for one second considering their own impact on my personality. The environment I grew up in was far from ideal.

I am not sure what advice I'm looking for. I don't know whether to confront my parents or even just how to accept the fact my personality was shaped by the environment I grew up in. 

Ultimately, I have responsibility for what my life is like seeing as I'm an adult. So I am not blameless in this. I just wish I realized earlier the undercurrent of toxicity in my childhood that slowly shaped my neurotic personality. 

I grew up in an abuse-free environment with more than enough food, shelter, and safety. So that's a positive. Still, I feel like all this has affected me much more than I had previously thought.

598,"I was laid off from my job at the end on June.  I have been given unemployment that covers my bills and had about $6500 in savings.  Over the 3 months on unemployment I’ve used about 1k from my savings, most of it for my bf’s 40th bday party.  I have been working odd jobs for side money (I have been sewing forever so I do bridal alterations and what not for a little side cash).  I’ve been looking high and low and have had about 6 interviews but nothing has planned out.

Now my bf is able to get about 2 weeks off in November.  In my industry I never had that kind of flexibility, the most I could get off is about a week plus the adjoining weekends (we used my spring break to go to Peru last April, we are both 12 month education employees).  We started talking about the idea of going to Thailand on his 2 weeks off.

Of course immediately I said no because I’m unemployed....any expenses besides necessary expenses are on hold.  But then I started thinking....when I am ever going to have this much freedom to travel again in my life?  I did some research and a flight to Thailand from where I live is about $500, and Thailand is notoriously cheap to visit.  The street food is supposed to be amazing and you can get a meal for $2 usd.  We like to get more authentic places to stay so a we could easily get a place to stay for $30 a night.  Given my financial situation my bf offered to help me out with expenses while we are there, he said just pay for the flight.

So what do I do?  Just spend the $500 and enjoy the fact that I have some freedom right now?  Or be logical and keep that money in my savings?  I’m really scared I’m not going to be able to find a job....but I have a masters and several certifications so I know I’ll be able to get something it just a matter of getting the right job.  And on a side note....I think my bf wants to propose on the trip.  He’s been bringing up trips a lot and I told him we are in a holding pattern until I get a job.  He has been good at getting me to breathe a bit and realize my whole life isn’t about my day job.  He has also told me several times don’t worry about money, he can float us if my benefits run out...but I’ve never been a girl to not support myself.  He’s a keeper though...I will definitely say yes😍

Now for the main part:
My friends are all a lovely bunch of characters, we tend to mess around alot and have a lot of fun, but i've always felt empty with them, like there's some sort of emotional disconnect.

For instance, i almost never talk about any of the things i like to my friends, purely because i'm scared that i'll be ostracized from them based purely on something which could be considered trivial to most people.

Besides that, i'm not the best person when it comes to social situations, and there's one friend who just blatantly take advantage of any weakness you have and turn you into the short end of a joke, and honestly it's been wearing me down for the last 2-3 years.
One of the worst parts is that he is one of the more ""popular"" kids in my class, so most people in my class genuinely believe some of the bullshit he's claiming.

Its really awful to be unable to defend yourself in those situations, and sometime after all this stuff i feel endlessly sad without knowing why.

604,"I'm currently in a long distance relationship. I live in NY and she lives in AZ. I have been with my girlfriend for 2 years and some months now. With that being said, we have had talks of having children in the future, getting married and so forth. All the things that come with wanting to be with someone for a long time. In the beginning of our relationship, I was in college studying for computer tech. I was thinking ahead and wanted to further my education and complete a bachelor as well in computer tech once I finished my associates. I have already finished my associates and I changed my major because I realized that wasn't the field for me. Now that I have changed my major (to Psychology), I truly feel like staying here in NY to further my education (master's/doctorate).

I have visited her 4 times now. Her and her family insist I go again. She gets really sad when I tell her I don't know when I will be able to go. Her parents aren't keen of her coming here by herself because they are afraid of her having sex, getting pregnant and everything in between. Little do they know she is on birth control. I should throw in at this point that she is Mexican and Catholic. Two of the most strictest things you can put together. I can't just get up and leave whenever I want though. I work, go to school, I need to help with the rent and so forth. Those times I did go, I had the time and was able to go. I just feel things can be done differently on her end but her parents control her a bit but that's besides the point I am trying to make. 

I planned on moving over there to AZ once I finished my bachelor but I feel it may not be the best decision to make. It will be difficult to get a job. Her family is great but I don't want to live in their household and be under their rules. She will not under any circumstances move over here because of her family values and so forth and the weather sucks. I am not one of serious family values and I am not very close with most of my family. I plan on moving out regardless, I just feel like moving to AZ may be detrimental to my future. I asked awhile ago, would she leave me if I told her I wanted to continue my education here. She said ""if it were a master, I will be highly upset but I wouldn't leave. Now, if you're talking doctorate, I'm sorry but I cannot stay."" I respect her response and since then, I've been feeling more on the side of staying here. Being here in NY is less about whatever family I have but more about what my future may bring by staying here rather than moving to AZ. I do have a therapist who I really enjoy talking to and a part of me doesn't want to let go of that just yet. Also, I should throw in I finish my bachelor in a year and a half. She's expecting that we live together after I finish more or less. If I ultimately make that decision, my question is **how can I end our relationship on good terms?** 

I don't want there to be hatred. I know she will be upset, sad and so forth. If I make the decision, how can I go about it? If I don't and manage to work something out, what am I losing out on besides anything I have already stated?",20Sep2019,1

However, I’ve been having issues w my immune system to where im sick constantly, and now whenever i eat anything that isn’t meat and fat i have bad side effects like cramping, dizziness, overall lack of energy that ive never had before.

I don’t like to cry it makes me feel weak but i couldnt contain it. I just can’t stop thinking about “do i hate my life?” “Do i hate having to pick between my parents? Or having to work constantly just to disappoint him? Or to sit alone at lunch and listen to music? or to be sick literally all the time even with my strict diet?” I’m not depressed or suicidal. I just wonder if i really enjoy my life like I should. If anyone wants to help explain why I might feel like this thatd be great... whether i just feel like because of nicotine withdrawal or if nicotine has been serving as an antidepressant as all these emotions have been eating away at my spirit.",20Sep2019,1
607,"DISCLAIMER: Sorry, this may get long, I just want to get the details in. 

So, for some background, I’m an almost 20 year old college student. I live at home and drive to school every day, so expenses are low, but I wanted some extra money to save up for certain things. Over the summer, I started a job as a cashier, and for a while it was great. It wasn’t a particularly fun or exciting job, but it was relatively easy, I was making money, and I was being social regularly (which I’ve previously struggled with during the summer). 

Moving forward to the beginning of the school year, I arranged a work schedule that I thought would give me enough time to do school work/study. At first, it was fine. I was working about 24 hours per week, and my classes weren’t too hard. I thought it would be easy. But eventually, I started to fall behind. I’m not even 5 weeks into the semester, and I already feel like I don’t know what’s going on. This has never happened to me before, Ive always been good in school and good at getting homework done, but now I’m slipping. 

The obvious answer should be to just put more of my free time into my school work and studying to get my grades up. But this turned out to be not that great of a solution. 

With 24-26 hours of work and 12 hours of school every week, and all of my free time put into school work, eating, sleeping, etc., I feel like I have no time to do anything fun or relaxing. I’ve had to turn down so many invitations to plans on the weekends because of work. 

I’m starting to feel sad and on edge all the time, like I’m just running on a treadmill, without an end in sight. 

But every time I talk to my friends or family, they say that nobody likes to work and there are plenty of people who work more hours than me AND go to school. 

I don’t know what to think anymore. Am I just being dramatic? Should I keep things the same and just deal with the unhappiness or try to change my attitude?",20Sep2019,1
608,"I just got a job offer via phone from the VP of a company I interviewed for. I was flustered and honestly very surprised by her unexpected call.. usually i get an email for stuff like this.  
I was so excited that when she told me the salary (which is more than I'm making now) i forgot about negotiating it.  She plans to send me my offer package on Monday. So I feel like I have very little time to negotiate. I don't want them to make an offer letter twice. Also the only contact I have to this company is the recruiter's email, or the number the VP called me from.. but I think the latter would be too weird for me to call.  
I need help, guys. I've never done this before and my friend just read over a draft I made and said it wasnt assertive enough. Btw I think this is a huge company so I don't want to make them change their mind, they're probably hiring many others for this role! People wouldn't rescind an offer because you tried to negotiate or you poorly negotiated, would they? Also how high is too high to ask for, like is 5,000 more too much?

611,"So I broke up with my bf. He was pretty abusive. I shouldn’t have dated a teenager to begin with. He was so immature.

When I dumped him he called me Non stop close to 100 times. And my whole family was concerned as they heard how many times he called. I called him that night and I told him I needed space. 

The next day he started again and I did meet up with him but was so mad that I left. He followed me to my car. 

This went on for a week where I would block him and he would make fake accounts. Call me on block or basically just harass me. Going as far as to open my car door and talk to me. It was getting crazy. I then unblocked him to make it just stop. 

A week later I began to date someone else. He knew about my ex and how he wouldn’t go away. 

When I posted a snap of me and my new bf. My ex stopped bugging me. In fact he blocked me. 

A week later he unblocked me to tell me how he will do great things without me and I was the bad one etc. The next day he texts me wanting to apologize again. But I had enough of him. 

So I rubbed it in his face how I have boyfriend and how everything is great. And how my ex was completely horrible compared to him. 

2 weeks after that I heard non stop abuse from fake profiles on emails from him. 

Anyways all was calm. And it’s been 10 months since I’ve heard anything from him. 

Till I went to my doctor appointment and yep he was there. He works there. He greeted me nicely and was polite. He apologiZed for the wait that they were experiencing and it was professional. But it just felt forced. 

A week later I was sitting for my class and out of no where my ex shows up. He didn’t look at me but he walked into another room. He had a bag and looked like he was in a rush. He walked out right passed me. It was super suspicious that he came out of no where. 

So I have a follow up but I asked my doctor to transfer my record to another doctor. He is my family friend and he asked why. I told him about my ex and how he is starting to act strange. 

He said “I will look into it” and he may reprimand him.",20Sep2019,0
612,"I have a long time friend who is financial trouble according to his wife (whom I trust).  I'm told that he is $2500-$3000 in debt and has a primary and secondary mortgage on his house.  Here are some other details:

1) He had a double lung transplant a few years ago.  Despite the odds, he's doing pretty well and staying on top of his medication regime. He's always been a non-smoker, and his condition was very unusual and he went downhill very quickly.  I am told he was days away from death when a donor was found.  

2) His medical bills, especially monthly medication costs (est. $700-800 per month?) are primary cause of his financial troubles as far as I know

3) Because of his transplant, age and general health, he doesn't have the stamina to hold down a full time job, and I doubt that benefits would ever be available given his medical history.    He does do some gig work, but not a lot.  

4) I believe that he is tapping into disability that covers a fraction of his old income.  

5) His wife works part time.  She probably doesn't have the skills to make more than minimum wage.  We're all pretty close to retirement age (3-5 years).

6) I would be willing to give or lend him $2500 (possibly more - but I have a limit) but without knowing his full financial picture, I'm not sure if that would solve anything or just defer the inevitable.  I really love this guy and his wife and would hate for him to lose his house, especially if I could do something to help.

7) I don't know his financials or his history so I cannot say whether he has always made wise financial decisions in his past.  That said, I think he's a good, compassionate person.  

8) He is very proud, old school, and would be absolutely mortified if he knew I knew anything about his problems and would be doubly so if he knew I was sharing on the internet. 

I want to help him.  I feel like I need more details before I can do much.  I wish I could look at his financial position holistically.  Our wives have talked, but I haven't been in any direct conversations.    Essentially, she would take assistance if she could do it without her husband's knowledge.  I don't think she's been forthcoming to her husband about their finances (she runs them) partly out of embarrassment and partly not to stress him (or their daughter).     

I know that people often crowdfund for causes like this, but I can't see anyone donating to an anonymous recipient; I certainly wouldn't because I would wonder if it's a scam.

If his group of friends knew, many would probably all chip in.  He's generally very well liked.  

At least, I'm hoping to crowd source ideas.    Is there anything practical to do for this couple without opening up their problems to the world?

613,"If you look at my post history, its pretty obvious I've been here a lot for this subject, but I just can't seem to shake it and I just want to try again, anyway here is the story:

When I was younger (elementary school + middle school) I wasn't really a good kid. I was pretty mean to people a lot (I don't really know why) and I've really changed since then. Now I'm almost the opposite and I constantly do my best yo care for people and help people and put them before myself (I know its not good but one issue at a time) but for some reason I can't get over something I did when I was younger, despite how much I changed. In middle school, I was friends with the kid, he was sort of in our whole friend group. But the thing with him is that as the year progressed we sorta all started having a falling out with him. I'm not saying we at all were innocent in this, we were mean to him and he would do some strange and/or mean things to us or around us that really made us all uncomfortable. Eventually, we all stopped being friends with him, we sorta just over the summer stopped hanging out with him, talking to him etc. Fast forward to high school, and now I've started to change, I started to care for people, be kind, etc. But then (freshmen year) he isn't in a good spot, he starts to get into a depression, does drugs, and eventually attempts to commit suicide. Thank goodness he survived, he went to rehab, he sorta has fallen back in with his religion and is off most drugs (besides pot iirc). Now less than 2 years later it all sorta clicked to me, that I am responsible for this. I've tried talking to him, I've tried to help him but I can't now, at first I started off with apologizing, I tried to be friends with him again, would check on him now and then and it was alright, and he forgave me and didn't blame us for everything. A few months ago he told me that he thinks the way we treated him in the past  has really affected him now. He thinks because of us it changes how he treats other people and he doesn't like what that has done to him. Then basically I told him how guilty I feel and how much I've changed and how sorry I am and he said he's sorry but he doesn't think I can do much to help him. He also told me that he's gonna do his best to live his life and he wants me to do the same.

Now, I just constantly worry. I feel that anything that happens now is my responsibility. I also feel like that no matter what I do, no matter what good I try to do I can never get over what happened, I can never be forgiven and so on. I've lately just dedicated to helping others no matter what it does to me. I just don't know what to do now, everyone tells me that I'm such a good kid now and admire all the good things I do, even the kids at my school now see me as one of the nicest kids but I just don't feel it, I feel like I'm at fault for everything here and I feel so guilty and I really don't know what to do. I try to look up to my heroes and stuff but then I just think that I can never be like them, since this terrible thing I did in the past and it really hurts me. I'm just not sure what to do or how to move on, I wanna keep helping others and try to move on but its really hard to put this all behind me, does anyone have some wise words or any advice on what I can do to really move on?",20Sep2019,2
614,"I'm happy in my current relationship of over a year. My boyfriend is loving and kind and we're doing great. He's probably the one but we're both too young to think about that now. 


My old one ended 3 years ago after a 2+ year-long shitshow where we didn't stay together for more than a month at a time. This person, however, was my first love and that period of my life was the MOST emotional and tumultuous time I've ever had. Plus I was like 15 when we met. This person was my first everything. When that ended for the 100th time and finally for good, I was pretty lost. 


I've had one long relationship and one more bad heartbreak in the years since I ultimately left her. But she was the yardstick for me because I hadn't had anything else so ""real"" yet in my life. She left a massive impact on me. Clearly. 


So now, close to 4 years after it all ended, she's back in my dreams. She was even in a dream WITH my current boyfriend where I was struggling to choose between them. But there is no choice here, I haven't spoken to her in years and don't plan on it. Apparently she's got her own thing going now and is engaged or something, and that whole thing was a terrible idea anyway because we were clearly a bad match. *Amour Fou*. 


It's not like I think about her. Or I don't try to. A year or so went by without a dream about her. I was actually more torn up about the last break up before this relationship, and that person took over my thoughts and dreams for a while. But without fail, she's back. And I don't like the feeling that I still care about all that. 

Can I get rid of her? Cleanse her from my thoughts and brain and just forget? Because the sound of her voice in my dreams makes my heart jump when I think about it. I don't like it, and it just makes me want to hug my boyfriend so tight and hope he never has to know that this is what my brain does. He deserves my full attention and focus.",20Sep2019,0

Some of the stuff he says can be taken alittle wrong but he is just joking around.  I showed my best friend some of the things he has said just to get her opinion on what she thinks and she thinks it's a bit creepy.

So last night we had our second date and I already told him sex was not on the table for that date cuz I wanted to take things slow and not rush anything. He grumbled alittle bit about it but said he understands. So the date was going good and at the end of the night he kissed me good night but then says ""give me your hand"" and grabs my wrist. I pulled away and said no but I know what he was trying to do. He was going to try and force me to touch him. Then he kissed me again and this time wouldn't let me pull away saying ""I love kissing you"".

627,"I love my best friend to death. I’ve known her for over 3 years now, but there’s some things about her that bother me. 

1. She makes me feel stupid a lot. For example, today, I confused stick and automatic cars. Instead of being like oh it’s fine (cause I’m 15 and have barely driven, and she’s driven a whole lot), she calls me dumb and makes it clear to everyone around us that I said something not correct. 

2. She can be really mean. We will sit on the floor before class starts and as other people walk, she will often comment on people’s looks. “Ew, she has a lot of acne” or “his hair is so awful” or “she’s not pretty at all” and I’m just like okay well keep it yourself. She also constantly comments on other girls cellulite and parts of their body they’re probably insecure about (not to their face, but still)

3. She fakes depression. I know people with actual diagnosed depression, and what she says does not match real depression. She acts all bubbly and happy at school, and she says “when I go home the depression starts to come” like girl depression doesn’t just come and go. She’s so extra she even had her mom get her a therapist for her “depression”. And literally she shows no signs of depression whatsoever, and she never talked about her “depression” since then. 

4. She can be extremely deteriorating. For example, when she came to my house once, she goes “no offense, but your house is like so small compared to mine! Yours is immediately living room then immediately kitchen then immediately dining room! And your room is so small compared to mine!” Like okay I get it your family has more money than mine but you don’t have to do it. It’s not just me, she literally TOLD me that she felt better after seeing her crush’s house because it was smaller than hers. Like wow ok. 
She’s also like “wow I have a really good ass, yours is small tho but it’s ok” and it’s just so annoying.

5. She once told someone a super top secret secret that I specifically told her to NOT TELL ANYONE. it’s about my family that I’m struggling with. A few weeks later my other friend asked me about it, so I was pissed 

6. She talks shit about my mom a lot. Like I get it, most kids complain to their friends about their parents (I do too), but I’d NEVER talk about my friends parents they way she has talked about my mom before. 

7. She always talks about herself. We ride the same bus, so whenever she gets on I have no chance to say anything because she just wants on and on about herself and when I try to actually say something about my day she ignores it. It doesn’t happen all the time but it’s happened enough times for me to be bothered by it. 

Anyways there more stuff that I’m not gonna get into, but what do y’all think I should do? Should I confront her about it or what and what should I say",20Sep2019,1
628,"So I need to add a bit of context to this.

When I was younger I was bullied a lot. I was skinny and admittedly a bit weird, but I don't think I deserved what I got. This lasted 7 years, and I got depressed over it. I made 2 attempts on my life in that time by rope. Then I moved school and things got better, I managed to get a girlfriend too and I was taking care of my health, but was still skinny. I loved her a lot, but it took me too long to realise that she was a manipulator who totally lacked empathy. I learned this when I started uni and she started shagging her co-worker directly after our breakup. 
The breakup seemed easy for her, but I had all my emotions invested. I didn't trust anyone like I trusted her and I hated myself and her for what happened.
I went back into depression, started cutting and made the decision to leave uni as I wasn't enjoying it anyway and felt worthless being so expensive toy parents. I decided to make a career through a different route.

I came home but I was still messed up. I made 2 further attempts on my life by slashing my left wrist and other vessels and sitting in a warm bath. There was a lot of blood both times, but I lived again. 4 months later I had gotten out of my depressive, dark chapter and I looked I to work. I had good grades as I had always worked hard in school which let me get an internship in accountancy. I love it, I work with great people and my work has great variety. So now, overall 7 moths from my breakup, I'm happy for what feels like the first time in over 10 years, and I love it.
I should also mention that this whole time, what kept me going all this time was bodybuilding. I gained 24kg from my old skinny self and when I had nothing and noone, I still had that.


So now for the situation, I'm happy now, I have friends, I have a great job with future prospects, I'm very fit and take care of myself, don't smoke, drink responsibly, and overall in this position I feel extremely lucky to have almost thrown it all away, but still have everything.
However, the years of bullying and isolation, whilst in a single sex school means I now just don't know what to do with girls, and I'm not in a position where I regularly interact with new people.

630,"Basically when I was 9 and again just over a year ago, i was sexually assaulted by two different people. Growing up this made me quite the introvert. Certain TV shows and films can trigger me to react certain ways, get scared and feel really unsafe. I’ve tried therapy to deal with everything as a result of this but all they seem to do is try and change your way of thinking. Here is my issue:

Honestly the way I react to things is starting to annoy me. I’m angry about it. I’ve researched a lot about what people can go through after this kind of trauma. I already know I’m very self aware, knowing exactly what I’m thinking and why, the triggers and even chemicals. I can’t just change my way of thinking because of it do therapy would be useless. I need something to change but in a weird kind of way I’m too smart for my thinking to just change from therapy so it annoys me. When I start freaking out and have a panic attack it’s like two sides of my head clashing and overwhelming me. Like ones freaking out and the other knows why.

He has an expectations that I am going to drop my life and move back home to take care of him.   


Basically he called me, told me he had cancer, told me he is buying me a plane ticket home and that's that. My father has not been kind to me as far as living with him goes, and is very misogynistic. If I am around he will not pick up after himself, do dishes, anything, 'there's a woman in the house and she best be doing her job' is  generally his demeanor.   


Everyone that I have talked to has sided that me going would enable him to treat me even worse and prevent me even further from becoming stable. My s/o would not be able to move back with me either. I have a brother who is capable to help my dad during illness and I know that my dad doesn't need me there he just wants me there.   


His illness is in really early stages, the doctors are pretty sure that things are manageable, so it's not like he was given just a few months to live or anything. Sorry if I seem like I don't care about his illness, I do, I'm just focused on myself because regardless what happens I need stability.

  
The only real responsibility I have is my pets, he won't be capable I understand that. So this is where I need real help, do I have any options? I have some money??

  
My dog is a handful he's a chihuahua mix, and my 2 cats. I need to find someone else to take care of them until I can move them here or have a better home situation I can get them into. I really just need time so I can avoid going back home and being sucked into leaving my job and new life.   


TL:DR Dad is controlling about my life, moved away to get away. Now he has cancer and will do anything to get me back, he will use my pets against me if I can't find another situation for them in under 2 weeks. I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK. What can I do for my pets?",20Sep2019,1
642,"Just got my 5th injury of my college career and I don’t know how much more I can handle. 

I’ve been running since freshman year of high school and distance running weirdly clicked for me right off the bat. I managed to scrap together very impressive times in first 6 months of running. Fast forward to senior year and I ended my high school career with good but not amazing times. I ultimately chose an out of state D2 university that didn’t offer me any scholarship.

I’m now beginning my junior year and after paying full out of state tuition for 2 years I finally get a scholarship, for about 750 dollars a semester. Considering I lost my whole cross country season last year and missed loads of track races due to injuries, my coach told me that until I can make it through a season without injury, he’ll consider me for a higher scholarship. 

Spending my summers away from home and not working full time, with the sole purpose to train in order to achieve my personal goals and help myself and my family finically, I’m failing. Miserably. Every day of injury I wake up in my house with my teammates and just feel like a failure every single day.

Between the ages of 14-20 running has been my entire life, I’ve been 100% dedicated to this sport and it just isn’t paying off. I don’t really have any other hobbies and haven’t made true friends outside the team in college. I feel trapped but don’t know if I have any other paths to choose. 

Anyone experience anything like this, if so how did you ultimately deal with it?",20Sep2019,1

644,"Hi Redditors, I recently started a vegetable farm business with a married couple. The land is theirs and mostly already functional to grow and sell veggies. They've had this land for a few years now, but seriously needed to develop the business side of things, and that's where I come in. We agreed to split profits equally between the three of us. 

So I went ahead and made the logo, menus, website and all design related promo materials (biz cards, swag etc.). I also purchased equipment like LED grow lights, seeds, and grow equipment. My total expenses (not including my time invested) amounted to about $4000. 

We're only about 2 months into this business startup, but as life throws curveballs, my SO got a job in another city and I have to move with him. I broke the news to my biz partners and they seemed very understanding but also very sad. We talked about how to move forward and they said they'd buy back my $4000 expenses (they keep all the assets on their property), and that they'd continue the business by themselves. Now since we're only 2 months in and not making much money yet, we haven't signed any legal papers to be a legal business yet. The only thing we have with all three names together is a sole proprietorship bank account. 

A month and a half has passed and it's starting to feel like they're ghosting me. For example, they take a week to reply my messages to meet up and finalize things, or they keep rescheduling. They also use excuses like they've had no signal or forgot to charge their phones for days. Today they finally replied and said they could make payments at about $40 to $80 a month, which would be about 5 years to pay off. My concern is if there is anything I can do to hold them to this agreement, since it feels like \~5 years for $4000 is a long time. Especially since I'm moving away and no longer in close contact with them. The husband has even stopped replying my messages and only the wife replies. Any advice on how I can protect myself and get as much money back as I can? I'm not sure what collateral I can get from them either. Thanks!",20Sep2019,2

646,"For about a year my friend group (All F19) and I (F19) things have felt different. Theres five of us and I've known them all since middle school and we have been really close even with myself and one other friend in the group moving. We would at least meet up once a month and we still so but least year one of our friends passed away. Most of us were there for all of it and I stay closest with one friend compared to the others I guess because of it. 

Anyways one friend moved over two hours away so the whole group has felt uneven since then she does come to visit but it doesn't feel like she wants to be there. One friend got in a relationship but makes some time for us. Another friend had a rougher time with it and has been in and out of hospitals. I was the only one in  the group that attempted to contact her when she would go missing she has told me that she feels that the group no longer cares and that when we do meet it feels sort of mandatory and not the same. 

I am very much attached to these people and do not want us to break apart because some sort of communication issue or something. Others had told me that this is a part of growing up but I dont think i should have to lose my friends to grow up. It is genuinely more than some petty teenage issue and I do not want to lose these people.

647,"So first, back story.

She was hired to my department a few days before christmas alongside another guy. I was assigned to train them for a week. During said week, I noticed subtle signs that I associate with flirting. She is fairly my type, but I keep it professional and just train them. Within a weeks time, we start hanging out outside of work, and I even give her a ride home a few times. On one occasion we go to a bar where she makes an advance and we end up sleeping together.

A few weeks go by and we are casually hooking up. During said time I find out some details that make me realize that I do not want to pursue things further and I slowly cut her off. The final time I even gave her a ride home was just before February.

A month and change goes by, during which time the few mutual friends I introduced her too are all wondering, and actively investigating, why I cut her off and how I could do that to her. I keep those details private from them, as it was none of their concern tbh. But I was not hiding the fact that I had disdain for her and was ignoring her on ALL occasions

Now for the incident in question

Around april, I am working in a separate department from hers, but still under same management. We are short staffed this, but my department is critical and must be manned at all times. She saunters in and politely asks for assistance with a task. I ignore her and keep working. She giggles and continues in a playful mannerism to try a cajole me into helping her. Even tries tossing in a sexual innuendo (im the only one who can get it done right). After a while she explains what she needs help with, and I break my vow of silence and tell her that's is not a task you need my help with, and continue my work. I go to collect some supplies from a nearby supply room....and she follows me it.

Once I realize she did, I try to turn around and avoid her but she then spreads her arms out wide to block my exit and is now demanding to no why im not talking to her or even trying to help her. I put myself on repeat and just continue to say ""can you please let me pass""

She refuses.

It takes another employee coming in to gather supplies for her to break loose her grasp on the wall, btw said employee was startled and immediately turned around, enough for me to be able to slip passed rather abruptly.

To make matters worse, a few minutes passes by. Maybe a half an hour or so. Im carrying out my duties, and my department director calls me down to her office. I explain that im busy in this critical site, can she wait a few minutes. She declares she can not. I arrive in her office after the current assignment I had.

My director and the girl are sitting in the office chit chatting. I immediately felt the fiery flames of the hell that is my rage start to flicker.

The conversation started as a PSA in that I, the senior member of the team, need to show better leadership and assist the newer members when they ask for assistance, and that to deny them is poor workmanship. I rebutle that I am doing the work of 2 men in a department that is not only critical but also understaffed. If I leave, my work that is vital gets left undone and waits for me upon my return. She interrupts me to say that it is fine, I can leave for a few minutes to help out a staff member

Side note, it was under my new directors leadership that this clause of the department I worked in became critical and needs to be staffed at all times. I was even given a verbal warning for not adhering to my duties in said department the way she described. I hope my frustration is being felt by this point

I continue to defend my point, and even bring up the fact that almost an entire hour has passed since she (the new girl) was given her directive and she has done nothing but search for help. She has not even attempted it. Does she even know what she needs help with?

My director takes a defensive stance, as though I attacked her personally and now make her directive a mandatory order, aka do it or get suspended.

Those flames just got stoked.

At this point, we are both getting verbally loud, but I decide ill do it but im not going to be quiet.  I want my frustration heard and felt. At this point, one of my directors assistant managers gets involved. Without knowing the back story, he gets loud and boisterous and in my face. I get equally loud and remind him you are allowed to direct my actions toward the company goal. Don't confuse that with being disrespectful towards me as a human being. (mic drop) My director was not pleased and informs me that after this, I will need representation in the office to discuss disciplinary actions. (whatever)

Upon arriving at the area in question, we all overlook the assignment she so desperately needed help with. ITS NOT EVEN A FUCKING 2 MAN JOB. IT WAS A FUCKING QUICK SORTING ASSIGNMENT.

The flames have now consumed my soul.

My director has now lost all aggression and tries to calm me down by saying alright we will all help. (nope) She sets us all up (nope) to handle it in an efficient manner (didn't care) but while they do that, I do it. By my self. In the time it took them to set up. And I was very verbal. My director gives me the puppy dog eyes. (by the way, me and my director normally get along very well. she has a maternal touch that I admire) She gets somber, glances at the girl who asked for assistance, and back at me. The assistant manager pulls a homer into the bushes meme. And the girl in questions just looks like a lost child. Its obvious what everyone is thinking, and I cant lie. I felt as though I resembled Akuma, flames resonating and all. I decide to just be quiet and do damage control. We get in the elevator, I force out an apology and let my director know that I do have upmost respect for her and that I regret how I interacted with her during the altercation. She accepts, and admits faults for not fully investigating the situation. I leave the elevator with her and the girl in question, who still looks lost, but is now stuck with what I presumed to be a very disappointed director who wants a word in her office.

its still not over btw.

I take my lunch, go a blow off a shit ton of steam at the gym (hit a new bench press max!) and return to the mountain of work I have to catch up on. While doing an assignment with a client, I see her at the opposite end of the hallway. I ignore her while shaking my head, and now she decides to go off at the mouth.

""yea that's right, shake your fucking head. You aint shit nigga, fuck you anyways""

Im with a client btw

I rebutle, very vocally ""I don't have shit to say to you, do not speak to me, do not address me, do not even LOOK at me.""

Her: ""Yea yea, whatever bitch, im not even talking to you anyways""

Me: ""So stop talking to me. You don't have that privilege anymore. Stop doing anything to do with me""

Client is very amused by the way, treated the whole thing like an episode of jerry springer. Even got curious enough to ask what that was all about. I explain its nothing, I apologize for the abrupt explosion and continue business.

Now my issue is how to proceed. I initially did not want to report this whole incident to HR because I know that once the details of her trapping me inside a room that it is grounds for termination (imagine if a man did that to a woman and what not). She is a young girl, and very stupid though. I have hope she will mature, but she is continuing to be a nuisance at the workplace. I am also in a new position where I dictate instructions for her and she tries to be problematic (pretends not to hear me/understand me/flat out does not comply). Its has left me wondering what the think tanks on reddit can advise me on.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr Met a girl at work, had sex, regretted it after certain details were revealed. Ignored her. She didn't ignore me. She made a simple scenario explosive, got department director upset with me, and also caused a scene with me in front of a client",20Sep2019,1

662,"Hi everyone. First time poster, long time lurker. I'm not sure if this belongs here or not but I really need advice. 

The nudes in question are from October 1st, 2017.

So for some backstory, I have been in a relationship with my SO for almost 6 years now. He once had a friend from a different country who he was close with(they had a flirty friendship before I came along), due to the distance between our countries, I was never worried about her. Skip to a few years ago and I found out that she was trying to talk him out of being with me (Back then he had curbed her). Being the kind of female I was back then I forced them to stop talking and I had him block her on everything and I gave her a piece of my mind. 

The thing that hurt me the most was that me and her were friends. Also that he neglected to tell me about it. Fast forward to today, when I'm accessing one of his USB drives just to see what he had on it. I was expecting some usual stuff, hentai gifs, porn pictures, etc. I'm not the type to judge about porn because meh. So I'm scrolling through the pictures when I hit about 5 or 6 pictures of a real female body. Just by itself.  In my head I'm just like 'Okay, that's not me.'

I scroll to the next one and lo and behold, there is Lea(not her real name). I immediately check the source code of the picture and it was placed into the folder at 3:38 am October 1st, 2017. At this point in our life, I was about months pregnant with our daughter.

I suppose this is where I ask for advice. Due to it being so long ago, do I even have the right to be mad? Should I confront him about it? He's turned things like this against me in the past but even so I love him and I want to make this work. 

What should I do? Any and all advice is welcome, Thanks.

Then I got up to do something and came back and sat on a chair that was diagonal from her and noticed he was doing the same thing but she wouldn’t turn her head that much and her eyes would be looking my direction and when I’d look towards her she’d do the same thing as before. Could she have been procrastinating or does it seem to be more than that?

But we just keep fighting. He does things that frustrate me, I do things that frustrate him. 

The big things from my end are that he makes everything a joke and it's very difficult to seriously discuss anything at all. Also his parents are constantly involved and trying to control things and no matter how often he says he will set boundaries he never does. 

And on my end I'm a mess. I don't live up to his expectations either and I'm sure from his perspective it would be that I don't like his family. I do like them, but I'm vocal about how they frustrate me so I'm sure it reasonably looks to him that I don't. 

But we can't reconcile any of this. We haven't been able to for all this time. And I just can't do it anymore. Both for how I feel invisible and like he doesn't really care or believe how I'm doing but also I don't want to be another string pulling him in some direction. 

But I don't know still. I don't know if leaving him is right or not. It's not working, but I also love him so much. I feel like despite him being my perfect match in every way that I also took too long to end it because the other parts are large enough thorns it would never have worked out.

The woman reaches out to someone by text message asking for help saying her boyfriend is attacking her, choking her, throwing her around. He broke down the door to the bedroom to get after her. That person she texted comes to the house and sees that the woman is hurt. The woman who went over to help was the boyfriends sister, who the victim had a close relationship with, which is why she texted her asking for help. She has many injuries, including ones to her face and her temple was dented in, she was unconscious. Both the abuser and the friend do not call for help, but decide to monitor the victim as she was still breathing. She never regained consciousness and is deceased the next morning when they wake up. They call 911 and she’s pronounced dead. He did not call 911 for 24 hours until after she was dead. 3 people witnessed the victim in the bed, covered in bruises and cuts, and unconscious, while she slowly died. (ME has to still determine time of death). Cause of death blunt force trauma to the head and a brain bleed. He is currently only charged on assault and battery. He had a dangerousness hearing and was not given bail. He has an extensive criminal history, and two previous restraining orders against former girlfriends, which he strangled one of them. The perpetrator is claiming self defense, and that they had got into an argument about him messaging girls on facebook. He said ""he let her take her aggression out on him"" but then defended himself, and she fell and hit her head, causing the brain bleed. The defense argued he had no cuts on his hands, which proves he didn't attack her.

QUESTIONS:

Do you think this will be a murder 1 charge? Or what charges do you think are possible in this case?

Will the friend be charged for not doing anything? Not calling 911? The friend did not want the male to get in trouble so decided to keep an eye on the victim.

Could previous abuse in their relationship and the guy not stopping when she was asking him to stop show premeditation?

Can the medical examiner determine if the blunt force trauma was caused from a fall, or an object, or his fists? The DA said she has messages where he explicitly stated he is smart enough to not use his fists. He has a history of head butting former victims.

What else do you think they could determine from the autopsy? Can her other wounds and bruising counter his self defense. The defense is claiming an accidental death..

Please feel free to comment on anything, and read news articles about the case. It made national news and articles are easy to find.

666,"Matched with a really dope guy on Tinder a few months ago. We both game and looove edm festivals. The vibe is great so far and the attraction is def there.

The thing is, he’s an attorney while im now barely leaving an 8 year food service job for something better. I’m probably just being stupid, but I’m really worried about what his friends and family would think about it. Like, he’s got his career and path all figured out and I still feel aimless.

What do you think?",20Sep2019,1
667,"i guess basically the advice i’m seeking is how to cope with these issues i’ve been dealing with.

to begin with this year seems to have been the year of rejections for me i’ve never had such an immensely hard time in dating so i feel like that has had a huge impact on me emotionally. furthermore my brother who i am extremely close with just left for uni in another province (I’m canadian) that’s struck me pretty hard and what makes it worse is my parents seem to forget they still have a second son and since he’s there on scholarship all they ever talk about is him. it seems so painfully rare that i get asked if i’m okay or told they’re proud of me and if, on the off chance, it does happen i feel like they aren’t genuine. i was told by my friend to talk to my parents about this so that’s what i’ll do but if anyone has any suggestions on dealing with feeling like you’re extremely inadequate i’d be open to hearing it. 

i’ve also struggled with talking to my friends about this since i have feelings for one of my best friends and we already discussed it and realized the feeling is not mutual even if it was though we shouldn’t date that would be so bad for the group. 

it all just sucks this year has been brutal, not to mention i didn’t even get in the classes i wanted even though i tried so hard, so now because i’m not full time i’m off my parents medical plan!

sorry for the long post i just had to get it out. any advice is welcome for dealing with the issue of feeling inadequate.",20Sep2019,1
668,"He is in college and over 18, so nothing illegal is going on that I could report it and shut it down, but I'm worried it is going to ruin his chances of getting a job. Last time I checked, I don't think butt pics and videos of him using toys are something desired in employees

I realize I might be sounding like a bigot about him claiming to be trans, but I just think he's using this account to get attention, and that the trans thing is just another extension of that.

What should I do to show him that he could mess up his future if he keeps running this account?",20Sep2019,1
669,"The situation is a bit tricky to explain but i'll do my best. A good friend of mine and I got into a string of bad fights and have decided on seeing a counselor. Obviously this is a tad unusual as typically non-romantic friends dont tend to see a counselor together and I feel that the question will arise as to whether or not we have romantic feelings for each other. 

The issue is...I genuinely don't know. To my understanding she doesn't or at least didn't have any romantic inclination towards me, and I guess I just kind of let that answer itself. But now that i'm thinking more on if I do, I really don't fully know. I think at the end of the day i'm okay with either situation; i'm okay with there not being any romance and i'm okay with there being romance. But I suck with words and I was wondering on how I could best say that.

672,"I am sitting in front of my computer right now still baffled from what happened yesterday and unable to put it to words.

I am a junior at a large school and I hang out with one particular frat mostly since my boyfriend is in it. I am not in a sorority. Most people in and around the frat know who I am and some of them have a history of spreading bullshit rumors about me. I thought sororities were supposed to have the gossip and drama!!!

I'll get straight to it. Yesterday night we were at the frat house with my boyfriend and I was taking shots with a girl I had just met, having fun and getting drunk. During, a guy we'll call ""Hanoj"", apparently told my boyfriend two bullshit rumors that I cheated on him once and attempted to cheat on him. I will include the bullshit rumors at the end if you are interested in that part too.

So there I was standing outside the frat house with people everywhere, a lot of sorority girls and majority of the brothers. Thursday night, I know LOL. Anyways. I had been drinking for a good 6 hours, my speech was considerably impaired, and I didn't even know why my boyfriend and Hanoj brought me outside about. They first asked me about the CT story, and I was explaining what happened that night and but my boyfriend was already furious. He was already convinced I had cheated. Then, to make things worse, Hanoj said he'd be the ""mediator"" and took my boyfriend somewhere else to talk privately. Wasn't the whole purpose of bringing me here was to confront me??? Also, that's not how you mediate, idiot!! My boyfriend came back yelling ""Why didn't you tell me about any of this!"" ""Why, why?!""

I was like ooooooooooh shit. Shut the fuck up. Everyone and their mother is here and **I didn't fucking cheat on you,** idiot!

I couldn't do a good job of defending myself. Which was honestly because I knew I wasn't guilty so it was just like, bruh I didn't do that. I tried explaining but then I got overwhelmed, I started walking away because I was done with their bullshit and I was SO DRUNK. On my way out, people heard what my boyfriend was saying and someone asked me if I was okay. I said yes, I kept walking, I wanted to go to a private space with my boyfriend to speak. He followed me, and now he was yelling at a volume everybody at the house could hear! 

***""Where are you going? Are you ashamed? That's what fucking happens when you cheat like that!""***

With that, all of his brothers started cheering for him and chanting. I walked away as fast as I could but I could hear their chants the entirety of the time I was walking out and from the outside.

You wanna know something funny? He cheated on me before and I took him back. And there I was the one doing the walk of shame!

This morning he called, apologized, brought me breakfast. We called CT and he confirmed that we didn't have sex, but apparently he took it as I was trying to have sex with him when I told him he could sit on the bed. Holy god, some guys are fucking dumbasses when it comes to interpreting signs. However, Werd still told him that I locked him in his room and stood by his bullshit rumor. My boyfriend's roommate also claims that he saw me walk into Werd's room. To give you guys my side of the story, I don't even fucking remember that Werd was there that night. I wasn't talking to him. This night was months ago, so I don't remember every single detail, and I might have accidentally been in his room for the bathroom or whatever, but I can assure that not a single cell in my body has ever felt the tiniest spec of sexual attraction towards that guy. That I know for sure.

That Hanoj guy is a predetermined asshole. He is so culturally insensitive, horrible to girls and tried to fuck me one day after we had a fight with my boyfriend last year. Him and his friend have fake accounts on Tinder and catfish people for money. So they are not the most honest and trustworthy people on the world. But my boyfriend never stopped to listen to my side of the story!

I am thinking about revenge fantasies. I am a hot girl so I think I should just knee Hanoj in the balls tonight in front of everyone, and then yell: ""Keep making up shit about me and I'll crush the other one too!"" or something like that.

So, I can probably go back tonight. Don't give me the advice to forget about it and move on. I know how reputations work. Everyone that was there that night will remember me with that humiliating story and nobody's gonna care about my side of the story. All because of Hanoj and Werd making up rumors. So, they deserve something worse. SOMEONE'S GOTTA TEACH THEM NOT TO BE AN ASSHOLE TO GIRLS AND PLAY AROUND WITH PEOPLE LIKE THAT SO THAT THEY STOP DOING IT! I don't wanna just move on. I want REVENGE!!!!!

# APPENDIX: BULLSHIT RUMORS 

Bullshit rumor #1: This one has some true components to it. While my boyfriend was visiting his family for a week, I was at a house with some of the brothers and other girls. I needed some rest so I asked one of the brothers (nickname:CT) that lived there if I could lay down on his bed for a little bit. I fell asleep and when I woke up he was standing by the door staring at me. He told me he could go sleep on the couch but I said you can just sit on the bed for now, I will leave in a bit. He insisted that I stayed there because it was late, but then we agreed he would walk me home, so he walked me home and left. THE RUMOR HOWEVER, has it that we had sex that day. ( We didn't )

Bullshit rumor #2: According to Hanoj, on my boyfriend's 21st birthday, I (supposedly) followed one of the brothers (we'll call him ""Werd"") into his room, locked the door behind me, told him ""The door's locked"". Then, he told me to get out of his way and that I have a boyfriend.",20Sep2019,4
673,"So she broke up with me after 3 years a few months ago. Totally deserved, I was an asshole and just didn’t know how to treat her right. It was my first serious relationship (living together, talks about future).

We start talking and hanging again and it was going really well until I asked to be exclusive. She said she has fomo and doesn’t want to miss out if we’re too wrapped in each other. It’s just crazy to me because she was head over heels for the longest time. She said she doesn’t deserve how she was treated and she wants to be treated right. She said she’s open to trying again later but she doesn’t know right now.

I’m obviously heartbroken. She also broke up with me a week before we were moving an hour 30 from my friends and fam. I’m stuck here now while she lives a minute away with friends all over here. I wish I could blame her for doing that but I just can’t because of how i was to her. 

I’m just working on myself and what caused it but it feels like I’ll never have that connection again. I would give pretty much anything to go back to the bond we had and the times we shared together. It makes me wanna die thinking about it 

Do I go out by myself tonight? I’m a good looking guy but idk how comfortable I’d be talking to a group solo. Maybe after a few drinks lol. Do I go to a bar? A club? Idk never done it before but can’t just sit at home.",20Sep2019,1

678,"I’m 16/m and balding runs in my family. My Dad started losing his hair in his late teens and was pretty much slick bald by the time he was 25 (he had already been married to my mom for 5 years by then). My two uncles on my Mom’s side are bald as well, and they both lost their hair by the time they hit 21-22. My maternal grandfather is completely bald and my paternal grandfather went bald around his 30s but held on much longer than the others (I think he lost it all by the time he hit 40).

At the rate I’m going I’ll basically be looking like George Costanza from Seinfeld when I reach 20-21. My crown is pretty visible and my temples have receded severely. When my hair grows out, the sides are long and thick while the top of my head is thinned and wispy, making me look like a mad scientist. I would’ve started treatment sooner but the drugs and products are expensive and are not something i can afford as i am only 16 and havent started working yet.

I pretty much just dont care if i lose my hair and i wanna just shave it off completely and be totally bald than balding and looking like i have hair like Al from Toy Story.

My mom however refuses to let me shave my head because she thinks i’ll look like some sort of criminal or neo nazi. She hates the completely bald look despite my dad and her brothers having gone through  balding, but i would like to mention that my dad does not buzz his sides down to a 0. He’s always had a small amount of hair on the sides and the very tip top of his head and my mom asserts that she isn’t any less attracted to him and that she doesn’t mind balding.

Unfortunately i have already been told that my hair looks awful, even being recommended by my male teachers to just take the plunge and shave it off and that i’ll feel way better. Even girls that ive talked to said that i should just rock the bald look, as my crush admitted that the reason she wont go out with me is because of how my hair looks and that she thinks i should go bald as i apparently have a decent enough head for it.

My mom however has threatened that she will kick me out once i hit 18 if i were to shave completely and even quoted George Carlin by saying “if you want to be bald, then just wait a while.”

I am very upset because i feel i will have much more confidence with a shaved head than i do now with the way my hair currently is. How do i convince my mom that shaved heads are extremely common in this day and age?",20Sep2019,1

Some background: I'm an 18 year old male and I've just started university, I don't have any history of mental illness and I've never really had any self harm thoughts in the past. I also have a very minor tic on the left side of my face (idk if that's important or not but I thought I'd mention it) 

Basically over the last few weeks or so I've become increasingly obsessed with taking out my left eye. I've found myself fantasizing about it when I'm doing idle things like driving or showering. The main reason I haven't done it yet is because I'm trying to prove to my parents that I  independent, and I never worry about it hurting or losing half my vision when I'm having these intrusive thoughts. I had a panic attack last night and I ended up hitting my eye a few times and I'm having a bit of trouble seeing out of it now, and I'm starting to get worried that I'm actually gonna take my eye out. I don't want to go to a doctor or my parents because I'm scared they'll think I'm lying or looking for attention. I really don't want to lose my eye, any advice for how I should avoid thinking about it?

682,"Last weekend I spent time with someone who was at one point my absolute dearest friend, the person who I thought I could trust most.  They became especially important in my life when I was having family difficulties and mental health troubles.  But the time I got to spend with them was limited to half an hour because they showed up late and left abruptly, and when I asked the next day they said it was because they felt like the third wheel (I was introducing them to a new boyfriend - they wanted to meet him).  Over the last few months I rarely have been able to talk to them or even text because they just...don't respond, or always leave early.  Before that I had been the third wheel when they introduced me to new friends because I wanted to encourage them to have new friends in their life.  It deeply hurt my feelings to have them say something so blindly....hypocritical. 
They haven't texted me since, and I don't know how to start a conversation.  I've always been the one apologizing, always the one trying to make things better, and seeing that there's not even the slightest effort or interest in mending the situation....I feel like the whole friendship was one-sided.

683,"A few years ago I (23M) went to university in a different city and stayed at an elderly relative's house. This relative had a sort of maid or housekeeper (~30F), with whom I had a normal, even friendly, relationship.

One day I had come out of the shower into my room to get dressed while she was cleaning some other room. I realized I hadn't brought my clothes in earlier and so had no clean clothes in my room (they were left on this chair just outside, by the door). Since she was in a different part of the house, I'd pop outside in an instant to get clothes and drop my laundry bag. As I opened the door I called out her name to say I was going to leave the bag there, only to find that she was actually in the kitchen directly facing my bedroom and had turned her head on hearing me call. Mortified, I completely froze for a couple of seconds before awkwardly completing my sentence (she simply replied, ""Okay"" and turned back around), leaving the bag and getting back in the room.

I think at the time I just mentally blocked this as an embarrassing accident and tried not to give it much thought. We both acted normal around each other the next few times she was there (my relative had come into financial trouble some time before and couldn't afford her services as regularly, so she had already announced she was quitting within a set date before this), except for an instance where she came into the room despite my asking her to wait a minute when she knocked--I wasn't undressed, but was startled given the previous incident. I attributed this to her being in a hurry, but in hindsight, could it mean she thought I'd done it on purpose and had no boundaries anymore?

Recently I read about the harassment of hospitality workers, particularly by exhibitionists, as well as the fear and trauma experienced by the maids and the memory of this incident began haunting me. What if this woman interpreted this as an instance of deliberate exhibitionism and felt intimidated or harassed? The idea that I may have hurt someone like this even if by accident is absolutely destroying me, so that I can barely eat and my thoughts range from revolting to downright suicidal. Should I contact this person and talk about this? The story took place over a year ago now and I haven't heard of her since she stopped working at my relative's house. I graduated shortly afterwards.

I realize this sounds absolutely ridiculous, but please don't ridicule me. This is sincere and a very real concern for me as I'm prone to extreme bouts of anxiety. I originally posted this on a more specific sub, but the issue hasn't left my mind and I'd like to get some more opinions.

TL; DR I accidentally flashed someone over a year ago and am afraid I may have harmed them and that they believe I'm an exhibitionist creep. I'm extremely anxious, and disturbing, sometimes suicidal, thoughts abound. Should I contact this person to talk about it?",20Sep2019,0

685,"So I had a bank account with Key Bank a few months back that I ended up closing for questionable actions on their part. 

I had the account open for over a year while living in one state, when I moved last year to another state, the quality of the bank changed DRASTICALLY. I enjoyed their bank because they have a hassle free account with no fees or charges where you could deposit money and just leave it alone - my one goal. 

However, with my new move from a small town with very helpful associates and update to the largest city in my current state, it seems like they don’t really give a fuck. 

On 2 occasions they’ve refunded money I received from Cashapp to the sender. I do a lot a high end designer/antiques sales so the money they refunded to customers ended up being $600 and $360. The customer didn’t request a refund on behalf of Cashapp and there was no reason for it, the money just went into my account, sat there for a few days, and then was sent back it of the blue a week later. They made the process of me getting my money back INCREDIBLY hard and more or less treated me like the biggest burden on the planet for a mistake THEY made. When I contacted Cashapp they said there was nothing they could do about the situation and I would have to contact my bank or the customer. In the case of the $360 customer, she acknowledged that the money was returned to her and just paid me again. The $600 customer however completely ignored me as she already had her item. It took a month of me calling customer service, going into the bank (where they pretended they didn’t know what I was talking about), and threatening to speak to a higher up for them to even consider giving me a $600 credit and “starting the investigation”. 

The last straw was when I entered a giveaway for a company where 1 winner was to be chosen to win a $200 art bundle. You were only supposed to be charged 1. IF you won and 2. it was only supposed to be $13.99 in shipping fees. That’s the point of the giveaway, you get a free item. The company ended up charging everyone who entered the full $196.77 for the bundle and gave one away (which I highly doubt). They also waited 3 weeks to send out the item which eliminated the people who got scammed from sending it back in their 21 day return/refund period. This was NOT part of their rules and I contacted my bank IMMEDIATELY for them to halt the transaction and explained everything thoroughly. I sent them the link for the giveaway, screenshots of emails with the rules, and pictures of hundreds of people complaining of the scam. They assured me I’d be getting my money back in mid July - in August I got a form saying they would not be able to help me and the credit for the $200 they’d placed was taken out. I closed my accounts then and let them keep the money.

That was in mid June and I JUST got the paperwork they sent regarding the $600 transaction, which they credited me for, saying that I needed to pay $600 to them as I had not given sufficient proof for their investigation. The investigation where I sent in paperwork, tracking for the sale, the conversation I had with the customer, Cashapp saying my bank had refunded the buyer, etc. they had EVERYTHING and just decided to be their incompetent self I’m assuming. 

Anyways, what will happen since my account is already closed? Do I have to pay it back? If I don’t will they do something to me?",20Sep2019,1

696,"So, every morning before school I have this choir thing for around an hour, and on the seating plan I got put in the very back row (there are like 9 rows of people). I hate sitting in the back, I get so distracted that way and it's even worse when you're in a class of over 150 people.

698,"Snapchat memories brings up posts from “a year ago today”- that kind of thing. For a long time I had memories shut off because seeing pictures from my past hurt more than it made me smile. But I got over it all- it’s been more than two years since my ex an I- and it was a short(but harmful) relationship so It doesn’t hurt anymore. I love my boyfriend. I met him after I worked through everything and I was happy by myself and I’m happy with him. I think i’m going to marry him. But I turned my snapchat memories on a couple months before I met him, because I like to see me and my friends (even though my ex was in the pictures). I wasn’t keeping it a secret from current bf, I just didn’t think about how weird it was to see my ex “two years ago today”.  He saw that I had a pic of my ex in my memories and it made him really sad and anxious and it makes sense. But should I delete all the pictures? Should I turn memories off? I have no emotional attachment to the pictures necessarily but its a part of my past and a part of why I am who I am. I explained to my current boyfriend that the pictures don’t mean anything. He seemed to believe me but it still makes him uncomfortable to have pics of my ex on my snapchat(theres non saved onto my phones camera roll, just snapchat). What should I do?",20Sep2019,1
699,"There is a coworker who keeps making advances on me. I’m a straight male and he’s a gay man. Whenever he sees me at work, he calls me a name like “cutie” or “handsome”. He’s always finding something to say about my appearance. It’s starting to annoy me and I’m not good at confrontations so I don’t know how to tell him to stop. 


Whenever we work together, he always finds an excuse to touch me, like rub my arm as he’s walking by, or go out of his way to put his hand on my shoulder when he’s talking to me. I don’t like this and don’t like anybody touching me. He does this constantly.

Finally, he added me on Facebook despite me not knowing or talking to him much. I wouldn’t add anybody I’ve barely worked with, especially when this guy just started a month or 2 ago. He literally went to the roster to look my full name up and searched me on Facebook and we have no mutual friends. I did not accept his request and he asked me why. I told him I like to keep my work life and private life separate, but he took it as a joke and said something like “oh I seee, you just don’t like me that’s why you don’t want to add me”, then he told me he tried looking for me on other social media and couldn’t find me.


This made me change all my social media information to make me harder to discover. Now 2 weeks later, today, he added me on other social media platform. I checked his friends list on both Facebook and the other app and he hasn’t added anybody else from work.


I find this really invasive since I told him I don’t want to add him on Facebook, and he didn’t take the hint and still went searching all through other social media to find me.


I’ve spoken to another coworker about this and was told that he has already been talked to for behavior like this from someone else.

I ask people when they match with me to specify what they are looking for and if it is a hook up, add them to say, snap chat and I guess try to find a time to do the deed.

But several people have been having the same behavior and is confusing the hell out of me.  About 4 of them have always dodged the time to actually try to do it multiple times over the course of a month, and when I offer to back off if they no longer wish to, they say Im fine and they still wish to have sex but now right at the moment I message them.

Even my friends that hate their jobs are constantly working towards trying to get the job they really want. Everyone I know has some ambition they are striving for or has a job they enjoy. I on the other hand have nothing. My motivation levels are at about 0, I hate my job and I have no clue what I should do with my life. I have anxiety which is crippling at times and i have mild depression. It was very hard for me to start working at my current job where I've been for the last 2 years, and honestly I think the only reason I got through it is because I worked with a few of my friends. I decided to move out at the beginning of this year, hoping it would be the next step in overcoming my anxiety and issues with people. However for the past 9 months I feel like I've been stagnating.

705," I dabble making Youtube videos, but because I don't have time or resources for editing, I pay one of my close friends to do so for me. I asked said friend to do so because they were offering their services on their social media and since I know them it was a natural idea.

The thing is they take rather long to finish content and I think because we have such a close and casual rapport we're both kinda willing to look the other way. But I don't think I can let this go on long term.

I won't just dump them high and dry, because we're still close and I really love their sense of humor and how they tweak that into my videos. But I'm thinking of looking into finding someone else to work on my videos too. Not to micromanage one another, but basically to have two videos in the 'oven' at the same time and keep things more timely as I would like.

When it was time to demonstrate our code, our teachers assistant immediately saw that we had very similar code, but told us that it was fine as long as we did not do it again for future labs. 

My friend decided soon after the lab that he was going to drop the course, which he has now done. However, in my lecture yesterday my professor made a point to bring up our lab policy once again. Of course it goes without saying that sharing my code was technically plagiarism/cheating and that the system where we submitted our similar codes almost certainly found these similarities. 

The penalties for this could be very very bad and I’m stressing out because nothing has actually happened yet. I know I’m an idiot for sharing my code, but it’s already done so I’d appreciate advice.

713,"This is a crazy story and I have no one to talk to about it. 20 years ago on New Year's Eve of 1999, to the disapproval of my parents, I was talking to people in an AOL chat room. I was a sad, depressed, and lonely 14 year old who started talking to a 16 year old from New York. I lived in Oregon. I asked him to be my boyfriend and he surprisingly said yes. He started e-mailing me from school and we bought phone cards so we could call each other after I racked up $100's in long distance phone bills and was grounded for a long time. We mailed letters and cards. We broke up, we got to back together numerous times. When I was 18 years old I got pregnant and told him I wished he was my baby's daddy. We made plans to be together but being 3,000 miles apart was a big obstacle. When he got a girl pregnant it put a big wedge in our plans since we both now had a child and were unwilling to move away from our families. We remained best friends for years. Fast forward to 2011 and we had gotten back together but I met a guy where I lived and when things started getting serious we broke up for the last time. I ended up marrying that guy in 2013. In 2015 I was flying out to New York to visit my grandparents. I was flying in to Rochester which is where the AOL guy lives. We made arrangements to meet up but 3 weeks before I flew out he ghosted me. I was devastated. After some Facebook snooping I found out he got married and figured she was the reason why. Over the last few years I have reached out by phone or text every once in awhile but he never responded. 6 days ago was his birthday and I send him a text expecting no response but to my surprise he responded! I was so excited. We started talking like no time has passed. He told me he was actually going to be in the PNW in a week and a half. I asked exactly where and he said Seattle. I almost started crying because 3 years ago I moved to Tacoma and he didn't know that! He thought I still lived in Oregon. So he will be here 3 days and I plan on meeting him at the airport. I am beyond excited. I still have all the e-mails he wrote and all the letters he sent. I think about him all time. It has been 20 years!! The issue is my husband. He is jealous and not happy about me meeting him. We have been having issues the last few years and he said if I meet him it may cause more problems but it has been my dream to meet this guy for 20 years.

715,"Hi there. I’m 28M and currently live at home with both parents, 2 older sisters and nephew. My father has been retired for 5 years and my mother is about 1-2 years away from doing the same. My sisters and I split the living expenses in terms of rent and bills.  Roughly $2,600 is spent on mortgage and utilities. We split that evenly amongst 3. 

I work in property management and have done so for the past 10 years. The companies I have worked for always offer me at least a 30% discount on rent to move in to the properties I work for. I have never done this because of my parents financial situation. I feel guilty thinking about leaving the burden of a mortgage on both of my sisters. 

On the other hand, my sisters are both 35+ who have decided to live at home and have never moved out. Financially, an additional $500 each wouldn’t ruin them. It would be an annoyance yes, but manageable. 

I have an opportunity to move into my own apartment with a discounted rate. I would love the independence and finally being out on my own. I would only be about 15 minutes from my
current home. But the guilt about my family persists.

717,"Hi Reddit, My name is M. My best friend is A. We’ve been best friends for 9 years. He has liked me ever since he met me, and I developed a crush on him around summer 2015.

I was married from 2012 to 2017. My ex husband was horribly abusive — physically and emotionally, lost our baby, etc. The ex, T, and I separated and moved out in early 2015. He was seeing other women (and from what I understood, sexually assaulted some women as well). A was in town (he works in Seattle) and I hung out with him and mutual friends, we get really drunk and sleep together. He was aware I was separated and of the abuse I suffered with my husband. And now that I think about it, I slept with him because I just wanted to feel loved if only for a little bit.

In 2016, T asks to reconcile and I confess the truth to him because I wanted to be honest and open. He “forgave me” and proceeded to threaten A and my other friends behind my back. We move back in together and things are all good (to my knowledge).

2017, he’s back to hitting me and cheating and berating me for losing our child. I get the courage to leave, pack up after I graduate medical school and move back with my parents while he was at work. I file for divorce. During this time, I reach out to A and I find out about the threats. We talk and we are okay.

2018, I’m in Seattle for work stuff and I message A to come to my hotel while I was drinking at my bar. We go swimming, go drinking, party and then hook up and all that fun stuff. Again, I was grieving the feeling of being loved and wanted (ex-husband called me fat and unattractive).

Late 2018-2019, I visit A a couple times in Seattle at his home and spend weekends. I realize I’m developing feelings for him and I tell him. He tells me that I was super attractive but he isn’t interested in relationships and he wants me to find the right guy and mentions that if I brought up feelings again, he would cut off sex. He also says that he has considered making me his girlfriend before but his work comes first. I accept and understand. It would be absolutely unfair to hold it against him to want a relationship when he did not.

I find out through a mutual friend, that A was telling people I was using sex to convince him into a relationship. (I saw proof in screenshots). I was really hurt and stepped away — obviously I wasn’t supposed to be privy to this info, but I was really hurt that A thought so poorly of me. Especially when we’ve been best friends for so long and I’ve supported him and cheered him on in all the years I’ve known him.

How do I or do I even address that comment he made about me? I’m bothered he feels that way but I wasn’t supposed to know he said that. Please help. I feel like I screwed up my friendship with sex.

TLDR had a divorce, fell for best friend, had sex and found out he said I was manipulating him with my body.",20Sep2019,0

723,"My single mom holds a very conservative belief that children need to respect their parents and it’s fine to ‘take action’ them if they do. She has a short temper and doesn’t listen if it doesn’t go her way. Anytime I make a mistake she blames on my dead dad’s problems, and all her friends’ (neighbors and etc) think the same way for how she approaches things. 

Of course, she tries to feed me or worry about my health in a way how a good mother should, and sometimes if I discuss something she would change—giving me space occasionally and being a better model, she will change. But, I believe these ideas are logical if someone wants to be a responsible person. Though it took me hours over weeks to convince her that she should do so for me. Also, I think she has a hard time emphasizing. She will be brutally honest about her opinions, but, when I do, she will freak out.


The problem with also communicating my opinion is that she doesn’t process what I’ve said until I’ve repeated it 5+ times. This problem is not out of spite; she just fails to understand. She has the same problem with clerks or others explaining how even a policy or time for a meeting works.

I’ve read articles on how to approach short tempered people (directing the conversation to where I want it). But, I don’t know how to approach this problem. 

There is no real way for me to cut ties or even try to become financially independent bc I’m studying abroad.

**I only want an answer on how to deal with the problem mentioned. Thank you.**

The reason why I want to get the aforementioned idea across is that I believe it’s the first step to her respecting my rights as a person, especially since I’m heading to college soon, she may decide to tail me.

727,"So bit of backstory: I found Jenna’s Instagram off her tinder profile, DMed her, we just hit it off and became pretty close with one another. At the time we started talking right up until school started (September), she lived in the town of our college and I lived pretty far away and so we had pretty much just been texting since the start (July). But when school started, we made plans to see each other and since then Wednesday’s have become our date night since we both finish class early and we get time to see each other. Over text, we’ve definitely gotten pretty far (cute, flirty texts, sexting, etc), but in person we’ve yet to share a kiss.  I’m just pretty confused cause sometimes she’ll seem like she’s into me, but then sometimes she’ll just seem like she’s not. Our dates typically are just the two of us in bed, watching Netflix. I’ll always just gently touch her and whatnot, feel up her arm or whatever. And this is where I get confused cause if she wanted it, wouldn’t she reciprocate? But then if she didn’t want it, she’d probably move her arm or tell me not to. And I get mixed feelings from her. I’m pretty shy when it comes to women and I’ve wanted to try and make a move on her and try and kiss her. I saw somewhere that the best way to go about it is just hug her at the end and then hold her for a bit and go in for it, but every time she hugs me goodbye, she pulls away pretty fast and so I don’t bother with it. She’s also been hit or miss over text lately, she just hasn’t been talking all that much since our last date (a couple days ago). Typically she’ll text me fairly often or if she falls asleep, she would text me when she wakes up, but i haven’t really talked to her since Wednesday and it’s just weird since we used to talk like all day everyday since we met.

I know saying “you need to quit” doesn’t work, because it’s not as easy as that. I’ve never smoked in my life so I have trouble putting myself in his shoes. He won’t talk to me about this, whenever I bring it up he changes the topic immediately or just walks away. I know that deep down he does want to quit, he just won’t follow through with it. I’ve always assumed it’s because he just doesn’t want to go through the trouble of giving up an addiction. Is that realistic? Do other smokers feel that way?

He won’t listen to me, which I kind of understand. On one hand, I don’t know what it’s like for him because I’ve never smoked. On the other hand, he’s super stubborn and although he does want to quit himself, he won’t push himself to do it just because I’m telling him to.

​Hi reddit

Im 26 years old and have been in what I would call a relationship that has been too good to be true. When I met my gf, she had recently been in a DUI case and had several before but in the times that we were togetther, including the last month in which we both moved into an apartment together, we have never had issues as far as drinking or driving. She had learned from her mistakes and while we do enjoy each other's company when it comes to drinking or having a nice hit of the ganja, we are relatively relaxed and usually enjoy watching a movie and enjoying each other's company. 

Just this week, she went back to a city for a court treatment (to which her parents did not allow me to go) and got 3 months of court-ordered rehab at a substance abuse facility because she came out dirty for marijuana and benzos. 

I have lost all communication with her and only know what her parents allowed her to tell me when she spoke to me before getting dropped off at the facility (almost sounded like a hostage situation) where she told me that possibly in a month I would be able to see her in person or even communicate with her. She had told me I was going to be on an approved list of visitors and her parents were going to be getting the necessary information and while I have always had a good relationship with her parents, they are acting strangely and wanting to pick up her ""belongings"" at an apartment we both moved into together because she might need them soon. Funny thing is that the only belongings she has are not even on the list of what was allowed at the treatment center (think going out dresses, heels, etc.). Wasn't this what she decided would be her home?

My gf has had issues in the past but I know she is not a person that belongs in such a facility and I want to do everything to be of assistance and have been writing letters in hopes that she receives them as quickly as possible and as it feels like my other half has been taken away from me. Before she left, we both had our suspicions that her family was egging her on to go and almost wanted her to face some sort of punishment but that could have been paranoia. 

I just want her to know that I am there for her and while she had a rocky relationship with her parents towards the end because they said she did not have to move in with somebody and ""struggle"" (we have always had our necessities, have a nice apartment and were planning our vacation soon) and never offered a helping hand, though they have more than enough means. I never expected anything but it seemesd strange because the months before that she would always stay at my parents or me at her house and we just decided that we could use our own privacy and from there the whole relationship changed.

Do I have any rights as far as finding out what happened with her, should I call and see whether I am on an approved list or what would be the best way to let her know that I am here for her throughout it all? The whole situation seems strange and it is hard enough as it is just imagining what she is going through. Besides the situation with her parents, what should I be doing or focusing on? Is there anything sketchy here or are my suspicions",20Sep2019,1

It's getting worse as time goes on.

I (18F) wasn't too concerned at first coz the feelings of being nervous about things wasn't making me want to change anything. Just a passing faze that teens go through, is what I thought.

Now, I believe its gotten way worse. 

I've made plans with friends that I used to feel fine and excited by. But now as much as I still enjoy the time I spend with them, it's getting harder to handle my nerves. For example, tomorrow I'm driving all of us to the cinema, I've never been to the cinema and it's supposed to be fun and I'm sure it will! But I'm literally started to get chest pains and my muscles twitch if I think about it too much. 

Is this some sort of anxiety? Or am I just struggling to handle my nerves properly? If that makes sense? 

I know that anxiety is a problem where people can't control how they feel about something that may be stressful, but usually I'm fine with stress and can cope with my uneasy feelings pretty well. But it's like those feelings have been enhanced to the point I'm literally getting physical feelings like the aforementioned chest pains and muscle twitching.

742,"Ok, this might be long there’s a lot of info here

So, about a month ago I met this girl on vacation, and we hit it off, like really well, but it was only for one night and we both went back home (on opposite sides of the country) but we have been snapping each other every day since then, we have gotten really close and we want to see each other again in February for a few days. Which is great, although I don’t know what we are, I don’t think we are dating but we also aren’t just friends, we talked about sending nudes and stuff but she doesn’t want to do any of that.

Anyways, recently, I had a lot of girls add me on snap, about 50 or so (I’m not going to specify why, as far as you‘re concerned it just happened) pretty much all of them don’t even live in my country and some of them just started to send me nudes, and my dumbass, thinking with my dick, decided to send some back, now it’s like a regular thing that I can’t stop and I’ve even been FaceTiming and talking to one of them, while also talking to the girl I met on vacation, and I feel TERRIBLE about it and I don’t know what to do, but that’s not all.

There’s this girl at my school that has it in for me, like pretty hard, and I think she’s pretty good looking as well, we’ve never talked but I’ve heard from mutual friends that she is really in to me.

So here’s the question: Do I ditch the girl at my school and the snap girls to focus on the one I got close to but will probably never date (because we are both in school and she lives far away) or do I go for the girl at my school, as we could actually have a relationship, but that would also mean really badly hurting the feelings of the girl I met on vacation, as she is kind of waiting for me until we meet again in February. On top of all this, do I keep talking to the snap girl because #1, I’m not in a relationship, and #2, I wouldn’t be hurting anyone if I did, or should I stop because it feels morally wrong? I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO.

Hello everyone,

I joined Reddit a week ago, I have been really enjoying it, I regret not joining this website earlier, it is really amazing.

I have been really active, commenting and upvoting on the things I liked and found interesting.

I would love to share my work also to see what people think and get some advice and tips on how to get better.

But I do not know why I can't upload pictures of my work, I thought in few days I will be able to but it is still not working, I tried messaging the admins on two subreddits art but I got no answer.

I want to know if there is a limit or something or maybe my account needs to be one month old, I'm not sure, can anyone help me out please and tell me what the rules are and how the system works?",20Sep2019,2
746,"Some of us are lucky enough to have an interest that translates well into a job or career. If you like computers, you can go into IT or programming. If you like numbers, you can go into finance or data analysis. If you like cars or machines, you can go into engineering.

I don't think I'm one of the lucky ones. I used to be into computers, so I went into IT. I also minored in economics because I figured it was practical.  But my interest in technology has vanished ever since I got laid off of my first job and re-evaluated who I am and what I'm really interested in and care about. I don't completely hate my current IT job, but I tolerate it and stick with it because:

1. It pays pretty well, so I'm able to support my fiancee and I while she gets her PhD in neuroscience.

2. We'll need the benefits once we're married in a couple months, as she's on a medication that her insurance through school only covers like 50% of.

And like any job, it has its pros and cons.

These are my hobbies and interests:

* Guitar &amp; Metal/Rock Music
* Parkour &amp; Ninja Warrior
* Basketball
* Hiking
* Snowboarding
* Staying physically/mentally healthy (Meditating / Stretching / Working Out / Eating Right)
* Simple Living / [Hygge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl74ybpyNLk)
* Asian Culture
* Nature and wildlife, especially forests, wolves (and the greater Yellowstone ecosystem), and Komodo dragons

So not much I feel like I can do here. I'm not going to become a professional musician or athlete. I'm not much of a creative writer, so a blog or something about foreign cultures or stress-free lifestyles probably wouldn't be successful. And I'm not interested in going back to school for 4+ to become a wildlife biologist or botanist (I might consider something online).

My two favorite jobs ever were working at a drive-in movie theater and my hometown's road department, mostly doing park maintenance. Other than them, I've had all white-collar office jobs, which just isn't me. I honestly think my niche in the work force is small, simple jobs, and if it can relate to an interest or hobby, then I'm happy. Something like a pet shop or a guitar shop or some non-profit that focuses on nature and the environment. With the wolf being my favorite animal, I think my dream job would be working at a wolf recovery sanctuary like [this one](https://www.wolfeducation.org/) or [this one](https://www.grizzlydiscoveryctr.org/), even if it's just preparing their food and taking care of their habitats, doing their finances, something...  I've actually been to the latter one and it was awesome.

748,So I turned 18 6 months ago and still do not have my drivers license. I have severe anxiety/depression. The BIG thing is money problems. My mom and dad are okay with me hanging out at the house until I figure out what I want to do which is fine but my mom is not the best with money.  (she gives it away to my sociopathic brother that takes advantage of her) Anyway my parents are in quite a bit of debt and I REALLY do not want to be like them. There are times where we don't have food to eat and so on and so forth. I really want to get a job but live out in the middle of nowhere. So there is not really an option of walking somewhere that I work since the nearest place is a gas station like 10 miles away. This money stuff really worsens my depression and anxiety to the point where I cannot sleep at all and usually feel like I am going to have a heart attack. I can't really say anything to my mom about money or she will literally leave the house and not come back for a while. I just need some ideas on how to make some money maybe from home or something so maybe I can buy a car or something like that. Really just need to get on my feet so I can start my life instead of sitting hear rotting away with anxiety. Any help or advice is really appreciated.

749,"So after laying down and turning off the lights, u watch a few YouTube videos to get myself relaxed. But while falling asleep I feel vibrating. Like a subtle tremor of the bed.

I Over analyze every detail of my life, enough to need to plan every detail of the day down to the minute I arrive anywhere and I become incredibly stressed when things go awry (even though I really really try not to). I have to be at least 20 minutes early to anything or I’m a wreck, I freak out if I’m even a minute late, I’m a people pleaser and i feel like I bend over backwards to make people happy even when I really don’t want to. “Flexible” I would call it. Im a serial foot rapper, hand wringer, and leg rubber, so much that my mom would physically grab my leg or yell at me to stop. I can’t sit still for very long, like a clean house and even the pillows being messed up after I get up stressed me out. I like my bed to be made before I get in it or I can’t sleep and I need a lot of reassurance sometimes, having grown up being the middle child to parents who constantly put me down and according to my boyfriend our house looked like a model home, meaning it didn’t look like anyone actually lived there. My mother was the most nit picky person and constantly criticized me and the cleanliness of our house and us. Calling us dirty or lazy or scummy. Everything had to be perfect all the time and we had to be perfect. Couldn’t speak out or up or have any differing opinion then my parents, mostly my mom but my dad wasn’t much better. It all became too much and I started having panic/anxiety attacks in my senior year of high-school after being pressured to NOT go to college (weird right) but ultimately left home. 

Growing up and throughout college I tried to open up and confide in people, but I was always made to feel like what was feeling wasn’t real or invalid or people have much worse things going on, which is true so I just agreed and choked everything down. So much that now when I get upset my throat literally closes and I can’t speak, which is even more frustrating and the cycle continues, and may lead to a panic/ anxiety attack bc I feel like I can’t breath. I tried to talk to my mom about it after I graduated college and she would say stuff like “it’s not a big deal just get over it” or “just stop/ don’t” literally being her answer if I told her I was anxious about something. 

I’ve researched a lot and I feel like I tick all the boxes but only made half way? I currently work as a nurse and I deal with a lot of psych histories and I’ve seen the real textbook extremes and some not so extreme ones but I still feel like I don’t fit in either category. My job is incredibly stressful and I have a hard time leaving work and work and I’ll lay in bed for hours running through my shift, “did I chart this or that or did I call so and so” etc. sleep has been really difficult lately too. I take pretty good care of myself, I work out, I eat health, drink water, take a vitamin, I’ve tired bullet journalling, I do like to read, candles, bathed, I have a weighted blanket. So many things that are supposed to be good and help and yet still nothing feels like it helps.

756,"During the Summer of 2018 I got accepted into my dream school, one of the top rated public HBCUs, with a state wide scholarship that covered 75% of my tuition and a pre paid tuition plan that would cover all of the rest. I turned all of this down and decided to attend community college instead. Now, at this point you're probably asking yourself why. It's a bit of a complicated story but it basically sums up to this: I have extremely religious and overprotective parents who've made it impossible for me to gain life experience of any kind. Most people say their parents are overprotective, but mine have sheltered me to the MAX. For reference, my parents would never let me walk to the park (5 minutes from my house) in my safe, suburban neighborhood for fear of me becoming pregnant or being snatched up. They never let me go to school dances or events, and overall treated me like a child. This led to be being extremely depressed, and once they found out about this they wouldn't even let me get a job for fear that id become too ""stressed"". My entire life has literally been school, home, church, rinse and repeat, and maybe throw in a church event or family trip to spice things up. Now at this point it might sound like I'm ranting, but trust me, I haven't even begun to scratch the surface of the many ways in which my parents continue to and infantalize me. It's so bad that other members of my immediate and extended family have noticed this and commented their disapproval of their behavior. This extremely controlling and volatile situation led to my junior and Senior years of high school being extremely depressing because I had no motivation and nothing to look forward to. I knew what my passions were but was never able to fully develop my skills in those areas because they would only let me partially participate in events. I was in both marching band and drama but could not attend a large chunk of the events for either, because they were all on Fridays and Saturdays, and those are days solely set aside for devotion to God in my faith. This also led to me a) feeling emotionally stunted in comparison to my peers and b) feeling inadequate, because I was not able to truly cultivate the technicial skills I needed to pursue my passions. This eventually led to a dramatic mess taking place at school, resulting in a mental breakdown and an anxiety attack that was still carrying on into the summer when I got accepted. It was so bad that seeing my acceptance letter made me nauseous and hearing my school's song being played in an orientation video made me burst into tears. By this point I had no adult like skills of any kind, and I know that people like me typically flounder in the college setting. We go from having no freedom of any kind to virtually all the freedom in the world and we go crazy. With all that being said, I decided to go to community college for a year and then transfer. Now it will be a year and one semester, and I can truly say that I regret the decision. I decided to stay to work on my mental health, but it has ultimately gotten worse. I now realize that my mental health issues stem from my controlling household and the feeling of being trapped, so spending another year only exacerbated the problem. When I received my acceptance letter for the Fall 2019 term I turned it  down AGAIN because I ""wasn't feeling right"", but in reality that was the sign that I should have left. I am lonely as all hell and I feel trapped and stagnant. While my parents do appreciate the fact that I am looking for jobs now, they still keep me on a tight leash and see any signs of personal growth as a direct challenge to them and to God. For example, skipping worship or challenging any aspect of my faith ends with me being grounded or told that I'm bringing demons into my household. I wanted college to be my first set of ""normal experiences"" before maturing into a full blown adult but I guess not. How do I cope with the fact that I've failed? That I've fucked up and it's too late to go back? That I missed out on things I've longed for my entire adolescence and I'll never experience because they're limited to Fall semester freshmen/underclassmen (like joining the band and certain mentorship orgs)? I'm planning on transferring in the Spring because I truly cannot endure it anymore, but I know that is an extremely difficult thing to adjust to, let alone being a transfer student. I think the way I was raised might have had some kind of pschological affect on me, like an attachment syndrome. Does anyone know how to get rid of this? Any advice would be much appreciated.",20Sep2019,1

So to start off I finally asked out the girl I liked at the time on a date, she said yes but that she didn’t like me that way but wanted to see where things went. Shortly after she changed her mind and said no outright. We’d been friends for ages before this and are still really close friends now. 

Anyway turns out at the same time as I asked her out her ex boyfriend (who did stuff with her (oral sex) and then told the whole school about it, embarrassing her) broke up with his girlfriend and they did stuff again. He then got back together with his girlfriend the next day and completely ghosted my friend out of his life. 

I’m not sure what it is. I don’t like her that way anymore, she’s so nice and we get along so well but I can’t get this out of my head that when all’s said and done she chose the guy that fucked her over and ruined her first year of college instead of me. 

This isn’t one of those posts where I’m secretly ranting about how I would have been a better choice and that it’s all her fault blah blah blah (I’m not that guy).

I was already on the fence about mediacl school, and was just feeling horrible after my first year, so I delayed and delayed until i completely missed teh deadline to submit my supplementary applicaiton for the program. My mom had been bugging me about it, and it felt like she didn't trust me to live my own life (as she tries to micromanage everything). 

I missed the deadline, but i felt so conflicted about this application because my parents insisted on paying for a tutor and people to help me write my essay, which went against the rules of the program, but they justified it by saying that everyone else did that to get in. I felt like i had no choice in order to get into the program, but this violated my ethics and I did not feel right about it..

I got into another dream program, and i should be happy but this keeps haunting me, especially since i am very stressed to do well so i can get into  the infamously hard to get into Canadian medical schools. I am very very stressed about this and in the back of my mind i keep thinking ""fuck, i could have been in that other program"". Even if I find MOST of my classes insteresting, I feel bitter and angry at myself.",20Sep2019,1
763,"So I’m 13 and I feel like I don’t need the friends I have at school. Like there are times where I literally get up from the lunch table and go in the bathroom and eat alone. Mind you I DO THIS OUT OF CHOICE. The more I go to school the more I don’t want anyone to speak to me there. I just want to be alone, this isn’t just for a small period of time. This feeling has been happening for a month and it’s becoming a problem. Like I’ve never communicated well with kids in my grade/age. Like every girl just wants to talk about boys and what they want to do with them and all the boys just like to talk about girls and what they want to do with them. I just feel like I don’t fit into the puzzle and it’s honestly makes me sad. The friend that I have now me and her are drifting apart and she’s blocked me so we’re not talking I’m going to cut her off. I’ve been having the mentality of “everyone is going to die anyway so why do I need others” and it’s not cute. But I can’t help it. HOW DO I HELP MYSELF?!?!?",20Sep2019,1

767,"I’ve been at my job for a long time and have a good job and pay - but for the last two years have had difficulties with a group of women who were transferred to my department.  

They ganged up against me report me tell my boss that I don’t do my job they call me names they make snide comments they spread a rumor that my husband and I don’t love each other and that we cheat on each other. When I confronted them they said that I had probably told people that and I should not tell people about my business. It is just ridiculous. 
They have been so mean to me and the names they called me are beyond.  My boss says it’s a personality conflict and that we all have to get along.


My husband wants me to wait it out at least two more years. We have bills and at that time we may move out of the city.

I do my job I say hello goodbye I talk about work matters but I keep my distance and will sit on the other side of the room.  Today they had a birthday cake for a new girl that came to work with us.  They all sat on one side eating cake and i sat on the other alone doing my work.  I wished the girl a happy birthday etx etc.  but just want to do my job and go home to my family and friends.

I tried to transfer out but my boss said  NO maybe next year.   Im polite but after all the bad things they said to me i can never be more than professionally polite.  Any advixe - its so obvious im all by myself there. I dont mind being alone really but like i said i should stick it out the two years.  Any tips ??",20Sep2019,1

This may be due to my childhood, but I overthink everything and always assume the worst. It gets so bad sometimes that I have to stick to routine to calm me down.

769,"I’m sorry if this maybe sounds stupid, but over the years I think I’ve somehow convinced myself that I need to achieve something extraordinary in my life, and that if I don’t do that, I will live with regret and disappointment.

I’m a senior in high school, gotten good grades during my time in school, and I think I’m fairly intelligent and hard working, but lately I’ve felt this existential roadblock that’s been holding me back.

I was diagnosed with depression a little over two years ago and was diagnosed with ADHD a little under a year ago.  Over this period of time with my mental health issues, I’ve had the opinion that yeah, maybe my brain chemistry isn’t as it should be.  But I also felt like there was some crisis I was experiencing.  I just didn’t know exactly what that crisis was.

Today, I had the realization about my “obsession” with doing something extraordinary, and that it may be the reason I’ve felt so lost for so long.

Does anyone have any advice on how I should handle these thoughts?",20Sep2019,1

771,"This summer I was a camp counselor \[19M\], I have been doing this for the past couple years so I've gotten close with a lot of the kids. My bosses son is pretty much like a little brother to me and I've also become really close with his best friend and his best friend's little brother. The little brother has always looked up to me and would always come to my activities and just really liked asking for my advice. After camp he followed me on Instagram and started to DM me. He's \[11M\] so he doesn't have a phone and this is the only way he contacts me. Now I never initiated any conversations, I would just respond to what he said and would just be super positive and always tell him good job and just make sure he was always getting gassed up. Today, my bosses son told me that the little brother said he was banned from talking to me. Now I always assumed that his parents knew I was talking to him and really don't have much else to go off of other than that he's banned from talking to me. I could really use some advice on what to do because I don't want to come off looking creepy when I'm just tryna be a good friend to the kid. Obviously I'm not gonna send him any messages or anything but I'm just kinda confused on the whole situation. Thanks",20Sep2019,1

What I have been wanting to know is how can I help myself get over trauma? I’ve been heavily abused throughout my life and still to some extent am in a bad position, but I’m wanting to know how I can better deal with this. I tend to have a negative outlook on everything and mostly think about taking my life. I don’t want to, I want to live, but the thoughts and trauma that I’ve had really get to me and most days I feel like I can’t handle it. I don’t have any friends expect for one online who’s having a struggle of his own, so we haven’t spoken much lately either. Just wondering if anyone had advice for me :)",20Sep2019,1

777,"Hello all,

A little background:

I've recently graduated from UC Davis with a bachelor's in Economics and a minor in Political Science. Completed undergrad as of August 2019. My specialization was in Data Analytics and Economic Analysis. I've learned how to use R and STATA and have taught myself Excel throughout the years. 

The problem is, I did not intern nor did I do any kind of research during my two years at Davis. (I came in as a transfer.) My grades were mediocre. However, I have acquired work experience in retail, food and hospitality, and I currently work as a freelance makeup artist to support myself, and have been doing this since 2013 (although I pursued Econ, I still have a high interest/passion for the beauty industry and would ideally like to work for a cosmetic company as a Data Analyst or something related to that role.) BUT, my ultimate DREAM career is to be a film makeup artist.... ha ha ha.

Anyway, I've been very active in terms of job searching on LinkedIn and have applied to hundreds of jobs already, where I've included a tailored resume in each of my job applications. I'm still learning how to 'connect' with others on that platform. I've made my resume as ATS-friendly as possible. I had my undergrad advisor write a letter of recommendation for me, but I am not sure how useful it would be as far as boosting my chances of getting an interview, at the least. 

So far, I've gotten about 5 phone interviews and 2 in-person interviews.

I've enrolled for 2 Coursera certificates - the 'Data Scientist's Toolbox' and  'SQL in Data Science'. I know those two certificates alone will not necessarily boost my chances of getting a job in the data world but I am still curious about the programs.

My problem: I live in Sacramento. There are not many companies I would be interested in working for. Many of the cosmetic companies I want to work for are located in the Bay Area. If offered a position that I truly desired, I would be willing to commute. But for now, I guess my only option is to find experience in Sacramento until I find a desired job in the Bay Area in the field that I want to work in.

Can anyone please give me advice on what I should do and what options I have? I know my options are limited due to the fact that I didn't have much relevant experience. Please and thank you.",20Sep2019,1
778,"Long post 

Backstory: 
In the beginning of this year somewhere around February I asked a girl for her number and instagram (after funnily building up the courage). She gave it to me and we talked about 2 weeks until I confessed I was an addict. She really got sad and told me to stop for her. I was an addict during this time so I said “fuxk that sht I’m not dropping my drugs for her”. Obviously I didn’t say it like that but I told her “I would do that for her”. After I told her all of that she stopped taking to me. After a few days she texts me, asking “why do u ignore me in school”. Honestly I was mad because she didn’t take it like I expected she would. I said “I’m sorry I didn’t know that”, so we talked for a few more days but it wasn’t that much. She then texts me asking to talk it out with her and I said sure. I was mad at her for no reason at this point. (My life wasn’t going right during that period of time). We met up and I told her I wasn’t ready for the relationship and that I’m in a fucked position. After that we didn’t talk because I distanced my self from her. 
*Skipping to the start of this school year*
I finally got sober during the summer. And school started so I fell like my self finally. So in the beginning of school I’ve seen her and I remembered how she made me feel when I was at a really low point in my life. And I found out we had 2 classes together. Durning both classes that we have, we mad eyes contact for a good 5secs until it got to awkward for me and I turned away. I caught her staring a few times and she’s caught me. This is going on for about 2 weeks. The thing is she has a boyfriend now. I think she is with him for 5 months. Not sure. And all I want to do is be with her. For two weeks already she has been on my mind. Only her, and my imagination on how I’m with her. I’d like to approach her but don’t have the courage because of what I’ve said and because she has a boyfriend. I want to tell her that I like her but I just can’t. What should I do. If I walk up to her how should I start the convo. I really need help. It’s pretty hard rn because of school and she’s always on my mind and I can’t have her. I’m staying strong and staying sober because i can’t go back down that rabbit hole.

779,"About 3 weeks ago I started talking to someone on Instagram. We moved kinda over to snapchat and he kinda started pressuring me into sending sexual stuff. I eventually gave in and sent him a picture of me in my bra after saying ""do not screenshot this"". He, against my will, screenshotted it. The day after that happened, I told him straight up that I regretted it and he told me he screenshotted the picture. He said he deleted it but I don't believe him and I am very worried it'll end up in the hands of the guy I have some very serious feelings for.

Be me 25/M divorced.

After a long while eventually fall in love with a girl, girl has a friend who she's known for a really long time who claims he loves her but actions constantly prove otherwise. He finds out about me, confronts me, tells me to back off etc, I explain to him that we have been talking and pretty much told him everything in hopes to give the guy some sort of clarity, turns out that was the wrong call. He exploded and said a slew of awful things about her like ""I don't even want her around my kid because she's a liar"" and ""At least I have other options there's a girl that's been wanting to stay with me anyway."" going on to say a bunch of horrible things about her that are all just extra pointless details and would muddy this post. I was pretty clear with him that what he said I would tell her because she had the right to know, I'm guessing this upset him because when I talked to her and she confronted him he immediately started denying things/twisting my words by taking them out of context, as well as outright lying saying that I said a bunch of things that aren't true, I'm assuming it was some sort of self defense mechanism because he knows deep down the things he said were awful and not something that you say about the person you apparently ""love"".

Fast Forward a bit, she is extremely confused which is entirely understandable because she has known this guy for years and now it's this game of he said/ she said because he wants to be a child and try and sabotage anything between me and her.

I'm going to wait around while she sorts through everything in her head because I think eventually he will make a complete ass of himself again and then maybe things will be more clear for her, I genuinely wholeheartedly love this woman but what I need advice on is how do I handle the pain from sitting by and watching her be a total mess because she doesn't know who's messing with her, that shit hurts alot, it also hurts not being trusted but given the circumstances I can at least understand.

Do I unblock the guy and confront him on his behavior or will that only add more gasoline to the fire?",20Sep2019,1

It's been tough for a while so i haven't gotten it or see getting it in a while.

My reason for telling my mom she didn't have to pay is the views of my older siblings. They lived when my family was at it's worst economic state.They gave every thing they had to keep us well. So to hear my mother say i would be payed back one day made me looks selfish in their eyes.

I have no reason to believe that they will never pay me back. On occasions where i gave smaller amounts they always payed me back. The weight of the words of my older siblings made me feel awful to expect my parents to pay back my money. Before i said they didn't have to pay i knew they would pay back the money when possible.

I came here to ask if i should expect them to pay me back. If they should i will tell my parents the reason of why i told my mom not to pay me.That being my older siblings.",20Sep2019,1
