1,"It seems that no matter where I’m at or who I’m around, friends, family l, coworkers, classmates, strangers, etc. I am not respected. Paticularly the case at work, or well when I used to work as I’ve recently been fired, but I was never respected. Showed up everyday when I was supposed to and busted my ass the whole damn time. Worked like a damn tank and the managers would always say shit like “your one of our best employees”, but in the same breath almost would treat me like shit: force overtime, stick me in shitty positions or give me shitty jobs, wouldn’t listen if I had a question or concern or whatever. 



All I wanted out of that place was respect man, can’t blame me for blowing up. I took a year and a half of shit.",13Dec2019,0
2,"Posted about this some time ago as well. Things have developed. I've learned things. No advice needed on relationships here. Girlfriend of two and a half years emotionally cheated on me with a common friend and got with him the same day we broke up, and I'm just crushed.

I consider myself to be a very logical person, so I already know neither of them are worth having in my life, but you know how it is. I'm constantly thinking about things I want to say to get it in her thick skull that she's done something so dumb, but she's refused any wrongdoing this far, so I've just cut all contact at this point. I did call her a respectless whore in public in an auditorium at some point (we go to the same university). A huge mistake on my part. I've never been angry in my life, but this time I saw red. She gave me what I considered as a smug smile which made me explode. I formally apologized for that, and even though I have many good reasons to be angry, that was not okay. I decided at least I was going to be an adult and apologize for my behavior. I always tried to raise myself above them, and I did until that moment. But I've apologized, and said what I wanted to convey. Otherwise, I haven't been single since I was 13 years old (21 soon now), so I have a lot to get used to.

I think that's enough for painting the picture. I'll answer questions, but I don't think there's anything else I can provide to help for advice.

Anyways, it's been a couple of weeks now, and I'm going to work as usual, I hang out with friends and go out at night. All things considered, I believe I'm handling this very well. I know they fucked up, not me. However... I've never struggled with issues such as anxiety or nervousness, or anything like that before. I'm not known for showing anger or sadness, ever. I'm still open about my feelings, though. But lately, I've struggled a lot with nervous breakdowns at works, and its only there that I get these. I work in a grocery store, part time. I stack stuff, move boxes, do cashiering, and restock items. However, my job does not require a lot of mental work, so my mind starts wandering, and time passes painfully slow. I constantly tell myself to stop thinking about it, but 10 seconds pass and I'm back at it. It's like a little personal hell wringing in my mind. If I watch shows, talk to friends, or have something to occupy myself with otherwise, I'm fine. The only thing I'm terrified of, is that I will start linking this constant pain with the workplace. I love the job, and I'm grateful to have it, and I absolutely love my coworkers as they have all been very supportive. My boss knows the whole story, and I want to push myself to go to work every day. I want to function in day to day life. I've played with the thought of taking a free session to a therapist, but I want and believe that I can get through this myself. I just have no clue where to begin with my mental health. I've tried doing brain-storming for ideas for games and doing math problems. I've also tried planning events with my friends, and thought more about my loved ones, but I never imagined this girl doing something like this to anybody at all, and it pains me so bad that she thinks this is all okay and I can't get that off my mind.

I think I'm on the right track, but I really need help to get over this stuff. I have loads of shifts at work these next few weeks, and I don't want this situation to affect the work I do at all. But yesterday, I had to take a break to calm down my pulse. It was just 15 minutes, but it hindered someone else from doing their job since I was at the cash register, and I felt really bad about the entire situation. They said it was fine, but I know the days before Christmas are very hectic. All these feelings are brand new to me. Any advice on steps to take or how to proceed would be highly appreciated.",13Dec2019,2
3,"# TL:DR i found a bunch of spine bones at my sketchy apartment complex. not sure what they're from. should i call the non-emergency police line?

so i was doing my daily dog walk in my apartment complex, and they were suddenly interested in this pile of something. they were lunging at it and trying to eat it. closer inspection made me realized that these weren't just chicken bones like normal, but fairly large vertebrae. i couldn't look too closely (the dogs wanted to eat them) but i managed to take a picture. there are enough bones to make up a spine.

&amp;#x200B;

im naturally freaked out since i've only come across normal meat bones (chicken, ribs, t-bones). while they're *probably* animal bones i'm not 100% sure:

* they're pretty large and would have to come from a larger animal: i.e. pig, goat, sheep, deer, (human).
* they're too small to have come from a dead pet or a stray apartment cat.
* i don't know of any specialty butcher shop in the area, just grocery stores,
* i've never seen a cut that included the spine.
* it's possible that they butchered it themselves, but like i said i've never come across something like this before.

&amp;#x200B;

**should i call the non-emergency police line?** although they're probably from an animal *they are big enough to be human*. my apartment complex is pretty rough and there's an emergency vehicle here at least once a week. *i wouldn't be surprised if there was a murder.*

i don't want to waste anyone's time but this is pretty unnerving

4,"Hey Reddit, 

I am honestly so confused by this situation, we're all stumped to what it could be. I'm going to split this into multiple sections to make it easier to write for myself (sorry).  I'm also sorry for any grammarical and spelling mistakes, it's been a long day. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Background** 

In 2015 my mother committed suicide and she is confirmed deceased, so there is no chance it being her faking her own death and reaching out. However, when she died she had a lot of debt (like £50,000s worth) so we had to deal with debt collectors quite a bit. She lefted a estranged husband (my step-dad), my sister, myself and six of her sisters who she had little to no contact with. 

**Packages** 

So basically on a yearly occurrence we received a series of packages, normally books. My mother was an avid reader, but these books were children's books. This weird because my sister moved into her house after she died and she has three children (two at the time of her death) the first lot of books arrived almost two years after she had died, and I think (if I remember correctly) were primed on next-day delivery that required a signature. We assumed this was attempt of debt collectors for them to see if she would still be living at that address.

**Facebook activity**

On my mother's facebook account, there will be random likes on mine (last one was five hours ago), my fathers (they're not friends on facebook) and my sisters new account, which was made after she died. I assumed my was a bot that gained access to it, but it seems like someone is actively seeking out my sisters and dad's photos, and I don't think they'd naturally appear on her account's facebook wall for a bot to randomly like. 

&amp;#x200B;

What could this possibly be? other than someone doing this on purpose.",13Dec2019,2
5,"Hi all. Throwaway for soon to be obvious reasons. 

I am currently a graduate student; I've been in this current department for 5 years. I will call this department Y. To summarize the graduate experience: you work very closely with professors and graduate students on research. You have a mentor who you meet with very frequently and a committee of 2-3 other very supportive professors. You are supposed to go to many events/meetings/activities with your peers. 

When I first came to Y, I realized that my acceptance was very unusual. My research interests, background, experience, etc. was very much unlike any of the other professors. There was only one professor (who I applied to work with) that had even remotely similar interests as me. They also made it known that if it wasn't for this professor's very strong recommendation on my behalf, I wouldn't be in the department. Let's call this professor A. This discovery made me feel like I didn't belong in the department. Professor A became my advisor, and told me that I had to work to repay this 'favor'. They became incredibly abusive. I dealt with this for 4 years. 

It got so bad that the department got involved and I reported them to the university. I don't want to go into details regarding what happened if possible, but just know that it took a serious toll on my physical and mental health. Professor A got in trouble. All of the other professors at Y agreed that what A did was terrible, but half of them believed I shouldn't have reported them and should have just kept this in the department (to avoid them getting into trouble). The other half were understanding of that decision. The split reaction just added to this feeling of 'not belonging'. 

The department decided that A could no longer be my advisor, so they told me to ask my other two committee members (who we shall call B and C) if they could take over. B said that they were worried that A would retaliate against them, so they declined. I predicted this, since B and I had a good (but not very close) working relationship. C flat-out refused, despite showing the most support for my cause; they were there for me every day after things went south. I was really hoping they would say yes, but instead they just said ""no!"" and that ""it's impossible!"" and seemed to be very much against it.  I never got an answer for why they said no, they refused to tell me and just said it was 'not possible'. This was incredibly hurtful for me. This made me feel even more alone; not even the people who stood up for me the most wanted me. The department decided to have someone else fill the spot, who we will refer to as D, since B and C were unwilling to take on the role. D exhibited extreme reluctance, but has been my advisor ever since. At this point, I felt downright unwanted. That I was just a problem for them. When I asked B and C if they even wanted to stay on my committee, they said yes, but just that they did not want to take on the role of advisor. 

I eventually found an incredibly kind professor who studies something similar to me (E), and she is now on my committee (E). I started working with E half a year ago. E works in another department on campus, so I started going to the other side of campus more. Around this time, I made the decision to show up less to events/meetings/activities in my own department. The department was such a negative space for me at this point. My proposal defense, which was supposed to be a happy day, wasn't because it felt like B-D just approved it (without any comments, revisions, feedback) just so I could get through. At the end of the semester, they had a 'celebratory' party for all students who passed their defense that year, and my name wasn't on the list. That hurt me a lot. And while A got in trouble for what they did, they were still around the department which was REALLY uncomfortable for me. I asked B-D for permission to stop attending events. They said yes without a second thought. So off I went. I did most of my work at home. On the plus side, working from home allowed me to get so much work done that I'm a year ahead of schedule. 

Anyway, I'm at a point in my time here where I would really like feedback on my work. So I've been trying to start attending some activities/classes again. But it's really hard. That feeling of not being wanted/not being a part of the community really makes it difficult for me to be there. It looms over me like some kind of shadow monster. And I really want to get over that. I wish I didn't give such a shit about it, you know? But unfortunately I do. 

Does anyone have any advice about getting rid of this feeling? Or maybe creating a space/mindset of feeling wanted/belonging without necessarily changing the events around them? Or hell, even just coping mechanisms. Anything would be helpful at this point. I just want to be able to continue doing what I love doing without all of the negative feelings attributed to it. TIA!",13Dec2019,0
6,"My fiancé and I adopted a cat about 9 months ago. Ever since then she’s been terrorizing our young daughter. Our daughter is two years old, and is absolutely terrified of our cat. Our daughter recently had a visit with her pediatrician and her doctor brought up concerns about how many scratch marks the cat has been leaving on her, I mean this cat is THE DEVIL. My daughter will be sitting there playing with her toys and our cat will come out of no where and latch herself onto my daughters face. My daughter will be walking by and she lunges at her and scratches her up. All of this is completely unprovoked. And none of our other animals act like this towards our daughter, we always keep a good eye on my daughter when she is around any of our animals and are always quick to intervene if my daughter starts bothering them. But my daughter won’t even go near this new cat because of how terrible this freaking thing is. We’ve gotten the cat spayed with hopes it would calm her down, but it seems to have made her aggression worse. We refuse to get her declawed because we don’t believe in that, and we have tried using a spray bottle to keep the cat from attacking my daughter. I have no clue what else to do with this cat. I don’t want to rehome her, because I firmly believe that once you bring an animal into your home that animal stays with you to their last day, but this cat has been an absolute nightmare since we have gotten her. Please, if anyone has any training advice or any tips let me know. The cats most recent attack on my daughter has actually led to a busted lip and a chipped tooth. For now we have decided to keep the cat locked in our bedroom, but I really don’t want to have to keep her locked up for the rest of her life",13Dec2019,1

18,"Background:
I’m pan and she’s a lesbian. We are both 14F at an all girls school. She has been one of my two best friends for awhile.

I have been developing feelings for her for a while, I thought I had gotten over it for a while (I hadn’t). As her best friend, I know she has a major crush on a bi girl who also has a huge crush on another girl in our grade. (Our gay love triangles/shapes are f***ed up)

I am not sure if she likes me back in the same way though. Another friend thought we were dating and so we pranked her by pretending to date for like 30 minutes, some other girls were there and they all started shouting I knew it. It was one of the best experiences in my life. After she left I told of few of the girls there that I actually had a crush on her. They all told me that we were there OTP (one true pairing)

She keeps doing cute things like sitting in my lap instead of getting a chair or wrapping my arms around her. She also snuggles up next to me and borrows my hoodies a lot. But at the same time she comes up to me complaining about how her crush is talking about being in love with another girl.

We have such a good relationship (as friends) right now and I DO NOT WANT TO RUIN IT. But I don’t know what to or how to figure out how she feels about me. I am so confused

So yeah I’m just looking for advice.

19,"I (25M) have been good friends with Ashley (25F) for ten years. We had met at a high school school job when we were both 16. We became instant best friends. After I went off to college she would come to visit me and that’s where our sexual relationship began. We would occasionally bang from ages 18-20. I was in 2 year relationship (with another girl) that she respected and never tried to have any sort of relationship beyond being friends during that time. After said relationship was over we began occasionally having sex again, which I was fine with.

Now I have to mention that her &amp; I share a very close relationship; finishing each other’s sentences, we’re in the same profession &amp; just generally get along very well. I seriously consider this girl one of my best friends. I also have to note that our friendship is NOT based on sex, we were and continued to be very good friends when sex wasn’t in the picture.

Fast forward to about a year ago, she and a group of her friends were going to visit a city about 4 hours from where I live, she invited me to come along and I was more than happy to come along as I hadn’t seen her in awhile and it sounded like fun.

I drive to the city, meet her and her friends at a brewery, we casually drink alcohol all afternoon &amp; night until about 2am, when the bars shut down and we head to the cabin they had rented, we continue drinking until about 4am when everyone is ready for bed. Her friends go to their separate rooms in the cabin, leaving her &amp; I in the living room.

I am on couch and she is on a separate futon about 10 feet away. I had worked a night shift prior to driving the 4 hours to meet them and at this point had been awake for around 30 hours without any sleep, I was exhausted and really just wanted to go to sleep.

I’m laying on the couch, which was more of a loveseat than a full couch, eyes closed, on the edge of sleep. I hear her say my name, but I ignore it because I really just want to go to sleep. About 5 minutes go by and I need to readjust my position because I’m uncomfortable, so I do, and afterwards I hear her say my name again, which I respond to with a grumbly “yeah?” She tells me to “come over here” which I do. I was happy about getting to sleep on the futon instead of the couch, not gonna lie.

So I go over and lay down next to her, I lay on my back, she’s on her side with her back to me. She grabs my arm and pulls me over to spoon with her, which I’m fine with honestly, I sleep better spooning someone anyways.

About 5 seconds go by and she reaches back and grabs my dick. I think to myself “oh boy here we go”

At this point I should have just told her to stop but I didn’t and next thing you know she’s facing me and we’re making out. We eventually start to have sex and I climax faster than I ever had before, seriously couldn’t have been going at it for more than a minute. Anyways, I clean up in the bathroom and lay back down. I’m seconds away from slipping into sleep and she slips her hand down my pants again. I grab her and pull it out and say “hey easier there.” Another minute or so goes by and she has her hand on my inner thigh, reaches up my underwear and starts massaging my taint, which makes my dick hard, but when she goes for my dick again I tell her I don’t want to. She says “you don’t want to??” in an almost accusatory tone, like she can’t believe what she’s hearing. I give her a firm “No” She says “well I guess I’ll put my pants back on then.” So she gets up, puts her pants on and goes and lays down on the couch I had initially been laying on.

Finally, I get to sleep.

Since this incident, I have seen and had sex with her 3 times.

Now at this point she expects to have sex every time we end up in a room alone together. I don’t meet up with expectations of sex, I truly value our friendship and enjoy spending time with her like I would with any of my other friends. But I really have no desire to have sex with her, sometimes I feel obligated because I’m staying at her place.

She has texted several times in the past week and I have not responded. I really just don’t want to have any sort of relationship or friendship with her at this point, but I also don’t want to explain to her why I don’t want to be friends. We don’t really have the same friend group and the chances of running into her are low. I really just want to cut off all communication with her and leave it in the past. So AITA?",13Dec2019,1

Anyways, me, my boyfriend, my brother, and his girlfriend are going to a festival next year and without really thinking about it, I excitingly invited my friend to join us. We were drunk and I didn't really think about it, but since then I talked to her about it a couple of times sober, stating how amazing it's going to be and how much fun we're going to have. This was really stupid of me to do, because I never asked my brother and his gf for their opinion on my friend joining us. Important to note here is that my brother and my best friend only briefly know each other and my brother's girlfriend doesn't have any relationship with her whatsoever. They are basically strangers. 
I just realized that neither my brother nor his gf want to go to the festival with my best friend and I really feel like a bitch for not realizing it sooner. I guess I was just so excited to have my friend back that it kind of blinded me to all of this.

Hey Reddit, as the title says I asked a girl to get dinner w/ me, she agreed, and we decided on Ramen tonight. The issue is I have no idea how to have a dinner date, and I don't want to miss obvious signals. I might have asked her really late, because the semester is over and I leave tomorrow afternoon, and she leaves Sunday. 

Is there anything I should know before going into this date? My biggest worry is trying to figure out questions to ask her to allow her to talk about things she likes. All I know is she likes badminton and music, and I feel like I've only talked about music w/ her.

If you need more info, I'll post it.",13Dec2019,1
36,"When I was in highschool I had this relationship that was not very good. The guy wasnt evil. 
I was a virgin before we got togeather. He didnt pressure me into having sex before I was ready, I asked for it. 
It was very painful, which I thought was normal  at first. But it kept being painful. 

The guy I was with said no to foreplay. I asked if he could try to play with my body more but He liked the idea of it being more animalistic, like he had just grabbed someone off the street and stuck it in. 

Because it kept hurting I thought there was something wrong with me. At the time I appreciated that he put up with being with a women who didnt enjoy sex so I put out a lot. And sometimes I would try to scoot away so he would have to hold me there, but I was still concenting to that too. It was the only way to keep me from trying to scoot away.

I would disassociate a lot when we had sex. I didn't realize that this was what I was doing at the time. I would go off into my own world, block it out. Or I would count backwards from 100 over and over to distract myself. Or I would tell myself a story like ""If I get through this im never going to have to do this again"" which I knew wasnt the case, but the thought made it easier to handle.

I would want to cry out a lot because it hurt but I tried to make it sound closer to a moan so that it wouldn't turn him off. I would usually fake an orgasm at some point. I would hope it would make it end sooner. I didn't think anyone else other than him would put up with someone who was ""broken"" so I tried to please him sexually and talk him up about how good it was.

He cheated pretty early on, and I thought if he stopped wanting to have sex with me that he would go find it from somebody else. And he did, more than once. Or at least he tried. And he was proud of it too, when we were around his older friends. 

He wanted to do anal. I agreed but he didnt want to use lube because of the whole pulling someone off the street and sticking it in fantasy that he had. He said that would ruin the point.
It hurt worse than vaginal sex, and I just couldnt do it.

We spent most nights with either him at my house or me at his house. We even briefly moved in together in senior year. 

He would sometimes wake me up by touching my privates, which is a normal thing couples do. But I would shut down, my body wouldnt let me wake up until he stopped. It was crazy, it felt as if I genuinly didn't have the ability to open my eyes or get up. I wanted to, I knew how weird it was for me to just lay there. I just couldnt get my body to respond to me. 

I gave him a lot of head so I could avoid sex as much as possible. He wanted to go down on me, but when he did he would hold me there and just almost attack my clit which was painful so I wouldnt let him. I asked him to do it less intense but he acted as if it was my fault I didnt like it. Then if I ever asked for foreplay or touching/kissing or anything he could use me not liking being eaten out against me. From what he said I was sure his past ex liked what he was doing, so why didnt I?
 
I started drinking with him and his friends a lot in late highschool.
I found that if I got drunk enouph sex was more tolerable. I felt guilty that I wouldnt have anal with him more, so I told him he could do whatever be wanted as long as I was drunk enouph to not really feel it. Alcohol was an exciting thing for me, it was like I could have my cake and eat it too. I could satisfy him but also not have to subject myself to as much physical pain. So I would drink until I coudnt stand, and he would help me into a room and we would have sex, sometimes vaginal but I think usually anal. Because it was the only time we could do that withought lube. I cant really remember much though. 
It still hurt but it was tolerable. I could almost fall asleep. 

There was one incident where I woke up in the middle of it and I must have had some sort of sleep paralysis or something because I couldnt really move. Or it could have just been from how drunk I was. I wasnt sure if he was using a condom so I was worried. I felt really upset but I couldnt express that. But I think i just drifted back off after a couple of secounds anyways. I dont know if I had initiated that or if he had. I probubly wasnt asleep when he started, I just cant remember it starting. That bothered me a lot. I replayed it in my head alot.

He did awful things outside of the sexual stuff. He shared my nudes with his older friends. He acted proud of the cheating. He wouldnt talk to me if we were fighting, he would only fight through text. So I never got that closure I really needed. He said he wanted to marry me someday but when we were around his friends he often treated us as if we were just casual. He tried to lift my shirt up in front of his friends once. I tried to hold it down, then his friends told him to stop. I felt weirdly guilty deep down for not letting him lift it. So I took the initiative to take it off myself the next time we got drunk. Completely off. He helped actually, I dont think I had the coordination to do it myself. Im pretty sure I wasnt able to physically get it off. But it was still my idea. because I thought that's what he would have wanted. I dont remember most of that night. It was completely my fault. How embarassing. I remember that sometimes and it just makes me hate myself. One of the people I was with told everyone at school the next day. 

 Everyone is a different person depending on who they are around, but he was a COMPLETELY different person depending on which friend group we were with. Even his basic morals and values would change. It was eerie.

He lied to his friends about me and he lied to them more so about his own behavior. It's a hard pill to swallow.  The people he was friends with hate me. They still hate me. And when we were still togeather he had shown me a little of the text messages he had sent them about us. I understand why they felt that way. He cheated on me, and the day after I found out he told his friend that he just wants to help people and that I ""wasnt ready to be helped yet"". That's the story he told them to explain why we were thinking about breaking up. It was vague, misleading and odd. 

He liked to portray himself as very mysterious, like a ninja. I was already out if the relationship by the time I understood how much he could use the ""mistery"" element to his advantage when he had to manipulate a situation. To this day I dont know why he showed me that text message exchange though. 

Anyways, the reason I'm posting all of this now. My psychologist thinks I have PTSD. I get anxiety from places I associate with him. Sometimes if people ask me about highschool I get nervous if I think about that. The other day I went to a home that had the same basic set up as the home we would drink at. I was very anxious and grumpy for a couple of days after. 

I think about it a lot more than I should, considering we've been broken up for years now. 
I actually have some guilt. I had so much built up because he didn't love when I told my friends about what he was doing when we argued, and he never talked to me about it in person because of his rule about fighting through text instead. So I didn't talk to many people during the relationship about the bad stuff. 
I kept drinking with my own friends after the break up and I told them far too much. Almost everything.

 I couldnt keep my mouth shut, it felt like such a relief to be heard. But other people heard too. (It was usually parties so some people we both knew would be there) i think that's part of why his friends hate me too, because of me telling my friends about what happened whenever I was drunk. I would go over it and over it. With how he acted in front if them, and what he probubly told them, they must have 

I never called it rape. Honestly if anything I made a point to paint him in a better light then he was in, not the other way around. I felt bad for being a gossip. But there was just so many feelings. Talking about them helped at first, but after a while it was almost more draining than anything. 

I have really bad anxiety and I startle easily. And when my current partner and I first got together sex was still painful and a little scary. It isnt now, it's actually really fun and nice. I actually actively enjoy it. If I seem as though I dont like it, he will ask if I'm okay. That's amazing. 

For that first year or two I would get really bad panick attacks if he tried to cuddle me at night sometimes. He knows not to wake me up by touching me anywhere sexual because it can make me really confused, anxious and upset if I'm not in the headspace for it. I have never gotten that thing with him where it's like I freeze up and cant move though, like I did with the other ex. It's more like I'll just get irritable for the rest of the day.

 I still disassociate just a little sometimes if my boyfriend is behaving too erratically. And he has never hurt me while drinking in any way, but when he drinks I get scared. I think it's just because he is a man. My boyfriend had to jump through hoops to not cause fear or anxiety for a while. 

The thing that makes me feel unsettled about the idea of me having PTSD is that I was never ""raped"". 
I consented to everything we did sexually. Even the painful stuff. I got drunk for the fun of being drunk, but it was mostly for the explicit purpose of having sex later. He knew that. There was never a time where I shouted ""NO"" and he just shut me up or anything. I even got horney sometimes and would ask for it. It usually wasnt fun, but I would still try. I wanted to want it so badly. And I did fake orgasms even, so that must have been somewhat confusing. 

So with all that being said, PTSD doesnt feel right. The diagnosis doesnt sit right with me. I Just cant see myself as a victim of anything. It was mostly my choice. 

And I loved him so much at the time. I was the one who wanted to move in with him. I wanted to spend time with him. When we were together and things were good, I felt so safe. As if it were me and him against the world. I needed him with me, because there were so many things in my life that were hurting me. I felt as though nothing could hurt me while he was around. But he was hurting me too, and I was just passively letting him. I thought he loved me more than anyone else could. I think the fact that we fought almost entirely over text made it easier for me to ignore the bad parts of our relationship as well. 

I just hate that I cant seem to bury this thing. I feel so stupid for staying with him for years. I feel guilty for telling so many people what he did. I feel embarrassed by some of the things I did to try to impress him. I wish I could just stop thinking about it, but it just flashes into my head throughout the day. Not every day, but it was everyday for years. It's actually only been within the last 6 months or so that it's usually only a couple of times a week now. It's still too much. We broke up a long time ago and I havent seen him sense. 

I guess this came off as more of a rant. Does anyone have any words of wisdom? Has anyone been through something similar? My therapist things I was raped, but I dont see it that way because I agreed to it, and even would initiate it. I would be interested in hearing any thoughts. Although I dont think I can expect anyone to read this long monster of a post. 

TL:DR my therapist thinks I have PTSD and that I was raped but I think I was just in a weird situation for a while and now its over and I know I'm obsessing but could it really be PTSD? Maybe I'm just really fragile?",13Dec2019,1
37,"I'll start by saying this is not a common occurrence for me, this only happens once or twice a year. 

Some mornings, I wake up to find bloody streaks on my sheets by my feet and legs. When I check my feet and legs, there are deep scratches caked in dried blood. The first time it happened, I assumed my cat had come into my room and the night to sleep by my feet and scratched me when I kicked him in my sleep, but my feet and legs are always completely covered and the scratches are always too deep to be cat scratches. The scratches are never painful.

39,"I was watching a video aimed at bringing a group of self-identifying ""men's rights activists"" with a similar group of ""feminists"" together to spark discussions about issues and ideals that they may agree upon. There are pre-discussion interviews with each person, with one of the feminists' having gone as follows:

Ingerviewer: Do you think there's middle ground between men's rights activists and feminism?

Mimi (feminist): We'll see.


Just those two lines and I thought ""she just doesn't want to say that she doesn't think there will be middle ground."" The thought had come so naturally but it left me feeling a bit odd after a few seconds so I stopped the video and sat on it for a bit. Ultimately, I realized that it would have been unlikely for me to question the authenticity of her answer just because it was outside of the ""yes or no"" question if it was instead a man that had said it. It feels like a horrible cliche where I knew I was somewhere on the discrimination spectrum of thought but this realization really brings it to my reality.

I'm not sure if fleshed out my beliefs of both sides yet, but I know that it's problematic to approach groups with different sets of standards for skepticism.

71,"To start, I am on mobile, so apologies for format!

I am a 19 year old female and recently I was diagnosed with Bi Polar Disorder. Before finally going to therapy and getting on meds, I was going absolutely crazy. I have been going to college in a state where I know no one since August, and since then the mania and the depression have been affecting me like they never have before. I’ve thought about suicide for years, but I want seriously considering it until about a month ago. I go to weekly counseling and see my psychiatrist monthly, but in a way, I feel like I’m getting worse. I don’t have anyone here, not even friends, so that’s definitely a factor into it all. But it’s not even just about mental health, I can’t take this anymore. My grades are good, but I don’t know if I can do another 3.5 years of this. I worked so hard in high school. I beat my ass everyday to excel and succeed, but I am so incredibly burnt out now. I have no desire to continue my education, honestly I fantasize about moving back home and just doing community college (because some sort of secondary education is required, even though I wish it wasn’t). But what’s the plan with that? Most people transfer to a four year after getting associate’s and that’s not something I want to do, but what can I do with an associate’s? I’m terrified about disappointing my family, but if I have to keep doing this, I might explode. There’s the option of transferring to a four year where my family is, so I’m closer. However, the idea of having to do all of this over again causes so much anxiety (and I know that’s irrational, but I can’t help it). Also, I’m not interested in the degree program I am in at all. I want to do art but my parents refuse, they say I need a practical degree so I can get a good job. But then I see people online at art school and doing what they love and I burst into tears. Although I paint and stuff here, the stuff I am actually studying makes me want to rip my hair out. I know some people will say “transfer” or “change your major”, and maybe it is as simple as that. But at this very moment, this is drowning me

72,"Let me start out by saying I'm new here but I already know my problem is not nearly as important as others problems here. However, I've asked for opinions from friends to no avail and so I'm left perplexed and confused on something I  honestly never thought I'd be faced with.

\*\*some background:\*\*

I grew up watching movies with my dad. Even when the rest of my family fell asleep, wasn't there, or didn't want to, my father and I remained dedicated to the tradition. It's something that's brought us close together. Preparing the snacks, watching the movie, and then inevitably arguing about it after are all parts of a real experience for us. 

I should also mention in this background portion that my parents are divorced and it was not pretty. Between 3 kids, 2 states, and a salary in the top 1% (not bragging, just not trying to be specific), the divorce was extremely bumpy and took 5 years as my two siblings and I were growing older. My dad seemed kinda depressed (NOT diagnosed) through the whole process and even afterward; although, he seems to be doing better now.

\*\*the situation:\*\*

I recently watched (with my girlfriend, not dad) the new Netflix Original \*Marriage Story\* starring Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson. Without spoiling it any more than the most spoiling trailer, it's about divorce, and an unpleasant one at that. The movie seriously touched me and echoed the feelings my family experienced in our own situation. The acting is phenomenal and the writing is just so real. These traits check all the boxes of a formula for a movie that my dad would absolutely love. At the same time though, it hits hard on the issues of divorce, loneliness, and love. These traits check all the boxes for a movie that could seriously upset my dad, even if he loves the movie. I'm now faced with this dilemma of wanting eagerly to tell my father about this movie, but also thinking I maybe only want to tell him so I can selfishly keep up a tradition I'm wrapped up with. The alternative is not telling him about the movie and hoping he never watches it, but that also is an ethical issue for me. My dad is an adult, is it really my place to shield him from something he would love? Should any adult be shielded from any kind of media? These are things I thought I had made my mind about, but I genuinely don't know anymore and I've been thinking about this for the past few days. I know it's not a huge deal, but for some reason, it's really starting to bug me. 

\*\*PS\*\*: If your comment is letting me know my problem is stupid, you can just click back and forget about this whole situation. You really don't have to give input on something you don't care about. Thanks for being courteous.",13Dec2019,2

Yeah theres things I could do to win her over, maybe if I showered or lost some weight. The highlight of my day besides going home and buying some new pop funko figures online, is seeing her at work.

 i told friend A (imma call her Melissa) about all this and she said she wanted to see where things went. i know for a solid fact he is going to fuck up her life in everywhere possible and put her in a lot of uncomfortable and conflicting situations. 

he is also a dick to me and melissa’s other best friend (let’s call her Amy). he’s always calling us “fat ugly whores” and just stupid shit like that. that part is annoying but what really bugs me is that melissa doesn’t care that he constantly tears us down.

I'm attached to my boss, and I don't feel appreciated.

My coworker is better with people skills and consistently makes my boss laugh and smile.  I am not good at doing this and I'm finding myself jealous of my coworker.

My boss reacts very differently to my coworker than he does to me.  He seems to like her more. 

These seems to hurt even more because I have given my bosses a lot while being at this job.  I have stuck with them through thick and thin, when others have not. I do not feel appreciated when my boss is acts warm and kind to my coworker and cold and distant towards me.

I feel silly feeling this way, but I do.

78,"Hey Reddit,

I just wanted your advice on something, I usually don’t ask people for help ( especially internet ) but I feel like there are some great people here so I want your help.

Basically:
My have had a girlfriend for 7 months and I am really happy with her, maybe less right now. Recently, I have just felt as if when Im with her i feel drained and as if im basically baby sitting her or just here to please her. Yesterday she seemed sad and so I asked her what was wrong and she didn’t want to tell me for a hour and a half considering I already was having a stressful day. After time passed she finally told me: i wasn’t giving her as much love as she was giving me. But honestly I understand what she means since I kind of think she is right, but I give all my time and everything I have to her,  quite hobbies, seeing some friends and a few other things. She was in a depression that I helped her out of but I feel like she will put me into one at this point, she has some family issues and doesn’t have much friends the thing is that... I still really do love her. I  promised her allot of things and maintained them so as she but I just feel burned out. I’m the one making all the conversations even though all we talk about is sadness and dirty jokes. I feel like im just asking her questions at this point, I have given out so much of my personal happiness that I have none left. When she said that I don’t give her as much love as she did to me that just hurt like a dagger in my back, I give her everything I possibly can and have to offer while still being positive and cheerful but she still feels this way, witch I understand since some people need to feel more love then others but she is telling me that I don’t need to do anymore effort, that im the best and I truly believe she does think what she is saying, she really does love me and I love her but I just can’t, im the one im the pool drowning pushing her up and the bottom of the pool is getting deeper and deeper. She really does feel bad about this and tries to re a sure me it’s ok but I just can’t anymore.

If anyone takes time to read this thank you so much and I hope I didn’t bother you , have a good day Reddit.

84,"Hello,  I’ll try to keep this short and descriptive, but I’m not very literate. I really really need advice on what to do, because at this point, I don’t know.
I am a 14 year old living with my dad full time, since I’ve decided to cut contact with my mom. Don’t get me wrong, I love my dad, but I’ve just felt like something’s wrong.
He’s very much so a helicopter parent, I’ve never gotten to leave the house on my own/with friends and he refuses to let me stay home alone even for five minutes.
He’s very passive-aggressive and it’s constantly making me anxious, not only that, but he guilt-trips me constantly.
There’s so much on my shoulders since he’s been pushing what he wished he’d done when he was younger on me, making me feel like I have no choice.
I’m not at all prepared for the real world since I have absolutely no people skills from lack of socialization. I’m homeschooled and the only time I’m allowed to leave is when I go with my dad to work, my bass lessons, or we’re getting food.
From lack of socializing, I’m very meek and have no backbone. Constantly hiding behind, you guessed it, my dad.
He’s deemed me his favorite child of four since at a young age I learned I could avoid confrontation by doing what he wants. Meaning I’ve never said no to him, literally. I can’t even argue with him or defend myself because he gets so angry.
I think it’s also affecting my mentality, as I’ve been showing signs of sociopathy (my mom is bi-polar, disassociated and sociopathic) I’ve been bottling up my anger for so long, it shows so so much.
I feel trapped, I’m completely dependent on him and I’m afraid one day I’ll just snap and do something I’ll regret.
I’ve been constantly told by my dad that if anything happened to me, it, to put in better terms, “wouldn’t be long before he joined me”
I released my anger on my friends and pushed many of them away. I have no outlet. No where to escape to.
If you lovely people here have any advice for this stupid, depressed 14 year old. Please speak.",13Dec2019,1
85,"Hello,

One of my relatives is losing their retiree medical benefits this year (through their deceased spouse) and likely needs to sign up for new insurance and I am trying to navigate the waters, they are 90+, still mobile, but like most in the age group have 3+ problems.

Does anybody have a hassle free way to navigate all of the options, or some tips/tricks that are easy to miss?

My current plan of attack is to apply for Medi-Cal via Covered CA website to see if they qualify. I know Medi-Cal has a ton of paths to membership so I figured it would be best to not leave it unchecked even if I doubt they will qualify because of their retirement income being too high.

My plan after that is to go and get a Medicare Advantage with Prescription Drug Plan and probably a secondary long term care plan which is also another can of worms via the [SSA.GOV](https://SSA.GOV) website. It looks like this plan is better than the standard Medicare + Medi-gap/drug plan.

I was looking at the plan finder and I'm seeing a decent amount of options in the 4-5 star range (Kaiser, Sutter, United Health/Secure Horizons, and AARP) so it really comes down to I think premium, coinsurance amounts, covered benefits (hopefully similar/same) and available network.

&amp;#x200B;

86,"So today I was taking a quiz in French class on a website, and I totally blanked out for a moment and forgot I was taking a quiz. So, when I saw a word I didn’t know I looked it up on Google because that’s what I do on online homework assignments and class activities. My mind just automatically went there for some reason. As soon as I did it I realized I was taking a quiz and I couldn’t do that, so I exited out and I skipped over that question just to keep it completely fair. I didn’t tell my teacher because I didn’t think it was that big of a deal since I didn’t even answer the question on purpose so it’s not like I unfairly got the question right. But I realized another teacher who shares the room with my French teacher sits right behind me, just at the perfect spot where she can see my computer. She’s usually on her laptop doing her own work during this period, but now I’m really paranoid she saw me google the word and told my teacher. I really didn’t mean to, I just spaced out for a moment, and I purposely didn’t answer the question so I would get it wrong. I mean maybe I’m just overthinking it, she probably wasn’t looking at my computer screen, but what happens tomorrow when I go back and my teacher is like “I know you cheated.” How is he supposed to believe that I googled that word on accident and that that was the only word I googled?",13Dec2019,1

90,"Dear Anonymous Reddit Woman,

     I can’t thank you enough for being the one I can turn to during the hard times in my life. I apologize for taking so long to write and send you this letter. It’s taken a lot of time for me to find the words to say how much you mean to me. You have been my closest friend for many years and I can’t thank you enough for being there for me when I needed someone most.

I regret not being able to come out to see you, and I have nobody to blame but myself. The truth is I struggle to say what is on my mind and how I feel because of how hard they can be for me to talk about. 

You told me once that you thought my feelings for you were because it was convenient and that I was putting you on a pedestal. That struck a note with me because that is exactly what I did not want. I spent a lot of time thinking and reflecting on what you said, how I truly felt, and why I felt that way. What I have come to find is that you are far from perfect. You are imperfect and that is one of your most attractive features.

You can be irrational and moody at times, and sweet and caring in others. You have too many animals, and you can also be stubborn as a mule.

One of your strongest attributes is that you are an amazingly fun and adventurous person to be around. Your optimism is infectious and always gives me a boost when I need it most. 

I accept you for who you are and adore you just as you are. I wish we could actually be closer because you inspire me to change myself for the better and I am ashamed because I feel like there has been such little progress.

What I came to find was that it was all the little things that pushed me to develop feelings for you. The little things that may not mean anything to others, meant the world to me. 

I could not have asked for a better friend over the many years we have known each other. I care very deeply for you because of the many times you have been there for me. You have shown me so much about myself, and I hope that I can do the same for you. 

One of my biggest fears is that something would happen to you. I would more then willingly drop everything to be by your side to help you through whatever life throws at you. Even if you are half way across the world I will find a way if you needed me. No questions asked.

One of the harder feelings I deal with is that I want to explore the world and go on life’s adventures with you. This is because I want to be close to you, not just physically, but emotionally. I want to share life’s moments with you because you make them better for me. Even the little moments are better for me when you are there.

This is because I feel like I can be my true self around you. You help remind myself of who I was and who I’m trying to become. You have been so much to me over the years that I don’t think I can ever repay you. 
I once felt like I couldn’t depend on anyone and I had no true friends because of the state I was in. Then one day the friend I never knew I truly needed came back into my life, and it was you.

You have been there for me at my worst, and I want you to be there at my best because that is what I want to be for you. I want to be the one you can always rely on to be there when you feel like no one else is. I want to be the one you remember if you are in your darkest moment. And I want to be the one to show you some of what life’s great adventures can be. 

These are all things that I want however, and its taken me some time to deal with the feeling of being selfish in wanting so much from you.

I use to think that I needed you to be happy in life but the truth I came to find was that I was selfish in thinking that. I have looked for many answers and I have found that we are all in charge of our own happiness, and it was wrong of me to ask you to make me happy. You must love yourself before you can begin to love another. 

When I started asking myself how I could ask someone to love me when I didn’t love myself, I realized why I hated my self so much. My at times an overwhelming amount of depression was because of the stress and weight I carry on my mind. I hated myself for the mistakes I have made, and regretted not doing more when I had the opportunity. It something that grew and grew over time and I honestly took it out on my body as well as my mind.

I now know why I felt that way, and why I turned to the coping mechanisms I did. I started stress eating because it made me feel safer and brought back memories of my upbringing when my mother and father would bring those junk foods home as treats. I am partly ashamed to say that in the years I turned to stress eating I have become addicted because of the convenience it offered. The side effect of my poor diet fed into my body’s stress and I have lost many friends, memories, and opportunities because of it. 

I never forgot what turned me back to smoking either. It was right after X and I broke up. I turn to cigarettes as a way to cope with the feelings I have. It something I crutch on to help me get through many things because it gives me a break to stop and think away from everyone else which helps me relax. This helps fill the void and numb the pain. It is also a social activity that brought me closer to my peers.

I continue to struggle with my addictions because I do need help getting rid of them. There have been many times you have given me motivation to change my bad habits and start living a heathier life but I find my motivation fades because of the problems I am still dealing with. I still crutch on my bad health habits as a coping mechanism because I feel pulled in so many directions sometimes that I lose the energy to keep myself motivated for change.

If one thing is certain though its that no matter how many times I try and fail, I will right my addictions because I will never give up on them. I have come to strongly believe in the 1% a day rule. If you improve yourself 1% a day, by the end of the year you will be 365% better then when you started.

I use to want to lead a healthier life for you, so that you might be proud and attracted to me. In time I found that I have to do it for me. I want to fix my health because it effects my body in more ways then I first realized. I am also partly afraid that if I keep at my current pace I will have a heart attack in my 30’s. This scares me because I want to be around for you and my family. 

I want to be able to give back all those small moments so that they will be there when you need them most.
This is a lesson I learned because of you. I have learned and grown so much in my life because of you. You have helped me realize what it is I truly value in life. 

You have pushed me to ask myself the questions I was afraid to answer, and you reminded me how much life has to offer.

Part of my depression was that I built up mental walls around my emotions because I didn’t want to feel anymore. I didn’t want to deal with them. I felt abandoned, and alone in this empty 4 bedroom house. I felt worthless because I couldn’t hold a job, and a coward for having to ask for help. I also felt used and abused in the wake of the many friends that left once they got what they wanted.

These feelings were so hard for me to deal with all at once and for so long I walled out my emotions and told myself it was better to feel nothing. The world gets very pessimistic and gray when you wall everything out. 
I didn’t realize how much I lost myself until I didn’t know who I was anymore. I realized I didn’t know what made me happy anymore, and I didn’t know what I wanted to do in life which scared the shit out of me. 

In time I remembered what it was that I enjoyed. In finding what I truly enjoyed I have found my path again. That happened when you came back into my life.
You helped break down the walls I spent so long building. Like lightning in the blue you started breaking down my emotional barriers and you didn’t even know it. 

I realized how much I enjoyed talking to you every day and that’s when I started to realize I was developing feelings for you. This made me afraid because of how things always seem to go when I develop feelings for someone.

The more I started to realize how much you have been a part of my life, and the more we talked, the more you broke down my barriers.

One day I told you how I was starting to feel and that it was very bad that I was starting to feel this way. You didn’t push me away, and instead comforted me and tried to dissuade me. I never thanked you for what you did in that moment but I will thank you now. Thank you for being understanding in that moment, but I apologize for what came after. I did warn you however. it was what I was afraid of.

When I thought it was my moment to re-profess my feelings and pushed the envelope you rejected me and got very cross with me. I understand how terrible my timing was then, but you need to know what came after.
That day I actually had a fight with my father as we did not have the best relationship at the time. I was taking it rather rougher then usual that day. When I saw it was you who was calling me later in the day I got excited because you always made everything better, but you opened up with the terrible day you were having. I thought that me telling you how I felt for you again would be endearing In the moment but, what came after I wasn’t ready for and didn’t expect. You pushed me away and after the difficult day I had with my father I was pushed to the edge. 

After we hung up, I started drinking and dwelling. At the time I had felt like I was a terrible person and that I deserved to have this life I hated, that I deserved to be miserable and alone. I started to think of what a burden I had been on everyone, and that I would be doing everyone a favour if I found a way to just not be around anymore.

When I got half drunk I started staring at the Advil in my bathroom and kept trying to push myself to swallow a handful of the pills to just make it stop. I don’t know why but that’s when a memory of you popped into my head. 
It was a memory of a hug we once shared. Nothing particularly special about it, and at the time it felt very random. It made me feel like everything was ok, and that I was wrong in thinking the way I was. Just like it did when we first shared the hug. 
I threw those pills into the back of the closet and I went to bed.

The next day was rough because I felt so numb. I still went to work that day and I realized many things. The biggest eye opener was how much of a shock it would have been not just for you but for everyone. My day of reckoning came and went and nobody even knew.
You didn’t talk to me for a week, but eventually we set boundaries and you forgave me. I am sorry that even now, I will push those boundaries.

This is what I mean when I tell you I cant thank you enough. This is what makes me feel the way I do for you. And this is what makes me afraid. 

I am afraid that one day we might grow apart because of life or my actions and that is not what I want. 
I hope that one day I can repay you for everything you have done, and everything you continue to do for me. I feel like you have given me my life back by pushing, helping and encouraging me to become the man that I hope to be one day.

I want you to know that even if we cant be physically or emotionally closer that I still wouldn’t change what we have. This is why in part I have been so reluctant to send you this letter.

I am afraid that in sending this letter it will change what we have and that I would be out of line.
A part of me also feels like you need to know what you have done for me. I don’t think that you realize all the ways you have helped me by just being you.

I feel torn at times because I have a strong desire to be with someone I am close to that pushes me to my fullest potential. This has been you for so long that I’m afraid that if we cant be together I might not find another person who will be able to move and change me as you have. 

I learned to keep this feeling in check with my feeling of wanting you to be happy, even if its not with me. I respect your feelings and decisions because in doing so you are teaching me what it truly means to love someone.

Life teaches us many lessons, and we both have many more to learn. I hope that I can share life to the fullest with you, and be everything that you have been for me.
Whatever life teaches us, and wherever it leads us. I hope that I can be there with you truly proud that life has given me a friend in you. You have been a better friend then I could have ever asked for. And a better friend then I could have ever hoped for.

But now she has a job with weird hours, 3-11 pm. I just got a job working nights. As it is what is most suited for my sleeping problems. I have for my entire life had problems sleeping at night. For whatever reason. The problem here is. Literally the times we both have been made so that we won't see one another AT ALL. Basically I will see her sleep, she will see my sleep, But our schedules overlap to the point where we will only really see one another go to work in the morning, Then we won't see each other for another 24h. She only has 2 days off a week. One of which is a rotating day. that changes every other week. So if we are lucky we will have 1 day a week where we actually get to see each other.   
The obvious option here is that one of us changes jobs. But we are both at the beginning of our jobs. She has only been there for 2 weeks and I have only been there for 1. So it would look really bad on either of us if we quit. And if I quit. No matter what job I get. There won't be any jobs really with similar times to hers. SO there's just no fucking way we can reasonably see each other. Unless we both get a 9-5 kind of job. We are struggling really damn bad financially right now. I just don't see any way out of it.   


If anyone knows anything. I'd be happy to help. And please don't tell me stuff I already know. I KNOW life is tough, I was not raised like royalty. My life has been plenty tough so I am aware. Secondly, As I said in the post. I;m not expecting it to be the same as it was when neither of us was working. I just want it better than this. Because seeing each other 12h a week for two minimum wage jobs just hardly feels worth it. Even though we need those jobs. But it's not like one of us a traveling millionaire CEO or anything.",13Dec2019,1

97,"Ok, so this is the most teenager drama shit you will ever hear. I 15(M) have taken this girl to a school dance and I really liked her and I was really nervous and bombed the date. Recently, my best friend has just broken up with his gf and she is best friends with the girl I took to the dance. She broke up with him because she says she doesn't have time for a bf and he seems really salty about it. A few days before this, he hasn't talked to his gf that much and has started talking to the girl I took to the dance with, as they have been friends through all this. Now, he says that he is talking to someone and I am 100% positive it is the girl I took to the dance with. I still somewhat talk to her. I kind of feel uncomfortable if he starts dating her, and that would make our friend group all kinds of fucked up. Help.",13Dec2019,1
98,"Dear Anonymous Reddit Woman,

I can’t thank you enough for being the one I can turn to during the hard times in my life. I apologize for taking so long to write and send you this letter. It’s taken a lot of time for me to find the words to say how much you mean to me. You have been my closest friend for many years and I can’t thank you enough for being there for me when I needed someone most.

I regret not being able to come out to see you, and I have nobody to blame but myself.

You told me once that you thought my feelings for you were because it was convenient and that I was putting you on a pedestal. That struck a note with me because that is exactly what I did not want. I spent a lot of time thinking and reflecting on what you said, how I truly felt, and why I felt that way. What I have come to find is that you are far from perfect. You are imperfect and that is one of your most attractive features.

You can be irrational and moody at times, and sweet and caring in others. You have too many animals, and you can also be stubborn as a mule.

One of your strongest attributes is that you are an amazingly fun and adventurous person to be around. Your optimism is infectious and always gives me a boost when I need it most. 

I accept you for who you are and adore you just as you are. I wish we could actually be closer because you inspire me to change myself for the better and I am ashamed because I feel like there has been such little progress.

What I came to find was that it was all the little things that pushed me to develop feelings for you. The little things that may not mean anything to others, meant the world to me. 

I could not have asked for a better friend over the many years we have known each other. I care very deeply for you because of the many times you have been there for me. You have shown me so much about myself, and I hope that I can do the same for you. 

One of my biggest fears is that something would happen to you. I would more then willingly drop everything to be by your side to help you through whatever life throws at you. Even if you are half way across the world I will find a way if you needed me. No questions asked.

One of the harder feelings I deal with is that I want to explore the world and go on life’s adventures with you. This is because I want to be close to you, not just physically, but emotionally. I want to share life’s moments with you because you make them better for me. Even the little moments are better for me when you are there.

This is because I feel like I can be my true self around you. You help remind myself of who I was and who I’m trying to become. You have been so much to me over the years that I don’t think I can ever repay you. 

I once felt like I couldn’t depend on anyone and I had no true friends because of the state I was in. Then one day the friend I never knew I truly needed came back into my life, and it was you.

You have been there for me at my worst, and I want you to be there at my best because that is what I want to be for you. I want to be the one you can always rely on to be there when you feel like no one else is. I want to be the one you remember if you are in your darkest moment. And I want to be the one to show you some of what life’s great adventures can be. 

These are all things that I want however, and its taken me some time to deal with the feeling of being selfish in wanting so much from you.

I use to think that I needed you to be happy in life but the truth I came to find was that I was selfish in thinking that. I have looked for many answers and I have found that we are all in charge of our own happiness, and it was wrong of me to ask you to make me happy. You must love yourself before you can begin to love another. 

When I started asking myself how I could ask someone to love me when I didn’t love myself, I realized why I hated my self so much. My at times an overwhelming amount of depression was because of the stress and weight I carry on my mind. I hated myself for the mistakes I have made, and regretted not doing more when I had the opportunity. It something that grew and grew over time and I honestly took it out on my body as well as my mind.

I now know why I felt that way, and why I turned to the coping mechanisms I did. I started stress eating because it made me feel safer and brought back memories of my upbringing when my mother and father would bring those junk foods home as treats. I am partly ashamed to say that in the years I turned to stress eating I have become addicted because of the convenience it offered. The side effect of my poor diet fed into my body’s stress and I have lost many friends, memories, and opportunities because of it. 

I never forgot what turned me back to smoking either. It was right after X and I broke up. I turn to cigarettes as a way to cope with the feelings I have. It something I crutch on to help me get through many things because it gives me a break to stop and think away from everyone else which helps me relax. This helps fill the void and numb the pain. It is also a social activity that brought me closer to my peers.

I continue to struggle with my addictions because I do need help getting rid of them. There have been many times you have given me motivation to change my bad habits and start living a heathier life but I find my motivation fades because of the problems I am still dealing with. I still crutch on my bad health habits as a coping mechanism because I feel pulled in so many directions sometimes that I lose the energy to keep myself motivated for change.

If one thing is certain though its that no matter how many times I try and fail, I will right my addictions because I will never give up on them. I have come to strongly believe in the 1% a day rule. If you improve yourself 1% a day, by the end of the year you will be 365% better then when you started.

I use to want to lead a healthier life for you, so that you might be proud and attracted to me. In time I found that I have to do it for me. I want to fix my health because it effects my body in more ways then I first realized. I am also partly afraid that if I keep at my current pace I will have a heart attack in my 30’s. This scares me because I want to be around for you and my family. 

I want to be able to give back all those small moments so that they will be there when you need them most.
This is a lesson I learned because of you. I have learned and grown so much in my life because of you. You have helped me realize what it is I truly value in life. 

You have pushed me to ask myself the questions I was afraid to answer, and you reminded me how much life has to offer.

Part of my depression was that I built up mental walls around my emotions because I didn’t want to feel anymore. I didn’t want to deal with them. I felt abandoned, and alone in this empty 4 bedroom house. I felt worthless because I couldn’t hold a job, and a coward for having to ask for help. I also felt used and abused in the wake of the many friends that left once they got what they wanted.

These feelings were so hard for me to deal with all at once and for so long I walled out my emotions and told myself it was better to feel nothing. The world gets very pessimistic and gray when you wall everything out. 
I didn’t realize how much I lost myself until I didn’t know who I was anymore. I realized I didn’t know what made me happy anymore, and I didn’t know what I wanted to do in life which scared the shit out of me. 

In time I remembered what it was that I enjoyed. In finding what I truly enjoyed I have found my path again. That happened when you came back into my life.
You helped break down the walls I spent so long building. Like lightning in the blue you started breaking down my emotional barriers and you didn’t even know it. 

I realized how much I enjoyed talking to you every day and that’s when I started to realize I was developing feelings for you. This made me afraid because of how things always seem to go when I develop feelings for someone.

The more I started to realize how much you have been a part of my life, and the more we talked, the more you broke down my barriers.

One day I told you how I was starting to feel and that it was very bad that I was starting to feel this way. You didn’t push me away, and instead comforted me and tried to dissuade me. I never thanked you for what you did in that moment but I will thank you now. Thank you for being understanding in that moment, but I apologize for what came after. I did warn you however. it was what I was afraid of.

When I thought it was my moment to re-profess my feelings and pushed the envelope you rejected me and got very cross with me. I understand how terrible my timing was then, but you need to know what came after.
That day I actually had a fight with my father as we did not have the best relationship at the time. I was taking it rather rougher then usual that day. When I saw it was you who was calling me later in the day I got excited because you always made everything better, but you opened up with the terrible day you were having. I thought that me telling you how I felt for you again would be endearing In the moment but, what came after I wasn’t ready for and didn’t expect. You pushed me away and after the difficult day I had with my father I was pushed to the edge. 

After we hung up, I started drinking and dwelling. At the time I had felt like I was a terrible person and that I deserved to have this life I hated, that I deserved to be miserable and alone. I started to think of what a burden I had been on everyone, and that I would be doing everyone a favour if I found a way to just not be around anymore.

When I got half drunk I started staring at the Advil in my bathroom and kept trying to push myself to swallow a handful of the pills to just make it stop. I don’t know why but that’s when a memory of you popped into my head. 
It was a memory of a hug we once shared. Nothing particularly special about it, and at the time it felt very random. It made me feel like everything was ok, and that I was wrong in thinking the way I was. Just like it did when we first shared the hug. 

I threw those pills into the back of the closet and I went to bed.

The next day was rough because I felt so numb. I still went to work that day and I realized many things. The biggest eye opener was how much of a shock it would have been not just for you but for everyone. My day of reckoning came and went and nobody even knew.
You didn’t talk to me for a week, but eventually we set boundaries and you forgave me. I am sorry that even now, I will push those boundaries.

This is what I mean when I tell you I cant thank you enough. This is what makes me feel the way I do for you. And this is what makes me afraid. 

I am afraid that one day we might grow apart because of life or my actions and that is not what I want. 
I hope that one day I can repay you for everything you have done, and everything you continue to do for me. I feel like you have given me my life back by pushing, helping and encouraging me to become the man that I hope to be one day.

I want you to know that even if we cant be physically or emotionally closer that I still wouldn’t change what we have. This is why in part I have been so reluctant to send you this letter.

I am afraid that in sending this letter it will change what we have and that I would be out of line.
A part of me also feels like you need to know what you have done for me. I don’t think that you realize all the ways you have helped me by just being you.

I feel torn at times because I have a strong desire to be with someone I am close to that pushes me to my fullest potential. This has been you for so long that I’m afraid that if we cant be together I might not find another person who will be able to move and change me as you have. 

I learned to keep this feeling in check with my feeling of wanting you to be happy, even if its not with me. I respect your feelings and decisions because in doing so you are teaching me what it truly means to love someone.

Life teaches us many lessons, and we both have many more to learn. I hope that I can share life to the fullest with you, and be everything that you have been for me.

Whatever life teaches us, and wherever it leads us. I hope that I can be there with you truly proud that life has given me a friend in you. You have been a better friend then I could have ever asked for. And a better friend then I could have ever hoped for. 

With appreciation,

5 years ago a girl had a crush on me and now she’s messaged me on Facebook (I don’t have a pic of me pon there) and I’m scared she won’t like me anymore",13Dec2019,1
101,"By ""people"" I do mean multiple. In a college in SoCal, so it's pretty much the culture to be laid back &amp; running late, which infuriates me. 

Example: Wanted to run an errand before a movie starts, friends &amp; I are all driving together since it's a bit out of the way &amp; easier to carpool. Friends at 5 till we were supposed to leave head off to the dining hall because they haven't ate yet (were playing some stupid video game; I already ate since like, we had a /plan/ of when we were leaving). The time I wanted to leave would've allowed me to fill up on gas, run this errand (exchange some pants for a size down), and get to the theater in time to buy snacks. Now, we will only have time to go to the theater. 

In other examples, sometimes I'll go to the store with a different friend explicitly for the purpose of running errands/being quick, and I'll take legit 10 mins, maybe less to zoom around this store, grab what I need to buy, &amp; be waiting in the car (sometimes with frozen items!) while this friend takes another 10 minutes to stop and look around at every little thing. 

What I hate most is when there's a group project to do, we set a time to meet, and people suddenly have random stuff to do that leads to the meeting starting like 30 mins later than intended. 

I just... I don't know what to do. I feel like sooo much of my time is wasted sitting around waiting for people, because no one can hurry up, and if I bring up that I'm in a rush, it just makes other unnecessarily stressed, I think?? Just... How do you handle being a very punctual person in a place where the attitude/atmosphere is the exact opposite?",13Dec2019,1
102,"Recently, my sister has been trying to connect/re-connect with me. She's back from college now so we're both living in the same house with our parents for the time being. She was kind of absent from the family from ages 10-11 to 21, so I don't really have many memories of her and we never really had a close relationship. She wants that to change though, and I actually think that would be a good thing, except I don't know if I can do it. To put it simply: we are complete opposite personalities and spending time with her drives me absolutely crazy.

I won't get into all of it, but to elaborate slightly: I'm very reserved and work-oriented, and she's very much less reserved, and has a self-described ""loud"" personality. Pretty much all the things she's interested in, believes or thinks are funny are the EXACT OPPOSITE of my personality and interests, and it makes it very difficult for me to hold a conversation with her. Spending any length of time with her inevitably leads to her saying any number of things I can't help but find annoying. Example: she has this one joke that she CONSTANTLY falls back on where she makes quacking duck noises randomly and does a little dance, and if that's your thing then more power to you, really, but I can't help but find it incredibly annoying every time she does it. I think the problem is that I don't see it as my sister being weird, I see it as a relative stranger being weird. And I think you'd be lying if you told me that a random stranger trying to win your friendship by doing quack dances would be any degree of successful in that goal.

Honestly though, if it was just that I would be able to deal with it, but I won't lie to you, there's a small political element to this as well. I make special effort to NEVER talk about politics, especially with family, but she doesn't share this philosophy. At least 2/3 of her personality is encapsulated in her politics and she brings it up in conversation literally WHENEVER she can (and its NEVER a natural segue), and all I'll say is I frequently disagree (though I never voice this). I can get along with people I politically disagree with just fine, I have close friends that span the spectrum, but I can't get along with a person who does everything in her power to turn any wholesome, fun or normal conversation she's in into a super serious/sad/irritatingly political one.

Here's the kicker though: despite all this, at her core, she's actually a very good/nice person, especially to me, which makes me feel unbelievably guilty about constantly being annoyed by her. And here lies the essential problem, she makes frequent effort to connect with and engage me with conversation or fun things we can do, and I almost always try to find a way out of it. I just can't help it, the idea of spending an entire day with her drives me so crazy I don't know if I'll ever be able to do it. And she WILL pick up on this eventually. I think she already suspects that I might hate her, which I very much don't, but I just don't know what to do. I don't know how much longer we'll be living in the same house, I still have a number of things I have to set in order before I'm ready to make a go of my real career, but I fear if this goes on any longer she might just decide that I hate her and so she'll hate me too and we'll sort of cut off contact. Maybe I'm being paranoid but I see this vision of estrangement in the future and I really don't want that to happen (even though, I won't lie, and this is sad, but a small part of me actually enjoys the thought of her not talking to me anymore... I hate that I feel that way, but I do).

&amp;#x200B;

tldr: Sister and I have opposite personalities. She's an ultimately good person but she constantly drives me crazy and we have absolutely nothing in common to bond us. She wants to re-connect after being absentee for a long time, but I don't know if I can do it, and I worry she'll come to hate me eventually for snubbing her attempts to engage with me.",13Dec2019,1
104,"I’m in my 30s and have children and a husband that’s not very social.  I constantly feel depressed and lonely and know that what I’m lacking is a connection to people and something greater than myself.  The problem is that I don’t know where to look.  I was born into a Catholic family, but not baptized and haven’t been to church since I was a small child so religion is just not my thing.  I can’t choose one.

I think she's feeling like she doesn't want to accumulate more belongings at this time I'm her life, which is understandable, she's probably feeling some stress about what will happen to her belongings and having people go through her stuff and try to figure out what to do with it all.

I have a new project, I see a lot of people came to the internet to find a way to vent because they can´t take teraphy and need a way to discharge, so I was thinking i could post and ad for online help, you know, people message me and tell their issues and I can give them advice, comforting words or maybe clear them a dilemma of the situation they are in and what should they do about it.

Im scared about this, I don´t know if i will help someone or if it will work, I don´t know what Im doing and Im not sure if its a good idea, so i could really use advice and maybe some motivation

I also don’t like restricting who someone can and can’t hangout with, that’s way too controlling, and so I’ve kinda just let them hang out and talked down my jealousy. But after a while it becomes kinda difficult to not feel jealous and now I have this pit feeling in my stomach whenever they hangout like they’re cheating on me or something.

118,"Little back story (it’s very relevant to my problem right now). My dad went overboard on putting a fear in me. Since we moved into a new house when I was 5 he got an alarm, and had guns. I always remember him telling me since I was born that there are people everywhere who want to kidnap me, rape me, or hurt me. Sometimes it felt more like a house alarm was keeping us inside rather than a house alarm keeping anyone out. But I grew terrified of sleeping because I was afraid if no ones awake to hear anyone break in then I could die. 

It may seem stupid but I will stay up all night until my body gets so tired and gives up. It’s like my dad installed this fear in me. So here I am at 20. I’m a night person and have been going to bed at 5am every night sometimes 6am. But most of the time it’s purposely because I’m afraid someone’s going to break in. I need to fix my sleep schedule so I can have a life and get a job. And I’m tired of staying up that late. 

I tried to go to bed around 12am last night and I just couldn’t. Any noise that was made, made me think that someone was breaking in. I would fall asleep and my body would jerk itself up and wake me up. It’s making me have trouble falling asleep, it’s disrupting my sleep and stressing me out. I’m not sure how to fix it. 

How do you even fix a problem like this. Some of you are probably going to suggest therapy which I have gone to therapy for 5 years, but I lost my job and can’t afford to go right now. I can go when I have a job! But other than therapy how can I help myself?? I need to get this sleep schedule on track!",13Dec2019,1

I’ve done research into this but have come up with nothing. One night when I was maybe 14 or so I was sitting in my chair playing video games when suddenly my brother barged in and jump scared me. The feeling of adrenaline was instant and subsided a few seconds later. This is where it gets incredibly difficult to explain. I’ve somehow managed to gain control of my bodies ability to release adrenaline. To trigger this I “flex” what feels like a muscle in my spine. Instantaneously I feel the adrenaline and my heart rate jumps to around 160, my pupils dilate and I feel generally how one would during a fight or flight situation. I can sustain this “flex” for maybe 15 seconds, although it fells much much longer. So far as I can tell I’ve experienced no side effects short term or long term.

She asked her sister to grab her lunchbox as they were walking out, and they both got to the car but her sister forgot to bring out despite having been asked to do so about 30 seconds prior. My GF is reasonably upset at her and runs back into her house. Frustrated because she was already to leave she ran quickly to run back inside and get her lunchbox and either when she went inside or came back out, her little dog slips out with her. She saw him but didn't take notice of it until after she got in the car, backed up and heard him yelping out in pain. She then found him beside her front tire with his neck busted open and he was bleeding profusely. Just a quick note, she's 16, and this dog is just a little bit younger than her, and has been her dog since she could remember. He had had an episode or two this year where when he was put to sleep in order to groom him (because he's not keen at all to people touching him or picking him up. He used to be a really friendly dog but then something happened to him and I don't really remember). Anyways, when he was put to sleep, he wasn't waking back up for a while, and they had a quick scare for a minute. He had a few instances where he wasn't doing well and had to go the vet a few times, but overall he had kind of gotten back to being just an old dog. He's also VERY BLIND, and often times you could see him bump into things, which was cute but also sad at the same time. I'm kinda getting sadder and sadder as I write this because he really was such a good dog and damnit. I don't get emotional but shit. I only got to hold him once in his lifetime, and I was one of the few people on this planet he let pet him. Needless to say he was an old dog that her family loved and even I loved, and he had been with them a long time. Back to the story. She picks him up, blood is now all over her and her sister starts freaking out in the car and my GF yells inside for her mom to come help. They tried to get him to the hospital but he didn't even make it close. I'm usually the type of guy to hold her to a high standard and tell her to suck things up and to roll with the punches, but damn man. I really don't know what to do.

Recently we had a very personal conversation about what we’ve been individually going through in our relationships etc. and she revealed that she’s been suffering from depression and anxiety. ( I feel the need to mention how guilty I feel for not having noticed how much she was really struggling until she told me. ) I know she just recently started seeing a therapist but it’s very recent and they haven’t done much ( she’s not on any medications). 

But now she’s leaving on a big trip with our grandparents to Italy and a few other countries. This trip has been almost a year in planning and she has always been excited about it.  It has always been her dream to go to Italy and my family has put a lot of money and time into it. The issue is that I know she physically can’t bring herself to be excited about it because of how much she’s struggling. She’s really anxious and I don’t know how to help. Tonight, I was helping her pack and I was trying to hype it up and she was trying but I could tell she was forcing her enthusiasm. I don’t know what to say that could reassure her.

139,"I (22F) have been living with my aunt (46F) for the last year and a half while I attended grad school in a large city. My aunt agreed to move out of our home state to help support me while finished my degree. She is incredibly abusive and manipulative, using the financial support she gives me to keep me in the house, isolated from friends. She yells constantly. I got in trouble this week for opening a jar of pasta sauce to make dinner. I can’t ever spend time outside of my bedroom in the main living spaces. She constantly enters my bedroom and goes through my things, before denying she was in there. It’s a whole deal. 

When we moved here, I had a cat (Male, now 3). We adopted an additional two cats from a local shelter (Males, 2 and 1). The cats were a “package deal” because the 2yo boy, my cat, had been abused in some way before arriving at the shelter. For all intents and purposes, the older two boys are mine and the youngest cat is my aunts. 

I am in the process of moving in with my long-term partner. My aunt knows we have been looking for an apartment but does not know we signed a lease this week. I want to take my two cats with me, but she has been INCREDIBLY aggressive since I said I would be leaving around the time I finished school. She has told me on multiple occasions that I am a bad owner and caretaker, that I won’t be able to make it on my own and should not move out, and that if I do leave I should not take the cats because I won’t be able to adequately take care of them. She’s said that I am cruel for trying to separate her cat, the youngest, from my own cat because they are so close. She’s also said it’s cruel to take my oldest cat, who I have had since he was 2 weeks old (abandoned), because he’d be “too sad” alone. 

I would be lying if I said that these comments haven’t gotten to me. I am worried about their well being, and concerned that separating the youngest two in particular would be especially horrible of me and that they’d never recover from it. How should I handle this? Is it best to leave one of my cats, the bonded boy, so he can stay with the third cat who is my aunt’s? Should I leave both of my cats? Is it okay to take one cat? Will he be too lonely if I only take the oldest boy, who is not nearly as attached? How do cats typically deal with changing household dynamics and companionship? 

I want to do whatever is best for their emotional well being but I don’t know what that is. I’ve tried reaching out to their vet to ask what she thinks but I’m worried my aunt would hear I am leaving and freak out. 

Any advice to help clear my conscience on this and to help me decide what is best for the cats would be appreciated. I tried to keep the post as neutral as possible so I can get to what will be best for the cats, but I can provide additional information if needed.",13Dec2019,1

Most of the name calling and insults I do recieve, however, come from one person, and that's who I want help with. First, I'll give you some background on this guy. He is known for being rude, mean, and has been a jerk to nearly everybody in our Sophomore class. His insults honestly don't mean anything to us, as it's the same stuff over and over. There are two things, however, about the things he says that make me think. 1.) He self-depricates just as much as he puts others down., and 2.) the obvious connections between what he says about himself, and what he says about and to others. First, his self-deprication. I hear him say a lot of negatvity about his body and the fact that he's adopted. For one, he has stated before that he never got to meet his biological mother (I can't exactly remeber why) and has said very rude things about his stepmom, speaking lowly of his dad as well. In addition, he's extremely thin. I don't personally think I, or anyone else in our school would care about his body if he didn't constantly call others fat, or brag about how much he can lift, while calling himself ""the most anorexic kid at (school name)"" He also makes fun of me for my attractions. He has threatened to kiss me, and says innapropriate things about me and my (straight) best friend. Nothing particularly personal, but I'm not where it stops. If anybody does anything below his high standards of masculinity; he calls them gay. If somebody wears something tight and athletic? He makes fun of them for being gay. Once somebody is on his radar, he hyperfocuses on their ""sexuality"" and that alone. This worries me. It doesn't take a genius to see that he is insecure. Given that he never got meet his birth mother, the insults to his stepmom make sense. The way he speaks about his body is occasionally joking, but he seems to mean what he says. He likes to call strong-looking boys ""fat"" and a lot of students have said that they see him working out excessively at the gym. In, addition, (keep in mind that he has never put this on the table himself, and I'm not accusing anybody of having same-sex attractions) but he uses the word ""gay"" a lot. Whenever somebody known for being attracted to their kind is around, he'll jokingly flirt with his friends. That's no big deal, but just like his negative relationship with his appearence, he is so focused on that one aspect. There are so many reasons people make fun of me and people like me, but that's what he chooses. Every. Single. Time. Especially given his patterns thus far with putting others down for his own insecurities, I think sexuality may be one of them. 


ANYWAY


To the point, which is that I don't want any hate towards him. Personally, I never have, and never will say anything back to him. I'm worried about him. He doesn't have many friends, and is clearly in a lot of pain. I can't imagine what it's like to never get to see the person who concieved you. I also can't imagine what it's like to be known as the school a-hole, and to feel like that label is the only thing protecting you from everybody knowing how many issues you have. I don't know if he's getting help, as this behaviour has continued for so long with no sign of decreasing. What I want is to be friends with him. I want to give him somebody to talk to. I want to put my arm around him, and remind him that he isn't alone. Or at least that he doesn't have to be.


How do I do this? How can I go talk to him? I'm also intimidated by just going up and talking to anyone. Any extroverts out there with good advice?


Thank you! ",13Dec2019,1

I like them, but not to the point where I want to talk to them exclusively. Then when I try to back myself out and distance myself to try and seem a little less interested, I get jealous when they talk to someone else. I’ve only had one girlfriend whom I was with for 2 years and every time I try and talk to someone I always think about her. We had a nasty breakup and I’m just so scrambled. I don’t know anymore, and sorry if this is all over the place lol.",13Dec2019,1
159,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couscous
couscous is a rice like food that is made from wheat. It is eaten alot in the middle east and north africa.

It seems to be more popular now globally and I got a dry mix of couscous with garlic and herb spices. Without even realizing it, I got some pork tenderloins from the grocery store, and got couscous because its delicious that i wanted to pair with.

Is it wrong to eat a type of rice that originated in the middle east with pork? 

I know if you made some traditional iranian rice dish and paired it with pork, it would seem pretty disrespectful, but couscous is like quinoa or brown rice, a variety of carb that you can make into a dish.",13Dec2019,1
161,"I’m going to try to keep this as short as possible, but for context I live in BC, Canada. 

I have epilepsy and and I’ve been seizure free for 3 months. My manager didn’t want me on her team, despite the fact that I already worked in the company and the role required a very specific specialty that I have. There are very few people in our country that have this specialty, let alone the province. 

She constantly brings up my health and the slightest thing, she attributes to my health. I came off of short term leave a few months ago after completing a really awesome treatment program (hence, seizure free). 

I’m starting to worry that she will try to force me on leave as she is making situations harder (ie: I’m supposed to be able to work from home one day a week but my doctors note said “should” not “must” and now she won’t let me as there’s a loophole).

Can she force me on leave if my medical team says I’m fine for work? 

I wouldn’t be able to afford to go on long term leave and I love my work...

Thanks in advance!

TLDR: epileptic enjoying work, worried manager is trying to force me on leave.",13Dec2019,1
162,"I have always felt this way, no matter how much I try to be there for people and care for them, I don’t get the same back. Whenever I feel something for someone I’m never the first choice. No matter how pretty I get, how nice I am, how much I try to help the people around me they’ll be grateful for one moment then treat me wrong the next second. Sometimes I feel like I’m too sensitive taking everything to heart but I just can’t help it. 
I long for someone to care for me and adore me whether platonically or romantically.In my 18 years of life, ever since I could remember I always felt that hollow feeling. I don’t know whether It’s loneliness or what but I hate it. I don’t know what else to do. I thought that maybe I don’t love myself or whatever but I don’t even know what that means.

164,"I was researching my family history on ancestry and I’ve been trying to see if I can find any information about my mother’s biological father. 

My mother was born out of wedlock and the identity of her biological father was kept a secret until the late 90’s. The man that raised her my mother told her sisters first and then they confronted their mother and demanded her to tell my mother about her birth.  She did and my mother tried to contact him through his neighbors and he didn’t want to talk to her.  It haunted her the rest of her life. 

Both my mother (2017)  and her biological father (2006) have died since then. 

I finally found a daughter of my maternal grandfather. My aunt, on Facebook.  What would you do. Should I let it rest and let it be or reach out to her. If any of them look on ancestry they will find out.  I do not want anyone to go through agony.

166,"My friend and I have been best friends for about 3-4 years now and everything was innocent up until 2 years ago. He started asking/saying things that were overly sexual (they weren’t jokes) and made me feel uncomfortable like “Are you a bushy?” “What’s your cup size?” “Your tits are huge” “I just masturbated.” Me, being really dumb, thought it was just him trying to get closer to me and I didn’t see the obvious red flags. Last year, he started doing this thing where he would walk by and “accidentally” touch my butt or “accidentally” fall and put his hand on my breast.  When I tried to confront him about it, he got mad at me for calling him a pervert. More recently, I started noticing that when I would try to grab his phone to just  mess around with him he’d get really defensive and try to snatch it back really quick. If I tried anything to dodge him from grabbing it back then he would actually punch me to the point where I would hurt so bad that I’d give it back. I also started catching him pointing his camera at me and I haven’t said anything but I couldn’t help but wonder if he was taking pictures. 
Today, we were in class and he left to go to the bathroom and left his phone on the table. I needed to know if he was taking pictures of me. I unlocked his phone, went through his camera roll, and found multiple pictures of me and another girl’s butt. I do not know if we are the only two or if there are more girls he has taken pictures of. I cannot look at him the same anymore. I’ve never felt so violated and disgusted in my entire life. I haven’t confronted him about it and I’ve only told a few trusted friends. Now, I genuinely don’t know what to do and I need help.

Other possibly relevant information: 
Everyone involved in this story are minors.  (9th and 10th grade) 
He has been seeing a different girl (not officially dating) and when he puts his arm around her she genuinely looks sad and uncomfortable. He has made her cry multiple times because of rude things he has told her. 
There was an event last year where he said he was going to “end it all” on snapchat. Me and my friends who saw it all tried reaching out to prevent him from possibly committing suicide.",13Dec2019,1

Not sure if our detectors are working and at the moment I can’t visualize how to test them (my brain feels like burnt paper). I proposed calling the non emergency line for the fire department but dad objected, stating that there’s nothing anyone could do.

169,"I want to get a bachelor's degree - for life goals and also bc a lot of promotion opportunities at my current company require at least a bachelor's degree. 

Basic back story is I graduated from high school with academic honors in 2011 and graduated from community college with an associate's degree in general studies in 2013. I took online courses in community college and did well. GPA was 3.5-3.75 I don't remember exactly. I never really felt the need to study. The reason I didn't get better grades was bc I fucked around in classes I didn't care about (I'm not proud of it. If I could go back I would do better but hindsight) I've been with my SO since 2016, living together since 2018. SO and I met at work. I found a different job, SO still works there.

I have been thinking heavily about getting a bachelor's in computer science. I was always good at math and science - my AP chemistry teacher in high school suggested I should pursue a field in math or science. I personally love computers, computer software, and graphic design. Hence my choice for computer science.

My SO is concerned about money. An employee benefit I now have is tuition reimbursement (I have to pay for the tuition first and then I'll get reimbursed if I meet the requirements.) We aren't rich, but we are doing okay as is. We have debt that we've been paying off. We make ends meet if there are no surprises, if that makes sense. 

All that said. I'm scared to go to school, even if it's online. I feel like I've been out of school for too long. I'm afraid of the time commitment. I work a full time job. I have home responsibilities. I have two dogs and two cats that I'm primarily responsible for.

173,"



I’m a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it so idk. Also when I only got a pub job myself without asking for her help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it most appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way .  When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I Looked to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley quiet way which confuses me because she gave me a furrowed eyebrows snobby look at me when she first called me over to the appointment which got me down

I've decided to still not let them know about me going home for Christmas, and just go to Amsterdam and take the car from there.

The problem is that I'll have to go in my house to grap some winter clothes, snowboard, car keys etc.
I'd feel so bad for my dog, after 1 year of traveling I finally return home to just leave after a couple of hours again.

178,"Hi, so I'm in a complicated situation. I'm posting in behalf of my boyfriend. I've been with my him for 2.5 years now, and he's always spoken to me about how his father abandoned him and his younger brother when they were both infants. He claims that he's moved on from his father abandoning him (he's indifferent about it while his brother is very sensitive about the topic). But he always wondered if he had any half-siblings, or aunts/uncles/cousins on his dad's side of the family he could reach out to. So we decided to try and find half-siblings or family of his father through the help of Facebook and Whitepages (we know that's stalkerish but we had no malicious intentions with it; we wanted to find family). 

We found an aunt, an uncle, a great uncle, and a couple of cousins, and lastly, we found his father. We discovered that his father now also has a son who is a child, so my boyfriend has a half-sibling, but we don't know what to do at this point. We don't know how to tell anyone that we have found his father (like his brother; mother) We don't know if it would be ethical to reach out to the family even though it's family. But we don't know how they would react or if they even know about my boyfriend's existence. 
What do we do?

TL;DR - Me and my boyfriend used Whitepages and Facebook to find his father who abandoned him as an infant; but along the way we found aunts/uncles/extended family, and we don't know what to do at this point, if we should reach out to them, and how to reach out to them?",13Dec2019,1

183,"Hello. This has been plaguing my mind recently. I don’t really have anyone to fall back to for advice regarding this so I’m coming here. :)

I met someone online in a video game just over a year ago. And terribly of me I decided to ignore all the red flags of this person because I guess I liked having someone there. It was attention I never received before but anyway. It happened to be a terrible emotionally abusive relationship that lasted for 8 months before I finally had the courage to cut things off with him. But his existence still haunts me.

I am already aware I made so many terrible decisions with my relationship with him. I’m still regretting deciding to meet this person in real life alone and taking him to my home. (I must note I never gave him my address just gave directions). I ended up finding out he lied about who he was and that he was over twice my age about 3 months later after his visit and I was horrified.

I realized I invited a 40’s year old man to my home who is a convicted felon (robbery is what he told me). I felt like an idiot. I still feel it.  I’m glad I cut things off with him but I’m still afraid.

The date of when he came to visit is coming up in 2 weeks and for some reason I have been afraid of the possibility that he’ll show up and want to “get back at me.” Or something. I still live with my family so I’m terrified he’ll hurt my family as well. My anxiety over this has gotten so bad that I am starting to get paranoid that he’s watching me. I even downloaded Noonlight just in case I needed to use it and allowed my friend to see my location for safety measures.

I can’t tell my family. I know I will be in serious trouble for doing so. I know I was wrong and it was stupid of me to trust someone over the Internet. I feel so awful about it now and this just has been plaguing my mind.

I guess what I’m trying to ask is what should I do? Should I be afraid? He lives in a different state. But it’s an 8 hour drive to where I am. I don’t know how to deal with this paranoia of mine. :(",13Dec2019,1
184,"I'm a 27F, so I really should have my emotions together by now. I work in tech as a software engineer, the vast majority of my coworkers are older men. I feel like I'm career-suiciding my career by crying, but I just can't freaking help it. 

I cry when I feel powerless. There's a lot of these situations at work that end up happening -- and I'm at the point where I'm on the verge of tears at least twice a week. Little stuff like getting interrupted at meetings, getting talked over and condescended to, getting scolded in public and made to feel/look stupid by senior engineers on my team. It's little, but when it happens so repeatedly, it is exhausting and every little thing feels like a huge blow.  

For example: at work I was in a meeting that I scheduled to talk about a design that is a project I own. During the meeting, three senior people on the team just talked amongst themselves and when I tried to ask questions or participate in the conversation, they completely ignored/brushed me off and it was as if I weren't even in the room. And this was a meeting that I scheduled and invited everyone to! 

What I should have done was confront the people in the room about their behavior, but I wouldn't have been able to keep it together. I was already on the verge of tears and I literally couldn't speak without completely dissolving. I ended up pretending everything was okay and then went into the women's restroom and cried. I felt powerless and alone, and I think that was a lot of the reason why tears were coming up during the meeting.  

I noticed this trend in relationships too. Whenever my ex-boyfriend and I fought, I would usually end up getting emotional and have to table the conversation and go cry out my emotions before returning back to the conversation, or text about the convo instead of having it face-to-face in person. Obviously this is not great communication, but I can't help my emotions.

191,"When I first auditioned my senior year of high school, I thought it would be awesome. Two years later, I can say that this is not at all what I wanted it to be.

I am beyond burnt out, it has become a chore to get myself into a practice room.

I'm supposed to send my teacher a recording to finish off my requirements for this semester, and I'm heavily debating doing it. I know it's disrespectful for me to not do that for this teacher that did a lot to make sure that I could actually come there in the first place, and I'd feel awful if I didn't do it, making one more of those dumbass recordings sounds like hell.

I've never really been a good student either, and that hasn't changed as I've failed at least one class every semester.

I haven't made a lot of friends or even just people to get gigs with, if I had to guess, I'm probably looked at as one of the worst musicians at this school. But maybe I'm just exaggerating.

I've really grown to hate jazz (my major is jazz studies) during my time here. I know they mean well, but the way the professors refer to things basically telling me what I'm going to do with my life. Phrases such as ""When you go to play this tune..."" and ""When you're going to solo over these changes"" and I'm sitting there like ""Nobody has ever hired me to play these songs, why does any of this matter?"" I understand that it's applicable to other types of music, but then I'm thinking why am I not learning that stuff instead? I really like funk, rock, gospel, whatever you would say Ed Sheeran is, and neo soul. Why can't my lessons be focusing on that sort of thing? Why do I have to learn yet another fucking 12 bar blues head instead? This has gotten so bad that even when I have time to practice or just jam stuff that I actually like, I actively avoid touching my instrument, and I even actively avoid listening to music alltogether.

Really, I just feel like I'm wasting time and money being here. I don't know if dropping out or changing majors is a good decision though, because this is the only semi useful thing that I've ever been good at. I have no clue what else I would get a degree in. Trade school is an option, but none of that stuff interests me, and I don't think I'd be good at any of it. Of course, I could always just try to make it without music school. I know everyone there, if I was able to get some good paying gigs I'm sure people there would be able to stand playing with me for a night or two. I'd hate having to explain that decision to my family though.

I understand that this is a gigantic decision to leave up to strangers on Reddit, just asking for advice. I feel like I was all over the place in this post, so if you have any questions, just ask and I'll clarify. Thanks in advance!

193,"For context: I'm a guy in 3rd year university, I don't have any specific passions and I'm not the most social, but I'm definitely ready to work on that. Also, I had recently been cut out of my best friend's life, which is a super long story that I'm not going to get into. 

Without him, I feel like I don't have any super intimate friend-based relationships in my life. I have a super loving significant other who has readily introduced me to his friends, but I want to feel autonomous and have friends of my own. That is not to say that I don't have friends at all, we just don't connect in a way that I would deem ""best friend"" status.

I don't really fit in with the general vibe of my university (it's fairly small). I'm a part of a few campus groups but don't really connect with anyone there and if I do, then they already have a friend group established which singles me out as the outlier from the beginning.

With all that being said, I would just like ask for some advice about making close friends, and maybe tell me how you met your best friend(s).",13Dec2019,1
194,"For me, my favourite of online shopping is reading the reviews, their experience with the product, shipping, seller etc before I buy anything. And of course, I enjoy giving reviews myself. Therefore I am pretty detailed and may get emotional sometimes. 

A couple of days ago, I wrote a review on a business' public page, It wasn't by any means negative in my view, I recommended the product, but was annoyed at how careless the packing was (glass items wrapped together with one layer of bubble wrap in a box, without any 'stuffing'. I only asked that there glass items be packed individually, although I admit I sounded a bit patronizing, I'm sorry about that) .

I've had glass items be damaged in transit before despite being bubble wrapped. So I wrote about how displeased I was with the wrapping, gave suggestions, but otherwise **highly** recommended the item. 

The owner then texted me in private and went off about how I was ruining her business by writing such a review in public even though I enjoyed the product and there was no damage, her items were made out of sturdy glass and that she has been doing this for 6 years without any problems. I apologized and said it was not my intention to do so, however if she was confident with her packing then no problem, and thanked her. 

I posted on another sub and was made to realise that I had done a bad thing, as such petty things should be done in a private message to the owner. The owner did not reply my public review. 

While I understand that now, I'm a little bit conflicted.

1. On one hand, I may have been a little harsh with my review and suggestions. I will amend this behaviour and will write less passionately. I should take up any grievances with the business in private next time to avoid potentially ruining their business.
2. But also, aren't the review tabs there so that customers can document their experience for other users to see(to make informed decisions) and for the business to improve? I feel a little bit..suffocated, as now I feel I'm not allowed to express my concerns on a page in public, without receiving scolding in private by the owner. Which..kind of defeats the purpose of having a 'review' tab open to the public?

IRL, I've asked the opinion of several people, 8 out of 10 of them said I was merely writing a review that came with suggestions, and that the owner should learn how to take criticism better instead of lashing out at a customer like that. The other 2 out of 10 said that my tone was a little hard, which I agree as well, I was a bit annoyed and got too heated up. I apologize for that behaviour.  

So Reddit, basically...what should I do? should I not write reviews about my experience in the future? Or should I continue doing so but not get so heated? I know this is stupid thing to get all worked up on, but writing reviews as I mentioned, Is my favourite part in any transaction, I find a lot of enjoyment in doing so.

196,"So first off, two things are important to know:
1.) I have absolutely no intention on acting on this crush because
2.) He is happily engaged to the mother of his children, and sees me in no romantic capacity.

With that out of the way, I've worked with him for a few years. In the beginning he used to really intimidate me and it was months before I could actually have any conversation with him. Gradually though we've been able to build a really strong friendship, and I look forward to any shift that I work with him.

I've been trying to suppress my developing feelings for him, but recently he bought a comic for me because he thought that the cover art was really cool and I'd like it. It's a small gesture, but it made me realize how much I wish that I could date him. Maybe if things were different, we could be happy together, but there's no changing reality.

I've even found myself wishing that our fingers will touch when he grabs something from me. It embarrasses me to know that I am so infatuated with a man who is both taken and my boss.

I only have a little bit longer with this company and I want to return to some normalcy with him. He has no idea and I hope that he never finds out. I just want to view him as a friend again and get over this silly crush that I have.

Any advice?

Tl/dr I've worked with my boss for some years now and I now have a crush on him. Due to multiple reasons, I can't date him. Since I'm about to leave, I want to try to get rid of these feelings so that I can remember him as a friend and nothing else.",13Dec2019,1
197," Hey guys,

So I'm a medical scribe. It's basically where you follow a doctor around and take notes for them. It's great for a premed experience. I was assigned to an awesome doctor in pediatrics, but that doctor decided that they didn't need a scribe any longer, so now I have been reassigned to another doctor in internal medicine. The problem is, that I've worked with this internal medicine doctor before and he just didn't rub me the right way. He was super negative about his job and he just straight up HATES his patients. It's an all-round toxic environment for me to be in.

I honestly don't know what to do. I plan to put up with it and work with the doctor because I'm not one for complaining. I realize that if it's not me, then someone else will have to work with him. However, I know that I my co-worker is leaving her department and I would like management to know that I would like to be considered to take over her position in a different specialty if possible.

I asked my boss if I she could reach out to me with any cover shifts in the future, in case another scribe needed the help and I had free time. She didn't respond to that message. She did respond when I asked when my next shift was with this internal medicine doctor.

I called another manager, and left a voicemail that I wanted to discuss my placement with him and asked him to call me back so we can talk about possibly taking over for my co-worker. He hasn't responded yet, and it's been two days. I'm going to give him more time, but I can't help but wonder if I'm being ignored by him as well. If I am getting ignored, then what do I do? All this communication is being done over the phone and through texting, which makes it kinda hard to get any answers because I don't know what's going on.

I don't know if I'm being ridiculous either. I think people ask for transfers to different departments in the real world all the time, right? So by that logic, asking for a transfer to a different doctor isn't too unreasonable is it?

Thanks guys!",13Dec2019,1

But I’m a little lost since she’s never done this for me? I just feel really bad because I’ve been struggling with loneliness, isolation, and self-esteem lately",13Dec2019,1
200,"A rant. I already journal, I am wishing for some advice. Know I will extremely appreciate it. 
First of all, I feel im less mature than the typical 15 year old. Elementary school? Loved it. no huge problems that i couldn’t call “expected”. 
When 7th grade came I stupidly decided friends&gt;school. Grades dropped, numbers of absences raised!(so did detentions and suspensions ngl) big time slacker. 

In the end of 2017, going into my 8th grade year, my parents announced I will be moving to a new state! I was so excited. A chance to feel that “fresh start” and get my shit together! yay! Being the weirdo I am, my 13 year old self stupidly found people from that city prior to arriving so I could have friends already. That’s so fucking wack looking back. but I went.. 

luckily I was popular! When people questioned I gave them false stories “ my cousins from here so I’m a little familiar “ 
i was INSECURE. The most insecure! I felt so terribly ugly(even though I could get any guy;) . not only that, but sometimes people actually called me weird/mental/adhd “she was hot until she opened her mouth. So dumb” my self esteem dropped! and for a reason. I wouldn’t call it bullying, just judgmental kids
. I couldn’t go 5 days in a row cause I struggle with attendance:( Had to take 3 hours to get ready and sometimes didn’t feel like getting ready.

So I quit school. Later shaved my head. All my friends were worried about me. I became obsessed with who I was. Mbti (I first thought I was INTP-T but I’m actually an ISFP) my sense of self was GONE. I thought I was autistic, maybe it was the result of boredom but at the same time it made sense why I thought it was. 

people do tell me I have adhd sometimes, once I made a post describing me and everyone in the comments said yes! And I constantly get comments on my “character” but I don’t think I am... I’m weird (wack facial expressions,constantly look up when I’m thinking, walk awkward but cute, random questions,talkative, dress boldly,catch feelings super quick I meet so many people! ) but I don’t think adhd anymore. I felt stupid believing I could be diagnosed. 

ANYWAY 


I always include irrelevant stuff but I feel like it’s important to know what I’m like. I’m nice. I’m loving. I would hang out with you but zero doubt. I like having fun. I smoke pretty much everyday. Lack self control. Careless. Happy. Everyone says I’m ALWAYS happy but if I truly was I wouldn’t be here. Even in the depressing times I can still feel Giant bursts of happy and excited energy so that’s what keeps me going... 

today I just broke down crying realizing how horrible I’m doing. Everytime I try to do school I give up! I gave up in 9th grade after several weeks, same with 10th. I finished 9th grade in online school. Now I’m in online school, even thought when I went to 10th I was so happy! had so many friends! guys confessed having crushes on me, life was soo good I HAve confidence now! literally don’t get nervous at all. but I still gave up:/ I started online school and I’m behind like 200 assignments. I’m so isolated now (even though a couple weeks ago I travelled and had fun with a new boy) but besides that all I think about is 
-how I can act more attractive, tbh it’s all worth it because I’ve gained confidence and since moving year I’ve had all sorts of fun. Went missing, had boyfriends, concerts, drugs, stealing, Amusement parks, shopping, live right across a lake etc! 

BUT IM SO SAD AND HAVE NO LIFE AND CRAVE FRIWNDSHIP BUT I QUIT SCHOOL THINKING I NEED TO FOCUS ON SCHOOL ONLY AND NOT FRIends which results to me not even doing school cause I’m too sad and bored! In school I couldn’t focus on anything but me, friends, opinions of others, boys, etc 

OH YEAH I live out of town which makes this so horrible!!!! I’m so isolated oh my god. I’m like a big extrovert. I skype people a lot, but it’s not the same!

SO THE PROBLEM IS: I (used to be in advanced classes) But NOW I have the intelligence of like a 6th grader! I’m so behind that school is SOOO HARD it’s like I need a placement test and start from there. My mom said it’s possible to drop out of high school and go to college ? so I could possibly make my goal: learning not “passing” and then enroll in a college when I’m 18 and have the knowledge I should. 

I’m so lost. Subjects are hard. My brain is so tiny to understand, but at the same time everyone arounds me acts like I have so much potential but I seriously do try in school and I find it too challenging! 

this is so long but I need to get this all out, luckily I have the writing level of a 5th grade so It won’t be too hard to read. 

My fears: wasting so much time, living a boring life, failing, putting effort into school, everyone hating me

I WANT TO BE A GOOD STUDENT but I can’t work independently anymore. And when I do work with people it’s hard not to just talk about other things. I find some classes interesting, but I feel lazy and like it’s impossible! seriously! It’s so difficult


I smoke everyday (I’m out rn) but I depend on weed and so I think me being sober is causing all these thoughts to come out. The truth 


It’s funny cause people come to me saying they feel depressed, not living enough but I feel the same but hide it 😂I act like I’m this EXCITING girl when in reality I’m this loser at home. 
Im confident in my personality and looks, however my insecurity def SHOULD exist. I don’t do anything productive except dieting. PLEASE HELP THANK U!!!!!!!

This is getting worse as I get older, and I find myself avoiding going outdoors because I feel safer in my home. What sparked this fear was an incident that happened 10 years ago in my home country. I was walking outdoors in the village my aunt lived in, and a middle aged man grabbed me from behind and dragged me through an ally to attempt to rape or kidnap me. Luckily my screams were loud enough for him to drop me and run away, but it’s something that will always stick with me because it makes me wonder what if? What if I didn’t get away?

203,"So, as the title says... We are pregnant. We have had alot of ups and downs. I tried posting in a different sub but it wouldn't let me, so I apologize. I seriously love this woman with all my heart but we really struggle when it comes to communicating with eachother. I've basically came to a standstill and I feel like a complete ass for it. Almost every time I speak to her, she either doesn't say a word to what I say, or she just cuts me off and talks about whatever she wants to talk about. It drives me absolutely nuts because I feel like I'm not important to her. We openly try to work on things with eachother, which this has been an ongoing issue since we got together... Today is her birthday and we spent all day moving into a new house that we bought. Well, I spent all day moving the stuff since she is pregnant. 

Anyway... I'm crushed. I just wish she would act like what I had to say mattered. It doesn't matter what I'm talking about, my day, her day, the weather, anything. 99% of the time she says absolutely nothing or cuts me off and talks about whatever she wants... I'm about to give up. She is pregnant with my child, but part of me is just wanting to leave and pay the child support, which I feel disgusting saying, but idk what else to do. She says she is sorry, she says she will work on it, it gets better for awhile and then it seems lately she has taken a thousand steps backwards... I'm about in tears while I type this but I hate feeling like I don't matter, especially when she means so much to me. She will walk off in the middle of me talking about how I feel, especially when I'm trying to nicely discuss it with her. Then she will say we were fighting or something... and says later on that I should know that she loves me, etc. And it makes her mad that I feel the way I do... Idk what else to do, I'm running out of options here... Couples counseling is the next step, but that won't happen for another week and a half... Any suggestions?..

My pregnant girlfriend ignores me most of the time when I talk about anything or she interrupts me to talk about whatever she wants... It's been an ongoing issue and I'm at loss with what to do. :(",13Dec2019,1

205,"Heya, I kind of want to make this short but I don’t know if I’ll be able too but let’s give it a try. 

20(M) here and currently in University in 2nd year. Working while studying which makes things more interesting and at the same time complicated. Usually I wake up with that feeling of not wanting to get out of bed and not going to work or just leaving every assignment for University for the last minute and it kills me off slowly. 

I know I should wake up and go to work, because I need the money. I know I should work on my University assignments weeks before due, but I can’t seem to just do it.
Hell, I even used to be the type of guy who played video games and was good at it by always playing and practicing it and now I want to do the same with in real life stuff and I can’t. 

For example, next year I want to go abroad and work somewhere related to my degree. But before that I need to apply for various roles and get a job. I don’t have much time or roles available because there’s more and more people applying to this sort of stuff every single day. Even though I know I need to do this and need to find a job (not for University or anything, just to myself, to feel like I’m doing something and not just stopped in time doing nothing) I still can’t manage to actually GO and look for anything.

This becomes super frustrating because in typical usual stuff I want to do something and it’s like my brain doesn’t want to be bothered or something.  

I’m in my 20’s and now it’s the age that matters most because you can choose what your future will be. I’m scared of wasting all of this opportunity life is giving me and then regretting it a lot in the future.",13Dec2019,1

16M planning on going on an exchange program. They told me most of the time I'll get a country that's in my top 5, but to be ready in case I'm unfortunate. You only get one country, 99% of the time.

I'm feeling really good about it, almost ecstatic- then I get the phone call that they want to send me to Hungary.

Keep in mind this was not in my top 10 countries, not even in my top 15 I bet.

It's taken a couple of days and I like the idea of a cool Eastern-Central European country, but the ONE thing holding me back is the Hungarian language, one of the hardest in the world.

I had the chance to exchange e-mails with a previous exchange student who also went to Hungary, and she said that I'll most likely not understand my classes for the first few months. I don't know about you guys, but I cannot STAND the idea of that; I'm a very good student at home and I take my classes very seriously, and simply thinking about that idea makes me extremely anxious.

Now I'm taking a step back, wondering if I should even go. I keep getting extremely frustrated with myself, wondering things like ""if I hadn't told them I was a quick learner would they have sent me to a country with such a difficult language?"" and ""who were the students who made it to my top 5 countries? How could I possibly have been worse than them?""

214,"A year ago I started dating my (now) ex. When we met, we instantly clicked and fell in love. For a year we had a wonderful relationship, with its ups and downs until I ended it about a month ago. We were both getting more uncomfortable as our social lives seemed really stunted and we didn't have much time for things other than each other. 

I started getting fascinated with psychedelics and I wanted to try some (in a responsible environment). As I'm still living with my parents, and they'd most likely kick me out or worse, she said I couldnt do any drug such as alcohol or weed or anything until I graduated in fear that I would get caught. 

While I understand where she's coming from, I got so infatuated with wanting my last year of high school to be exciting that I got more and more depressed that I wasn't able to let loose at social gatherings as much as I'd like. I have a very rebellious personality, as long as I can remember. Sex, graffiti, drugs and sneaking around are part of what makes life fun for me, of course in moderation. 

We both ended up getting into more and more arguments and I ended up ending the relationship, even though we both sort of wanted that. That was a month ago. I haven't talked to her since, except 2 days ago. Our first real conversation.

We drove somewhere and talked in her car. At first it was awful, the most horrible moment of my life. She talked about how our relationship was unfair and how she wanted nothing to do with me. I found out she told a few people I ended our relationship just so I could do drugs. I think it's more complicated than that. And the drug situation was just a catalyst for me wanting more freedom. 

Anyways, I expressed my disappointment at that oversimplification of what I thought was a pretty great relationship. She said those things about me to those people when she was still on the ""I want to kill him"" phase of the break up, and now she's mellowed out. She said she felt sorry for saying those things and even cried out of how bad she felt. I reassured her. And eventually we started catching up. 

The conversation takes a turn here. We started talking as if we were dating, making jokes and talking about our feelings. We said that we missed each other. We hugged and held hands and she even hinted that we could possibly restart this relationship in college.

For now though, she said that she wanted to try to get over me and possibly distance herself from me to do so, as being with me obviously brought her feelings back. She even said that the conversation we were having would be our last one for months or possibly years. Later in the conversation though, we played with the idea that maybe we could hang out and talk like we did that night every couple of weeks or so.

I'm in love. I love this girl. I know that she still has feelings for me but she's also very irritated at me generally, and that's understandable. I've been with lots of girls and none make her feel like she does, this is the only person I can really imagine being with for a long time, possibly even years or more. 

I want to let her know this. But at the same time, if I try and restart this relationship I'd have to give up my freedom to be myself and to indulge my rebellious nature, which would probably depress me a lot, not to mention how embarrassing itd be at school (lots of the school knows because of rumors and such I guess?). I feel like this is two halves of my life that I have to pick and I cant imagine being without one or the other. 

I know this might sound selfish, but I'm thinking I could possibly try out some psychedelics just to have an experience, and then remain celebate from them until college. After I have a psychedelic experience I feel like I'd be satisfied and then I just want to spend the rest of senior year with her. Probably longer than that, since we're likely going to the same university.

She has arthritis, so she has difficulty walking and moving in general. She also has tracheal collapse, which means her trachea collapses...it’s common with her breed. 

According to the vet, she has a high pain tolerance. My parents switched her food to a low fat formula and she’s lost a little bit of weight, and my mom said that this is helping with both her mobility and the trachea collapse (both are worsened by excess weight).

216,"Hi , when I post this I don’t judge anyone’s beliefs and I respect all religions but I am just speaking as a mother who doesn’t know or understand what is going on with my son .

My son (16 ) has for the last 3 years been very much engrossed in Hinduism and “Vedanta,” (a type of Hinduism I guess ) and has been reading a lot of these “Vedantic” scriptures .

I found this strange at first because we have no connection to Hinduism or India in any way (we are Italian American ) but I let him get on with it .

But over the last year he has been starting to get into it much more than I think is healthy.

As soon as he comes home from school he will go into meditation for 2-3 hours . He will spend another 2-3 hours chanting and will be reading those scriptures all the time even at school .

He only sleeps 3 hours a day sometimes even less as it is promoted in this religion to control sleep. 

He doesn’t socialise with friends or anyone of his age group  at all as he calls them “kusang’ which he says is the Sanskrit word for bad company . 

He has also developed an unhealthy attitude towards sex and he does practices like holding his semen for as long as possible and I know he doesn’t masterbate (like most healthy kids his age) and seems to run away from all contact with women .

His grades in school aren’t slipping he is still a straight A student but he is completely introverted and his teachers have observers this.

I don’t know if this is healthy or not and I don’t know if he will turn out crazy or something .

I don’t know much about this and I can’t find much advice about it .  I don’t think he is Hare Krishna but I think he has found these scriptures and maybe has taken them too literally.

Is this unhealthy , I know it’s not normal but is it bad . Other kids go to parties and drink and do drugs and have meaningless sex and I don’t know if this is worse.",13Dec2019,1

219,My dad is stuck paying about 500 a month. Every week or so he gets mad and rants and gets mad at people or me. I'm done with it I'm sick of it. It fucks me up emotionally. I say I'm gonna go hangout with friends just to get away from him when hes mad. He wants to take my mom to quart calls her every name in the book. It all just makes me have mental breakdowns sometimes think of suicide cause I am sick of it. I like being around him when hes not like this but it just fucks my mental health when hes line this. He has gotten better from being made 4 to 5 times a week punching walls breaking bikes (never lays hands on me) now he breaks stuff once a month and rants once a week or so. So what should I do?

226,"At my university, the grade distribution is as follows: A=94-100, A-=90-93, B+=87-89, B=84-86, B-=80-83, C+=77-79, etc, etc. I currently have a 93.59 in a class (we don't have A+), and we are about to turn in our final proposals, an assignment which accounts for 25% of my grade. I have not missed a single class the entire semester, have never turned in an assignment late, and have actively participated in debates and discussions held in class. I cannot go in and speak to my instructor because I left university to go home after my last exam and this assignment is to be turned in online. 

The aforementioned proposal is due 3 days before grades are released so the teacher has enough time to grade them, and there are other heavily weighted assignments being entered into the grade book in the ensuing days. Am I justified in asking, after submitting this final paper and while awaiting the last few grades, for a bit of leniency in her grading to boost my average to an A? I don't think instructors can simply round up a student's grade, so I was thinking of asking for gentle criticism on this last assignment. I think it is a strong paper and I have been doing increasingly well on the bigger assignments throughout the semester. How do I word the email in asking? Do I allude to it then ask? 

Any help on how to approach this would be appreciated, even if it's telling me not to do anything.

239,"  

I could talk about this forever, but I'll try to keep it short (That might be hard). It's also going to be hard to thoroughly describe every aspect so feel free to ask questions. 

When I was around 7, my disabled Dad got married to my stepmom. Since then I've had three step siblings, two of them being pretty normal. However, my stepbrother, who is about 10 years old than me, has always been a piece of shit. For the rest of this post I'll refer to him as Junky. From the ages of 7-10 I lived with Junky and was oblivious of his antics. Apparently, my dad told him to stay the fuck away from me as he knew Junky was up to no good. Thus, I never really talked to him much during this time. I later learned from my uncle and some of my step-family some of the fucked-up shit he did during this time. For example, when he was 17, he stole shit from a house party in our neighborhood. After that, a mob of people showed up at our front door basically screaming for his head. Somehow, my stepmom was able to diffuse the situation. He also fucked over drug dealers, stole money from his ""friends,"" and did countless other awful things during this time. There's also a multitude of stories I've heard from step-family before my Dad and stepmom got married. For example, Junky taught his youngest sister how to roll joints for him when she was only 5-6. He also was found with a pound of weed in his room when he was 13; his mom, didn't care and got mad at his dad for going through Junkie’s shit. Eventually, we ended up moving to a different city about an hour away without him when I was 10.

From the ages of 10-14? life was pretty normal for me. Junky lived with his grandparents where we had previously moved from during this time. I was sheltered and didn't know how fucked up of a person he was until I was about 16 or 17. He ended up moving into our house when I was 14 or 15. One year, after Christmas, I lost $500 from my room. It was blamed on Junkie’s friend and he was never allowed over again. However, I now believe that Junky did it. I also began to notice that I was missing clothes from my room over a couple year span. Eventually, I saw Junky wearing a shirt that I had received as a gift from my mom, who's very poor. That pissed me off to no end. I ended up going through his room, making a mess of it and taking all my shit back. He came in my room asking if I went through his shit. I told him yes, went off on him, and told him to get the fuck out of my room. Since then, he hasn't stolen anything from me as far as I know.

Around the age of 17, I started smoking weed. I eventually started smoking with my uncle who told me a lot of family gossip and pointed out how drugged up Junky was daily. For the next 5 years, there were countless incidents where he's sold heroin at the house, shot up with his door open, stole from people, and done other fucked up shit. Everybody that came over to the house or lived here has known about this. He's fucked up daily and it's so obvious. He falls asleep with cigarettes in his hands and ends up burning himself. There are countless other telltale signs that Junkie’s However, my stepmom has always thought he just smokes weed. As this is what he has always told her and there's ""no reason my son would lie to me."" My dad and some of my stepmom’s family have tried to convince her for years but she's stayed in denial. I honestly think the only reason my dad is still with her is that he's been disabled and in bad health for the last 15ish years. He's not in a wheelchair or anything though, just has to use a cane and deals with constant back pain. He has been prescribed pain killers as strong as fentanyl.

At the beginning of this year, I moved away for college, which is about 4 hours away, so I haven't been home much. So, I haven't exactly been around much. However, my dad said he's been up to the same shit. About two months ago, Junky was arrested for felony trafficking of fentanyl. He sold 6 grams of fentanyl to an undercover cop. When I heard the news, I was so happy. I remember thinking, ""how can my stepmom stay in denial now?"" He ended up staying in jail for about a month. During this time, Junky was crying on the phone with his mom telling him her was clean now and would never do it again. He was also convinced he was set up and apparently, he plans to plead not guilty with a public defender. Some of my step-family members searched his room while he was in jail and found a ton of drugs. If the cops searched the house, our house could've easily been seized. Anyway, my stepmom ended up spending $5,000 for a bail bond to get him out. Since then, I've visited home a few times. Over the past month, I've seen him fucked up multiple times and my stepmom has continued to use the ""he's just tired"" excuse. One of my step-family members has found needles, baggies, and other shit in Junkie’s car. However, my stepmom is right back to denying everything. Junkie’s court arraignment is this month and his trial probably won't be for another month. I'm scared the house is going to get seized, shot up, or robbed because of his antics.

While Junky was in jail, my dad told me he was going to move out and divorce my stepmom if she ended up bailing Junky out. I haven't really talked to him about it since, but I will now that I'm home for the holidays. Over the next few days, I'll be spending a lot of alone time with my dad and I want to try to convince him to just move away with my uncle and divorce my stepmom. However, I know that'll take some time to get everything in order. So, over the next couple months, I really don't know how I can convince my stepmom how much of a danger Junky is to the family. My step-family, my uncle, my dad, and I all tried to convince her not to bail him out, but she went through with it anyway. Now that Junkie’s out, we've been trying to show her how fucked up Junky still is, but she won't believe it. Should we have an intervention for her? I really don't know what to do. I feel unsafe staying in this house with him in it. I can't wait to watch his ass go to prison; I plan to go to the sentencing hearing.

Anyway, sorry for the unorganized mess of a rant about Junky and his mom. I really need some advice on what to do.

Btw, this ended up being a lot longer than I thought it would be. Sorry for that. I just felt the need to mention all of this to add context.",13Dec2019,1
240,"Before talking about my situation I would like to give a little of background on myself. I’m the type of person that becomes very clingy and emotionally invested with the person that I’m dating, but I also don’t date a person if I don’t see myself marrying them. And honestly I don’t think I’ll find a solution for my situation, I just need a place to get everything off my chest.

 I started dating this girl, and I really like her, which is surprising because I never like the people that I date (I would break up with them after 2 days or a week). She’s amazing, and she became my best friend, but it’s just that she’s a Senior, and I’m a Sophomore (I was supposed to be a Junior).

 She’s very high maintenance, when we started dating we started talking about cheating, and she told me that she cheated on her last gf because she didn’t pay enough attention to her, and when we met, she was dating someone else, but we were always flirting in some type of way (I didn’t know she was dating someone till they broke up, and they went to a different school, so I never saw them). She’s always telling me about how she can’t do long distance relationships or how she can’t stand if they don’t give her attention.

 And I was fine with all of that, but there are small things that bug me, I don’t have my license yet, so she’s always driving me, so we came with the agreement that she would pay for the gas and I pay for the food, little by little she went from being my gf to being my Uber, not because I would always call her to take me places, no, because every time I would be hanging with her and I would have to pass by my house she would ask me for gas money, but it didn’t matter, until I realized that I didn’t want to go anywhere near her car because I didn’t want to give her 10~25 dollars, and what bothered me the most was the fact that she would take her friends anywhere and she would never mention gas money to them.

 Another thing that I noticed is that I would text her and she would take forever to reply, and I would forget about it and thing something like “She’s busy or she’s talking to someone else”,  but then days would go buy and she would tell me something like “I’m sorry that I ignore your messages, it’s just that I get mad and decide to ignore your texts”. It feels like I’m the only one who cares, and I know that she loves me, it’s just that the way that she expresses it sometimes doesn’t get to me.

 But now I’m gonna talk about my problem, even after all of that, and other things that happen sometimes, I still love her, I like her so much and she makes me so happy, and I know that all of those problems can be fixed. My real problem is the fact that I know that next year we will break up over the summer because she has to go to college, and like I said before, if I don’t see myself with the other person on the long run, I don’t think I should keep this going.

 I will never see her next year, because she will be busy and I will be busy. Right now I’m on the swimming team, and after that I go to driving school, all of that while keeping a 4.1, and I know that my schedule for next year will look the same, it’s just that instead of driving school it will be a job. So my chances to see her will be slim. So I guess that I’m writing this and posting it because I’m trying to reassure myself that breaking up is the right choice.",13Dec2019,1

He will constantly steal her perfumes, makeup and other beauty products.

I moved in with my Uncle about 6 or so months ago? and before that he was always our favourite Uncle, and the closest sibling to my Mum.

He has this picture in his mind that everyone who lives in this suburb is perfect. The other week I saw a massive fight at the train station, and I mentioned it when I got home. He shook his head like I’m a liar when I had absolutely no damn reason to lie about that, like who would randomly pull something like that out of their *** and tell everyone. 

Another thing was that one of his daughters parcels didn’t arrive on the day it was meant to, and he asked me if I saw it. I could tell that he was suspicious (this has happened a few times now), and he just made this face at me... *parcel came the next morning smh!

It continuously happens, and he makes it soooo obvious. Like he’ll laugh or rub off his shoulder, or he has to check for himself before he believes me.

248,"So I've posted about this before, but my roommate - who was seemingly chill when we first met - is actually completely anal about the kitchen. I am generally VERY clean - I have always been the cleanest one of my roommates and have lived with a number of diff people for the past 7 years. This is the FIRST time anyone has ever complained about my cleanliness.

My roommate has sent me long texts telling me what to do / not to do in the kitchen, including:

\- Washing the sink down with soap after every use

\- Wiping down the counters after every use

\- Wiping down the stovetop under the grates after every use

\- Not leaving my jacket on the living room chair

\- Cleaning the microwave after every 2 uses

\- Not leaving dishes in the sink for more than 1 hour

Now...maybe these requests don't seem that ridiculous. But on a number of occasions he's gotten pissed about very small things that for me, I feel like any normal person would just let it slide and take care of themself. Just now, he barged into my room to show me there was a knife I had accidentally put back in the drawer when it had some egg on it. This is the first time in MONTHS I've done something like that. But he was very, very upset and when I apologized, he just closed the door loudly and left.

Issue #1 is that his needs are so OCD to me that I simply cannot remember all of them and honestly, i have a ton of other shit on my mind at the moment that it's just not my priority to keep the kitchen so sparkling that i could lick every surface of it. He said we should ""compromise in common areas"" but I don't feel like there's any compromise - it's just him telling me that I need to tiptoe around his rules. The larger issue is how he communicates it - angrily, as if I've done this intentionally or as if I'm an actually messy person. If it were me, I'd just say ""hey, friendly reminder to -"" -but he will send long text messages about something like egg being on a knife. 

TLDR; roommate has anal cleanliness needs around the kitchen; it makes me seriously uncomfortable at home and deters me from even wanting to cook anymore.

250,"I started a new job at the start of December. It's only been one week and I'm already dreading going into work. It's not a high paying position. I work as a technician.

The only ""turnover"" I'm aware of is the previous person before me, they left/quit after one month.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of my coworkers are very nice. They're great at explaining things or training me. Some of my coworkers just don't seem to like me very much. That's okay, I'm the new girl at the job so I can understand that. This doesn't really bug me too much. The job is okay, but most of my concerns and frustrations is with the management.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly forgot to ask about my wage during the interview. I had to bring it up near the end of my first training shift. When I asked about it the manager started to be quiet and distant... almost like they didn't want to talk about it. I could barely even hear them. I usually negotiate my pay for every job but for some reason I let it go. (The offer was ""okay"" so I accepted it.) This job wasn't for career advancement, I just wanted pocket money.

&amp;#x200B;

During a second training shift I started chatting/working with a coworker, we happened to discuss pay. (Yeah I know, whoopsee in hindsight.) We worked the same position. That coworker had been working there for years, they made less than me. A day or two later, I get an email from my manager saying ""Please refrain from discussing wages.""

&amp;#x200B;

My manager brings up a OT agreement. My hours are longer so I can work 3 days instead of 4. I actually prefer that. The OT agreement changes it so I wouldn't be getting OT for my normal work hours. However my manager NEVER brought this up. I get a random email asking me to sign this on my 3rd day. I replied with my opening sentence mentioning that they never told me this. They replied back saying that they told me multiple times already. (My manager lied. They never mentioned this.) I'm okay with a OT agreement, but my manager lying to me / playing he/she said already in my first week bothers me a lot. The agreement is also illegal. It's postdated, as they listed it for the entirety of December when it was already a week.

&amp;#x200B;

Thirdly, this is something my manager actually brought up during my interview. They were considering overhauling or changing the position I'm in. However they have not updated me about this at all since. I asked my manager today. They said they were looking to find someone more experienced but mentioned it was hard to find someone experienced in the field. I'm only an assistant so I'm not trained to do the tasks they mentioned. My manager told me they'd discuss this with me later... of course they didn't. I even said goodbye when I was leaving and they didn't bring it up either. I understand if my manager forgets, but this is a constant thing. I always have to go ask them about everything.

&amp;#x200B;

My manager also introduced me to my supervisor. They gave me a paper checklist to tick off for my job... My supervisor never really introduced themselves, they didn't train me. They obviously don't like me, they avoid me. I've tried to be nice and talk to them but they ignore me when I'm in the room or just excuse themselves if I talk to them. I'm not even sure if they're my supervisor, they don't even act like it?

&amp;#x200B;

I had another training shift today with a different coworker. I could tell instantly they knew what they were doing. I learned a lot. I asked him if I should be asking more questions or shadowing other people during my training. He told me that was his job. Right after this he went around to ask other coworkers to show me things. I learned more about the place today than I learned since my entire first week. I even asked this coworker about my role being changed and he immediately went and asked my manager.

&amp;#x200B;

Questions are bobbing in my head! Did my manager literally just tell me they were looking for someone more experienced to replace me? Am I being replaced? Am I being pushed into a different role?! I was doing food delivery to support myself before and while I might not make as much, I would be okay if I just quit.

&amp;#x200B;

Lots of people suggest giving two weeks notice, should I do this? Is there even a point? A large part of me wants to be professional. Tell my manager that this job is not a good fit for me; put my notice in and discuss it in my exit interview. However with the past-history of my manager I'm not really sure if I even want to. (I've only been here a week! Barely two :(

&amp;#x200B;

Should I quit? Should I ask my manager? Is this just new job stress?! I was SOO happy to get this job and I was telling all my friends. Aside from the management concerns, it's actually a good job.

252,"I[18] just had a first date with a girl [19] I went to high school with that I haven’t seen in ~6 months. We went to a play at her college, and we had a good time. We held hands during the play.  She told me that I should go to college there with her, 

But afterwards when I walked her out to her car I went in for a kiss but she rejected it. She just said something along the lines of she’s not sure yet and that she was really nervous. I told her I was really nervous too. She said that I should text her, and we should hang out again another time. 

The part I’m particularly nervous about are these text messages. 


Me:Hey i had a great time with you tonight thanks for hanging out with me
Me again(she had not responded up to this point): Also! If you’re not busy on Monday night I’d like to take you out to a cool spot that has an awesome live jazz band and some amazing handmade pizzas. Let me know if you’d be free or interested!

I’m 17 and my crush is 16. Me and this girl recently starting talking a lot more, we knew each other for a little while but we didn’t really talk. Like we end up teasing each other a lot at work. And she’s always super quiet and might be one of the most shy people I’ve ever met. So a few days ago I was talking to my crush at work and we’re talking about Snapchat and she mentions this one guy she wants to get snapchats from but never does. Apparently she’s never talked to him but she’s really nervous, so I tell her not to be nervous and to text him (she didn’t) later that night she texts me and tells me I got on her best friends list finally, and I see that guy is her #1 so I say something about it and start teasing her so I tell her to text him and she says noo wayyy (she didn’t end up doing it again) I even told her that I’d text my crush too, I ended up telling her about my other crush but I told her I didn’t really like her anymore because I didn’t have a chance (she knows I don’t like that girl anymore.) like a day or 2 later we start texting and I posted something on my private saying I need someone to talk to and she said you can talk to me, so I said “are you sure it’s a long and complicated story?” And she said “yes I’m here for you” so I told her what happened and she helped me a lot. So I end up thanking her, I said. “Thank you for being there for me it’s means a lot” she says back “anytime sorry I wasn’t much help” I said “your fine if helped” she says “are you sure?” And said “yeah” she said “okay good” then we keep texting for a little while. Today when I was texting her she told me that I’m stupid as a joke so then I said no u and she said back your right I’m very stupid and I said no your not I’m joking with you, so then she says back yes I am and I ask why and she starts talking. About grades then she says if she gets another bad grade her parents are gonna make her quit her job (which would suck because we go to different schools so I’d never see her, we met at work) and I said nooo please don’t leave, I’d miss you. And she says back  “Aw id miss you too. So I say I’d have to some to make fun of” and then she just start texting more. Idk what this girl thinks of me.

256,"The title is somewhat self-explanatory. 

So I'm 16 and in 10th Grade, and I've been doing Kumon since I was 3 and in Pre-K. I moved through levels somewhat quickly up until middle school, where puberty and mental health issues hit me like a fucking train. The amount of time it took me to complete a level went from 1 year to 3 years, as I was kinda preoccupied with trying to not kill myself everyday. Kumon was also a big contributor to the mental health issues I experienced through middle school, and I still get occasional panic attack I'm currently on Level K in Kumon Math. My younger sister who is in 8th grade has caught up to me in levels and is soon going to pass me and enter Level L. 

I took the Kumon test for Level K this past Wednesday, and I missed passing the test by 2 questions. Even though I've since matured **greatly** since my mental health issues of middle school, I still get angry. I had a minor tantrum after failing my test, muttering loudly ""Fuck this"" and accidentally making a chair fall over and not picking it up. I refused to do my test corrections and I sat outside in the sub-freezing weather for an hour. I just got a whole fucking lecture about how my tantrum reflects poorly on me and my parents, I just felt so numb. Like for once, I had genuinely cared about Kumon and the test, and I could have passed if he just bent the rules a little. I just don't care about Kumon anymore, and I don't have time to even finish my homework in a timely manner, as I started High School Swimming for the first time this year and I get home at 7:30 most nights. *I was 2 steps from killing myself on Wednesday*, because I thought my sister in 8th Grade had taken the same test I had taken and passed it. 

I haven't told my parents about this because I don't want to get fucking institutionalized again, but they just don't get it; that I'm trying my best to balance high school, swim team, and having some fucking friends. I'm just so frustrated and done, I act arrogant and smug every day at school and in general in order to hide my intense stress and helplessness. 

&amp;#x200B;

A common rebuttal to the hardship and stress that my parents would have is just to pray to God, because our family is Asian and we're Southern Baptist. I don't believe in God anymore. My perspective is that if God is real, why would he let one of his ""children"" who are ""made in his image"" undeserved mental illness and such terrible and stressful circumstances? Anyways, I've been wanting to tell my parents that I don't want to go to church anymore and that I'm absolutely ready to renounce my faith and just unplug from my church, but I'm scared that they'll make me go to Jesus camp or sit down with my pastor to ""save my faith"", or even cast me out of the family social life. Also, I need a pastor's recommendation for college in 2 years, so I don't know what to do right now. On top of this, I have to go to Friday Night Youth Group, and I just don't want to waste 3 hours in city so I can get my fucking feelings hurt more than they do already by my parents and Kumon. 

I see a psychologist every other Monday, but I just don't see him enough for it matter. His schedule is full, so IDK what do. 

Last thing, my parents won't let me quit on the spot, unless they get some really compelling reason to let me (i.e. I attempt suicide because of another failed test).

**Essential Backstory**


I am 22, am male and my sister is 14. She has one other sister, who is 25. She also has 4 living brothers, myself included. Including our mother, my sister has a total of 2 female role models to teach her anything at all about being a woman. 

This is important because this family has had a violent history involving brutal physical and sexual abuse. In the latter, my older sister (the 25 year old) was the victim. She was very young. The damage is significant and the issues she has make her somewhat less than qualified to handle a stubborn teenager (That aside if she happens to see this, I still love her very much). I am unsure how to, or even if I should, approach any kind of talk about safe sex. 

I feel this will become relevant when she inevitably begins to go to parties, especially if she’s high and/or drunk.

My mother and drugs are mutually exclusive. They are incompatible and should never be mixed. She would literally ground my younger sister completely until the age of 18 if she were to find out. For this reason I do not want to tell her or involve her.

The drug in question is marijuana. It is not legal where I live, though I have no issue with it. I’ve used it in the past and my family knows. I started when I was 15 and for some time I was heavily dependent on it. I have since moved past that but I regret every bit of it and likely always will.

**The Plot**

My younger sister approached me and told me straight up she’s smoked weed and enjoyed it. I told her that while I don’t have a problem with it, and won’t just tell on her, I do not believe she should use it while she’s so young. Never mind the exact effects it has on a growing child, I’m not qualified to discuss that. 

Purely the legal issue was enough to tell her that I will not help her get it, nor condone her using it, until she is at least 18. When she’s an adult, if it is still illegal, it is her decision to make. If she wants to risk breaking the law, I’ll do my best to keep her safe but I won’t take away her choice.

It’s come to my attention that she didn’t listen to me. She’s still trying to use it, to the point where she went behind my back and asked one of my personal friends to sell her some. Lucky for me he’s a good person and immediately told me. I know he won’t sell it to her. 

She openly told me she uses it as an escape. The violence that plagued us in the past is gone now, but the wounds are still very much raw. I understand exactly how she feels but I cannot let her make the same mistakes I did. I used it almost constantly, to the point where I felt almost nothing all the time. As I mentioned I’m moving past that slowly.

She will only open up to me about this. She says she “can’t talk about that stuff” with a therapist. I have told her what it did to me, though it’s hard to convey it in words that really sink in for a child. 


**The Big Questions**


Should I be the one trying to educate her in this situation, or should I be directing this to someone more qualified?

How much should I try to force her hand in this? At what point am I restricting her freedom as a human being?

How can I word all of this to a 14 year old girl who thinks VSCO (whatever that is) is like the greatest thing in history?",13Dec2019,1
265,"Throwaway account just in case. This is fairly long and I apologize for that. 

I teach middle school STEM. Today during second block (which is a class of 6th graders and one seventh grader who is repeating the class) I had to leave the classroom for all of 15 minutes for a mandatory meeting. The front office has a team of parent volunteers and substitutes that they send as aid to fill in during scenarios like this. The class was instructed to continue their group work while I had to step out. 

When I arrived back to the class the aid left the room and all seemed fine with the students but a note on my desk said “Student A called Student B the n-word.” (Names obviously omitted/changed). For relevant context here, both of these students are white males and this is completely out of character for them. My plan was to retain them after class to discuss the matter. 

Five minutes after I returned to class, the assistant principal, guidance counselor, and in school suspension officer show up at my door and request that Student B and Student C be allowed to leave. (Student C, the 7th grader, is a person of color. Student B and Student C have a history of not getting along.) I assumed that the aid must have written down the wrong names at this point. But 10 minutes later, Students B and C return back to class and the guidance counselor &amp; ISS officer then ask me and Student A to meet with them. They bring another aid with them but the assistant principal was not present. 

Student A is asked what happened and his generalized response was: Student B took a piece of the building project and wouldn’t cooperate. Me and the other person in the group asked him to give it back and finish the work. Student B told me to do it for him because I’m the ginger nerd freak. I asked him to please just finish the work and he told me to shut the f-word up. I just lost my last nerve and told him to shut up n-word. Student C stood up on the other side of the room and started yelling at me “What did you say little white boy?! Say it again!” over and over again. I curled up in a ball on the floor and the aid told him to go sit down. When I started to get back up Student B punched me in the chest and called me a weak b-word. 

His explanation was full of tears, apologies, and remorse for his actions. 

Again, student A is a white kid (red headed. Hence the ginger comment) who makes nothing but straight As and hasn’t once gotten a negative conduct mark. Student B is also a white male but often needs redirection. Student C is a person of color who’s easily 100lbs heavier than either one of them. 

The counselor, ISS officer and I ask Student A to step outside. We all agree that the appropriate course of action is to contact the parents of Student A for his first offense. The assistant principal walks in bringing student A from the hall and informs all of us that his punishment will be one day of in school suspension and one day out of school suspension. She berates him until he’s crying again about how disgusting he is for using that word and that he shouldn’t ever even want to think about saying it again. 

When she walks out I excuse myself to tend to my class and once in the hallway out of earshot of student A I ask her if she really thinks that’s appropriate considering the entire scenario. She stops, turns around, and asks me “Do YOU think it’s appropriate for whites to use that word?” before storming off to her office and slamming the door. Assistant principal is also a person of color. 

Student A received his formal disciplinary action showing that his offense was “committing immoral or vicious practice” as well as “uses profane/obscene language” and that his punishment is one day ISS and one day OSS. 

Students B &amp; C? Our write ups for them were returned and marked as disregarded by the assistanf principal. So they received no disciplinary action.

We're in the middle of a crisis. In the family, there's my mom and dad in their early 60s and four kids ages 19-30. Just trying to set the scene and let you know we're all adults now and have been dealing with this for varying numbers of years for each family member. 

My mom is addicted to sleep. She will do anything to sleep 10+ hours a night. From downing entire bottles of melatonin to using a cocktail of hydrocodone/restoril/Ativan/Ambien/alcohol, she's done it all over the past few decades. Again and again my dad has trusted her and given her way many more chances than she deserves. She continues to manipulate doctors into prescribing her meds and hiding the bottles all over her room. Last night, we once again went into to her room to find her babbling, sitting on the floor, confused and weak. (Episodes like this happen every 2-3 months with smaller ones between) It took us an hour to get her back into the bed. We filmed some of the night to show her in the morning (as we've done several times before but always chickened out and deleted it). When we showed it to her though, her only excuse was that ""at least I don't do it every night."" There have been times she has gotten on her knees and apologized profusely, swearing to never do it again. It always ends up the same though. One time, when I was around 18-19, she threatened me with a knife in the kitchen. I personally struggle forgiving her for that and all that has come after... This includes a two year long stint where I took her to the ER 5-6 times a week for unknown stomach pain, nausea, and migraines. A gastroenterologist eventually diagnosed her with a disorder called Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome, but she is still labeled as a drug addict at all the local hospitals and it's hard for us to know if she was faking or not too! 

Anyway, back in 2011, we took her to a rehab facility. It didn't help -- in fact, it made her denial worse. She is a nurse, so when the board found out about her hospital stay, they took action against her license. She had to do mandatory drug tests and go to AA and NA meeting several times a week. She continued to declare that she didn't have a problem for these two hard but thankfully clean years. After it was over, the records were sealed, she received her license back in full form, and she was able to work again with no restrictions. She loves her job and we are scared to have to take it away from her again. But we're at the end of our ropes and don't know what else to do besides another rehab. 

The mother-daughter relationship we had is completely broken. I really have to watch myself not to yell and scream every time we speak. Sometimes I don't do so well at that anyway. My brothers feel similarly -- especially the 19-year-old who was sheltered from this chaos for as long as possible. What's worse is my dad is really starting to struggle with his relationship with her too. She blames everything on him -- especially money problems stemming from the fact that she's a compulsive shopper and will sometimes get ""high"" and go on online shopping sprees. She even is blaming him for ruining Christmas this year because we ALL said that we didn't want to focus too much on material goods and presents but on more family time. Apparently giving presents was her favorite part of the holidays and we TOOK it from her! Ugh

We don't know what to do anymore. We don't want to ruin her long career as a nurse but also can't keep watching her do this to herself and her family. It's gotten to the point where we are scared for her life.",13Dec2019,1

277,"Don’t get me wrong, I love my friend. But her behavior makes it a constant strain. It’s hard to be around her and just not constantly think about it. 

She contracted herpes about 2 years ago and has constant outbreaks. We work in a male dominated field. There’s only 3 of us women on the pipeline. 

She constantly sleeps with me without telling them she has herpes. Someone of these men have babies on the way. And or married. 

My moral compass keeps nagging at me to speak up and tell them. Because her thought process is “the only way they’ll know is if they get blood work, so how will they know I gave it to them” and “I never asked to get this, so why should I let it affect my sex life” she also has her tubes tied. So she just sleeps with everyone , and I mean everyone. 

Would I be a terrible person to warn the guys she peruses, or has already Slept with and tell them of her status. I feel horrible how these people are being purposefully deceived all for her own decisions and not including them.",13Dec2019,1

The dreams are usually extremely realistic &amp; its always the same: we ended back together and i feel happy af. But then i wake up &amp; end up feeling shitty. 


This girl meant the world to me &amp; she helped me through a rough period, she’ll always have a piece of my heart, however i wish &amp; felt that i moved on, i often feel like i im ready to meet someone new, but these dreams they really mess with me &amp; ruin my day whenever i have them. Does anyone have any advice on how i can get rid of these dreams?  

Is it that im not over her &amp; its my subconciousness kicking in? Or where do these dreams come from?

280,"My friend, let's call her Abby, recently confided in me that she had been flirting with some guy, ""Ben"". At first I was sort of confused as to why she was acting like it was such a big deal, she told me he was a family friend but I couldn't tell anyone that they had been flirting with one another. I just assumed she wanted to keep it on the down low with her parents (our families are very close so if I had told my mum, her mum would find out straight away) 

I honestly encouraged her quite a bit with this guy because Abby has had a bit of a rough time recently and she sounded really excited about things Ben and her would do. She hadn't mentioned anything really intimate, just that he would tell her she looked hot, whisper in her ear, hug her, rest his hand on her shoulder etc. All just flirty things that she'd reciprocate. I thought it was just normal fun between two teenagers and that she was having a good time so why discourage her? 

Recently however I found out that he's actually 23 years old. I knew he was older but I thought he would be maybe 18 at the max, even that seems like a large maturity gap for kids our age. I was really shocked and now I feel terrible about encouraging her and grossed out by the things he said to her. I also found out that they plan on getting more intimate with one another and I can't think of a way to tell her that it's not okay without hurting our relationship as friends and her feelings. 

Abby is really headstrong and I know she wouldn't see it for what it is if I told her my opinion. I also know that quite a few bad things have happened in her life the past few months and she's a bit vulnerable right now and I'm afraid Ben knows this and is taking advantage. 

What should I do, if I should even do anything? Where I live the age of consent is 16, so legally there's nothing wrong with it as far as I know but I feel like I'm being a shitty friend by letting her go through with this.",13Dec2019,1
281,"Hey guys. 
Basically I have a younger brother around the age of 14, and I’m in my early 20s. Him and I don’t have the best relationship; in fact, we have no relationship at all. We don’t really speak to each other &amp; when we do it’s just very forced 2 minute conversation. We walk past each other in the house, we go days without talking. I have other siblings as well, it’s just him I’m not close with.
The reason for this is because he’s shy, and kind of a different kid. He’s an ILP student, meaning he’s not the brightest. He’s confused majority of the time, spends his days stuck daydreaming and thinking within himself. He also doesn’t have many friends. I truly worry about him because I know he feels lonely and left out in life. 
I myself struggle to talk to him because the only topics he likes to conserve in is movies/trailers, avengers, video games. That’s literally it.
What can I do to improve my relationship with him? How can I help him throughout life?",13Dec2019,1
282,"2019 was probably one of the worst years of my life. My mental health began to plummet in January and has since completely taken over my life. Depression, anxiety, ocd all hit me very hard at once. 

If that wasn’t already hard to deal with, my fucking birthday was when my life started to take an entire 360 and I lost so many people who meant the world to me. My best friend who was my constant is no longer in my life, another very close friend of mine who was becoming the best part of life moved away, and I broke up with my boyfriend. This all happened in literally a week. 

I have another friend who has been my best friend since birth, who lives literally next door to me, but our relationship is extremely strained and we aren’t exactly the best of friends right now. It makes me really sad. 

I have one great friend, though. She is amazing, honest, caring. If I didn’t have her I don’t know if I’d be alive right now. 

Shit fucking sucks right now. I have a job and that’s fine, but I don’t know what else to do to just not be fucking sad for once. I need advice, I miss my friends. I miss my ex so so much. Mental health sucks. What can I do to make my situation better right now? Thanks :(",13Dec2019,1

285,"So recently, about a month ago, my friend told the girl he's liked about how he feels.  They've been in limbo for a year at this point, and he needs an answer.  He wants to just get this off of his chest.  She doesn't say whether she likes him or not, just that he shouldn't wait for her because she needs to get herself figured out before exploring guys, or something to that effect.  It's kinda ambiguous what she feels about him, but he is understanding and moves on without making things too awkward, and they remain friends.

Today, a month later, she decides to get on Tinder.  When she said she wouldn't be ready for guys for a while just weeks before.  She essentially lied to my friend, saying she wasn't ready for guys, when really she is.  To make matters worse, her and her friend literally teased him to his face, saying ""will you swipe right on her if you see her?""  My friend seemed to take it okay in the moment, but when the girls were gone, he told me how shitty it felt to be lied to like that.  He seems to be taking it really hard, and his (ex) crush is blissfully unaware of how messed up she was to him.  She even told a couple of my friends he liked him back in summer, so I guess that's not accurate either?

Anyways, I want to call her out.  She's treated my buddy like crap for long enough, and I think she needs to know how messed up she's being.  While I'm driving the four of us around, my friend is sitting in the passenger seat, hurting, while she giggles with her bestie about cute guys in the back seat of my car.  Is this an overreaction?  Should I tell her that what she did was wrong?  I just don't think it's fair for my friend to feel so shitty about himself because she couldn't be straight with him.

289,"I live in a 100 year old building with 2 other units. A couple just moved downstairs and they have two dogs, a small one and a bigger one. They are at ground level and they bark at every single person, dog and car that passes by. The small one usually starts the barking and that teiggers the big one, which statts barking and then howling. Their front door has a glass and whenever I leave the apartment or come back home, the dogs bark like crazy and the big one jumps on the glass hitting it with his front paws, and it feels like it might actually break it one day. They basically make me feel unwelcome in my own home, and this whole thing decreased the quality of my life since they moved back in July. I thought the do dogs would get used to the new apartment by now but I don't think that will ever happen. And the neighbors are aost never home, so the dogs go mental when they are home alone. As an example, they left for 10 days ober Thanksgiving and somebody came once or twice a day to walk them, but other than that they kept barking most of the time. How do I deal with this? I love animals (we have a cat) but I find myself really hating these dogs. I secretly wish they break down that window one day so I can call the landlord and have them kicked out or something. I didnt talk to the neighbors yet, they are almost never home and I feel like that would be very awkward. I think I'm going to have to talk to them at some point, so how do I do it?

I've known I was gay for awhile now, but we've been dating since our freshman year of highschool, so a bit over 2 years. I always pushed my feelings down, never discussed them, and I need help.

If I wasn't gay, she'd be the one. I dont want to make her become depressed or anything. For her privacy, I'll call her G.

G also has said she lives me, several times. 

 I'm also really into this guy (let's call him Matt). He sits in front of me in math and plays basketball with me and my pals about every day or so. He's really cute, all that stuff. Also, I know he's gay, as we may have confessed feelings for eachother.
I need help ending things with G. I know, I know, teenage drama is the WORST. I just need some advice. 

Matt really likes me, and he's closeted too. I dont want G to be mad at him. I feel really bad about this, but I cheated on G with him. We were making out in the car after going to a movie, and I feel really bad about it. It was a moment of weakness. G doesnt know, and I know I'm a horrible guy, I'm just freaking out.

297,"I am desperately in need of good advice. I have never been in such a situation before, nor have I ever heard of a similar one. I (35M) have been married to my wife (39F) for ten years now. We have a three year old daughter and earlier this month, we discovered that she is pregnant with our second child. However, the problem has no relation whatsoever with this pregnancy as it is still in its initial stages.

My mother (71F) is a skilled artist. She took up painting at the age of 53 and learnt it so quickly that her paintings began to receive critical acclaim within about five years or so. She mostly paints still-life paintings and landscapes. However, she has recently developed an inclination towards depictions of the human figure and since my wife is exceptionally good-looking, she occasionally poses as a model for my mother.My mother has often requested her DIL (whom she calls ""my sweet beauty"") to pose naked but my wife, who was brought up by conservative parents, was averse to the idea. So far so good.

My wife and my mother also have another shared interest - chess. They discovered each other's interest in chess earlier this month, just before the pregnancy. Since then, my wife has often expressed a desire to pit her skills against her mother-in law. My mother jokingly warned my wife that she would lose at least ten times in a row and eventually lose her interest in the game. My wife responded with a laugh and bet my mother that she would pose naked for one of mother's nude paintings if my mother could beat her ten times in a row.As expected, the bet that was proposed by my wife was sufficient to convince my mother to take up the challenge.

They have played each night for the past nine days, and my wife has lost to my mother each time. Last night, my wife remarked that she would have to brace herself for this unique experience of posing naked. I reminded her of the option of refusing to play tonight, but she turned it down. She seems to have accepted defeat as a foregone conclusion. What can I do to boost her spirits so that she does not lose and go through what might be an embarrassing experience for her?

TL;DR: My wife bet my mother that she would pose naked for my mother' painting if she could beat her at chess ten times in a row. She has already lost nine games. How can I help her avoid the embarrassment of losing ten times in a row and posing naked for a painting?",13Dec2019,1
299,"In grade 3 i was bullied which triggered the start of my anger. Met a good friend in grade 4, lost her the next year, and starting turning really really angry in grade 5. I would never exhibit the behaviour in public but my temper was terrible at home. I threw temper tantrums every single day. I remember one time I even slapped my mom on the cheek. Currently, I’m in grade 9, and ever since grade 5 my temper has been bad. I’m able to control it, but only to a certain extent(Istill slip out a few salty words now I then). My friend, although not on purpose, angers me all the time, interrupting me in class and always talking about her feelings when I don’t care at all. At this point i have no empathy towards her, even when she told me that she’s depressed and wants to disappear and that she used to contemplate suicide. I understand her pain (sympathy) but i don’t feel her pain in the slightest (empathy). Although I know this isn’t the truth according the general public’s opinion, I don’t like when she shares her feelings with me and I find it annoying, and i’ll try not to get angry, but i can’t help it. And on the inside I’ll want her to stop sharing her feelings but on the outside I try to act like I care (which usually fails). I don’t share my feelings with anyone; the person who’s now closest to me (my mom) has never shared her feelings with me but it is still a pretty good relationship; and I don’t lik when feelings are the main bond for a relationship. I know people are gonna say “there’s something wrong with you” and “you need therapy” and “you’re probably traumatized” to me, but that is honestly advice i would never apply in real life.

300,"First up, the situation: There is a concert in my city, tommorow which is Friday. It's super hype, and I don't have tickets, so I am trying to buy tickets off Craigslist. I found a guy, willing to send me the ticket if I send him an e transfer, and once I scan the ticket in, send him the password. At first I thought this was fool proof, but as I thought about it, some potential problems arose.

The Craigslist posting: [here](https://vancouver.craigslist.org/van/tix/d/vancouver-winter-breakout-2019-tickets/7037324210.html)

The potential scam: in running this over with a friend we came up with a potential scam. He sends me the ticket, I send him an e-transfer, but, he has autodeposit set up so it doesn't require a password, and he immediately gets his money. It doesn't even matter if the ticket is even a ticket, cause he has his money.

The potential fix: Once I get the details, I e transfer 5 bucks, if it goes straight through no password, I'm fucked, other wise I'm chill and I send the rest and then give the password later once I'm in. 

The question: is there something I don't know here, can anyone else notice a scam that he could be running, or does it seem pretty safe.

Since  I didn't want to cut back my hours at work i took all my classes online. I decided to only start with three classes this semester (9 credit hours)  just to see how much i could handle and balance school and work, and my parents told me that doing it online was going to be difficult and that i needed to stay on top of it which i told them i would. It was going fine for a while and I was staying on top of my classes and still working full time, but then work began to get busier and I didn't have as much time for school. I started to fall behind and eventually just started avoiding school all together. I have a bad habit of avoiding things when they are stressing me out. I avoided school so much that i totally quit doing it. The semester is now over tomorrow basically and i already missed one of my finals because i've been avoiding school so much I didn't even know when the final was. Due to the stress and anxiety of me doing so bad in school but still avoiding it which obviously made it worse and the stress of work and home life  i've been pretty depressed and so lost.

308,"Hi, I’ve never made a Reddit account before. I usually lurk via YouTube videos, so I’m hoping that I’m doing this right. I’d really appreciate some advice. I’m one of nine kids, my mom has had kids since she was a teenager and she’s never gotten to make decisions for herself because she started having to make choices that were the best for her kids early on. She’s been really selfless all her life, putting our needs above all else.  Anyway, she’s currently in a relationship that’s lasted about eight or so years; they’ve lived together for most of it. She stopped loving him a long time ago, but she’s unemployed and it’s hard to care for nine kids by yourself so she’s stayed with him despite it. But then she met this guy and she fell absolutely head over heels for him. They’re best friends and she spends every second she can manage to steal away to be with him. She loves him with all of her heart and the only times I ever see her happy anymore are when she’s with him or talking about him.  The thing is that she told him she’s a single parent. He’s a devoted Christian and the idea of causing someone to lust for a person other than their partner would probably break his heart. (I’m sorry there’s so much context I feel I should supply) So anyway, it’s not hard to tell that my mom and her boyfriend are unhappy. They fight everyday. And then she has to have sex with him to make up for it. It makes me feel really helpless knowing she’s forcing herself to indulge in that just across the house from me just so my siblings and I can have a roof over our heads. He’s obviously noticed that my mom isn’t happy and he thinks she’ll get away if they don’t tie the knot so he asked her to marry him. She didn’t answer at first and he said, “don’t you want to marry me?” And she said “yes.” Today, in the car she said to me, “Op, maybe I should just give up on happiness with [best friend] and marry [boyfriend]” I don’t want my mom to be trapped in an unhappy marriage and say goodbye to the man she loves when she’s never gotten to do anything for her own gain. But she can’t leave her boyfriend. She dropped out of school to raise kids full time, and now she has my autistic little sister she can’t leave home alone while she waitresses.

She ended it one night, I found out later she had been cheating.

My older sister went back to school to get her MBA in another state. Her first year, she got a super energetic Rottweiler behind my parents back. Lo and behold, when the puppy was about ten months old, she was doing so bad in school she had to surprise my parents and give them the dog to take care of. She insists it was a family dog and she wanted to surprise my mom who always wanted a rottie and give her a dog so that she wouldn't have to deal with the difficulties involving puppyhood. Found out in a short amount of time that my parents are extremely bad at properly training them and would have had a dangerous dog. The whole situation was face palm worthy. Conveniently, I graduated at that time and my parents negotiated with me 100% responsibility of the dog in exchange for a much lower rent (I was definitely not fond of dogs at the time). Over the year, I grew to love this dog so much and got over my dislike of dogs (I have a huge passion for them now). I trained him and he is doing beyond great (were excelling in dog sports!), but it sucked deep down knowing he wasn't mine. 

It's currently my sister's winter break and she's back home for a month. We're about two weeks in and I am so frustrated with her narcissistic behavior (she disregards everything I worked on and claimed it's because the dog is great or that she already taught him that etc.). I don't get to do any of my normal activities with him and she's constantly playing with him so he doesn't get any rest time and is exhausted (the dog doesn't know it's limits). Also spoiling him like crazy and allowing bad behavior (there was a lot of training I had to work on when I took over). My parents are nonchalant about it and dont understand the fuss I make about making sure a dog needs training. I keep explaining that if he didn't have any sort of ""work"", he would wreck the house up. I feel constantly angry and irritated but I feel i have no right to because it's not my dog. My sister is going to graduate next May and also going to move back home to save up money and I know I cannot live like this. 

I feel like I already know the solution as I type this up. Move out and get my own dog, but rent is so expensive here (2k/month for 1br/1bath). Is that worth it to dig myself deeper in debt? I could live with roommates, but it's no one I would know. What about splitting living costs with my boyfriend you ask... Well, I can't stand his living conditions at all (I'd basically be the housemaid cleaning up after a teenage boy). Actually I'm really frustrated with him and questioning my relationship but keep convincing myself that we've been together for so long etc. We've changed so much since we graduated from college. 

As for my job, I feel unmotivated and I feel like I'm just ungrateful. Shouldn't I feel excited because I'm doing a job that's related to my college major? Shouldn't I feel grateful because it's helping me with loans? Last month I reported one of my supervisors for sexual harrassment and they kept him with the same position and everything but just moved him to another location nearby. 


Anyway rant over. I can't help but feel that I'm just being ungrateful and everything I'm feeling is invalid. I don't really know any solutions besides moving out that would help me, but dig a deeper loans hole and make my life miserable in other ways. Do i just deal with it?",13Dec2019,1
314,"I’m staying with my grandparents for a few days. I decided I would go with my grandma down town to spend some quality time with her. We did some jobs that she had to do. Nothing too interesting. We grabbed coffee and talked for a little bit. Eventually we left and went to a small cheap shop to purchase some small Christmas decorations. We pick out a few things and headed to the cash register. A young woman was serving us. Everything is going fine until my grandma pays. She hands over a $20 note while asking if she can get a bag. The cashier kindly replies that if she would like a bag it would be an extra 15 cents. My grandma proceeds to tell the woman that having to pay for bags is ridiculous and that the bags should be free. The cashier calmly tells my grandma that it’s a new policy made by the government that you have to pay for bags to reduce harm to the environment. My grandma then holds out her hand and demands the change as well as saying “How do you expect me to walk around town with these items? Young people these days are so rude and disrespectful!” The cashier gives my grandma her change, clearly hurt by her words. My grandma walks out of the shop first. I stay behind until she’s out of the door. I apologised to the woman for my grandma’s actions and then quickly caught up to her. 

I know it’s not my fault that this happened. But I feel guilty, like I should have said something to prevent my grandmothers words. I understand there is nothing I can do, but I can’t stop replaying the scenario. What should I do?",13Dec2019,1

I just want to know what I should do?

A part of me wants this to be depression just so I can blame it on that but does that mean I don’t have depression? Is it just my mind playing tricks on me? I really don’t know. 

I don’t wanna feel like this anymore. I just wanna feel good, better. I’m tired of being sad and angry at everyone and everything. I just wanna know what’s right and what I should do. 

I don’t want to kill myself. I feel like if things don’t get better soon, I might kill myself. I might end it cause I’m done with the bs. What the heck do I do? I feel like crying right now but I can’t cry because I can’t. I just can’t. I feel like a failure. I feel so angry at everyone. I feel like to die, to scream, to punch the wall, and whatever else.

I never act better than anybody else or make fun of others but I always get put down and made fun of myself which is unfair. Everybody thinks I’m gay so I can’t talk to the other boys without being made fun of. And people talk behind my back and make rumors. While I have been ignoring them it’s really starting to hurt. I want to learn and help others but the people I thought were friends are just using me for quick laughs at my expense or as a tutor.

322,"Gender neutral terms to keep this on low. I don't know who I know that uses Reddit. Sorry if mobile messes all this up.

P1- Abusive Parent
P2- Non-Abusive Parent
S- Sibling
S/O- Significant Other
SOF- Significant Other's Family

I'll try to sum it up. My entire life P1 has been extremely verbally and emotionally abusive. Upon turning 18, going to college and getting a part time job, P1 has been very critical of me and expecting of me. My S has no diploma, is not going for a GED, and works part time. Recently because reasons S has gotten the OK to get even less hours at work, our rent is increasing, the holiday season is ending soon (means less hours for me due to my line of work) and ALL of the financial pressure would land on me. We're a low class family.

I have savings for my S/O and I. Around 1,000. P2 never wants me to have to dig into it, but P1 is very unhappy I keep it from my family and I ""make them suffer"" because of it. I use the excuse that it's to keep paying for college, but especially recently, P1 is sounding like they want me to quit my job and give them all my savings. Not happening.

My S/O has talked to SOF about this. SOF is very understanding, has seen P1 at one of their worst moments, and will take me into their home in a heartbeat. Step 1 of moving out is done. Step 2, go through my things and decide what I should and shouldn't keep. Step 3, have a heartfelt and sad talk with P2 about this. Step 4 is facing P1..

I have had traumatic experiences with P1, have severe anxiety around them especially in conflict and I am constantly on alert at home to see if P1 is unhappy or even awake so I can go out and get food or something. I avoid P1 as much as I can. I don't think P1 realizes just how badly their behavior as a parent has affected me. It gets confusing because sometimes I have positive interactions with P1 but it never feels like a regular nice interaction with a friend or family member would. It feels confusing and conflicting. 

I don't think I'm in a situation where I would be physically harmed. It's definitely a fear, but I don't think it would happen. P1 would definitely yell and be unreasonable, call me this that and the other thing, telling me I'm going to make them suffer, etc. What should I do? How should I approach this? My S/O would happily stand by my side so I could even bear to to it, but I'm not sure it's the best way to go about it. I would ask my friends but I don't think they've had this kind of experience.

TL;DR: Verbally abusive parent. I'm terrified of them. I need to tell them I'm moving in with another family somehow. What do you think would be my best course of action would be?",13Dec2019,1

I didn't even let them in the building, someone else did. Then they start packing up everything and saying that I'm moving home for good- and this was the first I'd even heard of this, there was no warning at all. I tried to stop them myself, but I was unable since there are two of them and only one of me.

I needed that space from them desperately. They found out I was transgender and bisexual and have made my life hell ever since. I tried to involve the Residence Office, but since they're forcing me to sign the forms the office's hands are tied. I should've called security or something I guess, but I was scared to do that. 

Now I'm stuck at home, possibly not going back to college next semester, and losing my shit. Please help.",13Dec2019,1
327,"TLDR at the bottom

Burner account because privacy

My father has been an alcoholic for as long as I can remember. As an elementary school kid I used to look for his bottles that he would hide in his car and give them to my mother. In middle school he would regularly pick me up from football and lacrosse practices and school drunk and think I wouldn't know. At the time I was too scared to say anything but he went to a great rehab center, twice, and was 4 years sober. This still did not help his case with my mother who divorced him after the first rehab visit. In the last year or so he has relapsed. I know addiction is never over and I have been to AA with him and therapy numerous times. He is a really loving father and never acted violently or disrespectfully during those years and I know he is sick with a terrible disease but he has acted differently since relapsing.

 I'm in my third year of school now and I have confidence in telling him when he is fucking up. Most notably I invited some of my friends with my to my families vacation home where he was staying. I went out to my friends place and he offered to cook us all steaks for dinner. When we got home he was hammered. Like stumbling, slurring hammered. I told my friends to go outside and called him out. Of course he denied it so I grabbed his keys so he couldn't wrap himself around a tree. He chased me around the house yelling at me while I was crying (which is pretty difficult do). I'm a lot faster than a fat drunk old man so I was just evading him telling him to go to sleep when he swung on me. It was the slowest haymaker I've ever seen in my life but it hit just as hard emotionally as it would have physically. I hid his keys and my friends helped me stop crying and we drove the two hours home after just 30 hours at the beach. 

More recently I was with my girlfriend in the city and I took the train back to where I live. I had no ride and didn't want to spend the money on an Uber so I called my dad who told me, ""No problem I can pick you up."" He *sounded* fine so I said, ""thanks come fast I really have to shit."" He pulled up and you guessed it... hammered. I got in the car and sat silently until his driving scared the shit out of me. I told him to pull over and let me drive to which he essentially said ""my car, I'm driving."" I called him out and continued to tell him that he's drunk and he kept denying (which I know is a common issue with alcoholism and addiction in general).  I continued to say, ""Dad, I think you are a really great person with a really bad problem and I want you to get help."" He replied, ""I'm a really great person with a really great attitude."" Like, what? I ignored it and thank god we got home safe. He took my to my moms house and as I got out of the car silently he said, ""hey, fuck you."" and drove off. That's the last I've spoken to him.

Every time something like this happens I just want to never talk to him again. I have been so forgiving over the past decade which is literally half of my life. I have extremely close friends whose fathers I would kill to have. I also have an extremely close friend who lost their fathers to cancer who would do anything just to talk to them again. I'm tired of hearing the same thing over and over again. ""I'm tired of living with regret."" ""I'm so sorry for hurting you."" I feel like it is just a repetitive cycle of me forgiving him and trying to help and then him fucking up again and hurting me. I don't know what to do. I want a father and he is the only one I have. I also don't want him to kill himself which is whats gonna happen either by crashing his car or drinking to death. 

TLDR: My very loving and non abusive alcoholic father has been that way for 10 years. After 4 years sober he relapsed and drunk him is an asshole. I'm sick of his shit, but I want a father in my life and he is the only one. WTF do I do?",13Dec2019,1

It was just so, so sad and each time I got a message, my depression would be triggered. I'm still getting bill collector calls for her every day no matter how many numbers I blocked.

330,"My husband gifted me a pedicure at the local salon, it was my first visit there. It seemed a little run down but I was hopeful it would be fine. Today I woke up and my second toe in pain.

She is quite a bit older than me so I don't want to cause conflict and ask her to stop but I 'm trying to figure out a way to neutralize the smell better and deter her in a passive-aggressive way essentially. Is there anything maybe like a febreze plug in that I can put in the common areas that would have a strong smell and help prevent the smoke smell from moving throughout the house?

338,"It's also my first cousin, BUT do not fucking make fun of me. Cousin crushes are very common, most just don't act on it. Cousin marriage is legal everywhere except half the US states (and I live where it's legal). Some possible hints I've gave my cousin, and how she's become kinda mad probably at some of them:

1.I've asked my cousin 2-3 times when she's going to upload another photo to Instagram (last time was July).

2.I've told my cousin's boyfriend that I miss my cousin several times, and when I do that he says she misses me too, but I honestly am sure that's complete bullshit.

3.Because my cousin's boyfriend had stopped responding to my messages (previously he answered almost every time), and I wanted to see if he was actually seeing the messages I sent to him, I sent him a picture of my hip which I had beat until it became red, and I did it because I was incredibly sad that I think my cousin hates me and wants me to die. When I told him why I did it, he told me to stop and that my cousin likes me and cares about me. Again, this is probably complete bullshit, and is actually the opposite.

4.I probably made my cousin irritated when I told her she's the best football player in the world (she plays football in a football team), because I wanted her to feel nice. 

5.Few months ago, when I was at my aunt's 50th anniversary party, I tried to impress my cousin by drinking beer even though I'm not allowed to, and it backfired because she became mad at me and took away the beer, probably just because she just wanted to feel good for herself that she stopped a crime, not because she wanted to care about her little cousin.

6.At the same party, me, my cousin and her boyfriend were going to go outside to take a walk with our dogs, but it was late at night so it was really cold and my cousin became mad at me for not putting on extra clothes, so I couldn't go with them until I put on a jacket. I had told her when I walked outside without a jacket that she wants me to get a cold, and that that was the reason why I did it.

7.I once got a picture of my cousin from my cousin's boyfriend, and I told him to tell her I think she looks good, then he told me she says I look good too. This was probably just a lie though to make me feel good. 

8.I once washed my cousin's plate, bowl and glass after she was done with her midnight snack, but she didn't thank me, which has to be because I’m awful and can't understand anything. I probably shouldn't have expected a thanks, as I'm just a stupid kid.

9.I got really nervous when I met them once, because I was playing guitar and my cousin asked me if I was practising trying to play a song, and well I just said uuuuh um for like five seconds, because I didn't want to say the wrong answer. 

This is why I have a crush on my cousin:

1.She called me cute once when I described what the letters in her name meant.

2.She offered me a ride to the store to buy candy.

3.She offered me her used Coke Zero one time, and although I didn't like it before when I had tried, I drank it because it was my cousin who offered me the drink, and just because I tasted my cousin's used Coke Zero I now drink it instead of regular Coke. That's good I guess? 

4.My cousin made me food once late at night.

5.My cousin let me choose the music we were going to listen to from her phone when we were in the car.

6.She has recommended me several good TV shows.

7.She accepts all my hugs, unlike my most of my friends.

8.She let me excercise with her for one day, even though I don't actually excercise most of the time.

9.She is always so sweet compared to girls in my class.

339,"Please bare with me, this is my first relationship (21F) and I don't have friends who I can talk to this about.

Backstory: I met this guy and we started officially dating a couple of weeks after we met (he asked me to be his gf). The thing is, he only broke up with his girlfriend (of 2 years) a few months prior to us meeting. 

Now I'm not the jealous type and I totally respect that 2 years of history doesn't just go away, but every now and then I get so sad and think that because they are still talking, he's not actually getting over her. My fear is that he will realise what he had and go back to her.

I've talked to him about it and he says that I have nothing to worry about because he's never felt this way about anyone before, but I'm still just so worried about getting hurt.

Weve been together for a few years and shes always told me its just about her kid ( I always stay out of it and havnt seen any communication between them for 2 years)...i looked at her phone tonight after she forgot it and theres pages and pages of messages that have nothing to do with her kid ( I'm not upset about that and its not necessarily anything bad) . But its the constant communication thats bugging me. I can barely get a text from her and had to have a fight just to get a goodnight text. She has no problem talking to him and praising him, sending I love you's, defending him for recent wrongdoings, sending him memes and songs she likes. I get none of that...like Nothing...she barely talks to me unless its to complain about her problems, (though I'm expected to do all the step-dad stuff and family gatherings... which I like doing). She shows no interests in my hobbies or what I do but listens to all his new cover band songs with a 500 word summary of how good it is apparently... She always has to leave town to run an errand where he lives and theres messages making plans to meet up... Maybe I'm just being jealous but I dont like it and dont talk to other women out of respect for her and I just dont feel like what shes been doing is right... kid together or not...she instantly got defensive when I asked about it and said now she cant trust me because I looked at her phone for 5 minutes for the first time in 2 years and now wont talk to me...whats up with that?

346,"It's also my first cousin, BUT do not fucking make fun of me. Cousin crushes are very common, most just don't act on it. Cousin marriage is legal everywhere except half the US states (and I live where it's legal). Some possible hints I've gave my cousin, and how she's become kinda mad probably at some of them:

1.I've asked my cousin 2-3 times when she's going to upload another photo to Instagram (last time was July).

2.I've told my cousin's boyfriend that I miss my cousin several times, and when I do that he says she misses me too, but I honestly am sure that's complete bullshit.

3.Because my cousin's boyfriend had stopped responding to my messages (previously he answered almost every time), and I wanted to see if he was actually seeing the messages I sent to him, I sent him a picture of my hip which I had beat until it became red, and I did it because I was incredibly sad that I think my cousin hates me and wants me to die. When I told him why I did it, he told me to stop and that my cousin likes me and cares about me. Again, this is probably complete bullshit, and is actually the opposite.

4.I probably made my cousin irritated when I told her she's the best football player in the world (she plays football in a football team), because I wanted her to feel nice. 

5.Few months ago, when I was at my aunt's 50th anniversary party, I tried to impress my cousin by drinking beer even though I'm not allowed to, and it backfired because she became mad at me and took away the beer, probably just because she just wanted to feel good for herself that she stopped a crime, not because she wanted to care about her little cousin.

6.At the same party, me, my cousin and her boyfriend were going to go outside to take a walk with our dogs, but it was late at night so it was really cold and my cousin became mad at me for not putting on extra clothes, so I couldn't go with them until I put on a jacket. I had told her when I walked outside without a jacket that she wants me to get a cold, and that that was the reason why I did it.

7.I once got a picture of my cousin from my cousin's boyfriend, and I told him to tell her I think she looks good, then he told me she says I look good too. This was probably just a lie though to make me feel good. 

8.I once washed my cousin's plate, bowl and glass after she was done with her midnight snack, but she didn't thank me, which has to be because I’m awful and can't understand anything. I probably shouldn't have expected a thanks, as I'm just a stupid kid.

9.I got really nervous when I met them once, because I was playing guitar and my cousin asked me if I was practising trying to play a song, and well I just said uuuuh um for like five seconds, because I didn't want to say the wrong answer. 

This is why I have a crush on my cousin:

1.She called me cute once when I described what the letters in her name meant.

2.She offered me a ride to the store to buy candy.

3.She offered me her used Coke Zero one time, and although I didn't like it before when I had tried, I drank it because it was my cousin who offered me the drink, and just because I tasted my cousin's used Coke Zero I now drink it instead of regular Coke. That's good I guess? 

4.My cousin made me food once late at night.

5.My cousin let me choose the music we were going to listen to from her phone when we were in the car.

6.She has recommended me several good TV shows.

7.She accepts all my hugs, unlike my most of my friends.

8.She let me excercise with her for one day, even though I don't actually excercise most of the time.

9.She is always so sweet compared to girls in my class.

TL;DR Does my cousin know I have a huge crush on her?",13Dec2019,1

352,"Throwaway account because my friends know my main.

I'm on mobile so sorry for bad formating.

I live in Korea, if context is important.

Usually at this time of the year I would either be happy, for getting decent grades, or angry, for failing. However, now I don't feel anything.

 Math and statistics were yesterday, while I just finished chemistry and biology. And I think it's safe to say I flunked most of them.
Now I'm home, in bed, browsing reddit, getting ready for my physics and Japanese test on Monday. Usually, failing a test brought sadness and hate. If this was last year, I would have been furious at my self for not performing better. But now, it's like I don't care anymore.

Come to think of it, nothing bothers me or makes me happy like I used to feels a few years ago, and I don't know why.

Ever since I got into high school, I've been staying until 10pm studying. (for those of you who don't know, Korean schools have self studying time, generally from 6pm all the way up to 12) . I'd sometimes sneak in a few games here and there but I don't know if I played them because they were fun or because I wanted to pass the time. In fact, I don't even know what makes me happy know.

Before you tell me that it's because I spend too much time studying...

1. We have so much school work to do that it's practically impossible to catchup without spending a ridiculous amount of time and

2. I don't really have much of a choice either.

I'm, by law, an American resident. Getting into a decent American college might be my only excuse to go back to America(I just want to GTFO of Korea lol), so studying less is an option. Korean schools' tests are very different compared to most American ones. Instead of having a set score goal to pass, we measure our grades by percentile. Top 4% get A. Top 11% get B. And so on. Because of this, tests are ridiculously hard. No matter how hard the test is, there will always be a expected amount of A's and B's. So, despite being in the top 11% of my entire school I have comparably low GPA scores.

Maybe I'm finding out that it's nearly impossible to get into a decent American college. Maybe that's why I feel anything.


Anyways... I don't really know what to do from know on. I guess I'll be studying for my upcoming exams.. Hopefully, they turn out better.

357,"I have a bit of a strange situation where I could definitely use the community's advice. I've always been a bad listener, can't be good at everything I guess. When I think about kindergarten or high school, a lot of the time in class I was just zoned/phased out, dreaming about fantasy novels in my head. When people talk to me for too long, I tend to phase out also. I have a very hard time following the conversation, especially if it gets complicated.

I used to be  a smart kid, so even though I didn't pay a lot of auditive/listening attention, I was able to make up for it by reading/studying the material in a lot shorter timeframe than what was required in class. I had one appointment with a study counsellor in high school who told me that it's not a big deal, he made the analogy that some people are born muscular and some much less so. When a muscular guy trains he will develop a lot more muscle a lot easier than the skinny guy. Just the way the world works and I should focus on what I'm good at.

 At university I would skip the lectures that had good study material and just study it on my own, as I didn't feel like I benefited a lot from being in the classroom.

I always thought my intelligence would be enough and I would not face problems over this, but lately I noticed that my lack of auditive skills have become a problem at work. I have a very hard time following discussions at meetings. The material of my job is very complex and if I can't see it written down, people might as well be talking Chinese to me. I don't ask (a lot of) questions, as I'm conscious about my lack of auditive intelligence and I will just try and understand everything later at my desk so I can perform my task.

This has worked for a while, but I have encountered several situations where I will ask in a meeting 'shouldn't we discuss this?' where they pointed me towards the fact that this was what the whole discussion was about, so I just wasn't able to follow it apparently. When I follow a meeting for co-workers, and I have to provide them feedback afterwards, I can't really tell them a lot as most of the times I didn't really understand what the discussions were all about or how it impacts our project, until I sit down and write up the project on my PC and the puzzle starts to fit. This doesn't come over well.

Anybody ever encountered this situation? Being intelligible on paper/written communication, but much less so in auditive communication/meetings? FYI I am a medical writer, so the largest portion of my job (writing on the pc) fits my personality, but the meetings are very tough for me.",13Dec2019,1

359,"I am desperately in need of good advice. I have never been in such a situation before, nor have I ever heard of a similar one. I (35M) have been married to my wife (39F) for ten years now. We have a three year old daughter and earlier this month, we discovered that she is pregnant with our second child. However, the problem has no relation whatsoever with this pregnancy as it is still in its initial stages.

My mother (71F) is a skilled artist. She took up painting at the age of 53 and learnt it so quickly that her paintings began to receive critical acclaim within about five years or so. She mostly paints still-life paintings and landscapes. However, she has recently developed an inclination towards depictions of the human figure and since my wife is exceptionally good-looking, she occasionally poses as a model for my mother.My mother has often requested her DIL (whom she calls ""my sweet beauty"") to pose naked but my wife, who was brought up by conservative parents, was averse to the idea. So far so good.

My wife and my mother also have another shared interest - chess. They discovered each other's interest in chess earlier this month, just before the pregnancy. Since then, my wife has often expressed a desire to pit her skills against her mother-in law. My mother jokingly warned my wife that she would lose at least ten times in a row and eventually lose her interest in the game. My wife responded with a laugh and bet my mother that she would pose naked for one of mother's nude paintings if my mother could beat her ten times in a row.As expected, the bet that was proposed by my wife was sufficient to convince my mother to take up the challenge.

They have played each night for the past nine days, and my wife has lost to my mother each time. Last night, my wife remarked that she would have to brace herself for this unique experience of posing naked. I reminded her of the option of refusing to play tonight, but she turned it down. She seems to have accepted defeat as a foregone conclusion. What can I do to boost her spirits so that she does not lose and go through what might be an embarrassing experience for her?

TL;DR: My wife bet my mother that she would pose naked for my mother' painting if she could beat her at chess ten times in a row. She has already lost nine games. How can I help her avoid the embarrassment of losing ten times in a row and posing naked for a painting?",13Dec2019,1
360,"Hi all

My grandma has passed away. Her family owned slaves back when it was legal and then held a large sharecropping operation for many years after it was not. Materially not much changed to the people who worked the land until the practices were outlawed. Their wealth slowly collapsed during the 50s-80s and she went to live in the city with her children. Most of the family are successful business people in their own right, a lot of them got start-up funds via familial wealth.

This was pretty ""normal"" practice for the time, in the area, for a large landowning family. The part that I feel ""guilty"" to have witnessed is that until her death my grandmother had a handmaiden/ maid that had been given to her when she was a teenager to ""look after her."" In later years and definitely once she moved to the city the woman was given a salary and  did technically have the workers protections of a modern domestic house-worker, but she had been in it so long that she did not ever try to leave. Called my grandma ""mistress,"" ""if it please the lady,"" all that. In my years of childhood visiting each year I have watched my grandma humiliate, berate, abuse, hit, scald with hot water, unscrew light-bulbs from her room to keep her in darkness on her day ""off"" when she messed up the breakfast or the cleaning (even on days ""off""). 

The handmaid woman is now in hospice care paid for by my uncles and father who see the handmaid as the woman who raised them. My father in particular hates my grandmother but still has contact with her. He has told me many times that his family has an evil root, that she is evil, and that he ran away from home when he was young to avoid getting into their whole nexus. 

However she has left money for each grandchild (not a ton but a lot like maybe 1 year salary). In general he is sort of a self-made man but he did take a loan from a brother to start his business, around the same amount. He is urging me to do the same. I do not have a business I want to start but I am not opposed to starting one ""one day"" like he says. I am mostly self-sufficient I left at 18 and did not follow the goals they had for me and have worked for my bills however each year at Christmas and birthday they have given me lavish gifts like phone, clothes, gift card, one time a pretty new car for 25th. I work in a good trade and think I will advance but still am on the bottom rung. I could see starting my own llc one day doing what I do.

I feel as though taking this money would be evil. I am tempted. I want to give it away to charity but feel like I would end up spending a lot of it or keeping it because seeing that amount in my account will be a different experience. I want to refuse it but know I will offend my cousins who do take it and cause a big familial stir.

TL:DR at the bottom

So last year, I really had not many friends to hang out with. I would often sit by myself in classes and would go out by myself during breaks. I never would have anyone to do anything with. People would kind of... ignore me. It was annoying, and I really just wanted some people to hang out with. That was when I was approached by two people who were in a lot of the same classes as me. I'll call them A and K. They helped me out through a difficult time in my life. I had always struggled with depression and social anxiety, and A and K helped me through one of the darkest years I had experienced. I eventually was adopted into their group of 5 or so people, and it really helped. 

I had hung out with A a bit before in the past, but never really developed that strong of a connection. However, we found out that we had a lot of similar interests, and therefore we bonded really quickly. It wasn't long before she and I would be texting each other and talking a lot. However, between me and K, we never developed that same relationship. K was more of a quiet person around new people but was really energetic around her friends. She was a theatre kid and was very enthusiastic on stage. As we hung out more in class, she warmed up to me more and more, and we started talking about more personal leveled things.

I talked to her a lot about my depression, and she talked a lot about her anxiety. I learned some things about her past life that were quite dark, but looking at her now, you never would have believed what she had gone through. She went through some very dark times in her life, yet remained an amazing person to be around. She had managed to escape her holdbacks and was able to help me through mine. So, even though we were never as close to how close I was with A, I really loved and appreciated my conversations with K.

So, summer comes and passes, and we go back for another year. I learned that K had moved schools, as well as a few other people in our group, and we had a few new people. I kept in touch with K for a little bit, but we eventually fell out of touch about 2 months into the year. Sometimes we would go out as a group, and K would come, and she seemed just as lively as ever. She was energetic, and she seemed really happy. 

This is why it came as such a shock to me that, just a few days ago, I received word that she had killed herself. I don't know any of the details, frankly, I don't really want to know, but it was gut-wrenching. I never had as strong a relationship with K as some of the others in the group, but its been affecting me a lot. It seemed to have come from nowhere.

Loss of life is always a tragedy, no matter who it affects, and K was such a caring, generous person. It just hurts so much to think that something happened that hurt so much that she decided it wasn't worth it anymore. I just think that if she had stayed at the school if we had stayed in touch. If I had been able to help her the same way she got me through my darkest times, maybe something different would've happened. I can't help like feel like I am responsible, because I wasn't there to help her as she helped me so much. 

I haven't seen anyone in my group since receiving the news, and I am scared to confront them. I haven't been able to do any work, and I just sit there thinking. I haven't been sleeping at night, and it just haunts me. I wake up in a nervous sweat with nightmares about seeing her face.

I just need help. I need advice. I need anything. This is my first real encounter with death, and it plagues me. Please, anything to help...

TL:DR

I have just found out that one of my friends who helped me the most through my darkest times had committed suicide. I cannot help but feel somewhat responsible, because I wasn't there for her like she was for me.

I'm going to tell you about all things related to my height and back injury. So please bare with me.

I'm 164 cm or 5.38 foot tall and have around 70 kg weight.
I used to be taller then my most friends at the age of 12-13 years, then by some miracle i stopped gaining height. Meaning my grew but my friends height grew much faster and now they are much taller than me. 
Compared to them, my height grew at a pace of a turtle.

And now when I'm in my last year of college, some of my college friends who were shorter than me in 1st year have surpassed me in terms of height. 
It is like my height (though in turtle pace) was growing in school but in college years i didn't grew an Inch.

And now some information about my physical activities career. 
I was an athlete in my School. I used to have great pace and competed in many many races like sprint and half marathons although my competitors were huge in height compared to me but i used to outclass them. At that time i was around 55-60 kgs weight.

When i joined college I became a amateur boxer. I was around 60-65 kgs of weight at this point. Though it was a short career, i won one silver medal at a high level tournament. I stopped boxing because of my injury that occurred to me during an exercise session. IT IS A ""L4-L5 DISK BULGING OR HERNIATED INJURY"" WHICH IS CAUSING ME PAIN RIGHT NOW AS I'M WRITING THIS REQUEST. 
Doctor says i have to rest a lot. And because of this rest that i been taking for nearly 1and half years i have grown good amount of tummy 😂.

Frankly speaking I never get intimidated by anyone whether short or tall. But People usually (and this is what i think) get intimidated by me because of my muscle mass in my body. 
I have never stepped inside a gym ever but from very young age of 8 years i occasionally used to do pull ups, push ups and i used to Lift large amount of weight.

Global warming is natural
The earth is going to flood and ‘reset’
The earth is flat, domed, 
Planets dont exist
Crystals can heal

Can't decide whether going completely bald from Now would be healthy for me or not.

378,"Okay, hear me out. This might sound stupid but I'm currently in a friend group with people a few years younger than me. (I'm 17 and they're around 14-16). Two of them are transgenders and the rest (2) identify as non-binary. I'm a very open and accepting person so when they first came out I had absolutely no problem adjusting to the new pronouns and changes (sometimes I got confused accidentally though but I got used to it now).

But then the more I was accepting the more they started diving into the labels. One of the non-binary people used to be female but then they claimed to be non-binary because sometimes they liked to dress in a feminine way and sometimes masculine?? I didn't want to come off as rude but I told them that gender norms don't exist and that they're a society construct, so they can still be female while dressing up as a guy. They said that they just feel this way.

One of my transgender friends was influenced by my other friends coming out as non-binary and they decided to identify as they/them as well.. and the reason for that was because they started putting on make-up.

It just feels off to me that they're throwing around labels based off their interest in make-up and ""feminine clothes"" and excuse it as dysphoria. 

I cannot be in a conversation with them without them saying things like ""my non-binary ass just got a new shirt!"" or ""my transgender gay ass is attracted to this man"" etc. Their overuse makes it seem to me that they're taking it as a trend more than an actual issue.

I just feel like in their cases it's more like insecurity in being female, because when I was younger I used to prefer to pretend I was a guy online. 

They're young so I don't know if it's just an age thing or if I'm the uneducated one to be honest.

I don't know if I'm right or wrong, or whether I should confront them about it or not.",13Dec2019,1
380," I’m currently 16 (M), my birthday is in 5 days from this post. I’ve felt the need to make a post like this for a little over a year but kept dismissing it as me wanting attention or unearned sympathy. Honestly, the reason  I am making this now is because I can’t sleep. I just think about what I’m going to do with my life.

 I can’t stand myself and I don’t know what to do.  I’m 16, I don’t have my license,  I’ve never had a job, I only have 2 friends (one being my cousin), I am in 11th grade and only have about 6 credits, and I go to online school. 

 I know this is my fault. When I first started junior high (7th) They put me in 8th grade honors classes. Being 12, I got really heavy anxiety about going to school because all of my friends were in regular classes and I felt like everyone in my 8th grade classes hated me. I got really depressed and stopped going to school, stopped eating (heathy at least), stopped doing much other than playing video games. Whenever my mom would try to drag me to school, I would fight her and complain about my stomach hurting. 

 After about a month of not going to school I had finally convinced my mom I was sick or something so she took me to the doctor. The doctor found that I was “extremely constipated” (Probably because I got so lazy that I didn’t bother going to the bathroom) I have used the whole constipated thing as an excuse for me missing school since.

As you can probably tell, I got kicked out of my school so my mom had to place me in online school. After doing it for the rest of the year, I decided that I wanted to go back to a physical school. Little did I know that would start a vicious cycle of me being placed in the bottom classes due to my record, me hating school, me leaving, and then wanting to come back.

This repeated until I was in 10th grade. In the process, where at one time I was extremely fit, energetic, social, and had many friends, I had become lazy, antisocial, lost most of my friends, and lost my identity.

Today, I’m an untalented loser. I have no idea what I’m doing and what I truly like. Most of the time I just agree with my friends because I don’t want to lose them. Both my friends are very talented (I don’t know why they stick around) Whenever I try match them I find that I don’t have much talent for most things. 

Sorry if you didn’t really want my whole life’s story. I haven’t told anyone how I truly feel so there was a lot to unpack. But like I said, I am miserable. I don’t know what to do. I want to talk to someone more about this but my family is under a lot of stress and we can’t afford a therapist or a consular, so here I am, finally posting to Reddit and hopefully getting some sleep.",13Dec2019,1
381,"So I was sexually assaulted by a friend when I was drinking and almost passed out. He knew that I was not interested in any kind of relationship, sexual or otherwise. I said no and all that and tried to get away from the situation. 

Basically it started out as very minor, and when I said no, and got mad, he apologized. I tried to leave. He said he was sorry and I thought that would be the end. I wasn't able to leave because I was too drunk. When I tried to go to sleep he assaulted me. 

The whole thing has had me pretty upset. He has been trying to talk to me and meet up. I don't know what I should do. I feel like I should avoid him, but at the same time I don't know if it only happened because he was drunk. I don't even know if he was drunk, just that I was.

385,"Hi, so I've been publicly out as non-binary for a while. I genuinely thought I was enby for a while, until recently when I started to get these feelings I haven't had for a while. Back a few years ago, I was super uncomfortable with myself. I couldn't look at myself in the mirror sometimes, I absolutely hated my chest and wanted it gone, I absolutely hated the idea of being female and wanted to be a male. I just settled as it being me going through puberty and being a weird teen. So basically, I just settled as myself being enby, because I didn't like being male or female (less so female than male but okay).

So that was a fucking lie. Now, I'm facing the same issue. Except it's worst. Now I know it's not because of puberty or whatever because I'm done with puberty. I'm experiencing the exact same thing, except this time I'm genuinely more confused. This time, I feel absolute dread everytime I think of the fact that there's still people who know me as a girl, and people who know me as my dead name and won't call me anything else. I get frustrated over my chest, but I've started binding (I don't know if my method is quite healthy though :/ I bind with two sports bras and four regular bras and it makes it kinda hard for me to breathe). I've started on getting people to call me by my preferred name, and people are actually starting to call me by my name. I've started to work on making my stance more masculine and talking in a lower voice.

I think I may actually be trans..? I don't know though. What if I'm actually not? Plus, most people only know that I'm out as non-binary, and my parents really aren't supportive. When I came out as enby, they said that all they'll ever see me as is a girl, and that they'll only ever call me by my dead name.

389,"So I live with three other people in a four bedroom apartment. Two of those people lived in the college dorms last year and we decided to get an apartment off campus (very close to campus). We did not have a fourth room mate, and we knew that there was a possibility we would get a random. About one month in, it happened. We thought this guy would just be quiet and not have to worry about it, but we were wrong. 
About two weeks into him living there he started having his girlfriend over. It’s fine, if its once in a while. But she has her own place in an apartment that’s on campus. And by week 4 of him living with us, she became a permanent fixture. She is here EVERY NIGHT. And she is VERY ANNOYING, and so is the actual room mate for that matter. That’s lasted from October to the present.
There’s a number of things I can’t stand when it comes to these two. We’re in Buffalo. I get it. It gets cold here. But they will set the thermostat to above 80 degrees! My room feels like a sauna half the time I come back to it! I have to turn on the fucking AC just to get my room down to a normal temperature (apartment has central air). The three of us who actually agreed to live together split a TV for our living room, and this guy and his girl who does NOT PAY TO LIVE HERE will sit on the couch that THEY DID NOT PAY FOR and will laugh hysterically while I’m trying to work in my room. Or sleep. Or anything. 
I want to know how to put a stop to this. It says it in the lease terms that you can’t have someone overnight more than three consecutive nights per month, or six times in a month at all. And we’re well beyond both of those limits. He is violating his lease. I’m sick of her and this guy cooking and then leaving their cooking apparatus out on the counter with water in it to soak. Just clean your damn dishes! Is it that hard? I didn’t sign up to live with this guy, it was random, it happened. If he could get evicted it would be great. But at the very least, I want to make it clear that I did NOT sign up to live with four other people, it was three at MAX. How can I approach him and tell him to stop having his girl over every day? It’s like she lives here now. And I’m worried that it may be set in stone. Advice from anyone is greatly appreciated please.",13Dec2019,1
390,"First of all some background, I live in egypt in alexandria. I have two brothers that are in college in hungary, I'm still here in alexandria in 7th grade. I am thankfully fluent in english because i used to watch youtube videos since i was a kid.

Now lets start the story, My parents were first married in like 1985 somewhere like that and they had my two brothers in 1995 and 1997 and i was born on 2007. Back in 2001 - 2002 my dads business in trading stainless steel (which was bringing the family millions of egyptian pounds) basically failed and it completely stopped and my dad was not working and wasn't getting any money, but because we already had so much money from earlier we just kept spending from our saved up money until he could get back in the business again. Money started to run out so my mom started her own business in making clothes for stores and people and at first was getting us very little but right now (2019) the saved up money from dad's business has completely run out and we are basically living paycheck to paycheck from mom's business. My dad right now is in kuwait trying to get a job (thats what he says) but the problem is **My dad is a really entlitled person** so he only wants to work a job he wants and he is very rude sometimes so he got demoted a lot and he barely pays for food and rent but the problem he has been kicked out of many houses before because nobody likes to be around him and my mom is trying to tell him to change and work any job and don't be rude because **My mom has been waiting for around 17 years for my dad to start his own business again** but my dad blew up on here for even saying that he should get another job and that he is the problem. My parents always get into arguments about this and i personally agree with my mother that my dad is an entitled prick but my dad a) doesn't want to get another job b) is getting demoted and kicked out of houses because how rude he is and c) blows up on my mother when she says he might be the problem and tells her to just wait and how he will change our lives and give us millions of dollars when he gets his business back up and running but for the past 17 years hes said that nothing has changed and right now my dad and mother are in an argument and wont talk to each other because my dad wants to come back to egypt and says ""hes going to start his business again"" but he has said that so many times but doesn't so a single think and is pretty abusive to me and my mother and both my brothers.

&amp;#x200B;

So please tell me what to do right now? Should my mother divorce my dad? i dont know to be honest and i just feel lost and i need advice please This is a pretty simplified version of the story but i think you get the point right now so please send advice.

I've been feeling really empty this year.  I basically feel nothing. I can't even cry about stuff that in the past would make me sob all night. I don't care about anything i would normally worry about. I feel like I don't have a persoanlity. Lately I've been feeling like there's a fog in my mind that doesn't let me think correctly, I don't know how to describe it.

This year I was supposed to improve my life because I started college (I was really excited, because I would turn 18) . I would study, ""make friends"" and think about my future job, draw and  make ton of designs . But I did none of these. For some reason I lost motivation for everything. I only shower when I go to college because I have to, on my free days I don't even bother to do it because I feel like it's not worth my time. 

Years ago I would always find motivation to draw, paint, write, read a book, watch a movie, now I do none of that because I feel like non of that is worthy, I don't see the point of doing anything. 

Last week I was in one of my designs class and had a thought in my mind that said ""Why the fuck are you studying this trash? and it doesn't even make sense because this is supposed to be what I love?  I feel like I don't know who I am anymore or what I believe in. I'm not suicidal but I wouldn't mind dying as life doesn't even make sense anymore 

I want to know whats wrong with me, there's also moments where I would feel like everything is fake, like that feeling you get when you are about to faint? but without the sickness, I've been like that for days

396,"I'm asking this, knowing full well that people are different with how much and what kind of pornography they consume and that every individual is different.

Whenever I watch porn, there is always a moment where I think about my ex-girlfriend, and the moment I think about my ex-girlfriend I immediately close whatever video I am watching and just move onto something else, however I move onto something else feeling infuriated towards her. Like, the moment I think of her as I am watching, I immediately picture her getting railed by the male performer or performers and i just immediately close it and I start feeling agitated. 

I also don't have good erections either. I mean I can still masturbate with them but it's not hard to the point where it could split granite into two which is what I want each and every time I do get aroused or if I end up having a random erection (which I almost never have).  


Partly a reason as to why I keep thinking about my ex being pictured in place of the girl etc is because I hadn't loved anyone as much as I had loved her but she also made me feel incredibly insecure with how ""sexual"" she was. Like, I understand human beings can be sexual, there's nothing wrong with that, but she was too sexual for me to be comfortable with, she'd obsess over celebrities and how she would like to ride their dicks etc and I would always act cold towards her whenever she spoke like that and told her that I would break up with her if she ever spoke like that again but unfortunately she didn't listen.

Ever since then I've disliked majority of sexual things. I get annoyed/agitated whenever someone talks about sex regardless of it being a guy or a girl. I know watching porn is sexual and makes me look like a hypocrite but it's the only outlet I have and I really don't get aroused by anything else even though I don't sit there watching it for 9324348 hours. Each time it happens, I get increasingly frustrated and annoyed by even looking at the faces of porn actresses.

I know I have much deeper things to fix (I know people will say that I need to get therapy to deal with personal issues) I am in therapy, it is helping but holy fuck I'm actually going to lose my mind by feeling like this constantly.

 Every day when I get back to my dorm I always think about how I want to die. I know that sounds dramatic but it’s the truth. There’s always something that reminds me of how much I hate my life before I get back to my dorm. I don’t remember the last time I had a good day, any time my day is going alright it’s guaranteed that something will happen that will remind me of how stupid I am to have even considered letting my guard down.

I have nobody and my passions are just absolutely worthless. All of my friends have gone on to better things and when they graduate they will be making money with the things they care about, all I care about is history. It is the only thing that makes me feel joy no matter what and it’s useless, my history degree will get me nowhere and I feel dumb for pursuing the only thing I care about. 

 It is impossible to feel like anybody would miss me if I were to go, I see my parents and siblings maybe one every couple of months, my friends are too busy for me, and nobody is going to want me romantically. I don’t blame women for not wanting me, I wouldn’t want the girl equivalent of me either. I tried losing weight and have gotten about 80 pounds off since February but it just seems so laughable now. I expected weight loss to be the start of me being happy but everything is just worse. I don’t even know how to describe the feeling of utter failure I have when I look at myself in the mirror, I worked so hard to lose that weight and this is what I have? 

I can’t motivate myself anymore, I don’t know how I even got through finals week. I can’t plan for the future because i don’t expect to be around long term. I know that sounds edgy or whatever but it’s the truth and I don’t really try to dispute it anymore. When I think of a future all I can see is me with no friends, a job that I’ll hate, and no chance at ever having a romantic life, I don’t want to live in that world.

I'm not complaining, but I know my own limits, and working 5 days a week with everything else I have is beyond that.

My dept. head came back to me, asking I stay until Chinese New Year (Jan 25th) rather than before Christmas (Dec 22) as I had originally asked. I signed the paperwork about my resigning with that date, on the basis that she would keep my regular scheduling for the remainder of my stay. However, I have been told that I may need to work up to 40 hours over my winter break. This means I will miss out on a couple of projects that I planned on picking up (school robotics competitions and a play), which I honestly prioritize much more than this job that I've already quit.

We moved together after a few months (living situation before then wasn't ideal) and my advances at being affectionate were met with being labeled as clingy and annoying, they did not work like they should have to keep up with bills which meant that I used unemployment and my savings to cover their half, I was told that I spoke down to them so I changed how I spoke which in turn made me bite my tongue A LOT, had to ask about holding hands, kisses, hugs, normal stuff and felt like a nuisance doing so, cried a lot about behaviors thinking that I was being too hard on them after talking to them about it, got into a HUGE argument about them talking medicine (I slept on the couch and they asked me not to because they didn't want my sibling to see me there and get angry with them), was always told we did not have the funds to do meaningless things, and did not want to go places (like errands) with me, which I considered spending time together, since we didn't really do that at all.  


Breakup: They had an acquaintance whom they weren't fond of that they tried to avoid often. The acquaintance and I befriended each other under the encouragement of their partner and we began talking a lot. We had a lot of similar interests as well as living in the same domestic situation where their partner wasn't as affectionate as they would've liked. We both were essentially living as roommates in our own relationships. After spending a lot of free time together (emphasis on free time, our partners didn't make plans or do much with us) I realized one day that I developed feelings for the friend, my ex and I were arguing about our friendship when I realized it. After feeling guilty and being guilted for it, I was told that I need to end my friendship so I did and I cried so much. When I got home, tear streaked and feeling/looking terrible, my ex plainly asked how it went without much emotion, as usual. I went to bed alone (like usual) while they played a game. The next few days were a whirlwind of emotions. The friend and I spoke the next day because it didn't feel right to just drop each other, my ex went through my messages to the friend and approached me angrily due to the flirting it contained and talked to me as if expecting me to beg for forgiveness. I felt horrible at first but then asked what they wanted to do about it because I was tried of them bearing down on me. Then they said that they took screenshots of my messages and shared it with their friends. I was hurt that they did that, I was a very lowkey person, I was always very kind and nice to everyone I met, I literally made it a mission to be in good graces with everyone to the point that I partly developed anxiety over it. They said they wanted to work on us, so I gave them that. I gave them a month to be affectionate and they failed within the first 4 days. After that I realized that I didn't love them anymore and so I ended the relationship.

Details:

* They were very affectionate when we were dating but it stopped 3-6 months in
* They had a ""make your own schedule"" type of job, but would not work unless it was the week that bills were due
* Complained about me being financially irresponsible to friends often due to me buying small pleasantries (coffee, etc) even though I used my money to cover for their shortcomings
* Used family members insurance pay-out to fund trips, pay bills, and help them until it was gone
* Became affectionately starved and cries for it were gaslighted and turned back onto me
* Never planned events, complained about going if I did
* Complained all the time, especially about friends
* When friend and I became friends, ex always said ""Be careful of them"" but could never give me a reason as to why
* Friend was known to be flirty and was allowed by their partner, however they were not the same with me (wanted my friendship firstly then realized feelings at the same time)
* We had time to spend together due to our partners not spending time with us
* We did flirt in our messages but did not notice how inappropriate it was at the time. We would flirt and then say, ""I wish my partner would xyz"" very, very, very often. It does not make it right, but I just want to emphasize how starved we were in our own relationships that we didn't realize what it really meant
* Ex and I argued over the friend before the flirting even began, I even begged for them to explain to me why they were so bad and asked multiple times if they'd like for me to end the relationship, to which the ex said no, that they didn't want to be considered the ""bad guy""
* My profile was open on the laptop and ex decided to go through my messages while I was at work, they confronted me like a disappointed parent and told me that they showed their friends when I got home and didn't expect me to ask what they wanted to do (breakup or not). They softened afterwards, but the damage was already done
* My reputation was already tarnished by ex's ex before this. Ex was accused of being emotionally and sexually abusive towards their ex and I was accused of being a homewrecker. Ex broke up with their ex before we got together, however ex's realization of having feelings for me with why ex's ex broke up with them. I did not reciprocate those feelings at that time, but unknown trauma was developing because of the accusation towards me
* Because of the accusation \^\^\^ I worked tirelessly to be a good person and show that I was a good person to any and everyone I was around, even ex's friends would comment on how nice I was and how well I took care of them. So, for them to share my messages with them and then tell me of everyone's disapproval...it added to my anxiety (I started having panic attacks a few months earlier and this took it up a notch)
* I agreed to give them a month to work on us, during the first four days they talked about/blamed the friend, said they would plan a date for us (almost never happens), on the day of the date they asked me what I wanted to do twice, and then when they took us there, they decided to talk/blame the friend again. We had another argument that ended with me crying and feeling like I didn't deserve to live for causing so much ""trouble""
* I spent a few days after that thinking about the relationship, a literal full day of crying, and finally realized that I couldn't undress in front of them or kiss them so I ended the relationship
* They left the house calmly but then messaged me for weeks later about wanting to work on us, angry at what happened, blaming the friend again instead of talking responsibility for allowing the space for someone else's affection to settle into my heart, fishing for information when the friend was suicidal because their relationship was ending too due to realizing their mistreatment and lack of love in their own relationship, causing friend's partner to almost commit suicide by gossiping about things half-cocked, giving a weak apology saying ""I'm sorry I hurt you and that I can't fix it"", used their own depression as an excuse as to why they couldn't love me which in turn invalidated my feelings and own mental whatever, tried to come over to ""watch movies"" after finally picking their stuff up to move out, asking about ""breakup sex"" three times saying other people do it, screaming and arguing with me on the phone to the point where my friend had to intervene, saying I didn't give them a fair chance, accused friend of only being nice to me to use me and leave me (I wasn't thinking of being with friend this whole time and I told ex multiple times), said that friend was a liar and couldn't give examples when I asked for all of us (ex, friend, me, mediator, third party pov) to talk about what was going on
* Made it seem as though I left them for someone else when I really left because I would've killed myself if I stayed

&amp;#x200B;

I'm processing how much they hurt me and how I did not deserve that. Sometimes I think about hurting them as bad as they hurt me, and then I decide to leave it be. I think I really just want to let this out of me, but any advice as to what I could/should do would be cool.",13Dec2019,1
407,"There's a guy who comes into my work almost every single day. I've worked in bars for years, so I'm no stranger to someone who stretches the truth, but this guy is something else. 

At first I was just able to tune him out and nod along to his bullshit. I figured out pretty quickly that there was no point in even trying to have a conversation with him, because he wouldn't listen at all and just keep spouting the same old bullshit about being in the army (not true,) being insanely wealthy (also not true,) and being a bodyguard for the literal queen (don't need to say it.) I've tried counting all the shit he says he's done, and the amount of time he claims to have done it for, and I estimate him on that basis to be about 206 years old. I found that I can actually walk away from him to do something and he's too busy lying about himself that he will still be talking to nobody when I get back. The issue is, I am trapped behind the bar most of the time, so I can't get away from it. 

More often than not, he interrupts me when I'm trying to help a customer, and if I even try to disagree with him, or even just tell him to wait for his drink like everybody else, he loses it and starts yelling. Weird thing is, I've called him a narcissist, a liar, and told him to fuck off more times than I can count, but he just comes back the next day (or even an hour later) like it's nothing and continues with the same bullshit. 

He's creepy as shit and always harassing female staff and customers, but my boss always semi-has his back because he spends money, so he'll never bar him.  Very occasionally, he'll be alright, verging on pleasant (usually after someone has given him an extreme telling off, or a customer is more obnoxious than him so he has an excuse to throw his weight around) but eventually he always goes right back to where he was. 

I otherwise really like the job, but it's like he's wearing me down. I can just laugh at him when I'm in a really good mood, but when I'm not, or he's being extra special, it's fucking hard. It sounds so easy to just rise above it, and I usually do, but I like to go to work do get shit done to earn some money, and to clear my mind while I'm doing it, but I can't with his incessant jabbering of absolute nonsense. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind when customers talk to me, but it's the same shit from him every single day.

He's also constantly trying to get me in trouble with my boss because I can't even bring myself to be sort of polite to him anymore. I just blank him and only serve him when nobody else is around. My boss doesn't really care because he knows what he's like and tries to stay out of it, but it's annoying me that this arsehole keeps trying to get me sacked. It sounds so petty that I can't handle it and I hate that this freak is doing this to me. I'm good at my job and I'm good with most customers, but I'm just so fucking tired of dealing with him. 

All advice welcome.",13Dec2019,1

Im a University student in Turkey i just turned 19 and while my life was just starting to get better it was about to come crashing down. My mom and dad broke up approximately 7 years ago it was mostly due to my fathers failure in business, he went bankrupt 3-4 times and was unable to draw, deposit or even create a bank acount and when they were together my father was a very violent man and i still hate him for it, but what i didnt know at the time was that because he was unable to create a company he and his 2 beothers forced my mother to sign all the papers required to create a company and gave my mother %95 share (it means she was responsible for every transaction the compant did) in reality she was raising me from home. A last my father bankrupted this company again and it was closed for business just like usual; But there was a catch my father didnt pay the transaction fees and the mandatory health insurance bill that *YOU SHOULD ALWAYS PAY* to the government. 10 years later and my mom had made a career for herself going to college to study architecture and creating an instagram account (she is almost famous) unlike my father wanted her to and one day im just exiting my physics exam my mom calls me in tears telling me that our home is being mortgaged by the government for a fee of 250.000$

415,"Tryna make this as fast as possible

So I kinda like this girl. We're best friends but in a different way. 2 weekends ago we cuddled while at a little party at one of out friends house. She's been throwing out a lot of signs. Constantly telling me on ft (which we talk everyday on) that she wants a boyfriend but doesn't really count me out of the listings like when she was listing boys to her cousin she included me. I told her that I've had my first kiss after she thought I haven't because I tell everyone I haven't idk why I just always have not even because of the person or something I just like keeping that to myself. After I told her that she constantly asks me who and I just can't tell her I just don't like it (what I'm trying to show is that it means she cares a lot about that). It got to the point where she said she would give me a blowjob if I told her and she was being dead serious, the rest of that night was her pretending things were my dick and deepthroating them, moaning, and making dirty comments. Next time we get together I will be telling her. More recently now she talks about how people are always telling us to get together. She pretends like we are married and tells me she loves me and doesn't leave until I say it back. She goes around telling her family that we are dating and even on the third really?? She says yes until she tells them the truth and asks if she should date me. A lot of awkward moments have come from this. Tells her brother all the stuff I just said and then her brother says ""well do you have a crush on him?"" She doesn't say anything and he says ""so yes? Your not saying you don't so it's a yes"" she doesn't say anything. And then he asks me and I do the same thing. He also grabbed her phone and ran one time and told me to make a move on her. (Kids hella funny) Her cousin one time joined and started making very funny comments about me and her that show something too. she talks about us hanging out sometimes and that's pretty much it.

416,"So I was living overseas for 3 years, I had a boyfriend, my own home and a decent job.  Due to visa complications, I was given 30 days to leave the country and I have come back home, broken up with my boyfriend and have had to move in with my parents.     I've been living this way for about 2 months, and I've been to heaps of job interviews and even had a few job offers.  Living at home is far from ideal for me, and neither is the area they live in.  But, I can't make a decision... about anything.   I have no idea what I want, or what will make me happy and I keep turning down decent job offers because I'm just scared to commit to something.  There isn't any situation that I feel is right for me, and I don't have heaps of money so I can't 'just move out', whatever I do, does have to be calculated.     What sucks is that there doesn't seem to be any path that I want to be on.

417,"To preface this, I need to say that I have had sex before all this, many times and I loved it, never felt anything close to what I feel now not even when I lost my V Card. 

So, I had a surgery in September for an ovarian cyst and they also had to remove one ovary, it was all good and I recovered fine phisically and also mentally, I wasn't afraid not even in the beginning, it never bothered me that I have a part ""missing"" or whatever. 

In the meantime, I have been single and for a while i didn't even think that much about actually having sex, only the occasional thought. However, recently I reconnected with an amazing guy and we started going out, kissing and stuff, and I really started considering having sex with him, and I realised I am extremely afraid. That something will break, that it won't go well, honestly I don't even know what it is all about, I tried to explain it do myself but can't. It's just really irrational.

The next time we saw each other I told him about it, and he said he understands and he was extremely supportive and he said he will wait for when I am ready, didn't try to pressure me in any way and has not even mentioned it since. But I really want it, I want him both mentally and physically but I don't know how to do it, I sometimes get really scared only at the thought of it.

Somethings that bother me about her is she is constantly wanting my attention. We had a huge fight when I started dating a guy and I didn't text her on a daily basis. I basically told her I wanted to date him not her. 
She is constantly trying to outdo me in life and rubbed it in my face that she got married before me. 
I bought a house and she has been either obsessed with buying a house herself or constantly telling me how much better renting is compared to owning. It changes daily. 
She says really cold hearted things sometimes and I'm not sure if she even knows what she is saying.

Hey guys, just need some help, a tl;dr at the bottom

Just failed my calculus 2 final, (covering laplace, vector calculus, and complex calculus) and just feeling hopeless (my university requires students to pass the final to pass the course). My 2.53 on a scale of 4 GPA (4.429 on a scale of 7) after 3 semesters of study means I will never get to grad school. I am Australian so grad school is an nonnegotiable necessity for me to work in the industry I want to which happens to be space systems as I need an EB-2 visa (which requires a postgraduate degree) to get into the US as a US person.

Now my life has no meaning whatsoever and I'm just sitting here listening to some depressing music with some suicidal fantasies.

To make things worse, I was once considered pretty bright in elementary and high school (graduated 91.45 percentile from high school). I worked all my life to try to reach this goal but now it's just gone to shit in two hours. Guessing I really did fail the 10 year challenge.

428,"So my boyfriend’s brother and I are really close. Especially as of recent, because he’s been going through relationship problems and I’ve sorta been someone he could rely on to listen to his issues. It felt really nice to have that kind of trust with him, especially since I’ve never had any siblings my whole life so in a way he’s like the baby brother I never had.

Well, a few days ago he told me that he’s had alcohol on several occasions and that he keeps a bottle of whiskey in his room. It shocked me a bit because I’ve always seen him as this innocent little kid (which is partially on me; he’s almost an adult), but I didn’t think much of it. 

Then yesterday, he told me he was drinking in class. I still didn’t think much of it. In my opinion, if something happens to him while he’s drunk, that’s how he’ll learn his life lesson.

It didn’t stop me from telling my boyfriend however, and when I did tell him, I completely regretted it. He freaked out and did not react at all how I thought he would. I knew he would confront his brother about it, so I just asked that he confront him about it alone and leave my name out of it.

Well, fast forward to today, and his little brother is grounded. Why? Because my boyfriend did exactly what I asked him not to do. He told his mom and ratted me out, saying I was the one who told him about the booze. I got a text from his brother saying “thought I could trust you guys, guess not.”.

That hurt.

I’m just very conflicted right now as to whether or not I did the right thing. I’m very mad at my boyfriend for getting his mom involved because now she doesn’t trust his brother at all and I feel like if I just said nothing and kept my mouth shut then everything would be fine, as it was before. My boyfriend and his mom both said I did the right thing, but I don’t feel like I did. I feel like shit for saying anything because I probably just shattered his trust in me.",13Dec2019,1

435,"I’m an 18 yr f, freshly out of my mother’s home. My parents have been divorced for about 9 years. I’ve always felt like I’ve had to pick a side between my two parents, but it’s been hard because my dad was an alcoholic (now nearly a year so we), and my mom is an extremely manipulative woman. For as far back as I can remember, my mom has told me that my dad abused my older brother and I, but not my two sisters. She said that officials had been called and that she had photographs of wounds that my dad had allegedly given me. I have believed this to be true for as long as I can remember. Tonight I learned that my dad never physically abused me. I’m not saying he was father of the year or anything like that, but the things that my mom said happened did not happen. The longer I sit here and think about my mom’s story and my dad’s values, the more stupid I feel for believing my mom. Should I confront my mom about this lie? How do I move on from this? I’ve literally cried over what my dad allegedly did to me, and wondered why I wasn’t good enough for my dad. My mom has watched me go through this for years, knowing the whole time that it did not happen. To make things a little harder for me, my mom’s birthday and my birthday are both in the next week and she wants me to come home for all of those events, as well as Christmas. How can I face her after learning the truth? I found out the truth from my dad, so she’ll just call him a liar if I confront her. I can’t see confrontation being productive, but I also don’t know how I can face her after this. I’m open to any advice at all right now. I didn’t see this coming at all, and I am extremely hurt by it.",13Dec2019,1

440,Hi. I'm not sure if this is the correct thread to post this in but yeah. I'm a 19 year old college student and I'm in a dorm with 3 other roommates. One roommate has her boyfriend over constantly. He keeps food here and a towel and basically just lives here. Over the past couple months me and my other roommates have heard them screaming at each other over trivial things. I've only heard it once but apparently it happens frequently. Tonight was the tipping point. I heard them yelling at each other and then heard her scream OW. I got scared and waited a few minutes until I heard her boyfriend walk back into her room and I went out there and found her sobbing on the floor in a ball. I went and held her even though I dont really know her but I just felt really bad. She kept saying she wanted to die and that she was a failure and a bunch of stuff. Her boyfriend came out about 10 minutes later and just sat on the couch while I held her. He then turned on the light and said she was fine and that shes freaking out over a small argument and that it's really none of my business. And I said how could you possibly says shes fine when shes like this?? And he says that she says these things all the time and she doesnt really mean them. And I just said look I'm just out here to comfort her. And a few minutes later she asked me to leave and I asked if she was asking because she thought I didnt want to be there or if she actually wanted me to leave because I cared and would stay. But she said she wanted me to leave so now I'm back in my room just listening to make sure nothing happens to her. Idk I'm scared and have never been around anything like this before and I dont know how to help or what to do. Does anyone have any recommendations?,13Dec2019,1

Sorry if this is the wrong place to post but I recently met such a sweet and caring guy here on reddit. We live close so it's even better and honestly would be such and amazing friend. I do want to be his friend and am trying so hard to support him in anyway I can but I'm finding it rather difficult. 

He wants to go through all these changes and transition into a girl, has said it would be gradual but then is now telling me today that his voice will change and everything. I do have anxiety and so know am overthinking this but I worry what if once we have got to know each other, are good friends but then suddenly changes everything how will I cope with this? 

As I said I really want him to be happy, will try my best to support but I am so worried this could ruin the friendship due to my insecurities regarding this. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks",13Dec2019,1

I was planning to ditch the job but I think I would miss it, I love the staff and the passengers I help, it takes my mind of uni for a bit. I also like helping people on the phones, however I feel more stifled there because of the rules and I get nervous about messing up. This year is worth 75% of the degree so I don't want to mess it up, but I don't want to let the samaritans down and I would feel disappointed in myself and like I'd given up if I left. I'd maybe have a chance to join again after uni but I am not sure how they look at people who leave before even becoming a fully- fledged samaritan and then come back (I am still classed as a new starter and then after that probationer, then full sam).

What would you do? I know I could possibly do all of it but I want to see family, friends and my boyfriend too (long distance), and it would be A LOT, a lot of pressure and stress. I already think I am not properly looking after myself, I keep getting stress stops on my chin and styes on my eye. But i don't want to let anyone down....and I love the job, I feel like maybe I am making a mistake if I give it up. When I go back to my hometown I won't really have a chance to work at that station again. Unless I stayed in a hotel when I go back to the company....anyway I'm rambling.

446,"Hey there reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

tldr: I was in a short relationship with somebody at google, turned her down, now plan to email her boss for my idea.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, that's a complicated one, but I hope you can help me out with some advice.

As stated in the title: I met a google manager (on tinder), we hooked up, had a lot in common, but in the end I did not have the gut feeling that our relationship would last. I don't want to go into details, but I did not feel the kind of intimacy that one needs to feel. Understanding, closeness, trust.

I did not only say ""no"" to her. I said ""no"" to a luxurious lifestyle and a job a Google. Google offers every significant other a job at the same place that the spouse/gf/bf works. That was tough.  I told some close friends and one said: ""You know the saying: ""Fake it, till you make it.""

I am struggling financially, I work as a freelancing TV journalist, but still: I said no to her and with that I said no to the job.

But I didn't and she was very angry and disappointed with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Now here is the deal:

The last few months I got into programming Alexa skills and I won a Hackathon with my concept. I won 1000€ and a ""google home"". The company I work at took notice and the bosses invited me to present my concept at the online department next week and a headhunter I am in contact with told me he could get me in contact with Apple.

I think I might be on to something big - and I want to reach out to google, too. I don't want to write my ex-gf as I feel this seems inappropriate. I want to in the future, but not for this business/career stuff.

We are still friends on facebook though and I looked up her boss, that I had a chat and coffee with, when I was in the google HQ. When I first met her, she said: ""I already heard a lot about you!""

I want to email this boss my idea, but I don't know how. What would you do?

I am happy for any sort of advice! Really!

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you very much in advance!",13Dec2019,1

454,"This is now my 3rd time posting on this subreddit, and I'm betting there is more to come.


So I have a teacher who just seems to want to just end my life and my happiness as well. I have ALOT of reasons why I think this.

1. She says that students are ""fed up"" with me, even though there are TWO kids that have an issue, one of which is just doesnt like me in general.

2. Every time we get our tests back, if I fail she says ""only one person failed the test"" and looks at me.

3. She writes down every little thing I do wrong.
Say something mildly annoying? Noted. Make an obvious joke but it could be taken otherwise? Noted. 

4. She gets mad at me for finishing a tiny little smidge of my homework in class.

5. I didn't remember something at all for hw, and I said that I forgot in a note on my paper. She replies with ""After 2 days of playing in class?"" And shows my parents.

6. I have ADHD meds, and if i dont take them on a Monday, a good half a week is screwed over, and everytime i tell her that, she tells my parents i use it as an excuse.

7. She always has an issue with me talking, and when I explain that someone was not being quiet or something (I'm trying to quiet them), she gets mad at ME only.

8. I had a meeting with my 6th grade teacher who helped me alot with what I had issues with about my homework and what not, and she said my math teacher told her I have a 23.4 in math. Check my grades about an hour later, 74. Next day, 74. Meaning she lied to her.



My parents hate her too, but I dont know what to do to make her not hate me. Save me please. Anything helps. My life is absolutely hell right now. I cant answer questions/comments until 3.",13Dec2019,1
455,"



I’m a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it so idk. Also when I only got a pub job myself without asking for her help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it most appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way .  When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I Looked to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley quiet way which confuses me because she gave me a furrowed eyebrows snobby look at me when she first called me over to the appointment which got me down


Edit: she started saying the ‘awww’when I’d get up to leave after I failed an interview for not having enough confidence but I usually would say ‘oh ok thank you’ is maybe why?",13Dec2019,1

460,"My roommate and I have had minuscule mishaps throughout the entirety of our lease. Nothing that’s made me go insane, but the one thing that has always bothered me but I haven’t really been forward with her about is her horrible habit of sleeping with the TV on every. night. If not 90% of the time each month. On top of, no joke, watching TV 5-7 hours a day. It doesn’t really bother me when she’s watching it when she is awake/at the apartment because she has control of it. However, one of the mishaps we had was her telling me how she forgot to tell me she’s been paying for the light bill for around 5 months. 

I am currently working on paying her back for half of those 5 months, and I will eventually do that. However, in the city where we live in the average monthly bill is around $120 USD. I noticed ours is always around the $170s. I am fairly young and this is the first time living in an apartment without the help of my parents or a guardian. I don’t know how much the TV affects one’s light bill. But growing up, my parents never let me keep a TV in my room (which I ended up growing into the idea) and my dad to this day gets bothered when my brother and I visit and we leave the TV on downstairs when we go upstairs to get something or we’re talking on the phone, etc. 

I don’t want to tell her that she should pay for the entirety of the bill. I am aware that I live there as well and that I use the heater, the kitchen lights, the washer and dryer, and everything. Despite only being in the apartment 75% of the time, compared to my roommate’s 95%, I do think that the light bill should be split evenly. However, this has gotten too far. Would it be fair for me to give her a warning? Or to tell her it should be split 60-40? Knowing I sometimes come home at 2AM and her TV is on when she is clearly sleeping. I woke up this morning and she was sleeping w the door open and had it on. She’s also left the apartment with it on before.",13Dec2019,1

This could lead to me getting blackmailed or just simply him slipping up and sharing things about me that other people shouldn’t know. So after sharing a lot of intimate details about me with him last night and asking politely if he could keep that information to himself he simply said that I “shouldn’t have shared those details with him if I didn’t want other people to know.” That shocked me because I really trusted him and had said before that I didn’t want him sharing things with other people. I completely freaked out, it especially hurt cause he knew I already have trust issues. I told him I had to go smoke some weed (even though I’d been clean for over a week) because I was extremely stressed out and sad. He made a hurtful remark about “self control” (I’m chronically depressed so I’m very weak when it comes to self control). And we said goodnight.

He has always had a wandering eye while in relationships, and although he would never act on it, it was something I never respected. He's been actively meeting people on dating apps for hookups and he met another ftm in Germany that he vibed with really well. Now he is back in France and this guy he met was planning on visiting him because he wants to see him again early January. But he has always had an eye on his weed plug's gf, since he's been in France. So now he is blowing off the German friend and going in strong with the plug's gf. The plug, lets call her ""Tiff"" and her gf ""Kim."" Tiff gave my friend permission to hang out with her to do all the things that she doesn't feel like doing with her, as long as it doesn't go further. So now they have crossed many boundaries, starting with publicly flirtatious behavior one night, making out a different night, to full blown sex the last time we talked about it.

I expressed how fucked up it was, she is in a relationship and he is well aware of that and doesn't care. And he decided that he is going to stop keeping me updated about what is going on between them. I told him that whether he tells me or not is his choice, but it doesn't take away from what he is doing. Then we said that he understand what I'm saying but he was taken aback by telling him ""I don't support him"" which is something I've never said to him even if we didn't see eye to eye on things, and that it didn't sit well with him. Also that he is worried that if something does work out between them, my feelings won't change about the situation. He is acting like I'm saying I don't support him with life goals, and education, or traveling etc, so I don't understand how that is comparable to being a home wrecker. So he has decided to keep me out of the loop because I am putting a ""stress"" on our friendship, and he is going to continue to see where things go. I tried best to summarize this so if you have any questions please free to ask, but I just want to know if I was wrong with being too blunt about how wrong this is...

TL:DR My friend is essentially falling for/hooking up with his weed plug's gf, and I expressed my distaste and lack of support and he turned it on me as if he was insulted by my lack of support being his ""friend."" Is this gaslighting or is he right to feel this way?",13Dec2019,1

473,"Hello reddit, first time poster here. I'm wide awake because i'm still thinking, so i guess i'll type it out.
It's quite the long read because there is a lot of things involved. Also my english is a bit rusty so bear with me here. Maybe you guys can help me straighten my thoughts. 

I'm 25 years old and live in the Netherlands. I graduated last year on my bachelor as a social worker. My work can be very broad, from youth to elderly, to people with mental disabilities and so forth. I have had an internship in my second try on my third year in college in which i remained working and now have a solid contract with. This meaning they must have a pretty good reason to terminate and i'm in a pretty good position. It's my fourth year with them. 

Things you must know about my job: it's a pretty nice environment. The house is beautiful, we can work with animals and the clients are great once you get to know them. They have a light mental handicap and also have psychiatric problems such as autism, adhd etc. My coworkers are pretty okay, some are even friends. The job is challenging up to a certain point. I can never get promoted. There are no team leaders except for one. And she will likely never go anywhere.

I also have some other issues with this job. A few examples: 
I broke my shoulder, second time this has happened. Last year i had to get operated on my left shoulder to put in a plate because i was hit by a car. This year i broke my right by falling of my bike. Healed up by just using a band to hold up my arm. When i called to say what happend she said that i don't sound like i'm in pain. And while i couldn't work any nightshift i could work? I felt like i wasn't really able to say no as we are a small team and i didn't want to bother them. I worked about 5/6 shifts a week to cover for me not being able to work nights. This eventually got the best of me and i told her that, she said she couldn't find replacements and couldn't work herself because her husband (my boss) is ill. When we talked about this afterwards she said i should've set my boundaries clearer. 

I got molested by a coworker outside of work, she said she could not fire him but would not prolong his contract. Meanwhile he even gets scheduled to work full days with me and he by the looks of it isnt leaving anytime soon. 

Other issues are that either my coworkers are hypocrites or she is exxacarating what they say. On multiple occasions she said that ""the whole team"" or ""six employees"" came complaining about issues. She makes me very insecure up till the point i don't really dare talk to her anymore. 

Now i got a new job offer. A new friend send my name to another (big ) company. This company i work for now is very small. 15 employees, two bosses and a teamleader. The new company called and asked to meet. I went there with an open mind. Not expecting anything and knowing i stood strong with my solid contract. They called afterwards and asked if i wanted to check a location. To see if it was someting for me. Now this company is much bigger. The salary is better. And i have much more possibilities in my future. It is a bit of a mess thou, since it's a new thing. It's a more difficult group (youth with family, drugs, and other problems). And i don't know if i'll be happy there. 

So now i have to decide what to do. Can't make up my mind. I'm very loyal and this company treated me very good since i have learned everything there and they gave me a lot of chances. But now there is another option. I'm also very ambitious and since i'm young i don't want to be stuck. I'll also think it's hard saying my now clients and colleagues goodbye to take a leap of faith.",13Dec2019,1

I’m a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it so idk. Also when I only got a pub job myself without asking for her help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it most appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way .  When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I Looked to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley quiet way which confuses me because she gave me a furrowed eyebrows snobby look at me when she first called me over to the appointment which got me down


Edit: she started saying the ‘awww’when I’d get up to leave after I failed an interview for not having enough confidence but I usually would say ‘oh ok thank you’ is maybe why?",13Dec2019,1
476,Sometimes (maybe once or twice a month) I randomly panic...or something...I don't know what to call it. It happens just out of the blue without any cause. My breathing gets faster and I do things faster. It feels like I'm not the one controlling by body. Like it's on autopilot. My actions are still conscious but it still feels like they are not. Also I see things faster than they actually are. One time it happened in school and I looked over to my friend. I knew he was writing at a normal speed but it seemed like he was writing crazy fast. This feeling only lasts for about 7 minutes but it's utterly terrifying. What do you think is happening to me?,13Dec2019,1

It's  almost like he's trying to politely tell me to suck it up and move on, and sometimes I need that but not all the time. The times I just want to be held, he becomes irritated at me and gives me a slight attitude like ""whatever, I can't help you. I guess I suck"". It's been bothering me more this week because I am PMSing and told him I will be emotional and he still doesn't try. It always turns into something about him...

And since I will be a millionaire one day, I won't have too much trouble repaying the money. But obviously, there is nobody who would just gift 50000$ to a 21 year old. So I thought about the following offer: If I get 50000$ from somebody and I will have a million dollars at some point in my life I will give them a 100000$ back. And if I don't become a millionaire, well.. they lost their 50000$

It's a shitty gamble. But if I would be rich, I would probably do that if I estimate that the person has the capability of becoming a millionaire. So which rich woman or guy would be crazy enough to do such a bet?",13Dec2019,1

486,"Some back story, I have been training at a gym for a year and a little more now. Supposedly close and friends with the owners. In the first few months I have been interested in coaching classes there but i did not have a certification yet. Since I was told that i needed one, i took the next course and received my certification. 

However, months went by and I never got offered a position. I eventually grew impatient of this hot and cold attitude i was getting from the owner (we have open communication) and i asked if they will offer me a position. That being said, a few months earlier he let another person coach a class (wasn’t asked again, BUT the fact that he was given an opportunity puzzled me). 

I gave my official offer a week ago (i understand that this is recent) but a friend of the owner was asked to take a class the following week. Regardless of whether I was told yes or no, I feel like they should have at least given me a chance first. I have made myself readily available but the classes taken by the guests seemed impromptu. 

I considered cancelling my membership because they are going to increase for the upcoming year and I no longer see value in it. However, they asked why because I had just asked if I could work for them. I simply replied that I was not given an actual answer to the job (i see nothing wrong with that what I said because I cannot sit around and wait all the time). He somehow took it that I wanted to poke about the answer on whether they want me to work for them. I did apologize that it came off that way. - reason for leaving i will not include as it is complicated 

What I want to ask is : If i end up receiving the offer, should I still leave? I do feel like they already do not appreciate me and the unofficial work i’ve done for others. I do not feel inclined to work for this business anymore because of the attitude of the owners, but it is one of the few jobs that I can gain experience with being an undergraduate. 

TLDR : wanted to work but was asked to take certificate for job, didn’t get offer. when i asked for one, they did not respond and gave other people opportunities instead of me. Gave offer to someone new and it seems like they’re pushing me away. should I decline even if they offer me a job?",13Dec2019,1

510,"Posted elsewhere but didn’t get much attention so I’ll try posting on r/advice.  

I’ve been having some issues with one specific class that is a requirement for my college, business calculus (trying to study for accounting). I have had long had trouble with math, requiring additional 2+ semesters for college algebra and a dev pre algebra class, which I have struggled with in the past as well (took more than one semester to complete college algebra) and even struggled last year taking the alternate economics/light calculus class they offered instead. My point is I’m not sure I can pass calculus even if I do it another semester and even if I could my GPA is just taking a harder and harder hit. I have done fairly fine in the basic business courses I’ve taken (semi wide range but usually A-C) but heavy math classes like this are just foreign to me. The only other option I could see is switching to a history major because I’ve been very interested and good at learning history my whole life while I did attempt that a semester ago, I realized that the liberal arts college requires you to complete not just 1 year of a foreign language but 2. I did not take any language in high school because I was put in an assisted math/English class instead of a language and while I did do 2 semesters of a language for the business college, I got a D in the second semester and while that’s passing, it’s not passing to take the third semester of a language without repeating the second semester. I am also probably as bad at languages as I am with math (I think it has to do with the memorization of formulas/structures of how it’s put together). I feel stuck because 2 basic classes are sticking it to me either direction I go.

I have some basic mental disorders/autism and possibly a fetal spectrum disorder but none of it’s particularly well documented by doctors. Im registered with office of disability services but haven’t particularly used their services because I don’t know how they can really help because all they offer that I know of is note taking or private testing area neither of which I believe I really need. I don’t even want to major in history because I’m not fond of the idea of teaching but would rather major in something rather than nothing and do like history. It would also be easier to keep my GPA at required level if I majored in history but I’m not sure I can complete the language class either. Basically just wondering if their are any other potential solutions, such as going to 2 year college (not sure if they’d have same requirements for calculus or language) or a way to get an exception to certain classes (I attempted to get an excusal of several classes/semesters because of mental issue struggles but they said I didn’t have enough documentation for them) or anything else.

Also not sure if important but I’m in between sophomore and junior year so completed most college requirements and mostly just have major requirements.

I've made friends, but nothing like those I have back where I moved from. I don't necessarily hate living here, I've gotten into a lot of things, new hobbies and activities which may potentially not be available back there, but part of me doesn't feel content, or complete. I used to be spiritual and now that's gone. Maybe it's work, maybe it's to do with a lot of things. I don't know if I want to move back because I'm so driven on ""moving forward"". I'd have to restart all over again with the risk that I may not even have a foundation to start from. My old friends keep saying I've changed into a sadder person and truth is, as much as I'm doing now, they're right.

I'm going on a roadtrip start of next year which will have me travelling back there to see people for about 2 weeks which should be good. I just don't know if I keep pushing through and wait for the tunnel to become easier to navigate or ""give in"" and move back.

They always say things like “I suck at understanding human emotion so blah blah...” But have they even tried to understand? They’ve stepped on my feelings a lot and I feel like they’ve done that to my other friends as well. 
Even though I just typed all that, I’m afraid to drop them. I don’t want to lose anyone else. I have a hard time making friends and I’ve been abandoned by many... But they make me so mad and the last time I told someone and they said “drop ‘em.” I ended up still talking to them.",13Dec2019,1

I acknowledge that I'm only a 17 year old and my life didn't even start yet. but my biggest fear is to grow up to be poor like everyone around me, my goal is to become an officer in the air force or army. it seems like a lot of pressure to become someone when two of my siblings have left high school just to get pregnant or impregnate someone then live in Chicago with my dad. I don't want to do that, he doesn't even own a house. I don't know if I'm making sense so far because my mind is very foggy right now.

Just now she texted me saying she’s thinking of becoming a pagan because Irish gods are really interesting and that way she can worship them and not worship celebrities. I thought she was joking at first but she wasn’t. I told her to wise up and that her idea was stupid. Her reasoning behind wanted to worship a god is that she doesn’t want to have obsessions with celebrities so instead she’s going to obsess over a god. Am I insane for thinking that’s stupid reasoning? If she has a problem with obsessing over things how will it help to obsess over another thing? It makes no sense. I told her a better idea to stop obsessing would be to unfollow celebrities she’s obsessed with and to stop stalking their accounts, even block their accounts. Without a thought she said “no I can’t do that.” This is a problem with her a lot, she always comes to me with issues but then does nothing to fix said issue.  Anyways, I know I should be supportive of my friend if she wants to believe in a god or something but I’ve known this girl so long and known her as a person to think of religions as stupid and immoral. Seeing her want to do this is insane. And honestly as much as I’d love to be nice to her in this situation I just can’t sit by and watch her do something that we both find to be idiotic and immoral. She’s now changed the subject which is how I know she’s annoyed but honestly what do I do if she brings it up again?

I can get 80s and 90s without studying in all my classes, this semester I have a 94 in math, 99 in programming, 93 in communications technology, and (as of midterms, which was about a month ago) an 88 in religion.

529,"I started consulting with people who run an organization for helping non-traditional students of a certain background apply to competitive colleges, write resumes, prepare an application package to co-ops or internships...

Last year I applied to schools they recommended: UPenn, Cornell, and Yale.  I knew these schools had very low acceptance rates especially for transfers and, well, adults, but they talked a good talk, and I ran with it. 

I didn't get into any of those school. I've been out of a school and haven't heard back from my counselors for a year. So, I thought to contact them again for some guidance. Recently one of the counselors suggested that I apply to Syracuse University, but I replied that I wasn't sure about applying especially after hearing about recent events on campus there. I'm thinking I might have offended them because I mentioned the events. May people are offended about the news coverage of the events.

I didn't whine or blame my counselors for my not getting into UPenn, Cornell, or Yale. Instead I asked about finding schools outside their list that are good fit for me and where I'd have a better chance of being admitted and obtaining scholarships. My grades are great, and I have good test scores, in the top 10%. Scores and grades aren't everything, but I heard they're reasons to trash an application immediately without further consideration. 

One of the counselors even recommended that I apply to Yale again, their alma mater, but I courteously disagreed. My reasoning, I said to them, is that I wasn't even working in the field of computer engineering yet. At this point, it seems more important that I gain relevant field experience, not hope for an opportunity at Yale that I didn't get last year. 

How can you ask people for help with something or when should you just quit asking? I contact them through email once ever couple of months so I'm not harassing them or demanding for their attention. I'm not completely clear about college applications and where I could be applying, not just the ivy's or hyper selective schools, for the degree I want to pursue. 

It's okay by me to get rejected by college admissions officers who've never met me, but it stings a bit when people who know somewhat about you seemingly reject you because you didn't get into one of their recommended schools or you don't want to apply to them.",13Dec2019,1

I tend to be a little aloof and introverted, though I'm told that I'm charismatic. Over the past week or two I've been making more of an effort to eat lunch with people and invite them to do things, and it's been going pretty well. 

For a while now, I've wanted to throw a small get together at my apartment. I haven't done something like that in forever.. waaay too long. I felt like ""fuck it, I'll just do it"" and decided to have a little Christmas potluck. I set it up to be a little before Christmas since a lot of people are visiting their families closer to the day, and started telling people. I invited about 10 people and now I'm not sure if I should go through with it. 

Results:

1. Three people said they would come and bring +1s. However, I don't know the +1s.
2. A few other people said they wanted to come, but I haven't really talked to them since then so not sure if they may cancel or something?
3. Two friends I know for a fact are interested (they talk to me often), but have been sick in bed for a few days now after getting the flu. They may not be better in time.
4. A couple people said they may pop in for some time in the middle of the potluck but can't stay the whole time.
5. Some ""that sounds fun!! i'll let you know"" type responses.

The potluck is two days away and I'm thinking that I got ahead of myself trying to do something like this so soon, because A) this is something that requires some work from the people attending and B) i've only been trying to be more social for a week or two now.

Okay so I'm kind of newly gay? If that's a thing? I don't know. Sorry if it doesn't make sense. I'm just starting to figure my shit out so I don't really know what's normal and not

About a year ago a new guy ""Mike"" moved to town and started working at the same place as me. He kind of turned into a mentor when it comes to work stuff and recently we've gotten pretty close as friends. We don't work close everyday. Most of the time we spend together is more on our own time. He's gay and out

We're in a small town and I'm not really out so even if I could find someone to fool around with I would be too afraid that it'd get out. It seems like the only other real option would be to get on an app and drive way into the city and meet up with strangers which sounds dangerous. Or start hooking up with ""Mike""

I know he's experienced and into casual sex and attracted to meso I think he'd be into it. Plus I know he's into bdsm which is something I think I really wanna try. It just seems like a safe place to kind of explore things 

On the other hand if I knew a girl my age was getting fucked by a dude twice her age I would definitely think it was weird and gross. But I feel like this is different cuz it's not like I can just go hook up with anybody

536,"- [ ] I’m Male 182cm tall (just under 6ft)  lanky slim body  framed and pale with a receding hairline so yea I’m fucked when it comes to looks. I’m a kissless virgin.And I  noticed over time I get stared at like iv got 3 heads and treated poorly by most and it’s because I’m ugly. I don’t leave the house and havnt for 4 years  except for 6 hours a week to work at a football  stadium as somebody there to help. I used to enjoy it and it made me excited to go out and do something with my day for once , but other times it’s very difficult. I always get picked for the shitty jobs (part of being ugly) and there’s times I blatantly get stared at because I’m ugly. Last week some young guy walked past me stared at me walking past it was obvious what he was thinking. Another higher up authority young guy there always stares at me a lot  and I assume it because I’m ugly and I think it is, he does it every shift and he’s nothing special either but when he’s fatally talked to me he’s seemed nice and friendly with me. and I get a lot of girls sometimes who stare me down because I’m tall and slim it happens so often too it’s made me develop an eating disorder. I don’t ever wanna leave the house for it. Just last week I was at work at that stadium job around a lot of people  and a girl and her dad was standing drinking and the girl looked at me with a blank glare (I only stared back because I thought she needed help with something as that’s what I’m there for) and she looked back up to her dad with a disgusted look on her face and said ‘ewwwwww god no’ (I lipread her) it was ok for her as she had tons of makeup on like it was a mask covering her face tho but was quick to judge? I mean cmon I leave the house for the first time in 3 months and then that happened? Doesn’t bode well tbh. And when a girl stared at me facially then quickly looked me down because I’m tall and skinny yet she was like 5ft tall if not shorter. I don’t wanna ever leave the house. I wake up with suicidal thoughts crying. I never knew being ugly would make life so difficult. I can’t have a life as much as I want to. Sometimes when it’s cold I wear a hat and a snood and it helps a lot tbh. I have bad depression because of my looks too so it’s difficult to not look very tired and pale too. I spend every birthday and Xmas alone and it’s because I’m ugly, whoever said personality matters more eh? And I’m tired of trying to help someone when it’s a women and they’re always snotty and dismissive I take it personally.

538,"Ok guys this might be a long ride, TLDR at the bottom. Any opinions would be much appreciated because I feel like I'm pretty alone here. Throwaway because I'm paranoid.

Some background details; I've (J, 21) worked for my boyfriend (R, 30) at his and his mothers (M, 58) cleaning business for the last 2 years more or less. I should probably include the fact that I don't have a supervisory position, I'm an employee like anyone else. About a year ago they took on another woman (K, 45) for one office in the same building which is part time hours. I've got on well with K up until a few weeks ago. 

K would always tell me a little bit too much about the goings on of her life (family drama, etc.), and while I didn't think it was appropriate, I figured she just needed someone to talk to. Leading up to this incident she'd had a few bad things happen to her (brother almost died, daughter is in an abusive relationship, dad is being treated badly in his nursing home) and the day of this incident, her car got clipped by a truck on the way to work (she was fine and only suffered a minor dent). 

She came to my section and told me about the ""accident"" and seemed a little shaken up but otherwise fine (she was stressed because she has no licence and can't claim insurance). I offered to make her some tea to help her calm down but she went to her section instead. 20 mins later she came back and told me that the manager of the office (A) she cleans had told her to go home because of the accident. In a conversational way I asked ""are you not losing your hours?"". Her response was that ""if the company still gets paid, I still get paid"". Now I know that if one is an hourly worker, they don't get paid unless they do the work. I said ""I don't know if it works like that, you'll probably have to check with R and M. But I know if I didn't do the work I wouldn't get paid"". Her attitude changed a little after this and she tried to justify that the work was still going to be done. By this I figured she meant that she'd organised M to cover, but she told me she hadn't spoken to anyone yet about leaving early (I later found out A was cleaning her office herself). I told her to just let R know that she was leaving (because he's her boss), to which she replied she couldn't find him. I offered then to tell him for her so she could get going, and she said she'd come with me (I knew where exactly he was and it's a big building, she would've been delayed significantly searching for him alone).

When we got to the hallway, we bumped into A. (I should mention this woman is one of the most arrogant people we've all ever come across) Before I managed to even say hello, she said ""I told her to go home"", I said ""oh I know, she's just going to let R know that she's leaving"". She got hostile straight away and shooed K and said ""just go. Now. Go"" and again said to me ""but \*I\* TOLD her she could go and I'm calling M to tell her"". I said ""yes that's fine, but R is actually here"". She said ""oh, well where is he?"" and I told her and offered to get him for her. She said she'd do it herself (which she never did) and I just said ""ok, no problem"" and said goodbye to K. What's important here is that when K said goodbye to me she was smiling and seemed perfectly fine.

The next day, K ignored me when I ran into her. It struck me as odd but I gave her the benefit of the doubt and figured she didn't hear or see me. That night after work, R tells me that K was ""very upset"" that I'd ""discussed her wages"" and that it was none of my business. I had NO IDEA what he meant by this and asked him to explain, to which he said he hadn't spoken to her directly but she had called M after work and almost quit her job. The first thing I thought was that M was over exaggerating, because nothing like that had happened and I didn't expect K to lie. But in the following weeks I realised she had a serious issue when she would ignore me when I said hello, storm by me if she came across me and give me filthy looks. So I took it upon myself to reach out to her. (Photos or links not allowed so I'll give a short rundown of the conversation. K was a lot more hostile than I've typed out)

&amp;#x200B;

J: Hi K, is there something wrong? I feel like you're acting a bit strange towards me the last while.

K: You're not imagining it. I'm annoyed at the way you spoke to me about my wages when it wasn't your place to say anything. A had told me to leave and you marched me up to R like some sort of a bold child after all I've been through. I'd been in an accident and still came to work so I wouldn't leave anyone stuck.

J: I'm really sorry it came across that way, I didn't mean it like that at all. How I remember it, you came to me after A told you to go home and I asked if you were losing out on your hours, you said that if M and the company were getting paid that you were too. I said I wasn't sure if it worked that way and you'd have to check with R and M. I offered to tell R for you and you said you'd come with me, then we ran into A in the hall. I'm sorry for any misunderstanding.

K: I know what way that conversation went and how I felt walking out that door. You insisted if I leave I wont be paid. My wages shouldn't be anything got to do with you. You went on and on about going to R and about my wages.

J: K I never said you wouldn't be paid, maybe what I meant came out wrong. What I meant by that was speaking in general, I didn't insist. Your wages are none of my business, I only asked if you were losing hours and I wasn't aware of any arrangements you'd made with A. Sorry again for the misunderstanding, I hope we can put this behind us because a negative work environment isn't good for anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

What I later found out was that as far as M was concerned, K's over exaggerated version of events was true and she was pissed at me. It took so long for me to find this out because she never approached me for my side of the story, which I feel she should've immediately. She was also lead to believe that A was there for the entire conversation between myself and K and that I had interrupted, which didn't happen either. 

There have since been 2 fights between myself and R about this situation because it's bothering me so much. I feel firstly that if K had approached me with what was bothering her instead of acting childish, we could have worked it out between ourselves. Secondly that M should have asked me for my side of the story instead of believing K first, which she admitted herself she should have done. R and M are aware I've reached out to K, and I feel that she shouldn't be allowed to make colleagues uncomfortable in the workplace. I'm not asking anyone to make her be friends with me, but it's gotten to a stage where I'm afraid to see her and when I do, I go into panic mode. I've considered leaving over it too. I've been told not to make an effort with her anymore and that I just have to ignore her, and I know that's all I can do but as far as anyone except myself, R and M are concerned, I'm the one in the wrong here. Am I wrong in feeling like they should be defending me? Their excuse is that they need to ""keep her happy so she doesn't leave"".

The only conclusion I can draw as to why she'd blow this out of proportion is that she has a lot going on in her life, and maybe our conversation sent her over the edge? I'm aware that I might have been out of line in asking if she was losing her hours, but I should probably add that anywhere I've ever worked, you knew what your colleagues hours were (rosters etc), and that she'd made her relationship with me personal herself (literally the day previous she was asking about M's living situation and commenting that she takes too many holidays, prying into mine and R's living situation and personal life, telling me that she'd force her daughter to get an abortion if she ever got pregnant, suggesting I am pregnant because I'd been sick recently), so I really didn't think I was being too invasive. I don't know guys. 

I'm a really non confrontational person, R had suggested that he sit the two of us down to talk it out but the idea of that makes me need to take a xanax. I hate the idea of someone thinking I'd purposely upset them, and I don't really know what to do considering I've reached out to her already. 

TLDR; Coworker 24 years my senior is unhappy regarding a conversation we had and has lied about me, is now ignoring me rather than sorting it out like an adult. Bosses staying on her side because they're afraid she'll quit.",13Dec2019,1

So I was fixing a laptop from someone close to us and I found a video from which the title was interesting so I clicked on it and watched it some random person with this someone and someone's kids. Now we did more digging on the laptop and found more evidence that point to this being a relationship that we never heard about this person before in the entirety of the time we know this someone.

And we made the connection that someone is visiting said persons mother because we saw fotos. And this where someone said they go or someone's kifsctell us they were there. 

Now we don't know what to do.

Thank you.",13Dec2019,1

546,"This ones heavy and I can’t sort this out on my own. 

My boyfriend and I have been close friends for 8 years and together for 1.5.  Recently he was served papers saying he needs to appear in court in the new year as he stands accused of sexual assault from a girl he dated briefly about 6 years ago.

He has told me everything and says he never hurt this girl. Never coerced her into having sex and anything they ever did was sober, consensual and willing on both parties. I believe him completely but I’m still really fucked up over this one. 

She apparently has been seeing a therapist and was told to confront him, she sent him a message back in October and he denied there ever being any forcing in what happened with them and he asked her to talk to him more so he could hash things out with her and what she remembered about their encounters and she never responded... 2 months later and he’s being charged. 

I (F) have always been a firm feminist and I believe that victims deserved to be believed but I also know how damaging false accusations can be to people. I feel like this is ripping me apart inside and I just don’t know how to feel or respond or anything. 
We have a lawyer and we’re going to fight it. I just need advice on how I can deal with this if anyone’s ever been in a similar boat... we both can’t sleep, can’t eat and feel sick that someone would accuse him of such a horrible thing and the fact that it’s been so long after they ever had any encounter with each other is just blindsiding.

Then I flip on pornhub. What the fuck.

I'm realizing, SO MUCH sex is going on out there, all-over-the-fucking-place-at-all-times.... I feel like my sexual boundaries just got ripped wide open. I don't even know anymore. What is right. What to do. Do I judge people whoring it out in nightclubs? Do I judge the stiff religious elder who believes in procreation mainly to have a better family / community life? Do I hook up with the cute girl in the back stock room at work? Do I not and wait and save it for a more serious healthier relationship? Do I do threesomes? Foursomes? Go to sex parties and rail out some girl next to a ""friend"" doing the same? Do I save it just for monogomy with my girlfriend or wife and just do it with her and we both turn down all temptations? There are millions of sexy people out there doing millions of things. I AM SO CONFUSED. What the hell people?!!?!?!! I feel like a leaf being blown around in the fucking wind at this point.

557,"Im an undergraduate student at a community college studying english, currently trying to maintain my cgpa. got 3.97 in the first semester, but am now suffering mentally due to the pressure of compensating for other group members' parts in assignments. i burned all my bridges from my sem 1 class because i was being neurotic about getting good scores for my assignments (coz in my country if we graduate with first class honors we get student loan exemption). the faculty rearranges students in sem 2 by their electives so i got new classmates and have worked really hard at making sure everyone liked me this time, but my god its like working with sloths that i wonder why these people even chose this field to begin with (english isnt a first language in my country and that being said, my english is probably not as good as native english speakers but still better than most from where im from). ive been very nice about taking on the extra workload so the group projects dont turn out like shit and they feel really guilty about not living up to my high expectations. theres another group in my class that i would say is almost as serious as me about getting good scores except theyre kind of standoffish at times (but that might just be because ive created somewhat of a reputation for myself). ive worked with them before and we work well, but ive now become good friends with my current group members despite them being terrible work partners. im thinking of switching groups next semester. possibly jeapordizing my friendships  as well like what happened in my diploma days. its important to note that ill probably never be friends with the other group coz they have their heads way too deep in their own asses to let me in, but i dont wanna seem disloyal and fickle if i do switch groups.",13Dec2019,1
558,"I already posted this on r/teenagers but im not getting a lot of help

I made a post a couple days ago trying to get some support and tell her what I truly felt. 

We had a date planned but she told me she couldnt make it so I asked ver when she could and she simply replied with i dont know. I felt miserable after that. That was yesterday.

 Today I had a terrible day. The day started with me crying at 1 am because I had this idea that she didnt care at all about me. I went to school and I hurt my tooth once again after almost breaking it 11 days ago and having the risk of my tooth dying in some years (btw i still need help with this if you want to try and help send me a message or something. I need every support I can get today)

I told my mum what happened with my tooth and she just yelled at me from the phone which made everything even worse.

 I looked from some support in Carolina (thats her name) but she just made it worst by not saying the right things (this was by text btw). I couldnt hold anymore what I felt so I said that I felt that she didnt care about me and that she didnt even like me at all. She just said sorry but I wanted to know what I did to deserve this disdain from her. 

She explained that I finally found her biggest defect. That she was selfish and that she didnt know how to help with problems form others. She was honest with me and I respected that a lot. And because my emotions were so confused at that moment I told her that I loved her with all the letters. I Just made the confession that I was going to do on the date by text because I couldnt hold my feelings anymore. She said this and I quote ""Omg I was sad and now I'm happy and aaaaahhhhh what do I say? I don't know .... You know what? I still can't tell you if it's mutual but believe me I really really like you a lot and I didn't want you to be like this because of me :("" 

I Just answered with just tell me what you honestly feel. But she just said i dont know. So I asked her what should we do? She said i dont know. 

I said that maybe we should stop talking for a while but she really wanted to keep talking with me. Then I asked her if she wanted to forget everything that happened today and she agreed with that.

 I didnt want that at all but I just want her to be happy and if that makes her happy then ok. So now she just started normal convo like how was your day? And I Just feel terrible and awful. 

What should I do? About everything? Give me your thoughts please. Im feeling so bad. I just want some help. And an hug from Carolina........

Her family is very abusive and growing up her birth parents were horrible and physically abusive, so her grandparents adopted her and her brother. But even her grandparents are shitty, and to make matters worse her father got out of prison after a decade of being out of her life (mind you we are all 17 in high school as of right now) and her father began living with her and her grandparents. I got quite a bit of insight from her on how shitty that combination was. Needless to say, she convinced someone other than her to call CPS for her, and a meeting was legally scheduled about a week ago with her family and everyone. Her family also tried to bribe her with a puppy if she lied to CPS. She’s been gone ever since, and hasn’t been responding to our texts/calls.

569,"So myself and my 2 best friends have been living together for about 3 years now. One of them in particular has terrible living habits that myself and my other roommate have been trying to get him to fix for what seems like forever.

Let's call my friend with the bad habits Dave. At our previous house, Dave was always very messy, would leave his stuff all over the house and would just absolutely trash his room and only ever clean it on special occasions. When it came time to move to our new place, Dave put off cleaning up his huge mess in his room until the very last day of our lease. All of his stuff then ended up boxed up and randomly thrown in our new garage. I'm talking boxes everywhere to the point where we can't even navigate. He immediately said that he would have his stuff more organized by the end of July. Here we are now in December and he's maybe spent 30 minutes going through some of it.

With the new move, we talked to Dave about how we are concerned about his habits and want them to change at our new place. Currently, he probably has close to 30 or so open cans, bottles, countless plates and other dishes all over the place in his room. His clothes scattered all over the floor and in a laundry bin all while his dresser is completely empty and only used to set shit on. Not to mention, the smell is absolutely awful. No matter how many times we have offered to help him clean on trash day, he always just says ""I'll take care of it myself"" and it just continues to build up.

His cat that I primarily take care of has recently had some issues that warrant a vet visit. He blew off the first one, and I had to ask him 5 times before he scheduled another one for this morning. Sure enough, I wake up this morning and he blew it off again. I also have to constantly remind him to clean her litter.

It just kills me to see him come home from work and just bullshit around with his life. Instead of cleaning a pan he's had at the sink for the last week, he'll go into his messy room and play video games until he falls asleep. He refuses to see a therapist for his issues. It's almost like he doesn't have a care in the world for himself or anyone he is around. How can I help my friend? I'm starting to lose hope for him.",13Dec2019,1

Anyways, these calls stopped for about 3 weeks. Last night, I spent the evening at my boyfriends and then came home at around 10:30. I was asleep until my vibrating phone woke me up at around 12:15. I was half-asleep and saw that it was my boyfriend calling me. When I picked up, there was a deep, muffled voice on the other end of the line.

I hang up the phone and I realize that wasn't my boyfriend because it did not sound like him, wasn't his voice, and he had called me on my phone but we always talk via facebook messenger because my boyfriend pays for calling minutes.

575,"I'll start with a bit of background history also, long post so sorry.

Growing up I had what I used to refer to as a hard ass dad. Now I'm aware he was incredibly physically abusive and emotionally abusive. He always phrased it as parenting and that he was doing the right thing by keeping me in line. I started to realize this was manipulative when I started getting in trouble for minor thinngs

My dad is 6'1"" and about 300lbs doesn't drink or do drugs. My mom was a sweetheart and we were very close but ultimately didn't do a damn thing about it growing up. Now she is growing increasingly bitter as I refuse to put up with shitty behavior. I do feel a debt to her but I'm starting to resent her. She's been denying certain things and is starting to develope a ""poor me"" attitude. Which drives me nuts as I've begged her to leave several times. (she's Catholic and believes she shouldn't divorce. )(He's abusive towards her too)

After moving out for adult life things are significantly better. I do live 3hours away from my parents and with them being so poor and me trying to make it on my own i don't have a lot of extra money.
 They've been hounding me on coming down for the holidays. I missed Thanksgiving because of car problems. This is the first year I'm not spending Christmas Eve and day with them because I am spending it with my new boyfriend and his family. I am spending a day with them to celebrate.  I'm sure they are jealous. We've worked on some stuff since moving out. Mostly it's been my parents breaking down about me not talking to them about things and they're mad they don't know things about my life. I promised to work on the communication but it's hard hearing how poor they are and my mom is ""bitchy"" and my dad is a ""dick"". Just a lot of negativity and unchanged behavior. 

 Nothing has been said about the abuse. No closure for me. I do recognize their struggles and the circumstances that brought this behaviour about but that's all I've thought about since 3rd grade. I'm tired of thinking about them and their feelings when they still disregard mine. I want out of the cycle and I want to be different. 

 I've been dragging my feet going home. And recently had a bad dream of my dad flying off the handle at Christmas. My mom just sits there at the table not doing anything while he chases me and hits me. Locks me inside the house. 

I don't want to go home. I don't want to talk to them. I want like a year to myself with no more guilt or obligation.  To not have this constant anxiety of them being mad and driving up here and attacking me. They've never done that but that's the fear. I don't look at them as loving anymore. All they do everytime I see them is get mad that I'm not doing enough. They've never come up here and visited me. They've never helped me or supported me with anything. Is it possible I don't love them any more? 

IN SHORT: Even though my extremely abusive dad and I have worked on some things, I have recently started remembering things about my childhood that I have repressed. I also have started having bad dreams. Should I go home for Christmas? Is this a warning from my conscience?",13Dec2019,1
577,"Sorry for my english

As I wrote in the title, I (21M) am in love with my best friend (21F) since 2 years ago and she just broke up with her boyfriend. 

Obviously she thinks of me as a friend and doesn't realize that I'm in love with her even if it's clear. That is because while she was still in a relationship I had to suppress my feelings to avoid being pushed away by his boyfriend. 

There's another friend of ours that likes her (but don't seem to love her) and dms her every day and it seems she is at least a little interested in him, even if she told me that she is not.

I don't know what to do. 
Should I finally tell her how I feel with the risk that she would label me as a liar for not having told her before or start treating me in a different way ruining the friendship too? 
Or should I accept that she wil never love me, do nothing and keep being her friend?

578,"For the past 2-3 years, I've been using the same profile picture on all my social networks and I'd like to keep using it forever.

This picture is not mine. I found it on the internet one day. Now this isn't a problem, as I'm largely unknown, and have no plans on getting famous. But I fear that if I ever get popular (for example I gain massive followers on Twitter or Instagram) and still use that picture, the owner will see it and ask me for money for the rights of using it.

I've tracked the source of that pic and found the photographer who took it. I've googled her and her only portfolio is her Instagram profile. So she hasn't got any kind of store where she sells her photos.

I realize that I'm on the losing side here because I really want to use that photo, so she could ask me for any large amount of money and I'd have to pay it to use the photo. I'd be fucked (financially).

As I see it, my outcomes would be these (from most preferable to least):

I ask her for her permission to use that photo on my social networks (not for commercial use, not for profit) and she kindly grants me permission. This way I'll be forever reassured I can use it.
I do nothing and hope she never tells me anything.
I ask her for permission to use the photo and she denies and asks for a small sum of money (I can pay).
Like 3 but a large sum of money (unpayable, not worth it).
How should I handle this?

Maybe useful info: she has 10k followers on Instagram. She says she's building a business, so maybe photography isn't her main job, if it's even her job... Maybe a hobby. She's already married and has kids, I guess she is well off now, and wouldn't need to sue people to get extra money.

I kinda want to spend more time with her and shit. I like talking with her and all. 

She dropped me off somewhere this morning. Went to kiss her goodbye and she turned her head and I got the cheek.

We are to school everyday and she trusts me alot, so do I to her. We hang out after school sometimes and text all the time too. She is funny, kind the advice I want is do I tell her If she wants to go in to a serious relationship or do nothing and just stay Best Friends. I am fine both ways, but I fear that If I tell her and she doesn't want it, after that things might get weird and our friendship will probably die. Tho I would be really happy If we get togheter, but I do not wanna loose her. What do I do guys?

583,"Friend A has worked at Company A for a couple years. I recently got the same job as him at company A, albeit at a different location in a different state, and I start in 60 days. I told some people within our friend group about my new job, but not Friend A specifically.

The reason is sometimes Friend A has expressed displeasure at who company A hires, and I wouldn't want him to do something that jeopardizes my candidacy. While not explicitly telling me that he has messed with other peoples applications, he has mentioned the ability he has to do so, along with some other thoughts such as expressing pleasure in it. Also, while our friendship has been generally good, there are times when he will snap, though he does apologize after we talk it out.

The reason I WOULD want to tell him is, I don't want him to think I kept it a secret from him, or kept it hidden behind his back.

It took them over a month to get back to me, only to simply say 'we cannot refund you as per our policy.' but I argued at first that due to the sheer waiting time to get back to me, I still feel I am entitled to a refund. Again they replied two weeks later 'as our policy states blah blah..'

Anyway, I then decided to do some research on the Consumer Rights Act 2015, and it claims that if the customer is not satisfied with the item purchased then they are entitled to the refund. I brought this forward to Trion and they still are adamant on the whole policy thing.

I am here on Reddit now to asking if I truly am entitled to take this further? Trion just emailed me back saying they will now close my support ticket after I said that I will take this further with them.

586,"So I am graduating with a 4 year degree in computer science. These past few weeks I've been putting applications all over the place, but currently have only had two interviews. Both went well, one was in person and led to a job offer last night. The other was over the phone and went very well, and they said they would be in contact in a few days to schedule an on-site visit and meet-n-greet. 

There is a major difference between what the two jobs entail, and thus my dilemma:

The job offer i received last night is for an IT/Helpdesk position at a private school. It ends around June, and pays a salary of 30k a year. However, it would only require me to be at work for 5 hours a day. So roughly $530 a week before taxes for 25 hours a week. Basically a good paying part time job. The extra time is attractive because im interested in doing my own app development, and as I would still be living in the town as my university i could also keep my part time job in the cafeteria. Rent in this town is low, and I know lots of people here. If I don't get a house mate I could probably rent a place for $500 a month. 

The other Job that I have not received an offer for, but seems from my interview that they are at least interested in me, is a little further away so I would probably not be able to live in the little town I am familiar with. However, it seems like an opportunity to get in early and establish myself. The IT manager is new, and is looking to completely revamp and rebuild the old architecture at this company. There would be a lot to do, and a lot of variety of work to let myself shine. I do not know what this job would pay, but I am assuming no lower than 50k a year.

The advice I am seeking is this: The guy at the school needs an answer by monday morning. Do I turn down his job offer in expectation of receiving this second offer? Do I accept it, and tell him I might be receiving a better offer? Or do I say nothing, accept the job, and quit if I get the second? What sort of things should I ask my contact at the second Job to see where they are with the hiring process?

Thank you all in advance for any advice or wisdom you can offer :)",13Dec2019,1

594,"So a little background: i transferred to my current college and will be transferring to a different one in spring because of... poor administrative choices, to say the least. Very, very poor choices.


My gpa from this college isn’t in yet and I won’t have ANY grades in till then. I’ve made As and Bs in most of my classes except one- a polisci class. I understood the material, but the tests just weren’t connecting for me, and I’ve made low Cs throughout the semester. I know, without a single doubt, I will fail the final whether or not I study. It’s not for lack of trying- but between double shifts and 4 other classes, I don’t have time to revise the 28 6-30 page readings he’s assigned throughout the semester. 


I’m leaving anyways, and have been officially accepted into another college, so I’m not worried about that. They also forgive 3 F’s on the transcript, and seeing this is the first semester I haven’t made straight A’s, I’m not too worried.


My question is this: should I just accept the failure and focus on my other final essays/exams? Or should I put in a last ditch attempt to study? And on top of that- is it /really/ that bad to fail a class when I have a 3.9 gpa from the first college?",13Dec2019,1

So. I'm studying in high school rn[17, M]. I started taking vocal lessons at 13 and wasn't at all serious about that. Wasted years and started truly practicing at 15. My friend's opinion on my singing varies. Some say I'm okay in singing. Some say I'm good. Like kinda 2.5-3 outta 5. But yes I've observed improvement in these years. My music teacher agrees on that. And I'm serious and dedicated about singing. But I'm feeling like I need to do something, or else my dreams gonna be wasted. Till now I've sang in chorus groups in my music teacher's concerts, and yea in school. I don't know what actually to do next to enliven my dreams. So, I'd be happy to get y'all's advice about this matter. Yes, if I can make a good career on it, I'd be on top of the planet but I'd be happy with just earning my living by doing something simple based on singing.

597,"So basically, I was on a car ride with my mom going to take her to a doctor appointment, and we stopped at a rest stop on the way back. She kept texting while driving and it was making me mad so I grabbed her phone and saw a questionable text from a man well call Dave. Dave had said something along the lines of ""thinking about you 😘"" and it made me uncomfortable. I thought about it a lot but didn't say anything because hey, he could be anyone and could mean anything, plus I love my mom and she doesn't seem like the kind of person to do this. 

My dad is the most exemplary man I've ever known. He works sometimes 80+ hours a week for our family, spends time with all of us, and loves on my mom so so much. I dont think he knows about ""Dave"" or if he even knows who he is. But I dont want to see my dad get hurt or to watch mom leave us. 

So flash forward to today, and my mom left her phone at home. She asked me to bring it to her at work. Her phone used to be mine, I had to downgrade for other reasons. So for old times sake I just swiped the screen and it opened right up to messages between mom and Dave. I know I shouldn't have read them because that's personal, but I caved because this has been eating at me for a while. Theres some pretty explicit messages clearly showing there is something there. It seems as though it has died down now, but it was very obvious theres something going on. 

So, what should I do? I'm considering asking her who he is, and also considering asking my dad to talk to her about it. I know they are both reasonable and I love them so much, but I am so scared that they will split up because they have fought for each other for 25 years. Please help, thank you.

600,"I finished my masters in a STEM field from a top ten school with a 3.7+ GPA. Unfortunately, with a top ten school comes top ten egos a few of which I inadvertently offended. Certain students in my program had other advanced degrees similar to those held by staff members and I didn't initially realize that there was an expectation from staff that their ideas be treated as if they were excellent even when they weren't. For example there was an incident where one of these students proposed that a department should require the masters degree we were getting for a minimum wage job. This was not only insulting to everyone in the program that didn't have other advanced degrees but would have been a ridiculously unjustified cost to the department. My response was: ""How can we justify the cost of the pay raise that would be necessary to attract applicants if we raise the minimum requirement from no degree to an advanced degree for this position?"" Literally that's it.  I was full on reprimanded by the department because people (with the same degree as him) took offense to this question. I was told that I was being aggressive, overly critical and they expected a formal apology. These kinds of extreme reactions to innocuous behavior makes me now wonder if they are retaliating against me still after I have graduated by preventing me from finding jobs through the Handshake website. This is the website where employers specifically go to recruit students from my school and is generally a great way to get hired out of school since these employers are looking for recent grads and not people with years of experience like most job boards. The website has me listed as a Freshman and as a result employers will not look at my applications because they are not looking to hire freshman. I have been going back and forth for the past few months with the office that handles it where I will notify them of it they will go around for a couple weeks, fix it and then within a day or two an unidentified staff member will manually change it back to saying I'm a freshman. Nobody else in my graduating class is having these issues. I was the one that spoke up the most about issues my classmates and I were having and as a result received the most department backlash.

So my sister moved out when she was 19 (iirc) to move in with her boyfriend (they’re together now, although there was a period recently where they were split up for about a year and she went with someone else but they sorted it all out and are good now). My mum used to go and visit her quite a lot when she first moved out (she lived about 25mins away walking at the time) but ever since then she has gone to see her less and less.

A few years ago my sister moved closer to us and now she only lives a 5-10 minute walk up the road, and she also has 2 kids now. Every time my mum sees her and the kids it’s always that my sister has  to come down to my mums place or they just don’t see each other for ages despite living so close. Every time my sister asks her to come up, whether it be just to spend time with the kids or for a family event (for example she asked us all to come up for new year’s eve and have some drinks and some food at hers) she always makes stupid excuses that most of the time aren’t even true, such as “i can’t i’m washing my hair soon” “i’ve got to go out soon” (even though she doesn’t) “im working late” (when she’s not, she finishes at 3pm every day).

My sister is getting extremely fed up with it and messages me constantly ranting about it which is understandable it’s really starting to annoy me too why she’s making excuses to not see her family for no good reason. I talked to my dad about it and he also has no idea why she keeps doing this and he’s even had arguments with her about it, and the excuse she always makes to him is that she’s been working all week so she’s too tired for it. Which is stupid because we all work all week, that doesn’t mean we can’t make time to go see our family every now and then.

613,"I met this boy at an outreach programme we were doing, and it had been going on for the past 2 weeks and the programme ended today. 

We had rlly nice conversations, and I don’t know, from the moment I saw him my heart was beating out my chest (and that’s never happened before). From the looks of it, it seemed like he was into me — when we would talk he wouldn’t stop smiling, and idk there were multiple times I caught him staring (maybe I’m getting ahead of myself).

I was rlly rlly hoping he’d ask for my number today, but he didn’t. I was on my way out, and he gave me a hug and I said “Hopefully I’ll see you again” and he said “Yeah, hopefully, don’t be a stranger around these parts” referring to his school, and that was it. He didn’t say we should keep in contact. Didn’t overtly say he’ll miss me. Nothing implicating that he wanted my number, like he didn’t even ask for it. 

Judging off of the goodbye we had, i kinda just came to the conclusion that he didn’t like me back (or just wasn’t interested in the same way I was), but I’m finding that so hard to accept. I know we have a mutual friend, and I now I’m trying to convince myself that if he rlly cares, he’ll find my number through her, cos if you love something let it go, and if it comes back it’s true…

But I can’t come to terms with the reality that the fantasy is over. How do I come to grips with this? Do you think there’s a realistic possibility he could pursue this without me having to make the first move? Would he make the first move if he liked me? Mainly, how do I move on?

615,"Me and my brother grew up quite close he is 2 years older than me . We went through some bad childhood trauma together and lived vet similar livers until 18 when we went to different schools. 

Ever since we were younger my brother has been the type of person to crave approval from friends and society. I remember when we were 3 and 4 he pushed me off the sofa when he was with his school friends. I am the opposite in that regard. I prefer only haveing few friends that I know I can trust instead of s bunch of people I will have fights with and let me down.

My brother has a chip on his shoulder when it comes to family. He will shout at my mother and siblings if he is angry and all it takes for him to get angry is a minor disagreement. But he is never this way with friends. He would never show that side of himself to them. I was telling one of my very good friends how we would joke around at home and he could not believe my brother would behave like that. He wears a mask when out of the house

My brother is also very competitive. When we were kids we would play video games and he was usually better. There was a point where I got better than him and he was irate. He got so angry just because I could consistently beat him. My friend played table tennis with him and beat him. He wanted to go and get something to eat and he said my brother refused to let him leave until he gave him a rematch
I believe this is why he gets so angry at any disagreements.  As this habit with me here he can never admit he is wrong. We o ce got in a crazy argument because I corrected him when he said 5 reps of 5 sets and I said you mean 5 sets of 5 reps. He said that is what he said, but it wasn't. He starts shouting as he always does when there is a disagreement.

I never get angry or shout, but I have a natural ability to piss people off. I don't do it on purpose and can control it but their is something about they way I say things that makes me very good at verbal confrontations. I am the person everyone thinks is funny even though I never try to be, I just talk and people find me funny. He has told me I am funny more than once

I did not back down from this confrontation because I know what he said and he has done things like this before. The argument dies down and he goes even if I said it you know what I meant. When he said that I was shocked because it meant he knew I was right but did not want to admit it. 

He does littl things like this. One time he was dining a backstreet boys song in the show and I joked with him about it. He got angry at me absented singing it. When we argue he is the type of person who tries to hurt me by going after my perceived flaws. Again he is never this way with friends.

Any time we argue he never comes to me to break the ice. I would always go to him after 7 days or so. One time I said duck it let him break the ice. We did not speak for 3 months. All this time we lived in the same house. 

At school this guy got angry with him and was getting very aggressive. It was a disagreement and this guy was getting aggressive in a way that showed he wanted to fight. People were trying to hold him back. My brother was not the wrong person in this situation, the other guy was 100% wrong and was being ridiculous.

My brother is older than me but I have always been bigger, taller  and stronger than him. He would never admit it but I am and I have always been. He came to me when this guy was getting aggressive. He did not say anything but wheh this guy started getting aggressive he came to me and made sure I was right behind him. I was not going to let a hair on his head be harmed and I stood their quietly.

The guy who was angry with him was pissing me off and he had was at fault and had no right to be angry. When the situation died down, a few minutes after he went to go and break the ice with him and be cool with the guy and tell him let's not fight. This was a guy we had only known for 2 months. He was not his friend.

We went through some very traumatic things when we were younger.

So fast forward some years and he has moved out. I have been out of work and admittedly I need to make some major improvements. He has s good degree and a job. He moves out and he is saying stuff like he will never come back and he cannot live with our mother. I don't like the way he talks down to me when we talk but I take it because I don't want to get in a disagreement with him because he cannot have them, only shouting matches.

He tells me stuff like do I want to live at home forever. But he is not saying this in a helpful way. He is saying it in a way that is like o have left and made lives and you have not. Their is a positive way of conveying this but he says it in a way that shows he is comparing our situations and saying he is better.

He quits his job and has 6 months left in his lease. He is moving back home. After talking down to me about being at home and talking all this dhutbyo me about even if he has to hustle at a ware house he will do it. I supported him at the time and told him if it comes to that he needs good shoes. He points to the shoes I have him because they were to small for me


So now he is coming back. He comes to the house and he starts complaining about there being no food and some things not being clean. He is saying this in a jokey way but when I tell him just bring your own food in a jokey way back he gets serious and angry with me. It is subtle but he is not joking and acts as if how dare I give him a suggestion.

We get in an argument after this. I can't remember exactly what stated it but he has a hair trigger when it comes to me even slightly swaying he should do something different. Even when telling him where to put the rubbish in which bing because the trash men won't take it if it is it sorted right, I am on egg shells seeing if he will get angry.

During the argument it got to the point where I straight up said you talked all this shot about moving out and even javing to work retail and your never coming home but here you are. He is always crithcusibfnhe and talking down to me.

I never realise how pervasive this was. Even when joking he is insulting be slyly but he would never take the same from me. It hot yo the pint where he admitted he would never even take the slightest criticism from someone like me. I am just talking about telling him to stop complaingkbg there is no food any time he comes over,

He accuses me of being jealous of him. I have never been jealous of him ever. There was a time that a girl I like became his girlfriend and I was never jealous. She ended up treating him like shut and I supported him.

Even if I was going to be jealous of someone it would not be him. He had a basic graduate salary job and a good degree and a girlfriend but those thugs mean nothing to me.  If I was going to be jealous of someone it would be a young millionaire. I have been admiring the discipline and fare work of s certain famous person lately sbdbad never been jealous of him.

I realise he only said I sound jealous of him because he thinks he is better than me. He is looking at his situation and looking down on me. He has compared me and him before and also our other sibling saying the things he did better than us.

I dont now how I can carry this situation going forward. I can't just call him and let us going back to joking around because this is not the first time this year this has happened. He has majorly disrespected me earlier this year when I was trying to aid him with something.

He also fights and swears at our mother. Againhe would never shout at his friends. One of our sisters asked him if he ever get angry and insults his friends like this and he said no.

Some of his friends have screwed him over big time and he would never blow up at them. One of his fiends was trying to get him to call in sick because he needed his help in his court case. He gave my brother no advance to book a holiday and insisted he call in sick. This was during one of our dumb after fight silence periods and I fully agreed with him. He did not blow up at him like he does with us. He only talked about loudly.

I can't act like brothers and friends with a guy who does not respect me and sees me as lesser than him. He wants me to visit but he was pulling his bullshit again. He basically decides I am wrong and he is right and uses any justification to prove that even though it does kotmsne sense. I was going to just call him up and say and visit, but if I go to his house I don't want to be in a situation where he tells me to get the fuck out.

I can't carry on our relationship like this. I can be walking on eff shells around him and joke and laugh with a guy I know does not respect me even if he is my brother 

Me trying to bring up where I think he is not treating me right will just lead to a crazy argument. I always apologise to him if I ever piss him off or even if he takes something the wrong way

I am going to work on myself for some time abd I don't think I will have a relationship with him for a while.",13Dec2019,1

Can u guys give me tips on how to start a conversation with a girl ?",13Dec2019,1
618,"i (20m) had an argument with my girlfriend (20f), and this was over the course of a day or two

basically, i took some adderall to help me do an allnighter to study for a tough final the next day, and she disapproves. she is judging me for it, and i feel like shes talking down to me when we were discussing it; essentially telling me im not cautious enough, im being flippant about it (i made a joke about it), and that i am misusing/abusing adderall, even though this is the first time ive taken it.

i feel like this is super hypocritical because she enjoys some weed here and there, and i dont see how this is any different. when i compared me and her, or how she views her friends taking adderall, she told me its different and that me being casual about it is what is not okay

am i underreacting? or is my girlfriend overreacting? i feel bad about arguing it but i genuinely dont think im in the wrong",13Dec2019,1
619,"About two years ago I (22F at the time) moved to Seattle from Arkansas with my gf. She breaks up with me shortly after the move, I stay because Arkansas is lame and I’ve been trying to leave my whole life. I make it work. I find a decent job that allows me to be able to afford living in a house alone which is my preference. I meet this girl. I’m known for moving things too quickly but she takes it to a whole new level and about a month after meeting we get married. I don’t need anyone to tell me I’m stupid for doing that I already know. I had friends and colleagues telling me not to marry her but I did anyway. I ignored all the red flags, and there were plenty. The vision I had of our future looked so beautiful I wanted more than anything for that to be true. The reality is our relationship sucks, she’s a substance abuser and emotionally manipulative/abusive. She makes me cry almost every day. And shortly after we get married she talks me into quitting my decent job. Takes me 3 months to find a new one. But I do and it’s working at a cemetery as a family service advisor. I love the job. So much I’ve never felt this way about a job before. But every day that I come home happy about work she makes my life hell. Our relationship got so bad at one point my work put me up in a hotel just to get me away from her. Obviously I’m miserable at this point. And it’s embarrassing for me to have let my private issues seep into my professional life I just couldn’t keep it together and she was threatening to come get me fired. I let my younger brother (18)  kind of know what’s going on and he lets my dad know that I’m not happy in my situation and need help. My dad and I have an interesting relationship. My mom convinced me my dad was the antichrist when I was young so I had almost no contact with him from the time I was 10-18. Once I discover it’s my mom who is the POS I try rebuilding my relationship with my dad but it’s hard. Being from conservative Arkansas, my dad isn’t a fan of the gays. Which i am. He really struggles with it because it goes against his beliefs but he tries to love me anyway. And he has. He’s been very helpful and loving since I’ve let him back in my life. I don’t know what I would’ve done without him at some points. Well, he’s now living in Florida and offering to move me and my kitty from Seattle to live in Florida with him. My dad isn’t a stranger by any means but we’re not close, we don’t make phone calls to each other, some occasional texting but that’s about it. I feel like I hardly know him. I guess I just don’t know what to do here. Stay and make living in Seattle work or leave this bitchy wife of mine and move to Florida to live with my dad. I’m a pretty independent person, so taking so much help From my dad and being under his roof again doesn’t sound too appealing but at the same time my current situation sucks. I just don’t know if I should give up on Washington (which I love) or stay and make it work. Im just looking for some advice on what to do. I know I word vomited I’m sorry. All of this has built up for months and I haven’t talked to anyone about it.",13Dec2019,1
620,"As title says, aside from when I was born, I've never been to the doctor in my almost 25 years of living. Mostly due to the fact my mother is anti modern medicine. Anyways.

Do I just look up general practicioners in my network, make an appointment and go? Do I need to find specific doctors for specific needs or if I go to a general one can they direct me where to go? Do I dump all of the problems I have all at once in the first visit or should I make an order of importance and go down the list through numerous visits? 

I don't really have anyone to ask and social situations give me anxiety (one if the reasons I want to go to the doctor) so if I could get a general idea of how it's go and what I should do it's help immensely. Thank you.",13Dec2019,1
621,"So first of all, I live in an apartment complex in a college town. Because it’s mostly students, we have quiet hours of 10pm - 8am. This all began about a month ago. I had come home from work at around 11pm and I had that after physical work hyper adrenaline that happens sometimes. I was talking to my husband about... well, new cheeses at work, and he was in the bathroom while I was in the living room. I was totally being loud and excited, admitted. I hear a knock on the door and it’s a girl who says she lives above us and can hear everything I’m saying. I apologize instantly and tell her we’ll stop. I go tell my husband what went down and he and I are surprised that she’s able to hear us at a level that would inspire her to say something. We acknowledge to each other that we don’t put a lot of thought into the quiet hours system since we’re generally quiet homebodies who retire into reading or low volume TV in the late night hours. 
About a week later, and we’ve been actually putting some effort into staying quiet during quiet hours, even going so far as to lower our TV to a quiet volume (like 8 out of 100) and talk in very low voices. One morning, we get an email from apartment staff with a noise complaint and we are shocked. Even if she could hear a low buzz of our TV and voices, that’s imo totally normal noise to hear in an apartment complex with thin walls and not at all worthy of a noise complaint. We hear the low sound of our next door neighbor watching TV and are totally fine with it. So we emailed our apartment staff in reply and said that we had been trying to be really quiet for the past week after she confronted us and for her to complain about us only serves to make us feel like we have to walk on eggshells in our apartment. The staff was sympathetic but can’t really do anything.
Thanksgiving came and went and we’ve been religiously being super super quiet during quiet hours. We whisper and turn our TV to volume 4, which is practically muted. It’s annoying but I’ve told my husband that it’s not the worst thing to be forced into a quiet calm nighttime routine. 
However!!! The last few days at around 8ish we’ve had a movie or music going and this girl has the AUDACITY to like, slam a broom handle on the floor bang-bang-bang-bang as if to tell us to quiet down! When it isn’t quiet hours!!!!! We are shocked and pretty pissed because a) our noise level is totally normal and not out of hand b) she has no control over how loud we are when it isn’t quiet hours. We could be having a party. and c) what can we do about this? We can’t tell our apartment staff that we think she’s telling us to be quiet because it’s arguable that she isn’t doing that. It’s just so obvious with the sudden intensity and quick pounding that that’s what she’s doing. 
To underscore this whole thing with an extra level of frustration - she is weirdly always home and silent (if she just watched TV or listened to music I feel like she wouldn’t care what we’re doing) (also if she went out and had some fun with friends maybe she would be less nitpicky about what she hears) (yes some people are home a lot, we are for sure, but we read/watch tv/play video games and she... doesn’t do anything??) but she infrequently has loud, moany sex that we can 100% hear from beginning to end. Sometimes this happens like once a week, sometimes a couple days in a row. And it is usually during quiet hours. So it truly baffles the mind that she thinks it’s chill for her to have cacophonous sex and we must not hear her if she apparently hears every pin-drop inside our apartment. 

Tl;dr our upstairs neighbor has been very picky about our noise level and has started banging on the floor to tell us to be quiet during non-quiet hours, not sure how to handle it",13Dec2019,1

624,"Hey guys. So I’ve been in this horribly depressed state for about a year now and I am sooo over it. I’ve watched myself become a different person. I’ve racked my mind on why it’s like this. At first, i thought it was because I moved to Colorado from Wisconsin away from my family. I did so because it was so toxic back home. I decided a few months ago I’d move home but when I went home for thanksgiving it just felt so wrong moving back. I only have my sister, my grandma, and baby niece. Although I deeply miss them everyday, I HATE Wisconsin. It just isn’t my place. But anyways, I think I’ve found the problem (the core of it) and need some advice. So my best friend and I moved to Colorado together, it’s been a year and a half now. I have loads of empathy so I have always been there for her through the hard times and we’ve been through a lot together. But the problem is now our friendship has just spiraled into her only coming to me about sad things and it has brought me down so much. It is also ruining our friendship. I can’t be there for her AND take care of my own mental health. We also barely talk about anything else. I feel uncomfortable talking to her about my relationship or anything going on in my life cause she just kinda checks out when I try to talk. Or she kind of compares her problems to mine so i just feel excused kind of? Like my problems don’t matter anymore. And I totally understand mental health, so please don’t take this as me complaining about her lol. But anyways, I’m getting so stressed because i really don’t want to live in the same home with her anymore so we can have a normal friendship again. (Having movie nights, inviting each-other over, normal shit) But our lease is up February and I have no clue where i could move. I don’t wanna be stuck in a home I don’t wanna be in for another year. UGH GUYS I just needed a place to talk about this. Thank you.",13Dec2019,1
625,"My brother and his girlfriend want to decide when I can bring my girlfriend over

So I just moved into a house my brother is renting, I decided that it would be nice to be around him since growing up we were kinda distant. Before moving, he requested that him and his girlfriend get “comfortable” with my Gf before she starts sleeping over, I agreed and I moved in. 3 weeks in, and they’ve met her 6 times, and I’ve started bringing her over. Now they’re creating a fuss about me bringing her over because they aren’t comfortable with her yet because my Gf doesn’t “open up enough” to them during those 6 times, keeping in mind my Gf has been around them and has been with me for over a year. Now they tell me their definition of comfort is having a close relationship with my Gf, and that they wanted a month plus of hanging out with her before letting her sleep over or coming over. So I’m paying close to $1k a month, I have the smallest room in the house and I share a bathroom with his Gfs mom, keeping in mind they pay $1900 for a 3 bedroom. So now we are bickering because I think they’re approach is too extreme and imposing on my relationship. What do y’all think?",13Dec2019,1

629,"My friend and I are 20 years old and we've been good friends for over a decade. The lie he told me was extremely petty/silly, it was simply that he got scouted for a professional League of Legends team (a video game I don't personally play). 

Basically he said he was in the top 0.1% of players and a professional team recognized his talent. He claimed they offered try-outs for the team mid January and if he was good enough he would become a pro player with a jersey + salary and all that glory. But yesterday I caught him in his lie when I looked up his account to only to find out he was in the top 29%, not nearly good enough to be pro. YIKES.

It really seems like something a little kid would make up but I've known him for years and I absolutely never thought this would be something he would lie about. I completely believed him as he continued to lie to cover up his tracks throughout the past 3-4 weeks. I would give him motivational pep talks, advice on keeping focus on practicing, how I was so proud of him, etc when in reality I was a complete chump. He even sent me fake screen shots of his games against some of the top ranked people.

I wasn't mad when I found out but I felt really weirded out that he would just lie to my face for weeks on end. I thought I knew him well enough to the point I was confident he would never construct such a childish lie. So what I'm wondering is, am I over-reacting with how much this bothers me? I don't want to end our friendship but right now this ruins my trust for him. Is there something you'd say to him if you were me? I feel like I'm in middle school again",13Dec2019,1
630,"TLDR; at bottom 

Mom was a recovering alcoholic for 15 years and she recently relapsed. As usual, she becomes hateful towards my dad while inebriated. 

I spoke with my aunt as we were all concerned about her drinking and driving and she confessed that my mom is currently talking to the man that she cheated on my dad with during her bad patch of drinking. 

Backstory: her dad died while she was at a women’s group AA “conference”with this man when her dad had a heart attack and died. The guilt caused her to spiral into her alcoholism. This man is obsessive and even contacted me many years later on social media and has also located my aunt in the past too. I overheard convos as a kid where he would be verbally abusive to her and tell her to kill herself. He is clearly violent and an abuser. 

If she is talking to him again, then she must be in pain and letting her trauma + alcoholism win. I know if my dad found out, this would be a betrayal just as bad as cheating even if there was no physical relationship. 

Do I confront my mom first because she obviously has a secret about this guy and is in pain or do I just say fuck it and tell my dad what is happening... ruining everything right in time for the holidays? I just don’t think I can sit in a room with her and pretend everything is ok. 

TLDR; alcoholic mom relapsed after 15 years of sobriety and got in touch with an abusive old flame who she cheated on my dad with in the distant past. Which parent do I confront first?",13Dec2019,1
631,"I feel really down. I'm in a ldr. I'm in Europe my bf is in Australia. I'm going to move there in January. I'm currently crying in my bed so my post might be messy. 

I've been feeling down for the last few months. I really love my country and if it wasn't for my boyfriend I wouldn't leave it. But I like Australia and I'm young so I can take risks and I don't want to have regrets. So I'm giving it a shot. However, my grandparents aren't the youngest anymore and I'm terribly scared something might happen to them while I'm away. A few days ago my grandpa told me he might have to have a surgery on his head while I'm away but it's not certain yet. I'm really stressed and scared. I'm also stressed about leaving my family and friends in general. 

When I was 14 I was in my first relationship. The guy denied my existence to everyone and raped me. He manipulated me into thinking I'm worthless and ge also blackmailed me with nudes that ge took after he raped me so I couldn't leave. I tried to kill myself during this time and started cutting myself. 2 years later he got tired off me and broke up. I got my life under control again and started living. When I was 17 I met my second boyfriend. We were together for 2 years and he is a great guy. We're still friends. However, he is from a very religious family and never introduced me to his family. I was always hidden away on social media. It kinda bothered me because I always saw other friends who posted pictures of their so or commented their pictures. Shallow and superficial I know but I kinda wished I could have it too.

Anyway, now I'm in a relationship with my 3rd boyfriend and we're generally very happy. However, it's been 4 months since I saw him which is the longest so far and I just hate it. I just want to hug him and be with him. There is so much going on in my life at the moment and I cry myself to sleep so often. On top of everything, my boyfriend's grandpa is very sick and will probably die very soon. My bf and I usually talk about everything, we're really good communicators but I haven't really told him how done I've felt lately because I don't think it would be right given his situation. 

I've told him how it's always been my dream to have a boyfriend who openly shows me off and does all the cute social media stuff. I feel so embarrassed for saying this. I'm 22 and I'm hung up on something so stupid. But somehow I just really want it.
Anyway, so yesterday for the first time in weeks I felt somewhat good and I decided to do my makeup. My boyfriend loves when I send him selfies and he says it cheers him up. So I did my makeup in my boyfriend's favourite way and took some selfies. I felt so good and I was really really pretty. I sent the selfie to my bf when he woke up. He said he loved it and I told him I also posted it on Instagram. He then went to work and I went to sleep. In the morning we called and I spent the whole time trying to cheer him up. I didn't mention any of my struggles because it wouldn't be the right time now. I need to be there for him. I mentioned the Instagram post again and he said he'd have a look at it. He then showed me stuff on Facebook and then we ended the call. A few hours later he told me he was going to sleep and I asked him if he'd been on Instagram. He said no. 
I feel so dumb because I know how ridiculous it is. But it would mean so much to me and it would only take 30 seconds. But obviously I'm not going to say anything because it's just ridiculous to tell him again how happy it would make me when his grandpa is dying. 
Anyway, I think this has just been the straw that broke the camel's back and now I'm in bed crying. We didn't fight or anything and he doesn't know I'm crying but he did know how much it would mean to me. 

I don't really have a specific question. I feel horrible for how I feel. But at the same time I don't know what to do anymore. Any advice?

Tldr. I'm a mess

635,"Basically, my mom's recently installed an app on my phone called Life 360. If you're familiar with the app, you know that its main purpose is to track peoples' location, which is what she's doing. She can see exactly where I am at any given moment. She says it's for safety reasons, but recently it's felt more invasive than anything. I have nothing to hide, it's just the principle of having absolutely no privacy. 

If she doesn't hear from me for thirty minutes or more she panics and calls me over and over, or texts me demanding to know where I am and what I'm doing.

Another feature of the app is that she can see exactly how fast I drive. This has caused yet another issue.

Yesterday I was driving down a highway where the speed limit was 65. I was hovering at about 69, everything was fine, until today when I wanted to leave the house. My mom freaked out and banned me from going *anywhere* until after Christmas because I went FOUR MILES over the speed limit. I tried explaining how ridiculous that is, but I was hit with the cold shoulder. She's not hearing any of it. 

I just don't understand. There's no taking the app off my phone, because if I even joke about it she threatens to take away my insurance meaning I would lose my car. (I am technically on her insurance, but I am 18 years old and I make the *incredibly expensive* monthly payment, PLUS the car payments all myself.)

637,"It might seem like a no-brainer at first, but here are the circumstances:

I’m looking to enroll in community college classes next semester so mine and my mom’s loans can stay in deferment. My mom is planning a big move at the end of the month and although she would be willing to pay for the classes, she’s not happy about the idea because she needs to hold onto money for the move. 

No job I have applied to has hired me yet, and so I am unable to pay for the courses. But I did fill out fafsa and am eligible to take out around $5000 in loans. If I did this, I could pay for school and I could save the financial aid return check to pay for an apartment, once I land a job of course. I’ve decided I don’t want to stay with my mom mostly because we have a strained relationship (completely separate issue), and it’d easier to move to a new apartment with all my stuff while I’m still in the state. 

This is my issue: I’m already in quite a bit of debt (around $30,000 in my name and $100,000 in my mom’s which I agreed to pay once I started making money) from completing my degree.  and I don’t know about adding more. 

However my mother needs to save money, like I said. Also, she is the type to do a favor for you but then complain about it and hold it against you. Without getting into too much detail, she recently helped me financially despite my insisting she didn’t have to, but now periodically throws in my face what an inconvenience it was for her. 
 
So part of me is wondering: should take out the loans and go through with my tentative plan, or should I just let my mom pay for the community college classes?",13Dec2019,1

641,"Hi so I'm a fairly young person and I think I have depression and anxiety. It's weird though because it doesn't sound like the typical description of either like sometimes I want to hurt other people and then I hurt myself instead I've never felt comfortable in my own body but even though i want to i cant bind which makes everything worse sometimes I just feel empty and that makes me want to hurt myself more and I feel guilty for having panic attacks when my friends are there I feel like I just ruin everything. My parents are quite traditional and won't let me get help and I'm scared to talk to them about it as well they tend to beat me and I don't think I've gone a day without being toldim useless and nobody wants me. As well as this I've been in quite a few relationships where I've felt really uncomfortable but couldn't say no because I felt guilty about turning people down and I've been sexually assaulted by my ex and emotionally abused by someone who I thought was my best friend. I've tried to kill myself a couple of times but I'm stupid enough for it not to have worked. I cant really see there being anything else to live for at this point I feel like everything's my fault because at some point when things keep happening it reflects on you too but my friends are so sweet and supportive and I feel like I'm letting them down but not getting better.
Can I have some advice please?

i am fairly feminine and i definitely feel feminine. ive never thought “girl” or “woman” has ever suited me though. im definitely not a boy. ive tried using he/him pronouns and it just made everything 10x worse. but i still feel uncomfortable being called a girl or a woman. i dont know if this is stemmed from past trauma ive experienced or if my dysmorphia is developing into dysphoria (if that can even happen.)

657,"Hey so I'm 17 and I'm suffering from premature ejaculation during masturbation and I suspect it's lifelong as I've experienced it 99 percent of the times I've masturbated. I remember one instance where I couldn't reach orgasm early but that's about it. I'm a virgin and I'm worried if I would ejaculate early during actual sex which is going to be more stimulating than masturbation. I've tried no masturbating but that doesn't seem to work. Edging increases the overall time I spend in the bathroom but that's about it. I don't see improvements from it and it'd be absolutely silly to stop every 30 seconds during actual sex so you don't cum too early. The maximum I've edged for is 3-4 minutes out of which I'm sure 60-70 percent of the times I was just staring at my cock. Anyways, there are a few other common tips I've found on the net like squeezing and pinching and doing all sorts of weird things but I don't really understand why'd someone want to do all these stupid things during sex. Anyways, the squeeze and start and stop method I've tried, and they don't seem to give me any results. I masturbate real slow and breath as well and the maximum I can last for is 40-60 seconds.  Back in the days when I first started masturbation i.e. when I was 15, I never new reaching orgasm as fast as possible is not ideal and I used to go as fast as I could. I used to do this 1-3 times a day, daily. That could possibly be a reason behind my pe? But if it were, then abstaining from masturbation for literally a year should have cured it. But it didn't. So I still suspect I've got lifelong PE. I'm yet to try kegels and reverse kegels but about kegels specifically I've heard it worsens PE. I'm not really sure if it does, but if that's true. I'd not do it. Anyways, this is another weird thing I've seen on the internet.  They give me tips for curing my PE but at the same time there are equally popular articles from reliable sources that oppose those tips. Like for example, I see people say kegels cure PE but when I googled about curing delayed ejaculation, they recommended kegels there as well.  What the hell?! Anyways, since I'm just 17, I don't have enough money to see a good sexologist or urologist. I don't have the balls to go up to my dad and talk to him about it as he's against the whole idea of masturbation (he's orthodox) and would kill me if he knows I masturbate. So if y'all could give me some advice and guidance, it'd be really great. It'd be great if you shared your experiences with kegels or edging too and I'd be more than happy if someone who had suffered from lifelong PE shares his way of overcoming it too. I'm just 17 and thus inexperienced. Thank you so much for taking time reading this post.",13Dec2019,1

675," For context: I'm 24f, oldest of 3 siblings, my parents first split for a year when I was 13, ""reconciled"" for a year then split again and were divorced by the time I was turning 16. 

  I was very close to my dad when I was young, we went fishing together, he chaperoned every field trip, he spent a lot of time with me, he was the ""fun dad""...As years went by, he became more distant and less involved. I now assume it was depression and my parents' failing marriage. He was never the same way with my younger siblings (5 and 8 years younger) as he was with me when I was small, I admittedly resent him a bit for doing that to them, not spending time with them or guiding them. In spite of growing apart some, I still visited my dad a lot and we were relatively close, until about 3 years ago. 

  After my parents divorced, dad dated &amp; lived with the same woman for several years. I didn't particularly like her, but she wasn't horrible at all and she loved my dad. We would meet for holidays, cook dinners every other weekend, things like that... She wanted to get married &amp; he didn't, so they broke up.

  Less than 6 months later, my dad asked me to be a bridesmaid in his wedding (via text) to a new woman I'd only met briefly once. I said ""No, I'm sorry but I really don't feel comfortable doing that, I don't know her."" He didn't respond, his fiancee never reached out to me. My siblings were in the wedding party, went to the photo sessions, shopping, bridal shower, rehearsal dinner etc...I wasn't invited to any of that. As the wedding got closer, my cousins on my mother's side received invitations and I didn't. My dad never called me, nobody did. I did not attend the wedding.

  Our relationship has been basically non existent since. Shortly after the wedding I had a medical emergency &amp; was briefly hospitalized, my mom called him and left a voicemail explaining what happened...He never called back, never showed up at the hospital, never checked in. Now he sends an automated ""good morning"" text every morning &amp; I reply the same, but that's about it. Last Christmas I got a gift for him, his wife, and his step children; I texted him several times to arrange meeting to drop it off, it never happened. On Father's Day this year, I called and he didn't answer. I texted him ""Happy father's day, love you!"" and he did not text me back. My siblings now see him every 6 months or so, they just get the same automated texts as me every morning. 

  It seems like he's lost interest in us entirely, but idk, maybe he's worried it's us who don't want a relationship?? I've been thinking a lot about reconciliation lately because I'm getting married and having a baby in the near future...I never knew my dad's dad, they never had a relationship. I met him once before he passed. Dad has always been closer to his step father, even changed his last name to his, but never so close that I saw him regularly and formed a bond. I want to have a relationship with my dad &amp; I want my future child to have a grandfather that I didn't have, but I don't know if it's doable or how to do it.

TLDR: My dad and I have grown apart, I'm considering reaching out to him but I don't know if I should or how I should.

So I asked him if we could do that again and he said yeah basically. But when I asked him if he wanted to hang out again he said that he had work the next few weekends which was fine. But also that he wasnt sure if he wanted to pursue anything romantic so I tried to lay off on the suggestive behavior.

However the other day I ended up asking him if he wanted to talk on the phone sometime and he said yeah maybe. And that he doesnt usually do phone calls because he doesnt know what to say. So I'm line okay that makes sense.

But I felt weird about asking him that and I apologized for seeming and acting weird about it because of what he said before. 

Then he says that his feelings havent changed and that he doesnt want anything romantic but is fine with talking and stuff.

So idk, I really like him but I'm not sure if i should give up on this one.

I know you cant make someone feel the same way you do but I was hoping to at least hang out again or develop whatever we have into a relationship. But I guess that wont happen.

678,"So, I have an ex husband with whom I have a daughter. We have joint custody so we speak almost everyday and see each other quite regularly. We divorced in 2012 and I’ve never had any interest in him since. However, he has remarried 3-4 times since, and every time there are troubles with his new marriage, or he is just feeling alone he tries to reach out to me “anonymously”. 
In 2015 we had a very nasty custody battle bc I was up front with his wife and told her what he was doing, (messaging me on Snapchat while they were on vacay, I only replied twice with very short 2-3 words sentences) so she decided it would be best to fight me for full custody and push me out of daughter’s life.  Things got very ugly, very fast.

He is now married to someone else. 2 days ago he called me when he knew I would be alone picking our daughter up from school.. and he basically apologizes for what happened during our custody battle and says that he still has feelings for me, but to keep the phone call a secret because his new wife will flip out out. 

So now I’m conflicted. I don’t hide things from my husband. Ever. My conscious eats me alive so to speak, which is what has been happening for the last 2 days and I can’t stand it. But, if I tell my husband he is going to freak out. Like. Majorly. And he will tell my daughters new step mother as well. Rightfully so. 

But it will cause so many issues if I tell. My husband already has a very strange dislike for my daughters father because of things he did and said during our custody battle. And I really like my daughters step mother. I don’t want to cause any trouble for anyone. But holding this inside is killing me. I have no friends to discuss with. Literally, no one. 
So, dear people of Reddit, PLEASE give me the best advice you can.",13Dec2019,1
679,"I’ve been trying to find another job in the restaurant industry because my current job is going downhill and I’m not making near as enough money as I should be. Any restaurant I see a potential in working for, I sadly find out they tip share amongst the busser and/or host. My job I have at the moment thankfully doesn’t do tip share and I want to work at a restaurant that doesn’t tip share because I need to keep all the tips that I make.

681,"This is my first post, I hope this community can be helpful as I don't know who to turn to for advice right now without being judged. 
-I'm 23 YO male living in California-
I'm fucking torn, im sitting in my car crying my eyes out right now because I just got an email from my would be new employer saying I'm disqualified because of my background check. I been homeless for about a year now. Living in a tent during the warm spring and summer and now living in my girlfriend's car during these rainy seasons. I recently settled a court case that I was charged with by my ex(baby mama) from over a year ago. The charge was criminal threats with intent to terroize. Sounds pretty fucking terrible on paper, but anyone who knows me should know I wouldn't harm a fly. I could go on and on about how I'm innocent and how she set me up basically, but the case is closed now so it's no use, basically I got off pretty good given that the evidence was not at all in my favor and I'm a guy, she's a innocent little girl blah blah blah. I was only charged with a misdeamor instead of a felony, am on 3 years probation, have to do Domestic violence classes for a year all of which I have to pay for, nevermind the fact that I'm homeless and unemployed. So I've come to accept that it is what it is, I cant control certain things or people. So now that the case was all settled, I finally felt free to get my life back on track, start looking for work, I get an interview for a warehouse job, it goes great, she wants to hire me, all is well I fill out all the paperwork and consent to background check and drug screening. Few days later now we are here, I get an email from the employer saying I disqualify for employment based on the misdeameanor charge. Fuck. This job was the one thing I had to look forward to as far as my life goes. And it's not even like ""oh well there's plenty of other jobs out there"" no. This is a simple warehouse job , they are supposedly the easiest kinds of jobs one can get with a criminal background. So now what are my options? I have no money, what the hell are my options as far as getting work? I appreciate any and all comments that aren't judgemental or counter productive. And I'll answer any questions or provide information I may have left out if requested, thanks for reading.",13Dec2019,1

I was off on FMLA for two weeks last month for a foot injury that wasn't healing. Well, after the FMLA, my situation hadn't improved and I put in my notice with my boss and quit in the last few days. Yesterday, I received a letter in the mail from the FMLA dept. asking me to pay for a month of leave ( which i haven't taken; i only took two weeks). This means that my boss never emailed the FMLA dept. and told them that I had returned from FMLA, so now the FMLA dept. are billing me for my unpaid medical insurance.  

I sent my former boss a text on his personal cell that I needed his help resolving this, but he never responded to me. I think that he's angry about me quitting when I did, putting more work on his plate, so he's just ignoring my pleas for help. He's always gotten back to me promptly in the past.

Should I text him again, politely, and ask for him to fix the issue again?

I fear that he might be screwing with me. I don't want to anger him by asking him again, but I will if necessary. I called the FMLA dept hotline and they say that only my boss can cancel my FMLA. What's the smart thing to do here? Thank you so much.",13Dec2019,1

690,"This evening I saw an old friend of my sister from highschool. She was sleeping in a park I was just crossing. I recognized though my sister and her not having seen each other and having no contact for 3 years. She seemed completely in need of shelter and food.

The story is,she has been living on the streets the last 5 months. Her very strict parents kicked her out of the house after learning she was consuming alcohol in high quantities and doing drugs. She herself is an atheist but well, her parents are very religious as she told me. And on her days on the streets she also got some shitty tattooes which her parents would never accept either.

She turned 18 only a few weeks ago, I took her to my flat where I live alone. But she also seems very depressed and I fear she might commit suicide too. I'm a very busy man and make it barely home at days. I have no clue how I could help her.

Can someone enlighten me on what to do in such situations? And is also there a legal side to this? As much as I want to help someone who I myself almost don't know, I don't want to get into trouble neither. I just saw my little sister before my eyes.

692,"So, I’m am a high school student enrolled in a advanced program at a public high school. Recently I have completely lost my motivation, it started when I took the mandatory normal level classes, the teachers just didn’t seem to care and it was an almost auto 80+. The problem is that it is mind numbingly boring and it is killing my motivation in my other important classes.

 I am procrastinating on all my major projects and making excuses to stay home from school, things I never used to even want to do. This represents a major problem in my life as I need a set average to continue on in the program and the classes I love. I should probably add that I have had some problems at home mainly my parents split but that happened more that 1.5 years ago and I have had no problems until this semester so I don’t believe that to be a factor.

I feel like it’s just that the first half of my school day is me staring at power points on subjects I all ready know asking basic questions that the teachers don’t even seem to want to answer and often just straight up ignores while the rest of the class either sleeps or messes around. The second half of my day when I need to be on top of my game and asking questions to get clarification I can’t sum up the effort. Has anyone else ever experienced a sudden lack of motivation? If so, any advice to help me get out of this rut would be VERY appropriated.

P.S. Sorry for any formatting and grammar mistakes this was done on mobile. Also, I don’t feel comfortable having someone proof read this so if it comes off as an attempt to make a pity party I apologize that was not my intention.

693,"Long story short, for the last 3 weeks my boss did a 180 in her behaviour towards me and 100% excludes me from everything. At first, she wouldn't respond my texts about work, so I mostly spoke to the secretary about things because she clearly didn't want to talk to me. Now that we are approaching the end of the year, she didn't include me in Secret Santa, only the other teachers (I teach at a language school). She didn't include my students nor told me about ""ice cream day"" (something she does occasionally to celebrate holidays), which is basically distributing ice cream to the students. Last tuesday, she took me out of my class to lecture me about going to the secretary for things instead of her, saying ""who is your boss? me or her?"". She was extremely hysteric and I'm very anxious so I started shaking in fear. She told me ""we will have a serious conversation next week"". But I don't want to have a conversation, I just wanna quit my job and never see her face again, but she asks like she doesn't have time to talk to me. I'm 100% sure that I want to quit but I'm also EXTREMELY anxious about the whole thing because she is very unpredictable. How should I quit? Should I be direct and leave? Or should I adress her bullying? Should I schedule a time next week to make sure I finally quit or surprise her?",13Dec2019,1
694,"Hi reddit, this is my first time posting here after being a lurker for some time but I feel like I could use this for once. 

Essentially, like many others, I applied to colleges this year and have heard back from my early-decision school, Cornell, and got a big old rejection. No differed or anything because they don't do that. I know this is super-cliché, but I just feel like before finding out about this, I felt really good, positive, motivated to do things, and just on top of the world mentally. I know my life will be relatively unaffected by this and things happen for a reason, but I can't shake off the feeling that I've failed early on at something I've had my sights on for a while. My father went to Cornell as well, and a big reason why I applied was because of the legacy status I had. He had told me and so did others that I had a good shot in, and so I was really neutral/slightly leaning that I'd get in (my interview also went well), but for some reason on the day of (yesterday) I just had a gut-feeling that I wouldn't get in and that turned out to be true. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not really looking for college advice, stats, tips etc for that, I'm honestly a bit over the entire thing.. I'll just take what I can get from now on. That said, college advice is welcome but I just want to be able to shake off this negative feeling of detachment I now have from the whole thing.

I get it, mom liked her, my ex wants to do the same job as her so mom got the attention, nice girl and smart too!

So i am in my senior year of high school. I recently transferred to a private school because i am severely depressed and was flunking my classes. At my new school, i meet this girl. She is beautiful. The things she says make me smile when i didnt even think that was possible anymore. She has my taste in music (Eerily similar) We want to go into the same career path. (She wants to be a homocide investigator, i want to be a forensic psychologist) Every time i see her I am happy. I love hearing her talk and seeing the way she interacts with the world. She has depression and all of the struggles that go with it, but she is strong, confident, and loves people, so its like you’d never know (which ies exactly what i was like at my old school) She even smokes weed as much as I do

We seem like the only two people at this school who dont have their shit together. But i was willing to turn my life around to help her do work and study, not because i expected anything in return, but because i care about her. This is the purest form of love i’ve felt in my life. I genuinely want her to succeed and be happy. 

This week, i learned she has a boyfriend

I have no clue what to do. She is a wonderful person, and everyone at the school likes her, but ever since i learned that, i cannot talk to her, and i have stopped going to class. The emotional strain is too much. I would never take someone like her away from another man. But I can’t stop thinking about her. This isnt a little boy crush.

1. The home is falling apart. I think it’s structurally sound, and the issues are mostly cosmetic, but it’s embarrassing and depressing. I do worry about mold in the walls because it holds so much moisture. I haven’t seen any, but sometimes our home smells musty. 
2. We owe more than 2x what the home is worth.  No exaggeration. We’re completely upside down. The “good news” is that this amount is approximately $60,000 due. So nothing like hundred of thousands, but still sucks. 
3. We’ve never been late on a payment and we make plenty of money to keep paying the mortgage. Furthermore, the line of work myself and my spouse are in, we can be penalized for foreclosure on record. It’s only in their name, not mine.

717,"I was raised by my grandma for the majority of my 20 year old life. 

My mom had a marriage with a man she felt she didn't love. Divorced him. And showed up to the custody battle drunk. Of course she lost the battle when I was 7. She had another child with another man when I was 8 and left later that same year. 

My dad remarried and never had another kid after me. But the woman he married already had 2 kids of her own. With out combined family and the fact that his wife refused to get a job, he was feeding a house of 6 on his own. 

So I had a very close relationship with my dads mom. She raised my brother and I into mature adults. She always took us in and gave us a place to sleep if we wished to stay or needed a bed. She gave us money to help us get food or pay bills and helped us growing into the adult world. She was the one who helped me set up a bank account. She took me to all my doctors appointment and coached me how to schedule my own. She taught me budgeting and we experimented new foods together. She would tell me all the places she'd tried when she was younger that no longer existed. All the while my mom was off with my 2 younger siblings with another man in another state.

I don't hate my mom. But i used to. My mom came back early my freshman year of high school and we had a really tough start trying to create a connection again. But I currently live with my mom and I can say I love her again. My mom stepped in where I had blanks. She taught me how to drive and helped me earn my GED. She took me in when I had an argument with my grandma and moved out. She knows how to handle me when I'm angry or frustrated, unlike my grandma. I can make inappropriate jokes with her where i couldn't with my grandma. I feel my mom has become my best friend. And she tries to create a Mother-Friend line that doesnt always work out. She wants to be my mom first and foremost.  But I have this friendly connection with her that I didn't have with my grandma.

There were times when I was younger that i would slip up and call my grandma ""mom"". Nothing was thought of it as everyone knew she filled that role for me. But now that my mom is back they seem to be jealous of each other.

They don't go at each others throats but they bad mouth each other behind their backs to me. My mom doesn't like hearing about how her ex mother in law took over her role for me. And my grandma isn't too happy to have the role taken away from her. Though to their faces they act friendly and like they love each other. They both know there's something more under their smiles. But they won't admit it outright. My mom will even tell me that she loves my grandma. But she doesn't act like it. 

It's calmed down a lot since it first started, maybe 2 years ago. But right now it feels like a stalemate. Like I'm in the middle of something rather tense. And something that won't be going away for a long time.  I usually tell them both not to talk about the other but it doesn't help. They forget about it and will bring the other person back up later. 

How should I deal with this awkward and tense situation between both of my ""moms""",13Dec2019,1

My school also doesn’t give me freedom to drop any lessons without permissions of my parents it is a bullshit. I talked with my parents and they made fun of me while talking Russian.

719,So I have really bad anxiety when it comes to my boyfriend. Like if he looks at someone for too long I get really anxious and my mind just jumps everywhere. He tells me that he’s looking at their clothes because he likes fashion and it’s true and stuff. I don’t confront him about it that much because I trust that he’s not doing anything wrong but at the same time I don’t know for a fact and it annoys me to the core. Like I trust him but random thoughts just creep up like a spider on a caught fly. I know he would never cheat but sometimes I think otherwise I try to battle those thoughts but sometimes they win. And sometimes I get to dismiss the thoughts after a while but it’s annoying to even have to go through the battle EVERYTIME he looks for too long or acts slightly different. And it makes me mad. It makes me wish to get better and I beat myself up over it. I don’t wanna feel like this and every time I do he gets upset because it’s annoying and I agree. I searched up countless ways not to get anxious but they don’t really help. Like at all. Please help me,13Dec2019,1
720,"I graduated college last may and have been working since as a software developer. I am completely independent of my parents, pay all my own Bill's have my own place ect. The problem? I simply don't have any friends. I was a ghost in high school and have not spoken to a single person from high school since the day I graduated 5 and 1/2 years ago. 

Even though I was more social in college I did not really form any lasting relationships and all my friends from college have for the most part moved on from me. I had a girlfriend in college who I was very close to but she broke my heart. These last few months I have been on a downward spiral of depression to where I am sad 24/7. I have been seeing a therapist for the past month but she has not helped much beyond having someone to complain about my life to. The only real advice she has given me is I should stop smoking marijuana. Right before she asks how I feel about taking antidepressants. Thanks.

What the fuck do I do? Where do I go? I am so lonely all of the time it is crushing my soul on a daily basis. I break down crying multiple times a week. When I try to make plans with people it seems they always fall through. 

A big part of me simply just wants to peace out and move somewhere completely different but I do not think that would solve my problem of having an extremely hard to connecting to people. It feels like I am destined to be lonely, I have been for 99% of my life already.

728," I (16)  like a girl (15)  that is from Iceland and I'm from Lithuania. We met during student exchange program last year and this week.
 We used to be a couple for 2 months after first time meeting her in Iceland, but then we broke up and never actually had talked IRL until this week. 
So this week we got to know each other more and I think she likes me again ( her friends say that she always talked about me, and if i talk with her friends she always asks what I was talking about)
We hung out a few times but it wasn't like a date cuz we always had other ppl from project around.
Her friends say she is very shy and I saw that she was even more shy when I was around, and was lot less talkative in English language when I was trying to talk to her. When someone asks her a question in her native language she answers normally, but when I ask her something in English she usually does a shy giggle and says something to her friend in Icelandic or thinks for a while, asks her friend to translate what she wants to say, basically doesn't react as usual.
While in school we once played some computer games ( those were 2ppl play on one pc) I think she like it, she invited me to do Tik Toks with her friends, so we did that and some other stuff.
So as a good bye I gifted her a teddy bear with a little box of chocolates and we hugged about 5 different times before she leaves. 
It was an amazing week and I would really like to see her again, but I don't know when would be the best time to do that, I know some ppl that I can stay at in Iceland so that isn't a problem.

Some guys I know who are friends with M have told me that not only is he obsessed with me but keeps asking about what classes I'm in and if they know about me.

He is also in my weight room class where he apparently stares at me the whole class.

This has been really freaking me out for the last week. I'm nervous just walking around the school and going to lunch because I'm worried he's going to come up to me and make a scene.

736,"Hi there,

My partner and I  (M29/F25) are renting a room to an acquaintance of ours (M28).  
His hygiene is terrible and he has no desire to change this, so my partner and I leave the common space for him to hangout in and we both hangout in our private room unless we are hanging out as room mates.

The main issue right now is that he has becoming very invasive in our social lives.  If I have a friend over that has brought over wine or dinner or anything to share, and we are hanging out in my room with the door closed, my room mate comes in and starts hanging out, standing awkwardly until my guest offers him some of whatever we are having.

When we have friends over in a less intimate setting, we will hangout in the common space so that he knows that we are open to hanging out, but he makes a lot of my friends uncomfortable and has a complete disregard for hygiene (smells, only wears underwear) which makes people even more unsettled.  I have addressed the hygiene issue several times and he does not seem to care, that is a totally different issue.

I do not want to hurt my room mates feelings, but I need to reset the boundary of there being instances where I have company and he is not necessarily invited to hangout and to ""mooch"" off of them.  He also never hangs out if there is nothing involved that he can take (alcohol, food, etc.). Some of my friends have addressed that they notice he only comes when they have something to offer and his reaction is quite aggressive towards them.

I have a hard time setting boundaries, and am cool with hanging out with my room mate in certain circumstances in the common space, but how do I communicate that there are times that I would like to quietly sit in my room and have private conversations with my guest without hurting his feelings?",13Dec2019,1

For context, if it helps: I’m a teenage girl (17), and some of my friends and me have most classes together at our HS.
When I was in middle school, I got bullied horribly: I won’t go into details, but it was like hell was on earth. 
To the point that I didn’t talk to anyone.
Then, I made some friends. Then, they were super mean to me, teasing me about my physical appearance, and so on, even they knew I had struggled with ED’s in the past. 
So, our friendship didn’t last long (like a year or so) we stopped talking. 
They became bullies, and befriended my other bullies.
Then I entered HS: luckily, there was only one ex-bully, but she didn’t have any classes with me.
Now, it’s our senior year and me and my ex-bully we’re taking almost all of the classes together: we don’t talk or anything, and I’m respectful to her, but she has tried to manipulate my grades (just once, but still).
Thankfully, now I have a good group of friends: however, one of my friends (17 M) is really good friends with her, and has some classes with her: he even insists that we should all hang out.
I’d told him about my past, and how she was a bully who abused me in so many ways.

750,"Me (21) and my fiance and our 1 year old son recently signed and got ourselves into a rent to own agreement with my Father and his girlfriend. 

We signed an agreement to rent to own as is and to pay $150 plus $500 in property rent until we've fully paid off what they wanted for it (which was 15k even). 

Sure, that's an awesome price in my area for a 3 bedroom, 2 full bath double wide trailer, but there's a hitch. Almost all the flooring was torn out, walls busted open, water damaged studs and drywall in the master under the window, and just needed a good fixing up and cleaning. 

Me and fiance out of our own pocket, hired an independent contractor friend of ours and bought all the materials and went to town fixing it up, and did a kickass job in the process. Theres now only two rooms without flooring, but every hole in every wall is fixed. 

Now, the complicated part: the day we signed the agreement, we were told ant COULD be a problem in the area, and that mice and rats could also be a POTENTIAL issue. What we were failed to be told was that it was actually an ongoing issue and we're thrown into this situation. 

How we found out about the ants: As we were replacing the rotting flooring the master, we realized theres a few ants. Upon further investigation we saw hundreds and hundreds of ants inside the insulation as well. I sprayed it down with poison, left a few ant traps, and left it for a few days. Came back, saw nothing. Good stuff. I started cleaning while our friend was finishing up, and on the window in the bathroom down the hall, had 100s of dead ants in it. I cleaned it all of, and put it back up. Problem solved, huh? Wrong. I still keep finding an ant here or there every single time I walk in a room. Disgusting to me, but manageable. 

How we found out about the mice: The day before we moved in, we finished up the flooring in the morning and were about to leave to go start bringing stuff over from our rental unit, and me and my fiance noticed a hockey puck sized hole underneath the sink where it meets the floor, uh oh.

It looks to be the size of a rat, as I've seen online mouse holes are usually smaller, but who knows. Me and my fiance clean up where it chewed, stuck a few traps behind it, and drilled a piece of plywood over it so we could easily get in and out of it for now to replace dead mice as needed. 

It's been 3 days since our move in now, and I keep finding mouse droppings in different places, including next to our sink, and inside our pantry. The inside of our pantry is absolutely littered with mouse shit at the bottom, to the point it looks like theres an infestation in this house. 

*The issue is, I have seen a single mouse since being here *. Not one peep, not one piece of food broken into or eaten, not one trap set off. I feel like I'm going nuts, but I know damn well theres gotta be something here, so today I set out a 24/7 camera to catch the bastard(s). 

Now, for the needed real estate advice: I no longer want to be here because of this. Sure, I see online people saying it's not a dealbreaker, but when it comes to my son, it surely is. I feel lied to and snuck by my dad, who pretty much left this problem onto me and moved into some nice $300k house with his girlfriend, who's a complete slob, so no surprise theres mice. 

I'm thinking about talking to him about selling it as is in the market, and splitting the balance evenly, as I've wasted so much time and money trying to fix this place up. 

I'm sure I've increased the total value of the house by at least $5k. Am I entitled to any of the money if I walk away and he decides to sell it himself, regardless if I increased the equity? FYI, I also paid a down payment of $2k as well.

I can't keep living in paranoia and fear of a large infestation when I not only have my one year old son to take care of, but my Jack Russel-Chi as well. My fiance isnt too open to the idea as we finally moved out of her family's house, but this isnt what feels like home to me and I'll be damned if I be uncomfortable in my living situation.

755,"Hi folks, so I've got a bit of a problem: my cousin and I are both legal adults (18+) living in the same house (that belongs to my biological parents). Except, she smokes a lot inside the house (weed, cigarettes). I've told her to go outside when she needs to smoke, my parents have told her not to smoke inside the house, both of us multiple times, but she continues to smoke inside with impunity. I've delivered my ""final verbal warning"", but I don't have much confidence it will actually change anything. Yes, this /does/ feel like a behavioral issue that should have been ironed out when she was a teen in highschool, but here we are. Unfortunately, due to my living circumstances I will not be able to move out of my parents house for at least a year. Disciplinarians of Reddit, how do I handle this? I, like my parents, am non-confrontational by nature, but this bullshit needs to stop. A house without enforceable rules is a joke. My parents do not have the stomach necessary for harsh discipline -- I doubt they would kick her out of the house -- so any further discipline largely falls on my shoulders to enforce. What would you do if you were in my situation? I am up for absolutely anything, as long as it is not illegal.",13Dec2019,1

757,"I have been working under my boss for a year at a large company. My boss is the most chill guy I’ve ever met, fun to be around, drinks with us often.

There’s a girl we work with. She has slept with a couple coworkers and a family members of coworkers. She isn’t interested in having a relationship and does enjoy hooking up as that’s what she finds more fun for her needs.

Our boss and his wife had a baby 2 months ago. Since the baby was born he’s at our coworkers desk for nearly half the day every single day.

Long story short, there are several signs they’re hooking up. He refuses to reprimand her when her work quality is clearly lacking, he calls her into meetings 1-on-1 just to chat for an hour and not work (he admitted to this), and they go out to lunch together alone.

Our other coworkers all speculate that something is going on between him and our other coworker. He just had a baby, he and his wife seem happily married, and rumors start like wildfire in our office.

I want to give him a heads up on what people are saying about them, but am afraid if there being consequences. However, their inappropriate behavior does make it feel like a toxic work environment, where I bust it to get everything done on time and she does nothing the whole day and is enabled to do so. What should I do?",13Dec2019,1
758,"I was telling my bf about a lunch that I had with my two bosses and another employee. I then told him about a very uncomfortable comment that was said at the table by one of my bosses. 

I had just attended the Wendy Williams show and so a conversation got started between my co workers about Wendy’s hair. Not sure if it matters but out of all four of us women there was a white, Spanish, Asian and black person. My Asian boss then proceeded to say “ Wendy Williams wears wigs because she has an Afro and nappy hair”. Now I don’t personally think my boss is racist or even meant it in a derogatory way but I felt like damn she should not have said that especially because my black co worker turned and gave me a look. Cringe!

So now my issue here is with my bf. He says:

“Your boss is in a country where nappy is okay”

“Yes its fine. People wear wigs because they want to change their hair. Just like people wear corsets, dye their hair, change their boob size, etc. Are you saying we can't talk about that? “

“nappy isn't a bad/negative word so no I don't think what she said was bad”

“Non American Chinese for the most part. There's a few things other asians and other cultures don't see as ""bad"" that Americans do and vice versa”

“Lacking social skills doesn't mean not having a filter”

“Black people want to be sensitive about their low self esteem thats not my problem. “

“The black “co-worker”of yours should have taken in the context and adjusted for cultural difference”

So I basically told him if the word “nappy” has no negative connotation and it’s okay to use then go tell that to a black person. My whole thing here is the focus he has so much on that word, when I’m focusing on the statement as a whole itself. Really want to hear from the people what they deem as offensive and what they don’t from this “statement”. Thanks!",13Dec2019,1
759,"I've been friends with dude for over 10 years just fyi.  So back in july my best friend decided to move out of state. He comes back in august after getting a house so he can finish the move.  We end up hanging out and drinking. At first it was at a public water park (so his kids could play) and then we decided to take the party to his brothers house that lived near by. I had to run a errand so he got there first.  When I arrived he told me where to meet him.  I followed him back to his bros place and we started bbqn! Maybe a half hour later someone tells me that they saw a boot on my car.  I go to check it out and sure enough there's a boot.  Come to find out without a parking permit I couldn't park where I was.  There were no signs so I had no clue. So the notice said it would take 100.00 to remove it, 700 if I tried removing it myself. Needless to say I was upset.  Come to find out that my bestfriend knew about it because he parked in the right spot and made sure others did the same except for me so I confronted him about it. He's drunk so his actions did not show  empthay and he left me outside to figure things out. Not to mention when I told him he should help me out with paying it and he looked at me like I was crazy. So his wife took me to get money out of a atm and he pissed me off so bad that i confided to her that he admitted to cheating on her while he was out of state looking for their house. So i end up getting the boot off and he got a ear full from his wife.  Well that was how we spent his last day in his home town.  So here's the thing.  We didn't speak for the next month, and then I decided that 10 years plus isc worth saving so I reached out and apologized for my actions (exposing his adultery actions). He said its cool but that's it. No apology from him. Its been 3 months and we haven't spoke, and I heard he came to visit family for Halloween and he didn't hit me up.  So basically from his actions he doesn't feel what he did was wrong and obviously he's upset about me telling his wife.  Here's the thing I told him years ago that if he ever cheated on his wife to NOT tell me because I've known her as long as I've known him so she is a good friend to me so I couldn't promise she wouldn't find out.  Im to the point that I should just cut him off and move on.  Shit even his wife doesn't talk to me like she used to, talk about a double diss.        What would yall do?",13Dec2019,1
760," I'm taking a college class, and my Professor uses a test bank for all her exams (i.e. the textbook publisher writes a list of multiple choice questions, and my professor just uses those on her tests instead of making up her own questions). So, multiple people in my class bought the test bank, and sent it out to people via group-chats and what not. I didn't ask for it, but someone sent me the test bank. I didn't reply to them, I just straight up deleted it, so the only evidence out there is the message that someone sent it to me (because I never asked for it, and I never even acknowledged that I received it). And this is a class of probably 70 people and at least 20 people have the exam bank. Also, I wrote on my exam and legit solved each problem so you can't even say I didn't know what I was doing, because I DID every problem on the test!

761,"**Note: I know this is long, and maybe a little messy. I'm not gonna put a TLDR since I think not having 100% of the information there could cause misunderstandings. If anyone reads all this and responds, I will be forever thankful. You have patience of steel.** 

I know that this isn't a place to get a diagnosis or so, I'm aware. I just want your opinions and thoughts. It could either be from a professional or someone who has experienced something similar in themselves, a friend or a partner.

I've been with my girlfriend for about 1,5 years now in a long distance relationship. I'm 20 and she's 23. She has been diagnosed with an eating disorder that has been getting a lot worse the past 2 months or so. It has gotten to the point where she says she doesn't feel like herself and her ED has ""taken her over"". She said she wanted to talk less than usual for a few weeks until she had sorted herself out a little. She has also been diagnosed with depression, has kinda abusive parents and hates herself more or less. 

Now to my concerns. Her mental health problems that can sometimes be tough on me too and put a strain on the relationship, but overall she's a good person. Most of the time she's ""normal"" and very caring. But every now and then she becomes weird. It started happening about 6 months into the relationship and usually happens very rarely (usually just once a month or so, but sometimes a few times every month). When this happens, she actually becomes rudy. I hate that version of her, to be honest.Today it happened again. I'll rewrite the whole text conversation to avoid mistakes. I'll call her Lea. It will be translated from Spanish so it might be a little off in english. 

Her (out of nowhere, or an answer to ""Lea?"" that I wrote hours ago): Lea isn't here anymore, say hello to Ana (anorexia). 

Me: What?

Her: It was a joke.

Me: Are you sure?

Her: Shut up. When I lose weight and you'll see me with nice clothes you'll be thankful. No one wants a fat girlfriend, not you either.

Me: What are you saying? Why are you talking like this to me?

Her: Why I'm talking like this?

Me: Yeah. You tell me to shut up with no reason. I don't understand why this happens. Once minute you're in one way and the next minute you're acting strange and cold. 

Her: Oh god...

Me: What? 

Her: Nothing. 

Me: Do you love me? (I realize this might have been a weird thing of me to say)

Her: You're an idiot. 

Me (getting mad, kinda losing it): Me? Idiot? Is there anything else you want to say about me? 

Her: You fuck me just because you don't think anyone else would wanna fuck you. 

Me: Something else? 

Her: You're rude sometimes. Insecure. Play the victim. Great, now you're not gonna talk to me for a while. Next year maybe, unless you block me. The people don't get that I want to be alone. I've made a lot of people angry.

Me: Wow, I wonder who's the rude one... I don't get it. Why are you basically begging me to stay away from you? 

Her: I'm a monster, and you don't realize that. 

Me: What? Have you been lying to me about everything? Is all this what you really think of me? That I'm a rude idiot who just fucks you because I believe no one else would do it?

Her: No. The pro-ED blog. I'm sorry. 

Me: What? What do those blogs have to do with this?

Her: When are you gonna break up with me?

Me: Do you want me to leave you? It seems like that. It seems like you've chosen some blog over me, you're letting it decide what you're gonna think about me. I just don't get it. You're in control over what you say, not the blog. You're an adult. You can't let a blog control you like that. 

Her: Leave me, and maybe you'll never suffer again. I ruined your dinner, your birthday... 

Me: Do you want me to leave you?

Her: No.

Me: Then please explain why you're acting like this. One second you're so lovely, talking about how you want to marry me someday, and the next second you're saying I'm an idiot who fucks you because I believe no one else would do it? You're also letting some blogs control your relationships. You say you love me and all that, but sometimes your actions say otherwise. Please, give me an explanation. Is there something I should know about you?

Her: If I did something bad to myself tonight you wouldn't care, cause you're hurt. But I'm not gonna do anything.

Me: Just stop it! You know I love you, you know I care. I'm trying to talk to you, why are you changing the subject? Lea... 

Her: Lea isn't here. 

Me: I'm really worried about you. Maybe I should travel to your city and come with you to the hospital.

Her: Dream on. I need to be alone.

Me: And that's why you're seeing your friends tonight? 

Her: I ruin everything. I'm gonna lose my friends. My parents said they're tired of me. I'm mean, a monster. 

Me: Why are you acting like that then?

Her: Because I want everyone to hate me. 

Me: What?

Her: Because then they won't care if I'm feeling unwell. 

Me: You don't want to be loved? You've cried so much over people who left you, but now you WANT to be left by people? Including me apparently. You're basically looking forward to me leaving you. 

Her: Are you gonna leave me? 

Me: You want me to hate you, that's what you say. I've really been trying so hard to show you all the time that I love you. But you don't even want that?? 

Her: \*sends pic of skinny woman\* This is what I want my stomach to look like. No, I don't want you to leave me. I want to be with you. But I ruin everything, I hurt you. 

Me: You hurt me when you hurt me on purpose. Because you want me to hate you. You're not even mean for real. I don't get why you're being mean on purpose??? If you wanna be with me you need to stop doing that. You need to accept that I love you and stop trying to change it. Don't you get that. You need to decide if you want me to love you or hate you.

Her: Could you really hate me?

Me: Probably not. Only if you did something terrible. But you want me to hate you, that's the problem. How am I supposed to be with someone who is actively trying to get me to hate them? Also, can you please stop reading that god damn blog? It's ruining you. 

Her (sometime later): Sorry... I had an anxiety attack. 

Me: What happened? Are you feeling better now? 

Her: Sorry. I'm so sorry.

Me (some time later): We need to talk. For real.

Her: Why?

Me: What do you think? Have you read our conversation the past hour? You said you want everyone to hate you, you called me an idiot etc. 

That was pretty long, it's usually not that bad even. So what happens every time is basically that she starts saying these kind of things, then we argue about it for a while and she ends up apologizing and saying what a terrible person she is. 

I hate when this happens. If it was a one time thing then fine, let's forget it, but I can't ignore it since it happened more than once. What hurts the most is when she says things like ""you fucked me just because you thought no one else would do it"" or ""you don't love me"". Most of the time she says that she knows I love her a lot. But sometimes she says these kind of things, and it hurts. Because I've sacrificed so much for her, and I prove over and over again how I love her. It hurts that she accuses me of not loving her. Another thing that caused me to react was that she actually said she WANTS people to hate her. That's messed up, and I don't know what to do with this information. 

It's been about 2 hours since this convo. Now she's trying to act like she normally does. First she started talking about how she just got my christmas gift in her mail. Now she's sending me ""I love you"" and ""please don't leave me"" drawings, and saying that she has looked into different kinds of therapy. 

I actually don't want to leave her. Because when this doesn't happen, she's the best. I've never loved anyone like I love her and I have some of my best memories with her. But lately (the past 3 months or so) her mental health has been declining a lot, and her acting weird has become more common. I don't know how I should handle it. What could cause her to act like this? Her eating disorder? Does she feel guilty about other people feeling bad for her, and therefore wanting them to hate her instead? Could she have some other diagnosis?  How should I proceed from here?  Please help.",13Dec2019,1

Unfortunately their training consisted of them reading a short wiki page over a client, a short quiz and then you take calls for that client. I was thrown to the wolves and constantly yelled at when I made simple mistakes. 

One manager in particular blows up at me for making the smallest of mistakes. I’m already having a hard time adapting, and then I get yelled at. One incident that I didn’t think was a big deal, but after my brothers HR at his job reached out to me, I now see that it wasn’t okay. That same manager was trying to show me how to do something on the computer, when I wasn’t going fast enough she smacked my hand to move it off of the mouse so she could do it. 

A co-worker told HR but they only had a “talk” with her and nothing happened. My brother told his HR and they said “you don’t make contact with passive aggressive force, that’s instant termination”.

So story: I've had a multiple of eating disorders for 10+ years and over the past year have been working really hard to overcome them. I however wasn't underweight at all during this past year but was at my previous weight of 165 lbs when I got with my boyfriend about 2 years ago through starving myself. I have recently moved to South Korea for university and before doing so was in treatment for my eating disorder. Coming to Korea I really did jump head first into my recovery because I wanted to fully enjoy the year I have here, and due to my current living situation have no kitchen, forcing me to eat out every day or if I am really busy survive from food from convenience stores. Maybe I was too into it because after just 4 months I'm now 196lbs, the weight I was before starving myself. I've since been going to the gym 4 times a week to try and combat the gaining but so far after 3 weeks my weight is the same. Although my boyfriend had always said he found me attractive, lately he has been saying I've gained too much weight, I'm too fat and he no longer finds me attractive. He seems to think I'm not trying hard enough and hates how I look now. I just don't know what else to do to change this, I've been eating less and exercising more because I also don't like being this weight but I'm trying really hard not to fall back into ed behaviour..

781,"I feel so lost. I had every intention on going straight to law school this summer, but virtually all my friends were doing a gap year; so I figured I should too. I was a really good student, graduated top of my class and I used to tutor and in general help out my friends at school and they’d always tell me how bad they felt about being at school, the toll it was taking on them mentally and in general how they felt like they were massive failures and felt like they couldn’t keep up academically. This is how I’m currently feeling, just in regards to working. 
The whole idea of doing a gap year is to work and save money in order to move out, but I’m having the hardest time. So far I’ve worked three different jobs, one at a burger joint I immediately quit after just three shifts because I absolutely hated it, another one working at a clothing store that I quit today. I’ve been working there two months and I cry every morning before going to work, because I just feel miserable. It’s this feeling of “What am I doing here, I don’t belong here”. The coworkers are nice and the job itself isn’t that bad, it just makes me depressed. I can’t even put into words how I feel, because I don’t even fully know why I cry every morning. It just isn’t for me. 

Today was just all too much and I just couldn’t handle it. So I had to quit, and I don’t really regret quitting the job per say. I just feel ashamed, disappointed with myself, lost (it’s not like it’s going to be a blast just being at home all day). I’m just sad. I have at least 9 months until I actually go to law school and what now? I feel so lost and I feel like such a failure. I’m embarrassed that I cannot keep a job.

I guess the relief I thought I’d feel (which I do feel) is just being filled with self-loathing at this point. 

Money isn’t really an issue as I’m living with my parents and I do have enough to move out etc. This is more of an inner existential crisis.

789,"A bit of context, I [13F] live in a dorm and I'm in ballet school alongside the worst roommate ever, let's call her [13] Claudia . I'm new, but she isn't, she just also moved in the dorm this year, but for me everythings new.

We had this friend, Anastasia, trash talking everyone, smoking, drinking, and she's only 15. We befriended her and we hung out in the dorm, she offered me and Claudia a smoke, I refused but Claudia accepted and she took a hit off a regular cigarette.

I, and this is where I fucked up, went at one point to Anastasia and complained about Claudia and told her how she trash talked her (I'm stupid, I know, I should've kept it for myself, but it was an impulsive decision that I learned from) . Anastasia went crazy and told me how she is gonna start a fight with Claudia and I told her not to, but she didn't listen.

About 20 minutes later, Anastasia was screaming so loudly at Claudia that the whole hallway came out to see what was going on, I was feeling SO shitty, it felt like a thousand boulders were on top of me, which I'm also feeling now.

Claudia came back in my room and she was crying and shaking and probably having a panic attack, she went to the bathroom and she was hyperventilating and I was really scared, another girl came in the bathroom and asked what was going on and took Claudia to her room, I was speechless (let's call her Sarah). Anastasia came into Sarah's room and began screaming ,again, and Sarah defended Claudia, fighting with Anastasia. At that point, I fucking froze, i was in the other room and heard everything.

Then, Sarah, Anastasia, Claudia and Anastasia's roomate busted into the room. Anastasia jumped at me and asked me if I said this, or that, and she was lying through her teeth about what I told her. I told her that she exagerated immensely when she was screaming at a child and she told me I have no right to say that.

I'm pretty introverted and I was really taken aback by everything, they kept arguing between each other and I stared at a corner wall for about 5 minutes, that's what I do when I'm in highly stressful situations, I was ready to have a panic attack since the realisation that all of this happened because of me. Im currently crying typing this. 

Anyway, I apologised to everyone and made clear that I take responsability and I apologised to Claudia personally and I really began crying while talking to her because I felt that awful, I still do, I thoroughly explained how she didn't deserve any of this and that what I did,but now Anastasia is mad at ME, apparently, and at Claudia ofc, Sarah is nice, she yelled at me too for a bit, but when Anastasia left at one point she came back to check on us and gave us a hug and told us we should be supportive of each other and figure our problems and then she told us ""love you, be careful!"" And good night. 

Claudia forgave me, we became actually a little closer after this, but I personally do not feel that closeness, she told me that she sees it in my eyes that i'm regretfull and what's important is to never  do it again.

 We had a lengthy discussion, and at the end the antagonizer was Anastasia, but even though, besides Anastasia, everyone's good with me, I feel so incredibly distraught and horrible, I feel so damn guilty, I feel like I killed someone. I couldn't even go to a few ballet classes because I was so mentally unable. 

Just to say, Claudia has also been to Anastasia's room and complained about me on different ocassions.

I don't know what to do, In bad situations like these I only think this ""Will this affect me in x time?"" And in this case, every answer is yes, I feel like I can't even breath anymore.",13Dec2019,1

Not like the ""this sucks but at least I get paid in the end"" but the ""I would rather kill myself and everyone I know before going back to any of them for another week"". I'm not very money motivated since there's usually nothing I actively care about buying. 

The only thing I care about in my life is accomplishing my dream. I'm an illustrator/writer and want to combine those interests one day into making a comic book. There's just a few things that have been getting in my way. First off is the fact that I have quite a few mental problems that make drawing pretty damn hard, I don't like talking about them because they very often sound like me making excuses, but I suppose I don't care anymore, they are ADD and Aphantasia, the later of which being the biggest offender. The second issue being that I only started drawing last year and am no where near good enough to draw something coherent or professional looking.

All in all I feel pressure not only from my family, but also society to go out and get a career and make money now or never. I feel like there's a million different things happening at once that are pulling me in 20 different directions and that each passing day is wasted some way or another.

795,"Hello. I'm so sorry if this post will be all over the place but I do not know where to turn.

I'm 22F and I have PTSD and I've been diagnosed with Borderline personality disorder when I was 18. I was a horrible person for a long time but I found myself a therapist at 18 and she was with me til age of 19. 

We spoke about a lot about my anger and resentment and how I immediately react by trying to hurt people that hurt me. I learned some coping methods and I stopped manipulating/hurting people. 

I still had urges but now I just wanted to get better. I still do. My therapist went back to Canada and my doctor referred me to a new psychiatrist because my old one was a children's psych.

The new psych was in a government funded place because I recieve free healthcare due to severe physical disability and chronic pain. 

But it wasn't just one psych. We got a different one each year. I was referred to DBT therapy. 

I have been waiting for 4 years now. Recently I started having strong suicidal urges. Self hatred because of being manipulative in the past and naive, I started thinking maybe I was better off dead. 

I went to the hospital with my boyfriend. They saw me, said that they'd refer me to a program and sent me back home. That was a year ago and I haven't heard back from them. The suicidal feelings just grew and I started feeling empty. I started feeling like I just didn't care anymore. 

I did not want to tell my boyfriend how bad stuff got because he has his own problems. 

So to my biggest current issue: my current psychiatrist.

I told him twice that I had strong suicidal urges and that i need therapy or a meds change. 

""I won't change your meds because Prozac is the only medication that doesn't interact with the Warfarin that I can give you. As for the therapy, you have not attempted suicide since you were 16, correct?""

""Yes"" 

""Well you're not a priority. Also depression usually stops by the age of 25"" 

And nobody believed me he said that, they thought I misunderstood. Brought mom in with me. He told her the exact same thing. My mom suffers from severe depression. 

""Your mother is a special case, we don't have many people over 25 who have depression"".

I told him I didn't want to live til the new year. To please help me. I'll literally go to any program. Anything. 

He just said I was too smart to kill myself. My mom wants to report him to the clinic but I just don't know. 

This is the only free clinic here and I'm not in a financial position to go to a private person.

I don't want to worry my close ones. I just don't know what to do anymore.",13Dec2019,1

I can't risk another B in the next semester so I need to drop this class to a normal English class. My school however has made this new policy that says AP students are not allowed to drop their classes in the next semester which is complete BS. Because 1) they didn't tell anyone they were going to do this and 2) The school goes by semesters and should let you change in the new semester. Another thing to note is that AP is not required for graduation.

So, last year in March one of my best friends got so mad at me that he cut me off. We used to be best friends and always hung out together. We also have many similar interests and mutual friends. He is a paranoid person because many people have betrayed him over the years. He cut me off because someone told him that I was talking shit about him and he thought he couldn't trust me. (I never did it) However, he didn't believe that I didn't do it. Several months after, I tried to convince him to stop hating me and he said that we would never be close friends like that again. That really hurt me and I got mad and said some things that I regret. This made him hate me even more. Several more months after that he chilled out a little bit but it was really awkward, something it never used to be. So I tried to talk to him again but said something stupid and hurtful again accidentally (I'm not good at talking to people like that). And now whenever he goes somewhere with my friends I can not go because of how much he hates me. I really miss my friend and want him to stop hating me so much that I would do anything. I really love and miss him still.

801,"I was telling my bf about a lunch that I had with my two bosses and another employee in NYC. I then told him about a very uncomfortable comment that was said at the table by one of my bosses. 

I had just attended the Wendy Williams show and so a conversation got started between my co workers about Wendy’s hair. Not sure if it matters but out of all four of us women there was a white, Spanish, Asian and black person. My Asian boss then proceeded to say “ Wendy Williams wears wigs because she has an Afro and nappy hair”. Now I don’t personally think my boss is racist or even meant it in a derogatory way but I felt like damn she should not have said that especially because my black co worker turned and gave me a look. Cringe!

So now my issue here is with my bf. He says:

“Your boss is in a country where nappy is okay”

“Yes its fine. People wear wigs because they want to change their hair. Just like people wear corsets, dye their hair, change their boob size, etc. Are you saying we can't talk about that? “

“nappy isn't a bad/negative word so no I don't think what she said was bad”

“Non American Chinese for the most part. There's a few things other asians and other cultures don't see as ""bad"" that Americans do and vice versa”

“Lacking social skills doesn't mean not having a filter”

“Black people want to be sensitive about their low self esteem thats not my problem. “

“The black “co-worker”of yours should have taken in the context and adjusted for cultural difference”

So I basically told him if the word “nappy” has no negative connotation and it’s okay to use then go tell that to a black person. My whole thing here is the focus he has so much on that word, when I’m focusing on the statement as a whole itself. Really want to hear from the people what they deem as offensive and what they don’t from this “statement”. Thanks!",13Dec2019,1

804,"I met this beautiful girl, let’s say her name is Laura, at college. I met her friends who seemed nice.  Her friend I met, let’s call her Jessica. So Jessica would be sweet and tell me things like if I like Laura, tell her and how Laura seems nice but she doesn’t know her well. I’m like maybe I will tell Laura how I feel.  Perhaps she had another friend named Sara who sits next to her in class. We are all friends in this class. When I walk by Laura, Laura and Sara would them laugh at me. I would turn around and look at them like they’re crazy and they laugh some more. 

Laura would stare at me so much that my friend Jenna would ask me why does Laura stare at me so much. Laura would shout my name after class. One time Jenna and I hugged and she massaged my shoulder, Laura looked uncomfortable. When I left, Laura came up to Jenna and asked if we were dating. 

Fast Forward, Laura had told me on and off she had feelings for me. She pushed me away and even got more aggressive when her student visa expired after she graduated. Sometimes I get private calls one in a while. 

Laura’s friend Jessica and I are friends on Snapchat, and Jessica would watch every Snapchat story I post for 7 months. When Lauren and I spoke that I am seeing someone, Jessica disappear from my Snapchat 3 days later which was July 2019. 

Recently, Laura and I had a fight. On Facebook I’ve seen an odd girl who added me who went to the same high school, liked the same tv show and also went to our college. Never met her but I accepted her friends request and her friend then added me too. Then I saw another friends request from someone who worked at a T-Mobile and she worked there too. I’m guessing perhaps that’s a coincidence. 

Jackpot: so I met her friend Justine who I happen to meet before Laura in college. When I asked Justine if she knew Laura she said no. Laura’s ex told me how Justine and Laura are good friends and that’s how he met Laura, which is through Justine. Why is Justine lying? Justine did like me, however.

812,"I wanna keep this short, but the title says it. Best friends for ten years (we’re 20). Been through everything with each other, parents divorcing, moving to a new city, her mother’s suicide, and much much more. We are extremely close and tell each other absolutely everything. We go on ‘dates’, just out for meals or movies, shopping etc. We always say we love each other and are jokingly flirty time to time. 

She is also absolutely gorgeous, to like a pretty insane level. Professors have raised her grade, made comments to her in classes of 100, she’s always creeped on at workplaces and such. So yeah, she’s extremely beautiful, which does not help. 

90% of the time I’m fine and am totally platonic with her, and think of her as nothing more than my best friend. But sometimes she’ll post a beautiful picture, or we’ll hang out for an entire day and you can tell neither of us really want to leave cause it’s a lot of fun. I’m also very close with her family, including her late mother as aforementioned, and her current family too. They say they love me and my family towards her likewise. 

There’s a bit of an issue in that she used to date one of my best friends (well the three of us were) and they are still talking after a while of not speaking. She tells me that she still has feelings for him too. He lives halfway across the country and is in the military. She and I currently live 2 hours apart, but only since the last couple months. I too am joining the military soon, but will likely be posted in the same city based on the job I am training for. 

I have struggled with this on and off over the years. I have never insinuated that I have feelings for her or made any type of move on her. I don’t think I can say anything about it to her, because I can’t even bear to think about not having her in my life. I think it would be really bad for both of us. I really wish I didn’t have these feelings because I love her so much as my friend. But sometimes I can’t get over myself- she’s extremely smart, funny, very caring and nice, always looks to help out anyone, would do anything for people, and is one of the strongest people I know. I know she relies on me for a lot of things in a similar way. But I don’t think she has feelings for me in the same regard, so if I said something it could ruin our friendship. Especially with almost every guy she knows begs at her feet to be with her. I feel like she would lose her one normal guy friend that wasn’t obsessed with her, which would really bum her out.

 I have been friends with this girl since 2016, we have had our ons and offs with each other but things always seemed to go relatively well. I considered her a good friend because she was the only one that acknowledged me on school, and I came from an abusive envoirenment in the other school, so it was refreshing to see someone actually make an effort and talk to me. But things now are pretty shitty with her, since she knows a lot of details about me, such as how I used to bully people, how I had sent nudes to people, my crush on this guy, and how I had lied on the abuse my aunt had inflicted on me. Keep in mind that I didn't tell her any of this except for the first thing, she knows the other 3 things because she had snooped through my phone and found out about it by some conversations I have had with closer friends of mine. So, what did she do to make me so scared of her? You might ask. Last week she texted my friends and told every single one of my friends and people I casually talk to every day, all of this and how I had lied this whole time on everything, how I was such a sl**, a bully and yadda yadda yadda. It didn't end there, she managed to speak to my IRL friends as well, and told them about it. The thing is, that all of the ""proof"" she had was actually convincing, because it was a distorted truth that had happened. She had edited proof and lied convincingly about every single thing. She even told all of this to one of my closet friends that's also a guy I'm madly in love with all of this, and he almost cut me out of his life, but I spoke to him about it and he has apologized for not believing me and believing her first, but my other friends, only 3 out of 10 believed what I said to them, and they refuse to speak to me. When I asked her why she had done all of this whilst I was bailing my eyes out, she just told me ""Because I wanna protect you, they aren't good for you."" Uhhh, what? You can't decide who I am friends with, it's none of your business. I hate her and I just don't know what she will do next, that's why I am scared.

 My [29f] best friend [29f] of 15 years, we'll call her Ana, stole my drivers license in October of 2018. I was completely unaware of this until mid May of this year when I received a little card from the Courts saying my court date had been changed to the next month. I immediately freaked out because I have had ZERO run in with the law for the past 7 years. I looked up my name on the court website and low and behold, I have 2 tickets issued under my info.
I click the description and it said it was a traffic violations. I don't drive due to an illness that severely affects my vision so there is absolutely no way i can have a traffic ticket.
I look further into the ticket and I immediately recognize the 'offending vehicle'. Its Ana's...
But the issue date on the tickets was from April. I had seen Ana multiple times each week, every week since April and she never mentioned it.
I call her and ask her about it and she immediately admits to getting pulled over, panicking and giving the officer me info.

  Side note: Ana is (supposedly) illegal. She had been here on a school Visa from the age of 1 ½, then got married underage, her Visa expired at 18 and she never renewed it. No government ID at all. So this is why she was panicking. She also has two young children and was pregnant with another at the time.
   
  I asked her why on Earth she wouldn't have just told me and she said she ""forgot"" but she had around $250 for for the tickets. They were over $1400. I asked if she had used my DL and she promised on everything that she did not. So I decided that I needed time to process what was going on and hung up.

I called my parents (who are retired law enforcement) and they advised me as how to clear my name.
I cleared my name without incriminating anyone (I'm no snitch) and was informed that my DL was in fact presented to officers.
I text Ana and ask her, once again, if she used my DL and she swears she didn't.
I was so hurt by her actions at this point that I just completely blocked her on everything. Haven't talked to her since. 

But I do miss her. And I miss her kids even more. I'm sad that I missed the birth of my her youngest.

I want to talk to her but I also think that if I do she'll continue doing things like this. Let's just say this isn't the first time she's taken advantage of me.

823,"Last night when dropping my friend off at his house, my truck fishtailed when I was trying to leave his driveway. (it was very icy and a slight upward slope, with a blind spot. So you have to stop to check for oncoming traffic, but the slope with hope icy it was made it very difficult to gain traction.) The side of my truck whacked the mailbox right off of its post! I immediately told my friend what had happened and how sorry I was. He told me it was no big deal that the mailbox gets knocked over all the time, but that his dad had just reinforced it. I told him to please tell his father how sorry I was and that I would pay for any damages and his time in having to fix it. This morning he tells me his dad will take care of it and to send him a photo of my car. I texted his dad a picture of my truck (i have a pretty bad gouge and scrape on the side.) His dad says ""ouch that's deep! Make sure you park so no one can see it LOL you owe me beer and grab at Leos :-*"".  I went to Target and got a candle for his wife, a tin of cookies, an apology card, an 18 pack of his favorite beer, and a $100 gift card. Later his dad sent me a photo of the mailbox all fixed up and said ""all good honey"" with a winky face. It seems as though I feel very bad about the situation and his father is so kind and not giving me a hard time about it and it seems as though it was an easy fix for him. Is my way of apology acceptable? Do you think that the $100 Visa gift card is tacky? Is it going overboard in an apology? I have plenty of money because I'm blessed to have an excellent job, so it's not about not wanting to give the money, but more that I'm worried that it would be interpreted as though I felt as if he didn't have the money to fix it. I do not want to offend him I simply want to express how sorry I am for the accident and that he had to fix the mailbox in the snow after a long day at work. What do you think I should do? Give the $100 gift card with the other stuff or not?

826,"Hi R/advice, long time lurker here... I'm a bit in a pickle with how to handle the current situation I'm in, and would love some advice to help calm the voices in my head. 

For some background, I'm in my mid-20's and am a young professional at a large international company where I make pretty decent money. I'm multiple years into recovery from drugs and alcohol and I owe where I am to the recovery program I'm in. When I first got sober, I was homeless and jobless.

Currently, I've been dating a girl for about 9 months who seemed to be on the right track to the top (Job, great grades in school, roof over her head), but recently she's started making horrible decisions that have completely derailed her life to the point where she does not have a job and has &lt;$500 in the bank and will be evicted. She has two pets and her parents have given up on her because they paid her last month's rent and her friend paid her previous month's rent.

I hear two voices in my head and that's to either help her with this month's rent and let her crash at my place until she gets back on her feet or cut my losses and run and leave her. I've warned her for months now on how her decisions that were influenced by some of her more toxic friends have affected her and us from my experience in similar situations. I don't know if I should give up on her because that may be what she needs or just suck it up a little more. 

Her pets are at my place right now and have caused a little more than $200 in damage--which can be repaired and were thrifted. I just don't know what I should do, and I can't let this keep affecting my work. Thank you so much for the replies.",13Dec2019,1

830,"So I am graduating from college tomorrow and subsequently moving out of my apartment. I had a 6 month lease where I was matched with two random girls. Something to note is that while I have had no problems with K, I have had several issues with M. M never cleaned up after herself in the common space and the sink would be filled with her dirty dishes and left there over breaks. She would also never take out the trash or wipe down counters. I tried to deep clean the kitchen a few times but within an hour there would be more food left on the counter/floor and a general disaster. 

About a month ago, M's boyfriend starting staying the night. After about a week of him staying over more often than not, I made a joke to him about him potentially moving in. An important note is that at that point, I had no idea who he was or how often he would be staying over. I later learned that while M had asked K if it was okay for him to stay over, she intentionally didn't ask me. Since then there has been more of a rift between us. 

M is also graduating tomorrow and also moving out, while K is staying. I had a concern that when M moved out that she would potentially leave a mess behind just to spite me. Just in case I called the office to see if there would be any repercussions for her if she left a mess behind because I won't be cleaning it. Unfortunately if there is a mess left behind, K would be the one to deal with it when she comes back in January.

832,I'll try to keep this as short as possible. Due to a lengthy lost of circumstances and decisions on my part I'm kind of in a crappy part of life. It started years ago and I don't see it ending. I know that's depressing to talk that way but I honestly feel like at my age I should have at least something together. I wear jeans until they rip and I have worn the same pair of shoes almost daily for years. I am well aware that my life isn't the worst. Albeit with my dad I do have a place to call home. And I do have things that I am very great full for. But lately I have hot a wall. After I graduated college about 5 or so years ago I was so excited to get out and live. But I got stuck in a job that doesn't pay well for what I do. So it's hard to get by. It's made harder that it's a family business. And sometimes money doesn't come for a while. Mixed with my crappy habit of buying things that I don't need here and there and you have a storm of not good. But this past month or so has been really hard on me. For example I had some dental work done a few years ago that wasn't done properly. And I had to have a surgery to correct it. The surgery is in three parts and my insurance isn't paying any of it. I just had to cancel the second part because I couldn't afford it. Made worse by the fact the two days ago my car broke down after some family took me out for a birthday dinner. And I was just told that it would cost around $3000 to get it fixed. And honestly I feel terrible. I'm sitting here with the $300 that I have to my name and my terrible credit and looking at a bunch of nothing. I feel trapped. And more importantly I feel like a joke. I just want to walk out into the ocean. I've talked to my therapist about all of this and he tries to help but I'm very thick headed. And honestly afraid. So I guess that I'm looking for someone to help me get through my head that is possible to bounce out of this. Because right now I feel like a kid and a pretty worthless one at that.

So, my wife and I r currently staying in a very poor Southern Africa country. And in our neighborhood, there are a lot of kids that play in the streets, ages between 3 to 8.

Those kids do have a home, but they seem to be really poor. They always have dirty or torn clothing, no shoes, unsupervised, etc.

And they also get extremely excited by little things. Like when I brought a ball for them to play they were smiling like crazy and when I put a children app on my phone and let them play it was the happiest day of their lives.

Because they seem so needy, I start playing with them. I let them play on my phone, buy them sweets, let them go on my shoulders, to ride my bike, etc... And they love it way too much. In fact, they keep showing up in our house and we have to tell them to leave

Now, my wife started to get upset about me playing so much with them. She thinks it's a bit creepy for me, 23 years old, to play with kids that young. She's worried that their parents or the neighborhood might think that I'm a perv or something like that.

I never play with one kid only, but with all of them. And I never take them anywhere, we just play where they usually are, which is in the streets.

Do u think is a bit creepy?",13Dec2019,1
839,"I know I dodged a bullet but it doesn’t feel like it.


So this post might be a little long but bare with me. So there’s this girl that I had a thing with. We met in my web development class when my friend called me over to ask me what my favorite porn genres was. So F (friend) was clearly into this girl and they always had sexual convos I guess and then he would call me over to get my opinion but that’s where he messed up. The girl (now G) instantly starting hitting on me. I still don’t understand why to this day because I’m an average guy but she was kinda laying it on strong for some reason. She was actually really attractive, and Russian and I’m a complete cliche virgin boy.

So anyway she would always ask me for help and while I was on her computer casually have her boobs on my arm. Or one time she had me help her pick out lingerie for her boyfriend. I wasn’t dumb enough to not notice the flirting but I never did anything because she had a bf. F notices that she’s also coming on to me and gets jealous because he was trying to pull despite the fact that she isn’t single. He starts being totally passive aggressive towards me and always would yell “Why are you here” to get the teacher’s attention and what not. Anyway to make this story shorter he starts being a jerk to not only me but the girl as well and eventually she starts to hate him and actually moved to sit next to me. Being the fake friend he was he always found a reason to come over and talk to me so he could be next to the girl but she would ignore him and tell him to leave. I was also annoyed at him because I knew his true objective. 

Me and G start getting closer as she tell me about her friends, bf etc. I don’t cut her off ( honestly because I’d be lying if I said I hated the attention) but I always made sure to set boundaries because she had a bf. Like not talking to  her too late at night and limited sexual convos which was her favorite topic. She was also cheating on her bf during this period with a guy at her job but I still didn’t want to be apart of her cheating on her bf.

After a while of us talking everyday she broke up with her bf and obviously her advances increased. I should also let you know she was still friend with F. They had an on and off friendship. I at the time actually had a crush on someone else.  It didn’t work out but I still had feeling for her nonetheless. I let her know that I had feeling for someone else and she became obsessed with finding out who. I wouldn’t tell her because honestly she’s the type of person that has no filter. She tells everyone everything that happens in her life whether they’re close or not so I didn’t think she would be trust worthy. I don’t remember how she got my phone but she did and went through my messages and found out who I liked through a convo I had with a close friend. I didn’t even notice she had my phone until she yelled out “Who’s C?” (C being my crush) So basically everyone now knew who my crush is which is pretty embarrassing.  

I was angry with her and actually cut her off for a while but after going through Christmas break and seeing all the the apologies she left I forgave her. After winter break ended and we came back she kinda spread the news that she liked me to everyone (and when I say everyone I mean everyone because my school has like 500 kids total) so I was bombarded with people telling me she wanted to smash. I remember once during history  another girl called my name out in the middle of class pointed at G and then made a heart. Now I was interested in G. She was attractive and I was a teenage boy. Now that she was single it wouldn’t really be an issue but I still had my reservations about her. I have ppp (if you know you know) and obviously I’m insecure about it and she’s kinda has a big mouth and if the whole school knew I had ppp I’d actually kill myself.  I decided getting with her wasn’t worth the risk so I kind of just brushed her off.

But after a while she kind of started being mean to me. She would do stuff like call me a loser, the n word( which she justified by saying their not racist in Russian so the word had no meaning to her) and say things like she wanted to get with me but her friends think I’m ugly and that she should get with some other guy. I guess she was trying to show me that she had options and maybe pressure me to date her but her attempts made it worse. She even actually asked me out after sending nudes to F which was suppose to be compensation for him getting his feeling hurt. Also he wasn’t the only dude she sent to nudes to. Multiple dudes in our school were practically drooling over this girl and had her nudes, all of them were virgins and geeky like me. She was even sending nudes to one of her ex’s. I don’t want to shame her but I also don’t want to date someone when most of our school has seen her nudes. I never asked for her nudes and made sure I wasn’t never sent it so I’m basically the one of only people  in school who hasn’t seen them. 

The passive aggressive stuff go on and she hops from guy to guy letting me know everything that happens but I kind of get annoyed cause at this point I don’t care. She can get with whoever she wants. We had some arguments and eventually stopped talking to each other. 

Next year comes around and F instantly comes to sit next to me and tells me how she’s been saying bad things about me and that he wasn’t talking to her either. I say cool and don’t ask for the specifics of what was said and move on. But of course it’s not like our relationship was a secret and so people probably have heard rumors about me. I have a new phone now so I don’t know what was said before we cut each other off. So I message her and apologized if If I offended her and said asked her what I did. She said she didn’t know but she remembers I was an asshole.  We don’t speak again after that and she has a new bf who she post pictures with all the time ( one of them even had a conferderate flag on the wall in the background, Yikes). 

So eventually F stops sitting next to me and goes to sit with her everyday despite him quote on quote “not talking to her anymore”. I’m still single and a virgin to the boot with no experience with women. Ik she wasn’t a good person and I’m suppose to feel like I dodged a bullet, but I don’t. I actually find myself missing messaging her. My phone is dry now and I have no one to talk to. And I don’t think I’m every gonna get another girl as pretty as her to like me. I’m 18 and that was the most romantic I’ve been with a person. But I also feel pathetic for missing her because I know she was toxic.",13Dec2019,1
840,"So essentially, I'm moving. I have several friends at my current school, but it took me 6 months to make them initially. When I move away I wanted to do online school since it was easier, I didn't have to get up early, didn't have to worry about social aspects, etc. The problem is that apparently I'm not able to enroll in an online school until march or so. I thought I might as well wait until then, but nope. Apparently I have to be enrolled in a school before I can get into an online school. This means I have to go to the new school until I can enroll online. I was planning on finding a job asap, then saving up for later, but now I have to end up going back to school. With the area I'm going to be living in though, I'm relatively far from school, so if I did get a weekday job, I would end up with only about an hour of free time a day, which would kill me. I'm asking to see if anyone has any idea how I can get around this. Whether it be getting into online school early, or waiting until March while being out of school legally. It's already the second semester, so if I enroll in another school I'll be missing a lot.

How can I lose this weight?! I’m exercising and going to the gym as much as I can and I’m trying to eat better but it’s been hard as I have been comfort eating again as I’ve had a awful year being misdiagnosed and having unnecessary ear operations.

But I was finally diagnosed with tmj which is awful! 
Then only Monday gone was the worse day of my entire life as I lost my best friend of 16 years, my dog molly.. she wasn’t just a dog to me, I grew up with her. She was always by my side. My best friend. I just can’t function. 
This year has just been so cruel to me and my family. My mental health has been the worse yet!

848,"Hey reddit,

My title doesn’t explain it in detail so let me explain my situation. My male friend and I are both military and we’re both of the same boat. We’ve been working together for a little over a month (we get sent to the mess decks to be food service attendants for 90 days) and all has been well up until the last time we were out at sea. 

My friend and I (including others) were bringing boxes up six staircases because the machine we have to specifically do that is broken. When we got to the last stair case, I didn’t want to be in a certain spot of the line we do to pass up the boxes and my friend being his usual self, started talking s**t. Saying things along the line of  “oh my god, *insert my last name* you don’t do shit,” etc, etc. This is his usual behavior, him and I joke around like that often. What upset him was when I got upset, told him to “shut the f**k up” and a few other things. I left and went up to the mess decks because I was done with him talking to me like that. I told our supervisor about what happened between us because he asked me what was wrong (I guess I looked upset when I went back up to the mess decks). Our supervisor spoke to my friend and he’s been ignoring me and being rude when he does interact with me since. 

I’m usually not that type of person to bring my problems to our supervisor because I like figuring it out between me and the person I’m having a problem with. I was just so done with listening to my friend talk shit because I was very overwhelmed with all the people on board and the fact that we were working 12+ hours a day. 

Before I ask for advice, I have two things to add: I’ll tell you what I’ve attempted to fix this and another reason why I think he could upset. 

What I attempted to do is ask him to talk in person (so I could apologize and explain myself) and he said “no, fuck off.” And walked away. I’ve attempted to make small conversation about work, when he’s going to fly out during leave, etc. And I even try to help him out where he works to show him I am truly sorry and I want this friendship to work. 

Another reason I feel like he’s been rude to me is because my supervisor suggests that I am “one of the hardest workers he has,” and “*insert my friends name here* isn’t that good at what he does but he’s a nice guy.” I think he may not feel appreciated enough for what he does. I acknowledge the fact that my friend definitely does more work than me because it’s the truth...I guess our supervisor just doesn’t see it. I feel as if he might be upset about that too even though that part isn’t my fault. And I wish I could communicate that to my friend. 

So I need advice on what to do to mend our friendship. Should I text him a paragraph explaining why I acted that way &amp; that he’s appreciated? Should I give him time to cool off (this happened about a week ago)? Any advice is appreciated!! 

Thank you.",13Dec2019,1

853,"A few days ago I was looking for a tripod and found on the JOBY website, a tripdod discounted 95% from 179 to $8.80. I ordered one realizing the savings, then ordered 5 more. JOBY has another company, KIBO, handle their online transactions since it sounds like several distrubtors can send me what i've ordered. Its been a few days now and the order status states that ""my payment information is being verified."" This was all on the 12-10-19. Its been a few days and I now see the website is offering the same tripod for $88.00. Whether or not it was their mistake I purchased something at a stated price and even have confirmations for both orders. 

Does anyone have any advice/comments on how to proceed with garunteeing I get that price?

It seems like its all in their hands now, I doubt they would charge me the higher price since thats not what was confirmed for me, but I get the feeling they might try to cancel my order or something.

I do have a screenshot of the first order I made as well as confirmation emails for both orders with correct quantities and the lower price.",13Dec2019,1
856,"This is long so forgive me.

I was kicked out of my father's house back when I was 17 and have been successfully living on my own, until about 2 months ago where I became financially unstable. I moved back into my father's house just about a month ago hoping things have changed. (We fought and my life was threatened constantly.) I lost my job I had, and basically bad no money. I tried to apply to multiple businesses around me and my dad told me they weren't good enough for me. He would bar me inside to house telling me I couldn't get a job until he got one he liked for me.

Well we fought just last night, police were called. And he threatened my life again. Then he tells me to leave by tonight because I broke his trust by calling the police. I have no job, no car, no money whatsoever. And we live in a fairly rural part of town where it would take 3 hours to walk to my old work. I'm not sure what to do. And I can't really sell anything to get money out of here. 

None of my friends can take me in. And my brothers live across the country. If I could I would go move with them. But I can't without paying for a way there. What can I do to find a place to stay until I get enough money to move? Or really any advice at all?",13Dec2019,1

860,"**TL;DR** - met a woman on a language exchange app, dated long-distance for 15 months, I came to China to see her, currently living here at her apartment, working here, she controls my life (especially my money) and I feel trapped with no financial means to become independent. I'm afraid of her leaving me someday and me having no means of survival in this foreign country. What should I do?

------------------------------------------------------

I [23M] have been dating my girlfriend [26F] for 15 months. She is from Shanghai, China. We dated long-distance over the Internet until I could afford to come to China. I've been here for a couple of weeks and recently she said that if I am serious about being with her, I have to surrender total control over my bank accounts, salary, and all my money/savings to her. I won't have any access to it and she said that this is normal in Chinese culture and that she will give me a tiny allowance each month (to buy food/transportation costs to work). She said wants me to work hard to afford to buy an apartment and car for her (demanded that it has to be under her name only). She basically said that this is a necessary requirement if I actually want to be with her and it's a way I can show my dedication and love for her. I asked her what she will use the money for and she said it's up to her and that she can do whatever she wants with it, even go shopping for expensive brandname items/clothing, girls-night-outs with her friends, beauty parlours, and go on solo-vacations by herself. 

Background:

The thing is, this visit to China I made was only meant to be temporary, I only planned to stay for a month or two but now I cannot go back to Canada and she said I have to stay here and settle down in China right now with her. I no longer have any control over any finances, my VPN will run out by the end of December (so no access to the outside world), I don't know if I should contact my family and tell them I'm trapped, she is holding onto my passport for me and when I asked her why, she said she's ""worried I'll lose it"" which would get me into a lot of trouble and headache, especially here in China so I appreciate it but I wish I'd have more independence from her, it's like she doesn't trust me. 

She said I need to be able to demonstrate my commitment and loyalty to her and that I can support her lifestyle. This came out of nowhere and I don't know how to react. By the way, she works and makes a lot of money (wayyy more than I do and more than enough to support herself) but I have never been allowed to touch any of her money. I have deep love for her and agreed to her demands because I wanted to show that I love her and I'm serious and different from other guys who are players. I gave her my bank account information and she set it up where my salary automatically deposits into the account when I get paid (which only she has control over). But now I feel like I messed up and I'll regret this in the future. I love her and want to spend the rest of my life with her (she's extremely attractive and I will not leave her, I cannot even bring myself to think about doing such a thing). Wtf do I do though, should I go along with it? I brought it up with her today and she just laughed and told me to get used to it because this is how it is in China and that I need to trust her judgement and let her decide our futures because she knows what's best for me because she's older and more mature.

Seriously, did I mess up? I don't mind her being in-charge but I'm worried she'll lose her respect for me, ditch me, and take my $$$.
We only have sex now when I beg and plead her for it and it's always the same position (prone starfish) while she plays on her phone even though I'm trying my best during it, she doesn't even acknowledge me and pretends I'm not there. She gets annoyed if I try to kiss or cuddle with her and told me that she doesn't like it. She told me she is not a sexual or affectionate person and that she doesn't think sex is important and suggested that we stop having it. 

I feel trapped in this relationship now because I already surrendered control over my finances and I don't have access to it anymore (she has the passwords to the accounts and everything is under her name now). Idk what to do honestly.

She does not take me seriously at all, if I tried to ask her for control over my stuff, she'd laugh and say no. It's like she knows I'm helpless now and there's nothing I can do. I was thinking about saving some of my salary in-order to hide it and build up my independence but she set it up where it automatically transfer to her bank account when I get paid. I want to bring it up with the payroll department at my work but idk if they'll react well. I'm in a foreign country, my Chinese sucks, I rely on her for everything. She could kick me out of the apartment if she wanted and I'd be f--ked. I have no money to have my own place or get a plane ticket home.

I asked her if she could teach me Chinese so I didn't have to rely on her so much and she told me that she does not want me to learn Chinese and said I can't learn it. Idk if she's trying to manipulate me or just wants to be in an English-speaking environment because she wants to improve her English?

She wants me to settle here with her and we're talking about buying an apartment and car (she said it has to be under her name) and I'm working as an English teacher (easy to find a job when you're a native English speaker who is white and from a Western country). She has brought up marriage yesterday and it surprised me so much, it all seems to be happening so fast. But now I don't have any access to my salary because it deposits automatically into the bank account she controls. So I only have my allowance she gives me once per month. I don't even have a work visa so this is really dangerous because I could be caught and deported. She basically has my balls in a grip right now. 

I thought everything would be okay and I trusted her, she's extremely beautiful (model, livestreamer, athlete, professional dancer who appears on government programs with Chinese celebrities frequently) plus she has a great personality so I really value her and cannot afford to lose her. It's too hard for guys like me to find girls like her. I just hope it all works out but I've never been in a situation like this and apparently this is an aspect of Chinese culture so I guess I should go along with it.

I'm feel like her slave. Like I have a naturally submissive, shy, timid, unconfident, nice, gentle personality so I was really open to this idea at first and always agree with her. Honestly, I was never successful with girls back in Canada even though I'm not ugly and I'm fairly handsome (my first girlfriend which I got when I was 21 was a Chinese international student back in Canada who ditched me after a few months and went back to her ex, I lost my virginity to her), I'm just too effeminate looking and scrawny for the girls back home I guess. So you can understand how desperate I am and why I cannot imagine leaving her, I love her and I'm totally loyal to her. She is only my 2nd girlfriend ever and I cannot believe I managed to score her, like she's really attractive and there's no way I'll get this lucky and find another girl who is attractive as her again. So I cannot bring myself to breakup with her and leave her even though I've thought about it a lot. Like she literally controls all the money, I have no money aside from the money she gives to me so I cannot even try to be independent now. I feel trapped and stuck. I am scared of how she would react if I disobeyed her or told her I want to leave her. Not gonna lie, she'd literally kick my ass (she's stronger than me, same height, and athletic while I'm scrawny and weak so she is dominant both physically, mentally, and emotionally over me).

I don't mind being henpecked as long as she still loves me and never leaves me. I heard divorce is frowned upon heavily in Asian culture so I should be okay since Chinese women are loyal and family-orientated. I just need some sex and physical affection in my life but is trying to shut the sex down permanently. Idk if that's normal but I want to convince her that I have sexual and emotional needs, I want to feel loved by her, it will help me provide and be a good partner who can meet all of her harsh and strict demands.

We're in China right now, she told me she expects us to move to Canada and for me to help her come to Canada someday.

I wondered if she was using me for immigration but I don't think so. She could have picked any foreigner and she waited 15 months for me to come to China. I think her feelings are genuine. She legit gets hit on by guys all the time yet she's with me, not them.

I'm worried about becoming unemployed but I mean, I'm a white native English-speaker. I don't think I'll ever have trouble not making money here in China? Finding jobs such as English teaching is really easy here, there's racial prejudice that gives an advantage to Caucasian people in employment. I'm just deathly worried about failing to meet her strict demands and then she leaves me, I'd be utterly broken and lost if that happened, especially in a foreign country on the other side of the planet from Canada where I do not speak the language or know anybody.

She only lets me call or text my family if I'm being supervised by her and I lost all my friends because she said she doesn't like them and doesn't want me to be friends with them so I feel isolated. She checks my phone a lot.

We talk about marriage and having children sometimes, I'm just worried about not being able to afford having kids... but if I marry her, it's a good way to protect myself against her potentially leaving me.

I just feel totally lost right now. I basically feel like she is in control of my life and everything I had planned for my future has gone to the trash because I'm stuck here with her. Like now I'm stuck here in China, I work long hours teaching English to kids, have no friends, cannot make new friends because I don't have any Chinese language skills, and I feel like her personal slave. She makes me do all the household chores, I give her personal massages, I do everything for her. I do not leave the apartment without asking her for permission, she calls me when I'm out and demands I tell her what I'm doing, where I'm at, and what time I'll be home. Meanwhile, whenever she's not at work, she's usually out with her friends shopping or doing whatever (I have no idea, she doesn't tell me). She complains that I'm lazy and should work harder to impress her if I want to keep her and show her my love.

I made her sound like a terrible girlfriend but actually I cannot imagine my life without her. She's the love of my life and I worry everyday about not having her by my side someday. I just wish I didn't feel so trapped and controlled by her, I feel like her pet or something.

Please give me advice on how I can convince her to trust me and allow me more independence (such as having more say in how much allowance she gives me) because I feel lonely and miserable right now and only feel happy when she's chilling with me at the apartment. I have no life outside of her now... is this normal and am I doing the right thing? What should I do to turn this into a more fulfilling relationship for both of us? Thank you very much if you read my entire post.",13Dec2019,1
862,"My ex and I broke up three years ago. He contacted me recently to say that he was moving for medical school and still had some of my things at the apartment we shared previously, which I'm going to pick up tomorrow. 

I know it's been forever, but my ex was (at one point) abusive -- both physically and mentally. I'm aware people change, and he seemed sincere in his intentions, but the thought of seeing him kind of makes me uneasy.

864,"When I was younger I had a best friend. We were both in highschool and our situation was not the best one. We didn’t attend at the same highschools but we supported each other as much as we could. We were such good friends..

Then both of us changed to different highschools and our situations improved.  Out relationship slowly started to fall apart. She didn’t ask me to meet up as much as before and when I did it she was evasive. She met another girl (NOT in highschool)  and she replaced me for this girl.  The thing is we NEVER had a dicussion or were  angry with each other and maybe that’s a problem.

The reason I am making this question is another similar situation. This new girl let’s call her Gina and I have been friends since three years ago. 
After I finished highschool I was so lost in my life. I wasn’t working either studying. Besides I lost my other friends who in reality were toxic people. I was so bad. One of the few people I could reach to was Gina. Again, a wonderful friendship without any problem. Gina started working and met a new girl who now she is very friends with. And again I’m noticing how i am replaced.
Fortunately, I found my path and started going to university this year. I made new friends.

, I feel how my relationship with Gina is every time more distant. But this time it’s like I don’t care maybe because I don’t want to undergo the same experience. On the other hand it feels bad. 

The friendships were great and I never had any discussion with them. Maybe that’s the problem? What’s happening?

First off, I want to say thank you guys SO MUCH! It really hurts and stuff because I spent 3 and a half years of my life with this guy and what we had was comfortable. With that being said I’m also really relieved? 

Which brings me to why I need some guidance... I’m hurt, I’m sad, I feel alone and scared and stuff like a normal break up but unlike a normal breakup those emotions only come in waves? Most of the time I either feel ‘meh’ or I just fcking hate the guy and am so angry with him and myself for putting me through so much BS for so long.

I’m scared of being on my own, of being alone, not having that familiarity or comfortability... 

We rarely had any good times but I cling to those few memories and it makes me sad. I never had this with my last breakups, I was just heartbroken or straight up fine, there was no mix of emotions for me. Is this all normal? And as a side note, what are some ways of getting passed what him and his family did to me? How do I get passed all the anger? I’ve always had anger issues in general but this actually burns my entire being when I think about it and I want it to stop. I just want to try to be more peaceful and I’m so tired.

870,"Okay so Im very aware that I am going to come off sounding like a conceded bitch and for that, I am sorry.

There’s this guy, and I am 80% certain we like each other. He’s offered to treat me to dinner countless times, bought a lightbulb for me and tried to fix the headlight on my car, and he invited me out to hang with him at an event thats coming up VERY soon.

He has a YouTube channel that he runs with some friends. Its very small, and he knows. But in our local community, he is popular. There is a girl who watches the videos and she is really, *really*, into him. But we have been keeping “us” on the down-low, so going to that event will kind of be a “ta-da! We’ve been seeing each other!” From what I have heard, this girl is very nice however a little socially inept. And she talks *a lot*. According to his friend (the only one who knows we’ve been going out), she has been dying to meet him and will probably hang off his arm as soon as she sees him.

Okay so my problem: for starters, I am autistic. So things that are obvious to “normal” people (especially regarding social interaction), are not obvious to me. I have a tendency to be very blunt and sometimes come across rude or aggressive. While I’ve been working on it a lot, its still sometimes an issue for me. My conundrum, is how do I go about conducting myself tomorrow in a way that is not a snide mean-girl, but not a pushover? If she really does like him, and wants to meet him, I want to let that happen. I dont want to come across as one of those girls who are like, *“excuse me, he’s MY man and you can’t talk to him”*. But I do want to spend sometime with him, while Im there. I would be pretty disappointed if I spent most of the time on the sidelines waiting for them to finish talking.

So yeah. I dont want to be rude to her, but I don’t want to be a pushover. What is your guy’s advice for me? Again, Im sorry for sounding stuck up.",13Dec2019,1
871,"I'm 20F, my boyfriend (20M) broke up with me around 7 months ago. We were dating for 2+ years, and I was extremely serious about him. He broke off saying that he had self esteem issues, and he felt like he didn't deserve me, or that I was too good for him. He used to hang out a lot with me, and I don't know what exactly led to his downfall, but he got a drop in his college year. That took a toll on him and he broke up with me. It was very tough to recover, I loved him a lot. I had never thought about anyone beyond him. It's been 7 months now, and i tried to talk to him every now and then because it's impossible to resist myself. For a few months I completely cut off contact with him, and then one day he called me to ask how I was doing and that brought things to square one. Anyway, today I opened his profile again and saw that he has changed so much. His new pictures. He's become better looking, he looks really positive and he's become good overall. And I'm happy for him, but I also feel like I was the reason he was so depressed. I mean, when he left me, he decided to work out and stuff and get back on track.

1. he tore up and covered in cat nip one of our chairs. i don’t care that he did, we were gonna get rid of it because it sucked and we found a new one. but he says the cats (we own two cats) will like it and just somehow understand that it’s okay to scratch up... the cats haven’t gone near it. i pointed out that it looks dirty and if he’s sure the cats like it but he just won’t listen 

2. he brought up one of those electric bikes that sorta looks like a motorcycle. he found it in the garbage and wants to either turn it into a “project” or somehow fix it and give it to a friend. he doesn’t know anything about mechanics and neither do i. so right now it’s just sitting in our kitchen 

3. whenever we watch something, he will go an tangents about what’s going on and look too deep into it. when i try to explain something or correct him he just won’t listen 

4. he didn’t go to sleep right now and is currently trying to do things around the house so there’s a little bit of a mess right now if multiple things he’s working on

i was forced to homeschool, and managed to complete 2.5 years of high school in 8 months. during that time, my relationship with my parents worsened. my dad ended up physically abusing me on multiple occasions, so far as strangling me into a seizure. they then gaslit me into thinking i deserved it, and i still haven't shaken whether or not i was abused or not. 2 weeks after getting my diploma, i was whisked away to college to live on my own for the first time, after being essentially confined to my house for 8 months. unsurprisingly, i flunked out. 

i hid away at my grandmothers, and was coerced by my family to join the national guard. went to basic, had issues with me knees, and was kept for 4 and a half months in basic training lifestyle as a holdover, then sent back home. my parents asserted that i faked it to get out, and then suggested i live with them instead of my grandmother. i was originally planning to go back to college with my grandmother, which would have been more stable, but i listened. after i realized my home environment was toxic, i quit college and left for my grandmother, with whom i reside with now. i'm $2000 in debt, fairly miserable, and struggling.

i have no energy to do anything, and i have no idea why. i see everyone else going through life, feeling fine, pushing through, and i feel like a weak excuse for a human. i'm pretty sure i have a ton of mental issues, primitive social skills, rock bottom self esteem, and no life goals. my parents won't allow me to see a psychologist, and are pushing constantly for me to get a job. i was fired from my last job, for being late too much. i know if i get another job, i'll lose it, because i have no motivation or energy. my knees, ankles, and feet stay in pain, and i don't know what to do about it, since i can't see a doctor. 

i'm on my parents insurance, and they refuse to do much about my health. they've just now, after 3 years, got me on accutane to fix my acne, which is something, but my mental situation and physical problems are continuing to build. i have no social contacts living with my grandmother, as small towns are hard to get in touch with. so no real friends to fall back on. 

ive considered suicide a few times, so far as writing notes and even chambering a round, but have yet to pull the trigger. i barely eat, i don't do much, and i feel as though i'm a failure or will fail at anything i do. i have nightmares about my father and what he's done. with my wording situation, the anxiety lays down even more pressure, to the point i can only think about all that's wrong and needs to be fixed.

i'm lost, i don't know what to do, and things are getting worse. before all this happened, i had a loving family, a 30 act score by 10th grade, 3.8 gpa, and tons of friends. that was when i was 16. i'm 19 now, and i don't think ill make it to 21.

if anyone knows anything i can do, please. i could use it.",13Dec2019,1
879," So there's this kid named Josh, and he's a grade A jerk. He was already really annoying and not very many people liked him. All week he's been given me and two of my other friends threats and has been harassing us and being very disrespectful in general. He's not a big dude so I don't take his garbage, I tell him to screw off the moment he starts to mess with me. That being said, I will never lay my hands on him unless he does so first. Yesterday (the 11th) He was following us around and called my friend (who came from England) ""a stupid british b\*\*ch"" we told him that if he has a problem then he should step up and do something, which he never did. But me and my friends finally got him to leave us alone as we were waiting for another friend (who had also been harassed by him) and as he was walking towards us, Josh called him a stupid b\*\*ch. Of course he just kinda rolled his eyes and jogged to us. He came up to me and said ""Do you know how to do a takedown?"" I said ""Yeah... Do you?"" He turns toward Josh and says ""watch this"" as he proceeds to suplex Josh onto the ground and his head bounces off the pavement. Everything went quite and everyone absolutely EXPLODED, they praised my friend with me and half of the school cheered. I had a couple other friends off to the side who weren't apart of any of this and didn't know what was going on. But they saw me celebrating that someone got hurt and they got upset with me, sternly telling me to calm down and shut up while the others shook their heads in disappointment. One of these people was my ex but we still decided to be good friends, but one of the reasons we broke up was because i was a little too aggressive towards bullies instead of resolving it peacefully. So when she saw this i bet all she could think was ""He hasn't changed a bit"". But the main point is that her along with a couple other people are mad because someone got what they deserved and i get blamed for it. And i don't want to say sorry because i don't wanna seem like i'm trying to make her feel bad, so how should i go about this?",13Dec2019,1
880,"I was best friends with this girl for 10 whole years, she decided to stop telling me about her life, she never initiated hanging out anymore, she also has lied to me about never having time. She was too busy working to come see me from 10 minutes away yet she drove 10 hours to go see a friend she just made 3 months ago. 

I couldn’t take it because I was the only one trying and i was getting hurt because she’d tell me she was her best friend, but never hang out with me and only post pictures of hanging out with her other friends. And I’ve told her my concerns about 5 times she’s ignored all of them. I haven’t talked to her in a week and I think she’s being petty by posting a bunch of pictures hanging out with her other friends. I still care for her but I’m doing this to better myself. I’m not sure if I should delete her off of social media because we’ve been friends for so long and it’d feel wrong. What do I do?",13Dec2019,1
881,"Hey other people!!! If anyone knows of a better place for me to post this LET ME KNOW!!! Just looking for other opinions on these feels.

I'm a person who, during the first Obama term, I supported him. Then, somewhere in the middle of his second term, I started noticing some blatant hypocrisies ALL throughout the Democratic Party, which made me fully turn on it. I don't believe that the ""Left"" \*owns\* the LGBTQ+ movement, they sometimes \*ACT\* as if you're in that group you ARE REQUIRED to be a Democrat. I find that to be bull shit. Also, having issues with what people do in their own homes consentually is bull shit. It's no one's business. I agree that abortion should be legal and accessible, in the safest scenarios. Also, I'm not a follower of any religion.  I wouldn't say AT ALL that I'm a Trump supporter, but I don't ""hate"" him or really feel he did anything any worse than others in power in DC. He \*IS\* a scumbag that doesn't know how to communicate what he means very well. I will argue for that fact any time. Hillary was an outright CROOK, whom the media decided that they HAD to have her win, and they did EVERYTHING they could to get her in the White House and they failed. I LOVE that fact. I'm very happy that everyday people showed the media that, 95% of the time, we're not falling for their bull shit. But anyway, I guess I'm wondering where I fit in ""politically"". The Democrats are in a downward spiral of inadvertently destroying the country's urban areas, and making it impossible to get off of govt. assistance. Meanwhile, I don't agree with many right-wing politicians because I'm not religious and don't believe any of that nonsense, and the archaic nonsensical laws some of them want to put into place based purely off of how they feel because of their religion. BUT, I DO agree that our country needs to protect it's borders and be selective about who we let in. As far as I know, don't other countries get that privilege? We don't? I believe that healthcare in this country should use something similar based on Canada or other European countries systems. I support capitalism, but you can't trust people to do the right things. Not everyone is a good person. We can see the affects of that right now. Capitalism isn't perfect, but it can be made better. I'm just kinda confused about it all, and realize: There's no people I know personally who agree with what I believe out there. If there are, I'm wondering what that ""group"" is called?",13Dec2019,1

884,"I have had this problem, more or less, my entire life. I don't feel uncomfortable enough, when I should.

This guy I knew sent me the most obscene messages, he insisted on hanging out with me and doing whatever he wanted to do, and he would refuse to drop me off back at home when I told him to. The guy never physically assaulted me, and I know that would have made me really uncomfortable, but the situation as it was should have been enough for any normal person to say ""holy shit stay the fuck away from me.""

That anything was wrong with the relationship didn't occur to me until WAY later. Literally the only precautionary measure I took was to not hang out with him if I knew I had something to do after. I literally let that guy do this for longer than two years.

The issue wasn't that I was too afraid to stand up for myself. The problem was that I didn't feel appropriately uncomfortable.

When I would say ""alright can you drop me off now?"" and he'd totally ignore me, driving around with him for another hour basically just felt like having to stand in a long line for food at a popular restaurant. ""Annoyingly tedious, but not heinously abusive."" I wish I knew to recognize this as *heinously abusive*.

That's one example of many. There's a lot of stuff that when I think back on it I realize ""that was some really dark shit.""

Honestly, this might be a good quality gone so extreme to a fault. For example, I'm an adaptable roommate. I almost never get uncomfortable or angry. You can ask my roommates.

This might stem from just having a really loud family, and my natural instinct has always been to be really averse to that.

In effect, I can't handle yelling but I honestly don't notice when terrible people abuse me in terrible ways.

I really want to stand up for myself. I just don't know when to.

Do you have any advice?",13Dec2019,1
885,"So my boyfriend is currently on an 18 hour contract with a coaching company. We’ve booked to go on holiday in January as it’ll be our anniversary and his boss has basically made it really awkward for us. He’s giving him every other day of the holiday off work and considering his work place is 2 hours away from the holiday place, he’s obviously not wanting to do this. It’ll also ruin the holiday as we won’t be able to actually spend time together properly. He also gave his boss 3 months notice, and has only now just found out that he can’t have every day of the holiday off despite letting him know 2 months ago. The reason they won’t let him have the days off is because his boss hasn’t been bothered to replace 2 of his colleagues who quit after getting fed up with the company, meaning a lot of pressure has been left on my bf. He’s told his boss that the added distance is too much for him and that he simply can’t come in on those days, in which the boss said he would fire him if he didn’t show up for work. I don’t know much about laws but I’m pretty sure that’s illegal? Correct me if I’m wrong. I’m almost certain however that it is illegal for his boss to refuse him sick days for being seriously ill, which his boss has done multiple times. Is there any thing at all that my boyfriend can actually do here? Other than quit as he really enjoys the coaching side of the work, he’s just hating the rest of it I.e. his boss.",13Dec2019,1
886,"Vegan (no judge on the rest, do whatever), Woke (didn't ask for a drop of blood to fall out of the sky in a living room), Struggling with any and all communication with people (even my mother, objective reality is too difficult to agree on, conversations inevitably lead to no consensus or resolution) 

Basic problem seems to be that while most people shy away from the difficult, hurtful and obscene and prefer to live in a world of falsities and niceties, I seem to attempt to engage with my own demons and theirs. I'm not saying that I am constantly pointing fault with other people, but it seems like even when it is obvious that something has happened I am expected to just ignore it if it is uncomfortable, for me or them.

This obviously leads to loneliness, relationship breakdown with everyone, and the general expectation that I modify my behaviour to fit in. I am faced with the situation of never being able to be myself and make someone else comfortable at the same time. Even the psychologist I went to offered me to ""leave and I will waive the fee... if you want to"".

Am I being demanding by inviting conversation about everything and being unsatisfied with the meagre chit chat of mundane everyday life? Am I the asshole for wanting more out of conversation that a total lack of consensus and a wishy washy unfinished feeling from every interaction.

I've been seriously considering that I am the wrong fit and I should just exit the matrix, I'm sick and tired of pissing everyone off, being ""too intense"", not fitting in and genuinely seeming to find that I speak a totally different language, as it were.

Is it just the soul crushing realisation that humans are just guided by ignorance and emotion? If so, please give me ten good reasons to stay here.

Yours Sincerely",13Dec2019,1
