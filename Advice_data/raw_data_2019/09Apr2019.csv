I see people my age the same way I see my parents &amp; I just cant seem to fathom being their age? I just feel so different &amp; like a fraud &amp; that I can't handle adult life like everyone else does.",09Apr2019,1
1,"I'm in a military branch in a country. Won't say which one.  When I was 7 my mom suddenly and unexpectedly had a stroke. I was the only one home old enough to know something was wrong. We drove to the hospital w me and my sisters. The drive wasn't smooth. fast forward to her coming home she would randomly have siezures. I never realized siezures where ok and only kill in special cases until I was a couple years older. 

Growing up I did a lot of stupid shit but rarely felt fear. Thought I was a psychopath for a bit but I actually genuinely care about other people and my family and dogs so that doesn't fit. I thought I was brave for not being scared but you have to be scared to be brave so if you're numb to danger is a whole different thing and it wasn't until about 30 minutes ago listening to Ben Anderson on Joe Rogans podcast talk about PTSD did I learn that was actually a symptom. I looked up the other symptoms. I have almost all of them except for night mares. I don't get them. I don't remember if I used to. So maybe I'm wrong bc thats a big one right? I thought i was just depressed and anxious growing up. I feel like a fucking pussy posting this. If you're someone that saw combat you're seeing this and this pisses you off I'm really fucking sorry.",09Apr2019,1
3,"alright so. very long story that i will try to summarize as best as possible. i have been friends with this girl, let’s call her G, for 3 years now. i have always considered her a very close friend. G &amp; i were closer than ever last school year, but she ended up doing online school in march. we still hung out but after a few months drifted apart, then she ended up going to a new high school this school year bc her girlfriend lived there. we talked everyone once in a while &amp; i seen her a few times. well, in january, she came back to my high school. we have gotten extremely close again. about two weeks ago, i ended a relationship i had been in for over a year. i hadn’t felt happy with him in months &amp; i felt guilty.. because i had developed feelings for G. even longer story short, we ended up confessing our feelings for each other a few days after. she told me she had felt this way for over a year. OVER A FUCKING YEAR.

now, time for a little back story.

like i said, last school year we were extremely close. &amp; she is a lesbian, she is open about it &amp; doesn’t care. up until this past october she was in a very abusive on &amp; off relationship with a girl for around 2 years. we will call her ex S. i am mainly attracted to guys but for as long as i can remember, i always knew i looked at girls differently as well. i’m not automatically attracted to them, but i always knew i would date a girl if i ever caught feelings for one. looking back on last year, i believe i had feelings for G then. but i don’t think i consciously admitted it. i can just remember always wanting to be around her, i remember hugging her &amp; not wanting to let go. but looking back now on those things, &amp; some other things, i think i liked her then, too.

back to the present ish. so yes she confessed her feelings to me &amp; i done the same. i felt so guilty because we treat each other like best friends &amp; she has felt this way for over a year &amp; i NEVER knew. she told me she repressed it because i was with my ex, who was her friend, &amp; because she was with S. she told me she didn’t ever think i would feel the same way back. she also told me that if she would’ve had to hide the way she felt about me forever, then she would’ve if it meant i was happy. right now we’re just seeing where things go. it’s scary because i love &amp; care for her SO deeply, because she IS my best friend &amp; has been my close friend for years. i don’t love her romantically yet obviously, but i do love her deeply. i am so scared of losing her. BUT ANYWAY. the whole point of this post was to rant about my mom. however i felt like everyone needed to hear the back story to understand. also maybe help &amp; give me some advice about G, too.. because we’re both committed to making it work &amp; seeing where things go but we’re scared of losing each other &amp; our friendship if things don’t work out.

onto my mother. like i said, G &amp; i hung out a lot last year &amp; my mom knows about her. my mom obviously knows she’s gay. well about a week ago my mom came into my room &amp; began asking me if G liked me, &amp; if i liked her back. i obviously denied this, &amp; my mom told me “it’s just my job to protect you.” protect me from what, mom ? the fucking G A Y ?. also anytime i say i’m with G she acts weird &amp; i can tell she’s suspicious of how much we hang out. i know deep down my mom thinks something is going on. i’ve wanted to tell my mom many times over the years that i know i’m not 100% straight. but i know she would react horribly &amp; not accept it. &amp; it was easy before to deny it when she would ask me about G, because my feelings were still hidden. but now that we actually have something going on &amp; we’re hiding it from everyone, i feel even more paranoid about my mom. plus she knows i broke up with my boyfriend which makes her even more suspicious. i don’t want to make it obvious. i don’t want her to make me stop hanging out with G. it is so fucking stressful. someone just give me some advice or words of encouragement or something. idk at this point. 

also let me just say. it’s not just a crush i have on G. i have deep, genuine feelings for her. so deep that they scare me. i love her so much, not in that way. but she was my best friend first so i obviously love her. this whole situation makes me go ahsksejeka. :/",09Apr2019,4
4,"So here it goes:

A couple of days back, a girl posted screenshots from this disgusting group on our university's discussion forum. The targeted group of these memes were women that went to our university and it was honestly downright horrifying the kind of content that was shared there. The group had half a thousand members from our campus and apologies for being bystanders and not realizing the ""memes"" were problematic started pouring in soon after. 

All of this was extremely triggering as it confirmed to a lot of us women that boys on campus WERE predators, not one, not two but 600 of them. One of my very close friends, that I could not have fathomed would be part of something like this sent me an apology for hurting me and being a part of it. He said he was a silent spectator -but a little digging and it turned out he had liked some of the content there and added another friend of ours to it too.

I am so, so angry and I don't want anything to do with him. He knows how hard things have been for women on campus for the last few weeks (there have been other instances on campus about other things) and I can't believe that he couldn't call out that group for what it was and only thought of it as problematic when some girls created a ruckus on campus about it. 

I don't want to be friends with him anymore. But I do want your input because I don't want this to be a hasty decision I just took in the heat of the moment. I can't think of him as a friend anymore -all I can think of is that he saw some sexually frustrated and sick guys make these shitty jokes about girls on campus, including me, and didn't think there was anything wrong with it. 

He is really sorry and otherwise had been a great friend. But I really don't know what to do at this point. I want to cut him off but I don't want this to be something I did irrationally. What should I do?",09Apr2019,1

6,"Hey y’all.  The past two years I was drinking heavily most nights. Also was stoned from morning till night while also smoking cigarettes with a poor diet. 

I finally realized if I continued down this path I would ultimately die from my neglect for myself. So in January I quit smoking and picked up vaping and have tapered down to 1mg nicotine currently. I also stopped drinking in January. And only allowing my self one drink, once a week if that. 

A month ago today I stopped smoking weed and started eating clean. Started exercising a couple weeks ago consistently for the first time.  

All that to say I’ve been having panic attacks frequently for the first time in my life. Low self esteem and not sure what to do. My anxiety is heavy and to the point where I have discomfort  in my left side and just feeling incredibly tense. It’s been debilitating with work and overall motivation for really anything else. 

I’m sure this much change to my body is contributing to my anxiety.  I’m just fearing that this is the new normal for me and I hate it and I don’t feel like I’m getting better despite everything I’ve done/doing. 

I’m going to stick through, I’m determined but I’m miserable and don’t feel...human.",09Apr2019,1
7,"So I’m currently an 18 year old dude, and I’ve been dating this girl for a few months, just made it official. She’s sweet, she’s not trashy in the slightest, smart, and pretty, but just a little shy, especially around new people. Now, I’ve never brought anyone home...I’ve had girlfriends at 15 and 16 but nothing that serious. It seems like things are definitely getting serious. Last week I had her over, and the way my very small apartment is set up, when you walk in our place, it’s the living room, and the first thing you see is my parents sitting on the couch(only child). I walked in with her behind me, and of course my parents were there, my heart races. Before I could introduce her, she goes “Hi, I’m (name)”! My parents get up, say hello to her, and to avoid any awkward interaction, I say “we’re gonna go in the room and watch a movie”. And we were off. 

The next morning, my dad mentions how he thought it was weird and rude how I didn’t keep her talking to them longer. It was nothing against them, I just knew it would be a very strange and uncomfortable conversation, considering our living room is very small. I like my parents, they’re pretty cool people, I’m just a noob at bringing girls home. I told her she should come by in a few days and she said sure, and I’m planning on having her over for dinner with them, how can I make the interactions WAY less awkward since I’m the one bringing my girlfriend and my parents together?

TL;DR- First time bringing a girl home, was very quick and rushed. How can I make it a more comfortable experience next time?",09Apr2019,1
8,"We have been moving around my furniture lately so now I am putting my room back together, and I had about 40 plushies in a bean bag chair (all 6-8"" Pokemon ones except one) and the water splashed everywhere and accumulated at the bottom of the beanbag chair.

Most of them did not soaked. But most of them did get really wet in one or two places and since I live in humid Florida, mold is easy to grow. I would put them outside but it is dark already.

I care about them too much to put them in the dryer, also.

What should I do?

Also, how legitimate of a concern is mold for these? They did not get super wet overall but like I said certain spots were much much worse than others. These are one of the few things that I am not willing to get rid of (I am not overall a sentimental person) so I really, REALLY don't want them to get moldy.

11,"I feel like nobody supports me.
For context, I’m young with diagnosed depression and anxiety.
I have a girlfriend of 2+ years, two married parents and a very close sister.
Let’s call the girlfriend Abigail.

I have a large friend group which I am also close with.
Recently, in a turn of events, this friend group broke up because tension one friend and my girlfriend.
My girlfriend was not happy with one of the people in our group, she thought that we may have had feelings for one another and acted angrily accordingly.
We are now two groups which I hold a relationship with, and yeah.
My parents, sister, and bestfriend all have somewhat of an unspoken grudge against Abigail. They seem to try and support me but I know deep in their hearts they aren’t very happy with her despite being able to hold the persona that they are.
The rest of my friends are somewhat similar in not being happy but do not show it, and act cordial to her.
I have another friend who I will name Mariluna.
Mariluna and I have been somewhat close for a while, and Mariluna and Abigail hate one another.
Mariluna is similar to me in having depression and anxiety and personality which is why I get along with her.
Abigail tried make amends with Mariluna while Mariluna said that she didn’t care to be friends with her and that she would continue to keep myself and Abigail separate.
I’m at a low mental state and I talked to Mariluna about respecting Abigail and she essentially said that she does respect Abigail but won’t ever try to be friendly/caring towards her because it simply isn’t worth her time. She also said if it came to choosing Abigail or her that I should go for Abigail and she wouldn’t be happy but would see why.

I love Abigail, however we have a rocky relationship. We have been through physical and emotional abuse to another and moved past that for the most part. She makes me happy most times but is also possessive and somewhat jealous to most things.
I have talked to virtually everyone mentioned in this about Abigail and to my surprise, nobody’s attitude really changed.

I caught my bestfriend messaging Mariluna about how much he hates her and it made me feel like I really have no support left for my relationship.
Should I stay with Abigail? I’m very concerned that her lack of trust and cause of trouble will cause me to be unhappy long term.
Should I leave Abigail? She is very loving and I would hurt to lose her. I can see us longterm but all these present day events are deteriorating my health.

12,"So, this is going to sound crazy. Originally, I had debated posting anything here, as everything here seemed pretty serious. But this is kind of an odd occurrence for me. I'm hoping someone else knows about this.

So, when I was in elementary school, we had to go to library a couple times a week. For a few months, we read a book. The book was about a young boy who's father was in a refuge of some sort. The boy had been taught chess from a very young age, and was exceptionally good at it. The boy was later hired to operate the chess-playing automaton, the Turk, to raise money for his father.

I've looked around for this book, making searches for specific plot points. But I couldn't find any information on this book. Even searching for books with the Turk in it came up with nothing. At first, I thought this had never happened and was just a dream. But I know for a fact I read this book. 

Some plot points included:
- The boy meets Edgar Allan Poe
- The boy meets a girl in a chess shop
- The boy couldn't tell anyone he operated the Turk
- He had to sleep in a dusty room with nothing but a bench and the Turk itself
- At one point, during a performance, someone yelled ""Fire!"" in an attempt to reveal the secret that the Turk was not fully automated
- A streetcar scene with the girl and boy falling in love

If anyone has heard of this book, please tell me. Again, sorry for the odd request. I'm almost 100% certain this existed.

Cheers!",09Apr2019,2
13,"Hello, the title pretty much sums it up. But to elaborate, anxiety runs in my moms side of the family. My grandma dealt with severe anxiety, ptsd, and depression. My mom and her brother both deal with anxiety, and it looks like I’ve started developing symptoms for it as well. I’ve always been mostly laid back, but when i get stressed out, it can get pretty bad. Lately, within the last few years, it’s gotten worse. Im worried about most everything 24/7, and I feel like it’s causing me to lose control of my life. My mom has suggested multiple times that I consider getting on some anti anxiety medication, I always kind of brushed her off cause I didn’t think I needed it, but I’m about to start something that will probably stress me out a lot, so I’m making an appointment to talk to a doctor about it. ANYWAY, sorry for the rambling, I just wanted to get some insight/advice from people who are currently or have taken anti anxiety medications and what, if any, the more severe side effects were?

14,"My parents have had a very good relationship for as long as I can remember. Recently though, I noticed they started to argue about more and more, mostly relating to my mom's business and the baby. I kinda saw this coming too and I know it's not my fault nor can I do anything about it. 


I just want to know... *why*? I mean, they have had to move away from each other in the past, but it was only for a few months and definitely wasn't close to a divorce. Both parents have been acting on edge lately, this on top of having so much schoolwork I need to do has put a bunch of stress on me as well.

And what's to come of my mom? My dad makes more money than her even though she runs her own business. So I'm not sure if she'll have to close it or not. I'm not entirely familiar with how a divorce works or what exactly happens. I just would like someone to explain to me what should come in my near future and if you think it will turn out ok.

15,"I feel like nothing anyone says to defend them can be justified. When you speak to them they cringe, they dont even act like real fucking people! They are cardboard cutouts! Every woman i see I get the urge to hurt. If I make eye contact with a femoids scumbag she cringes. They dont look at me like a human. They look at me like a sub human. Relationships with them are impossible because they refuse to speak when spoken to (they feel to entitled). The female vagina doesnt feel pleasure like a male penis does. Therefore women dont get pleasure from sex and don't seek sexual comfort or sex with men. What do they seek from men? I dont think women are capable of love either. They treat anyone who is at all unattractive as a fucking monster (like if u have a big nose or a freckle women will fucking freak out). How the fuck do people like women?

16,"So I've sat on this for a minute and am not sure how to feel or proceed. I have a group of friends that recently decided they wanted to open a ""channel of communication"" between all of us. However, they came to my house to talk about this and it turned into each one of them pointing out my flaws, yelling crying, bringing up mistakes I made 3 or more years in the past, and never really giving clear examples of the things that hurt them just telling me how shit I am and saying how it's an open line of communication ( I was the only target for all 6 people). They took their turns telling me and just me how awful I was/am as I sat quietly listening  and talking their feelings into account. When I started to talk about my feelings they were meet with hostility and violent words instead of the open mind I gave them. 

This situation was gaslight by one person who is annoyed with me and wanted to make everyone else equaly as annoyed. I know this because another friend of this group admitted that's what it appeared to be. He said he had no issue with me but that two of the friends kept telling him things about me to try to make him upset with me, he said it worked until he honestly thought about it and realized how wrong it all was. My issue is that I did really love these people and they broke me down and destroyed my trust, but they want and expect me to act like everything is normal and that it was a good thing. When in reality the situation was very wrong. These are long term friends that will be very hard to let go of, but I'm starting to think it's worth letting them go if they are willing to turn on me so easily and tear me down like it was no problem. Only one out of six of these friends has made an effort to speak to me in the two weeks since this happened. They all say they love me and want me around but I doubt it now more than ever. I don't think these friendship are repairable. Am I wrong in thinking this?",09Apr2019,2
17,"hi so i’ve never used reddit before, i made an account only to ask for some advice.  :)

     so a few days ago my mom was going out for a cigarette (or so i thought) and i was talking to her as she was walking out of the door, and she says to me “don’t follow me outside okay?” and i didn’t think much of it because she obviously doesn’t want me inhaling smoke. i got my brother something to eat and my mom came back inside, then i smelled weed. my brother says “what’s that smell?” and i told him “i’m not sure” (he’s pretty young so i didn’t want to tell him). after that, i was mad, upset, and disappointed in her. then i started thinking maybe i’m stressing her out and maybe it’s my fault? but i still felt so frustrated with her. 

     today it was raining, and my mom came home from work so she went into the basement and i went to go say hello and ask her how work was. then she rushed me back upstairs telling me not to come into the basement, i thought to myself “she’s smoking weed down here isn’t she?”. without thinking, i said to her “i already know that you smoke”. thinking back on it now i feel bad for saying that but i’m upset, i don’t think anybody would want their mother smoking. 

     now i’m not sure what to do, like should i talk to her about it? keep it to myself so i don’t upset her? and how should i feel? she’s always told me not to smoke or drink but here she is. i’m mad at her for keeping it to herself and trying to hide it so desperately. now that i know i’m confused and not sure how to feel or do. thank you so much for reading by the way!",09Apr2019,1

19,"Sorry for the mammoth post. 

I don’t have any friends anymore. I used to, but now I have no one. I never had a big circle in the first place (I have trust issues), so we’re only talking about 3 people here.

I used to run a small nonprofit and that’s where the majority of these issues started. I had friends that joined the nonprofit and then things went south.

The first person I walked away from stabbed me in the back, and admitted later that he did so. He left the group in a giant huff. He later apologized for his actions. We were still friendly and I was seriously considering letting it be water under the bridge, but then my 12 year-old, sick Rottweiler passed. Hugely traumatic. He knew about her passing, but said nothing. Not even a text. That was it for me. I ghosted him, which I will admit is not the most mature thing to do. I was hurt and I wanted to hurt him back.

Things continued to worsen in the nonprofit. I was always the one to do 99.9% of the work, and it was getting to me. I told the group we needed to take a six month break to decide if this was something we all wanted to keep doing. I intentionally let the six month mark pass to see if anyone would speak up. They hadn’t during the break, and I wasn’t going to babysit them and remind them the six months was up.

During that six months my best friend of 16 years, who was the vice president of the nonprofit, started calling me less and less. He wouldn’t answer when I’d call him. The only time I heard from him was when he wanted to complain about his girlfriend and for me to agree with him. I stopped agreeing and enabling him and I called him out on things. He stopped communicating all together. 

When I told the group we were disbanding because I was tired of doing all the work and it was clear they really didn’t care that much either because it had been over a month since the six month deadline and nobody said a word. 

That left me friendless. I thought I had started a friendship with a guy I worked with. He had some financial issues that resulted in him losing a side business. He had asked my advice on these issues, and I willingly gave it. At one point he said I was manipulating him (no idea where that came from), and he stopped communicating.

Finally, I can feel a blow-up brewing with my in-laws. My wife’s father is über conservative and always wants to discuss (scream at you) politics. This one I can mostly handle, but he’s been going way off the rails lately. 

The real issue is my wife’s step-father. I do social media marketing, web design and maintenance, etc. He owns a small business and thinks I charge too much for my services (my other clients don’t agree). He recently told me he wanted me to maintain his website. I sent him my standard contract for the amount of work he wanted (which was a lot). He proceeded to laugh at me and tell me he would not be using my services and that I’m not worth even a quarter of what I charge.

So, is it me? I get you’re only getting one side here, but I’m trying to be as honest as possible. Am I just a giant asshole, or is this just something odd that’s happening in relative succession?",09Apr2019,1

23,"I’ve been in the theater program at my school all four years. I’m a senior now. (18F) Over the years of being in the program, I grew very close to my theater director (48M). He saw true potential in me and helped me expand my theater career. He gave me free passes out of class when I wanted it. Because he had a daughter who was close to my age, he took me on vacations with his family who I was also very close with. I felt entirely safe with him. However, my senior year, things started to change. 

Rather than referring to me as his favorite student, he began calling me his friend. He would text me often, sometimes about school related things, but usually about personal things. He began treating me like less of a student and more of an adult. Less of a child, more of an interest. He’d casually bring up adult topics in conversation, he would get frustrated when I didn’t reply to his messages, and he would STRESS that he was “always there for me no matter what.” Things progressively got more and more fishy. For example, he would comment more on my body. He would compliment me more. He would ask too many questions about what I did in my personal life. And the final straw was when he rubbed my thigh in the car on the way back from a theater conference. I finally told my parents about it all and sobbed for hours while finally getting all the pent up tension I had been through out. My parents were outraged. They had a bad feeling about him from the start, but they trusted MY trust in him.

My parents went to the school principal about it, which eventually led to me missing school to talk to a police detective. It was very painful to rehash all the details of everything that happened all over again. And I always got the same questions. “Did he sexually assault you.” No, but he rubbed my thigh. “Did he ever say he wanted a romantic relationship with you?” No, but it was implied through the way he would talk to me and about me. Every question they had, I had to follow up with a no, but. Every thing had an exception. And those exceptions were just enough for him to keep his job and for no charges to be pressed. 

I don’t WANT his life to be ruined. I don’t WANT him to lose his job or mess up his family. I’ve almost graduated and I’ll never see him again. I’ve gone to therapy for two months now and tried to cope with it. I’ve gotten over the trauma of it but I still feel anger. I’ve talked about it over and over and worn out the subject.

Each of us gets our own room in the house thankfully but I got stuck with the small room since no one else really wanted to step up and take the room.

A price reduction doesn’t do much for me even though they’ve given me one since I’m lucky enough that my parents are paying for my housing next year. My problem is that I did most of not all the work for this house whether it was through contacting the landlord to rent, being the primary contact, reviewing the contracts and making changes to them. I know that someone had to get the room and while yeah I’m salty that I got it I get that someone had to. They said that I could be given something for taking it, such as having the basement as my area for storage. The problem is that I don’t have enough stuff to utilize storage and don’t see any use that I could use the basement for to make it my area.

I know what some already may be thinking; “high school is the easiest part of your life”; “you have it so easy”. You guys are right, but for the last year and a half now, it seems like everything I do just drains the actual life out of me.

I’ve tried sleeping pills, they don’t work. I try to go to bed early, I just sit staring at the dark ceiling for hours. I always wake up about 10 minutes before I have to leave and am very tired. I have 4 F’s in my classes right now, but it feels to me like I have been giving it my all. I’ve talked to my teachers, and according to them I’ve just been doing sub-par work. I look around at all my classmates who have 4.0s and seem totally fine. I’ve always wondered why I’m different and if there’s something wrong with me, but at this period in time I address that question in all seriousness. I don’t even know why I’m posting this, I just know I need help. I feel spent. Whether it belongs on r/murderedbywords or r/toastme, let me have it 👇🏻",09Apr2019,2
28,"Our revenue is down this year, and they announced today that there will be “reduction in force” or “cost balancing.” So....layoffs. They are starting with early retirement offers. Then overhead positions, and then people like myself. 

Naturally myself and everyone in my office is terribly nervous. It’s just overtaken all my thoughts and I am so worried about getting laid off and entering a period of extended unemployment. They said they want to be done with it all by the end of the month, but even then it’s like you have to show up and put on a happy face until whatever decisions to be made are made. 

I don’t know. I’m just paralyzed with worry right now. 

To compound this all, I am 31 and literally just moved back to the USA after working abroad for the same company for all of 2018. Staying at my parents until I find a place. How the fuck am I going to get an apartment if I am unemployed? I’m going to be an unemployed 31 year old man in my parents basement. 

This is a bit more rant, but: the same day they announce there will be layoffs, our fucking Division President, THE man who will be deciding who stays and who goes, decides he wants there to be a potluck for his birthday this week. How oblivious can one be? You’re deciding the fate of people’s employment this week, and want there to be a party FOR YOU?",09Apr2019,1

They constantly make fun of my skin color since I'm a bit yellow because of my ethnicity, which is Korean-American.

34,"I've been struggling to find a job this past few months. No place was hiring around my area and would only call me for an interview but never get any calls afterward. Now I have a friend who said he can get me in where he works (fast food) but the thing is, that place is an hour away from my place and I would drive there if I had my license but I only have my learners. I told him that I'll consider it but until then I'd want to get a job near my place.

Anyways, about a month and a half ago, I was getting desperate. I asked my friend if he can still hook me up at his job. And in no time I got a call for an interview and I got in. I've handed my SIN, and my bank deposit. They told me they'll call me in for my shift. A month has passed and I haven't heard anything from them. So, I applied for this coffee shop that's only 20 mins away from my place then I got a call for an interview and was accepted asap due to them requiring people. 

Now my problem. Today I got a call from that other place I my friend recommended me at and was asked if I can start working tomorrow. I don't know how to tell my friend and the manager that I don't wanna work there anymore because the bus it takes me to get there is an hour long and it also takes me the same time to get home.

37,"A few friends from work are planning on moving in together this coming summer. One of these friends has also operated as my plug for the past year. I live in an illegal state. 

Under normal circumstances, the answer is obvious, **FUCK NO**. But my circumstances aren't normal. I currently live in an area which many would deem a 'total shithole'. Building in horrible disrepair with black mold in some areas, deadbeat super, high crime rate area, with roommates that live extremely unhealthy lifestyles (morbid obesity and alcoholism) which they have begun to pull me into. 

This new place, however is a couple of towns over in a much nicer are with one of the lowest crime rates in the state. The location will be down the street from work. My new roommates are quite honestly the nicest and most trustworthy people I have ever met, and as a person who hasn't had many close friends and struggled with chronic depression and borderline personality disorder for most of my life, I feel like I deserve to surround myself with people who lift me up like these people do. At this point in my life (early 20s) I can't afford to move out on my own, and this might be my only chance to get out of this dump for the next few years, and I honestly don't know if I'll make it that long.

Any advice?",09Apr2019,2
38,"I’ve been friends with my best friend  since elementary school (we’re now in high school I don’t want to specify anymore) she’s always been kinda emo and I’ve been fairly “girly” as some would call it. Her style is drastically different than mine and I’ve always been fine with it. In the start of the new school year she got a girl friend and came out as bi. I never saw her dating another girl. I’ve know her since like 4th grade and she’s always crushed on guys never showed any sign on liking girls. She quickly ended her relationship and got a new girlfriend.

I’ve never met this new girlfriend so I was a bit shocked. (I’m getting sick of saying best friend so let’s call her A) 
A told us how she was always in love with this person and how she was jealous of her ex. I’ve never even seen her acknowledge this person before. 
They started dating and yet again it ended quickly. After the breakup she informed us she enrolled to go to the same school as this person ( our school has this system where you can take classes at another close school/college to take classes out hs can’t offer like criminal justice, culinary,teaching classes) I asked her if she did it just because of her girlfriend and she said no and that she’s always wanted to take this type of class at this school. A is a very socially awkward person and this is something she would NEVER DO. 

The last straw for me was today when she informed me she’s cutting her hair short and came out as bisexual-ace. I have no idea what that means but I feel like I’m drifting away from my friend. This may sound extremely petty and I want to confront someone about this but I’m scared someone will tell her. I feel awful but I hope coming to terms with my feelings can guide me in the right direction. My mom told me it might be time to break things off with my friend but I can’t do it. I’m completely helpless  if you read this thanks I don’t care if I don’t get a response it just feels nice to get this off my chest 🙂",09Apr2019,1
40,"So I dated this girl for about a year and a half, and long story short, our breakup was ugly. I’ve tried talking to her to get on better terms (I don’t want her back), but she’s always rude so I’ve given up on that. 

She’s a senior this year, and I’m a junior.

We go to a pretty small school so it’s really hard to just avoid each other. I always seem to get dirty looks from her and her new boyfriend (who’s also unnecessarily rude to me). I have been looking forward to their graduation, so I can just get away from them. 

But here’s where it gets fun.

I’ve been pretty set on one university for a while now, it’s in a great part of my state, where I can have a great college experience and get a good education, without being too far from home. It seems pretty ideal.

Guess who announces they’re going to that school? You guessed it, my petty ex girlfriend and her boyfriend. Ugh.

So I’ve got some time to decide what I want to do because I’m still a junior. Do I spend my senior year as time to forget about them and go to the school? Or do I find a different school just to let the stress away.

Happy to hear any advice here. Thanks.",09Apr2019,1
41,"I’m (29F) having a hard time the past few years because I can’t say I have any best friends. No one ever texts me to just see how I’m doing. No one ever asks me to hang out on the weekend. I reach out but nothing builds. Ironically, I’ve been recognized over and over as an incredible conversationalist, a warm welcoming person, and someone with a high emotional intelligence. I’ve made a career out of communication, marketing, and storytelling, so people are my field of work. But I have a deep sadness because I don’t have anyone to hang out with or lean on - last time I did was in high school. 

Does anyone else struggle with this or know how to remedy this? Also, I seem to romantically connect no problem, but friendships are much more difficult. It’s a hole in my life, and I don’t have any siblings (I do but they are literally 15-20 years younger).

44,"Recently. Over the last couple of years, I have come to realise that I don't wholly agree with everything my parents do/their opinions, which I realise is perfectly normal because we're different entities. 

However sometimes I feel some sort of resentment(?) towards my mom at times and it just manifests out of nowhere when we're chatting or something. I might get too sensitive or read too much into some things. 

Now the thing is, I'm 100% sure my mom put her best foot forth while raising me and tried her best and I really appreciate it. I understand that she's human and humans aren't perfect and she did a pretty good job raising me. 


I personally am naturally sensitive and not very good at expressing my emotions so over the years, there might've been things that I just kept to myself instead of complaining. But it's really all past now...

I don't know how to deal with these feelings that come up sometimes. Do I just let them pass? Has anyone else felt this way?",09Apr2019,4
45,"Okay, I’m a high school student [F16] and I’ve been having hygiene problems for a while now. Randomly I’ll just start smelling bad... it’s horrible!! 

I first thought it was my clothes so I began washing my clothes regularly and barely wore clothes two times before washing them again. 

I thought this was a mind trick my brain was doing but I can see people move away from me or sniff really uncomfortably. I sat in a bath with soap, a bath bomb, and bubble bar, then showered and washed my hair. the next day, I can see the girl beside me shift away and ask if something smells weird. This other girl was talking to me and I guess I decided to just SMELL because she literally coughed and didn’t finish her sentence and turned away. 

There’s this guy in my history who is very kind and has been my only friend in that class. Sometimes we watch videos or I show him my work on my laptop and joke around. He gets close (to obviously look at my screen) and I know it’s normal distance but all I can think of is if I start to smell what is he going to think of me? 

I’m pretty sure it’s happening down there because I shower regularly and clean my clothes every week. I apply deodorant, perfume, make sure my bed sheets don’t smell before I sleep, EVERYTHING AND ANYTHING to make sure I smell good. 10 minutes later and BOOM everyone can smell me?? Why is this a thing?? What am I doing wrong??

46,"Here is some lengthy background, it may be boring but I feel like it is needed to explain my reasoning.

I recently just got rejected into the two colleges I had dreamed of going to since I was in 4th grade. I knew this was going to happen, hence, I only applied to two. 

I have always been in the rigorous classes been the president of important clubs in high school and was varsity captain for two sports. Before even applications had begun I knew my GPA was not good enough at all. The course load I took was very difficult on top of that I had two sports and a club sport to attend to thus, my GPA plummeted. 

I know this sounds like I'm giving excuses for my own lack of effort or intelligence, however, I always prided on myself for having a social life along with these classes. This obviously did not work.

 I am now going to community college for two years and will hopefully transfer to my dream institution. Although this decision enough completely tore my self-esteem (I know first-world problem but to each their own) I am now going to be enrolled this fall. 

 I have always been a very social person, I love talking to people. Being around random people or anyone for that matter makes me happy I just enjoy making friendships. Thus, here is my need for advice. At community college, I want to completely end my social life. I am just so frustrated at myself and want to concentrate and myself. I don't want to make friends, I don't want to be partners with anyone in the class, and I definitely don't want to make new friends. I am on the purpose of wanting to become anti-social. I feel if I don't do something drastic like this for my own benefit I will never grow as a person. My dreams are large and hanging out with friends and giving mediocre effort is not going to get me there, so cutting out these ""distractions"" I feel will benefit me.

So, is this a good way to approach my goals? Thank you for anyone who read this any advice helps.",09Apr2019,1
48,"This is long.

Backstory for context: My father died of cancer ten years ago. He and my mother were married for nearly 30 years and seemed to be (and both claimed to be) very happily married. They had rough times, like all married couples, and had sought counseling at one point, but were always very loving toward one another. When my father got his diagnosis, my mom took a year off of work (all paid because she had a great job) to take him to treatments and aid when hospice finally set up in our house. I was attending college a little over an hour’s drive away at the time, but my father requested that I stay in school rather than take off to be by his side, so instead I came home nearly every weekend. His death was hard for all of us, and my mom was hard to be around afterwards. She and I had butted heads a lot, and so had my dad and I, but my dad and I always seemed to be able to talk about things and laugh it off while my mom would get defensive, sullen, and sometimes vicious. A couple of years after my dad passed, my mom began to date a coworker and they ended up getting very serious. I was happy for her because this new beau was clearly head-over-heels for her and a very nice man. They moved in together, which was hard for me since they began to share what had been my parents’ home together, and everything related to my dad was taken down - all of his photos and photos of his family, as well as anything that was a reminder of him. I understood, but it still made his passing even harder for me. I also did not get along too well with her new husband - our personalities just really clashed and he had some habits that were major pet peeves of mine, like being rude to waitstaff - so I moved a couple thousand miles away at that point in order to try to restart my life (depression had really done a number on me and I gave up on college). My mom married this new man about five years after my dad’s passing, the day after what used to be my dad’s birthday. I still sang at their wedding and gave them my blessing, especially since my mom seemed very happy. Sadly, my mom’s new husband also ended up with cancer, different from my dad’s, and he ended up passing away last July. My heart aches for my mom, who has suffered so much loss. She is clearly depressed and not taking the loss of her most recent husband well at all; in fact, much worse than my father’s death. I moved back to try to help her with things and also because I am married with a child now and want my son to be near my family.

The problem: After my mom’s last husband died, she started to say negative things about my dad, which I thought probably stemmed from a place of grief. Things like, “Your father’s death was never as hard as this.” Like I said, I can understand that this was just her expressing her grief, but I wished she would tell someone else, not me. My father’s death devastated me, so it hurts to hear that she now looks back on it as easier to bear than other deaths. I never said anything, just let her grieve. Well, now she has taken to just saying bad things about my dad in general, not in reference to grief or death, while also casting her most recent husband in an angelic light. Comments like, “Your dad always loved to talk, *and talk, and talk*” said in a mean tone with a sigh and an eye roll, while saying that her most recent husband was “the light of her life.” Again, it is fine for her to feel that way, but it feels like an inappropriate thing to say to me. She has also been doing odd things like trying to twist my memories into bad ones of my father, or leaving him out of memories entirely. For example, we were trying to have a conversation about my struggles as a young adult and I said that it had been hard for me to grow up under so much pressure. She said, “You mean from your father? The way he always pushed you into things you didn’t want to do?” and I said, “No, from both of you.” She got very defensive and would not allow me to state my feelings at all unless I was only critical of my dad, which I refused to do. Earlier she tried to tell me about what it was like to drop me off at preschool and how I cried because she said I wanted to be with her all day, except that my dad was the one to take me to preschool and I have fond memories of the stories he used to tell and little games we would play on the way there. It’s like she thinks I won’t remember these details of my life and is now trying to paint a new picture for me with my dad as an absent or emotionally abusive father, which he absolutely was not. 

If it matters, my mom was married once before my dad, and refused to ever speak of it. I found out by accident, and all my mom would say was “It was the worst thing that ever happened to me!” before storming off in tears. I never asked about it again. A relative secretly told me that my mom had had an affair with my dad and that was how her first marriage ended, which fits with the theme that is emerging here: hating the last husband while worshipping the most recent husband.

So, now I don’t know what to do. I try to just grey rock the hell out of my mom or change the subject if my dad ever comes up. I am also working to get further away from her again. Still, I hate that she basically lies about my dad, and for what cause? Why does she need to do this, and now, of all times? It is like her newest marriage changed her whole perception about the hardworking, devoted, loving man I knew my father to be. Maybe she needed to do that in order to love her new husband? But, again, why? And why did I have to be robbed of my happy memories and photographs and family home because my mom wanted to hide my father away? How do I respect her most recent opinions while also holding on to my cherished memories of my dad? Everywhere I turn are photos of her most recent husband and his family. She keeps in touch with his relatives and has practically forgotten about my dad’s family, who has reached out to her over and over throughout the years. I feel like I have to keep my positive feelings for my dad a secret when I am around my mom. Talking with my half-brother and half-sister (from my dad’s first marriage) helps, so I plan to try to spend more time with them to keep my dad’s memory alive. My brother says my dad was his hero.

She has late stage lung cancer with estimated weeks to live and still smokes like a train regardless. She’s very stubborn and outspoken and has an argumentative personality, and she isn’t very good at expressing love or pride. I moved out when I was 18 for those reasons, but decided to give it my best shot. 

I love her but I can’t stand the woman 95% of the time, and I can’t help harbouring intense hate towards her for just my entire life in general.

I want comfort, I want apologies, and lately that’s been exploding out of me in uncontrollable bouts of rage where I scream at her until she goes back to bed.

I grew up in an extremely strict household and my parents always had a grip on me. I luckily have been able to stay in my own apartment away from them but they still have a strong hold on me. My parents are moving out of state and want me to go with them to save money. I personally do not want to move with them because when I stay with them for more than 3 days I get incredibly anxious and ready to go back to my own apartment already. They also are very traditional and think that you should only move in with a boyfriend if you are engaged. I am way too young to be engaged but I have practically been living with my boyfriend for the last 3 years as we stay at each other’s apartment’s every night and know that we would work well living together.

52,"Hey just a little backstory before, it’s relevant I promise. 

So I’m currently 19, around 2 years ago I ran away from home (the U.K) because of family problems and I moved to Sweden, 
I was experimenting with a lot of drugs at the time to cope with family loss and I can honestly say that I was curious about trying them and I was in a really bad place because of it. 
It got to the point I was sleeping with random guys for drugs and I don’t even remember that point in my life, I had no friends I had nobody and I was very very careless with my life.
I got pregnant and I was still very much using drugs, I hate myself every single day for it, 
I got admitted to a rehab centre while I was pregnant, I don’t even remember any of this that’s how fucked up I was, you would not believe my utter shock and disgust when I sobered up in that centre,

From my records, I was pregnant for about a month when I was admitted and I was in there around 8 months and I had my baby in there, she got put into care and I never got to hold her.  
I didn’t want to at the time I was heartbroken with many things and I hated the fact I did this to myself, like it was a reminder that I didn’t remember what horrible things I was doing in those 6 months of taking bad stuff.
Anyway, fast forward a year I’m out now. I’m healthy, I’m in an apartment with my friend who is helping me out big time with mental health and such, I’m very much stable in life I still have a ways to go but it’s on the right path, and I’m so lucky to have a friend who has helped me, and saw past all my mistakes. 
-

Now here’s my big worry, 

My friend is out of town for the whole month, so he can’t help me with this,
I applied to see and meet my daughter a while ago and it got accepted, I had almost forgotten about it and I got a letter. 
And now I’m meeting her tomorrow for the first time, I’ve never seen her I’ve never touched her or held her. 
I’m so scared, 
I’m sat up in my bed literally chewing my nails to the bone, I’m going to be judged by everybody there. They all know my background and why she’s in care, I’m 19 and I don’t even know who her father is, I’m so ashamed of myself for everything I’ve done and I have all of these thoughts running through my head. 
I wish I could just turn back time and never have done any of the bad shit that I’ve done. Ugghhh
I want to be there for her now, I cry everyday because I know I cant change my past or what I’ve done but I can try to make situations better, and I know if I don’t try then her life is going to be messed up because of me. She’ll grow up in foster care or have health problems and it’s all my fault. 
She’s 1 and a little bit years old currently.

53,"I have been dealing with pretty bad anxiety my whole life. It has fucked up a lot of things for me but ultimately it has also left me pretty depressed a lot. There are a lot of times I have felt alone in college and will feel lonely again, and for the most part I have stayed quiet about it to my family because they don't react well.

I want to say first, my family is wonderful and loving and have been nothing but good to me my entire childhood. However, they have issues when it comes to dealing with emotions or situations they can't immediately fix. I also know that both of my parents have been through medical issues in the last 2 years and that has left them on edge, which is another reason I try not to tell them when I'm feeling upset.

However, when I do try to talk to them they put me in a situation I can't win.

i was home for a weekend recently and came to my mom crying one night because my anxiety had gotten the best of me and I just wanted to hug my mom as lame as that was. She was nice about it for 2 minutes before she started to get annoyed. she asked me what was wrong and when I told her my anxiety was bad she started to get upset with me and told me I need to work this out on my own. I told her I just wanted a hug and she told me if I just wanted a hug I should have said that before coming in the room and waited until I was finished crying to get a hug.

My dad then saw me and started to get upset because I was crying. He started to scream at me which made me cry harder. He started to repeat the things my parents always say when I'm upset about how they try to give me everything and I'm still sad and how they failed as parents and maybe they gave me too much and that's why I don't appreciate anything. Honestly just a huge guilt trip to make me feel even worse about my anxiety and about how fucked up and how badly I've failed as a person lol.

The worst part is that they constantly contradict each other. That same night my mom yelled at me for never telling them anything, but when I did they start to scream at me for it. My mom also constantly compares me to her childhood. She'll tell me things like, ""yeah being upset over that is bad, imagine having your sister try to stab you as a kid."" I'm not in anyway saying that my mom didn't go through trauma, she obviously did, but she always makes situations where I try to open up be about her. She hasn't ever gone to therapy about her issues and its clear especially by the way she started to treat me after I turned 18.

One time I didn't clean the house well enough for her and when she came home she started to call me a lot of really nasty names. I basically just avoided her for the rest of the day and apparently that upset her so much she barred me in the kitchen and held a knife against her wrist while she yelled ""why don't you just cut me, because you want to hurt me this much.""

Basically, all these things together have made it really hard to talk to my family, even calmly, because no matter which way I word or try to express myself they take it wrong and to the extreme.

How can I combat this and try to talk to them about it? I don't want to cut them off emotionally completely because that would still make them just as upset. I'm working to deal with my emotions by myself and with professional help but how do I navigate the family aspect of all this?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: family unable to handle my anxiety/sadness and use anger/ guilt against me, how do I talk to them in a way whee they won't overreact?",09Apr2019,1
54,"Possibly a dumb thing to ask for advice on, but either way I’d like some. Starting in elementary school I’ve always had ambition to be an artist. I would draw, sketch, get my pictures displayed in art shows, that kind of stuff. In middle school I began getting interested in animation and fell in love with pursuing a career working with other animators. I fell off the loop my freshman year of high school and shifted my focus towards my academics out of fear that I wouldn’t get into a good college. I have a 6.687/6.0 GPA and I’ve set myself on a path to start pre-med within college, but thinking about it makes me feel unsure. I jump from career to career constantly, thinking they’re all beyond amazing and interesting, but I’m never sure. When I think about pursing a career as an animator I feel sure about everything, minus the fact that it’s such a hard career to obtain and my family thinks I’m going to be the first to go to college and achieve a high-level degree. This sounds so dumb when I type this out but I’m absolutely stumped. Should I try or stay on a pre-med track that I’ve been preparing for?",09Apr2019,1

60,"First post and sorry in advance it’s kinda long!
TL;DR at the bottom

I did good in high school and went off to college with a good in state scholarship that covered my tuition and got an additional scholarship from the college I went to. I started the fall semester after I graduated but quickly fell into a very depressive state that led me to really stop even going to class and so I ended up failing all of my classes. I regret this so much, and I know I was so irresponsible to do this, but the damage is done now. I came back home for the spring and I am currently not taking any classes. I have a job and can stay kinda busy and honestly I barely ever miss my college or even the friends I made because I associate it with such bad feelings. But now I am trying to decide what I want to do next because I do want to be successful and independent. My parents are very supportive and I feel so bad about the whole situation because I know it was very unexpected and a huge disappointment to them. There’s a technical college in my home town that I could get back started with, but honestly I’m scared I won’t be able to get into any college anymore and the rejection would really be devastating. I just know I want to do something where I can grow as a person and become more independent where my parents will not have to worry about me as much. I feel very lost and hopeless and I was wondering if anyone had any advice or if they went through anything similar. 

TL;DR: I flunked college and I feel like there’s nothing left for me to do with my life.",09Apr2019,1
61,"I am an adult now but when I was a freshman at 14, I was 6' tall and had a deep voice. I looked like I was 18 at least. I met one older girl because she eavesdropped into my conversations and then laughed loudly at a joke she clearly heard me make then asked me to repeat it to her, then after I talked to her, her and her friend wait after class for me so she can pop out and say boo and smile at me and she got in my face to do so. Then she began laughing at dumb stuff I say to other people, butting into my conversations, responding to me or asking me to repeat stuff to her. She couldn't look me in the eyes and say hi first. At first, her friend girl 2 didn't talk to me and she just pushed me to the first one. While talking to me 1 would get red and make no eye contact, hide her face and didn't stand still. She blushed and smiled when I say hi first. Then her friend asked me to be around them and she was embarrassed and had an attitude but 1 wanted me as close as possible to her and talked to me as much as possible. She scared me after I talked to her and she got my attention. Then she had her friend come and get me for a selfie when she dressed up and wore something showing cleavage. 1 asked for a picture with me when I talked to her and for me to get close to her. She found any way she could to compliment me and approached me with her friend next to her. They both laughed at everything found any excuse to be around me and talk. 2 offered me a ride when it wasn't necessary. Theyd both give me no space smile and make eye contact. Laugh at dumb stuff I said. Theyd get in my face trying to talk to me then follow me around. Find any excuse to be around me and as close as possible. Compliment me a lot. Theyd talk in a tone with me or talk in a higher pitched voice. Theyd giggle and say my name or say ""youve been really innappropriate recently"" when I did something bad. Theyd defend me and instantly believe anything I told them like a guy was saying stupid stuff about us and one of them told on him. One of them would be like ""Hey u can walk with us, sit with us"" hey we can do this.

62,"I had met a guy a over a year ago, when we met we were at the lowest point in our lives. We bonded over that. We fell out then reconnected six months later, in all that time he had never been to my home (I stay with my mother) but got a job being a team lead for a group home. The group home is literally across the street from my house.

You read that right. He ended up working full time 200 steps away from me. The day we found out it creeped me out tbh, the reason for this is because even though I liked him, his victim mentality mixed with having 4 children by 3 different women (I have none) I never saw myself as actually being anything more than friends.

I knew it would be a problem but just enjoyed the ride. It was great at first, because I’m 25 I’m not really that experienced with men and with him being a friend I thought he would help me get more experience being with someone.

He was confusing with his behavior, he would offer to buy me expensive laptops, stereos and tried to give me the key to his apartment......things uncomfortable because we weren’t in a relationship. I did things for him, little things like leaving drinks or food on the hood of his car for him to find, gave him a ride when his car broke down.....but nothing that grandiose. He got a present for his birthday and Christmas, nothing costing over more than $20

I tried to tell him that I wouldn’t take something that big, that he could give me something small, but would mean more to me, he would act hurt and then just do nothing at all. It’s like he didn’t hear me.

I gave up on him not because of his personal drama or background. I gave up because even though he was 200 ft away from me he chose to sit across the street and let his sugar levels drop so low that he almost had an episode (he’s a diabetic)

He knows what he has to do to maintain his condition and he called me his closest friend....but he chose to suffer like that, instead of calling me.

This same man called me one night and asked me for toilet paper.

I think he wanted out anyway towards the end he became incredibly busy, made me bleed the last time we had sex, and kept telling me if I slept with someone else while still talking to him I had his blessing. 

We stopped speaking, he is still across the street though and immediately after he began bringing another female over to the group home so now I’m alone and stuck having to see that constantly. 

The last thing I did for him was create a resume for him and fill out ten job applications, he got a job offer from one (the manager comes to my job regularly) that paid more and had weekends off. He still refuses to leave.

Why would he do this? He wanted out, was most likely already sleeping with someone else towards the end, yet won’t just leave. He’s right there so i have to constantly see that shit and it hurts too much. Why won’t he leave me alone?",09Apr2019,2

67,"So a lot has happened in the past week. But first, let me give you some background. My junior year of high school I was in an emotionally abusive relationship and once I left that, I decided that going to the local community college to take my classes for senior year was a good idea. My first semester I was there part time, but I still managed the football team and did things like powder puff. But this semester I'm at college full time, and I abandoned track and field, speech and debate, jello wrestling and beat-boxing. I figured since I wasn't able to maintain high school friendships, as I wasn't there full time, and I wasn't making college friends since I had to go back to high school, that was for the best. 

But, I was still looking forward to going to prom. I had been dating this guy long distance for almost ten months, and we decided that he was going to come out to take me. Well, after letting me spend 5 months and a few hundred dollars getting everything together, he decided to break up with me in a two minute phone call. Prom is in less than three weeks. This wouldn't have really been a problem if I hadn't spend the past ten months telling everyone at my high school that my boyfriend from South Carolina was going to come and take me to prom, and that I wasn't making him up to get back at the emotionally abusive ex.

 Now I don't even really want to go to prom anymore (I know I'd be miserable the whole time, going alone and having no friends), but every time I look at the beautiful green and gold dress hanging in my closet I feel as though I've wasted my senior year of high school. I've taken all these hard classes and I've even started helping teach math at the college, and I know this was all my choice, but I can't help feeling like I wasted the one chance I had to be a normal 18 year old. I didn't get to do anything that was a genuine passion of mine, and the one thing I was looking forward to the most was ripped away from me in the blink of an eye. 

So, how can I salvage the rest of my senior year? Or should I just give up on this one and wait until I start at a four year school next fall?",09Apr2019,1

69,"My fiance's uncle had just passed away from sickness. He and his family are mostly Christians. The funeral is held in a church. I have been dating my fiance for a year before being engaged for a few months. I have seen this uncle for a total of about 5 times, including visiting him twice in the hospice in the last few days of his life, it was usually at a big family gathering so I never had the chance to speak with him personally other than a Hi or Bye.

&amp;#x200B;

I am very thankful for his family treating me like a family, but I wonder if I had overstepped. The wake service was yesterday. Family and friends gathered in the room where the casket is and sang some Christian songs. It was my first Christian funeral (it's not the and I honestly had no idea what I was supposed to do. I googled but it seemed different. The thing that took me by surprise was, the organiser who was also the deceased's younger sister was herding everybody into the hall, and somehow herded my fiance and I to the front seat. I ended up sitting right beside the casket, and I was honestly shocked. The deceased was a divorcee with no kids but had a girlfriend.

71,"WARNING: Long story ahead

Im getting married so my soon to be wife and i had organised with a few mid-high end tailors to get suits made for myself, groomsmen and a bridesman (male bridesmaid). Pick a largely reputable brand with a dozen stores around our area.

All goes good on the initial consultation and fitting, ping pong table, beers flowing at the place where the fitting had occurred. Paid for all the suits, shirts, ties and pocket squares (upwards of $4,XXX) get told that we will come in 8 weeks later for second fitting where the suits are expected to have arrived.

This is where it gets ridiculous.

So we had organised a time of 7pm on a Friday for the fitting, get a call on that day at 5:50pm to say that the suits had not arrived yet so we will need to push the fitting to next week. Cool cool i can understand but he could of messaged me earlier (i had sent a message 3 days earlier asking for confirmation everything was fine). Call everyone, tell them its cancelled and to keep next week free for same time. 

Fast forward to next week, i call him on Thursday and he confirms the suits have arrived and we are good to go. Its Friday and we are about to Uber it to the place and i receive a message at 6:50pm (10 minutes before the fitting) that he cannot make it because his partner had just gone into labor. Fair enough i think but we have less than 4 weeks to the wedding so i call his boss and his boss says he will organize something. Says that his employee has the suits in his van which is at the hospital and he cannot get access to them so i organize with everyone to come to my place that coming Sunday at 5pm. Im very pissed off with the situation as are all my friends and i just take it easy and hope that everything goes well.

Its now 1pm on Sunday and i get a call from the boss, so apparently the suits had never been in the country and are almost completed with a expected delivery about 10 days from now and 2 weeks out form the wedding (like i dont have enough on my plate). The boss tells me he is so sorry, offers me a full refund (which i have in writing) than says he will call Monday to see if he can get the suits here faster. Tell everyone not to bother coming but slightly calmed down due to the fact that he said this isnt what the company stands for and will offer us a full refund (industry is largely word of mouth and i guess cause im younger (26) id imagine they think i could get some more people on board).

Receive email on Monday saying he has instigated the refund to my account and will get into contact with me once he determines whether the suits can get here earlier. Partner and I are content and happy with everything.

Than today i get a call from someone else from the company who explains that the boss and original worker are basically contractors and that the service they have given you is utterly disgusting. Tells me he will be taking over form here and that the suits are complete and he will call me later today on when they can be here. Problem is he said that a full refund will not be happening and that we can discuss this further re the compensation i receive.

TLDR - Purchased custom suits was fucked around and was not given transparent information on what was occurring which led to a supposed full refund which was then reversed by another person from the company.

Just wanted to get people advice on how i should go about asking for compensation in this scenario. If i have written evidence from the company saying i will be given a refund as well as the suits what should my avenues be to at least get a large portion refunded? Id be content with half of it refunded, think its a bit ridiculous to get played around for such a large sum.",09Apr2019,1

I am not very good and dealing with a lot of stressors at the same time, and I can't really seem to think straight because of this, so I need help in doing so. 

To give you a quick summary: 

I got the opportunity to do a research internship at a medical university in Japan, where I was told I would be taught skills related to epidemiological research (looking at patient data and finding patterns). 

I already found it odd that I didn't need to provide any additional documentation or sign confidentiality forms and whatnot. Now I am here, and the department I am currently at thought I was a 6-year medical student here to observe in rounds. This is not the case. 

I had asked multiple times if they needed more documentation, and they always replied no. But now that I am here, everything is a mess.

This is freaking me out to an extent, and on top of that my Japanese is not very good (which was also not supposed to be a problem, although I did try to study before I got here) , and I am still severely jetlagged, and I am sitting in a random office in Japan, where they have left me so they can sort it out.

I am unsure of what to do. I spent a lot of money to be here, but I can get a majority of it back. I am not getting any study credits for this, I was going for the experience, and was told I cannot get these credits as our universities did not have a previous relationship. Additionally, I am not here on a special VISA or anything.   

Should I go home, back to Europe? It's what I want, but it feels like giving up (although giving up is all I want to do right now).

79,"My dad is alright but I really need to escape my mother. I am human and I make little mistakes all the time, which results in my mother having a temper tantrum. Things like eating a little too much will send her into a rage and she'll start ranting about how I'm a loser and a failure, and I need to get a job. Yet, my parents don't approve of my career choice (drafting) and they both complain about it nearly every day.

I graduated high school a year early. I'm trying to get my drafting certificate right now and I'm a waitress/busser. I don't have my driver's license because my parents didn't want me on their car insurance. (Assholes.)

I think over the Summer I can get a job working at the college for $10/hr. 

I just want to leave. Hopefully I'll be able to move out when I have my drafting certificate, but I'd still need to continue college to get my degree.

I ride horses, I love it, but unfortunately my schedule is often packed so I take lessons inconsistently, but always with the same intructor. I love her! She's darling, good at her job, kind, etc. There is a waiting list of people who want to take lessons from her, she's that good.

Today I was stupid. I didn't eat and I didn't drink before my lesson, even though it was like A HUNDRED DEGREES out today! After my lesson, I got off the horse, and was walking away. Suddenly the sand on the ground became so bright I had to close my eyes and I said ""I don't feel right."" the next thing I remember is vomiting my guts out in the middle of the road. 

I fainted, and she CAUGHT me! She ran forward and caught me. She is amazing. She says I was out for about a minute, she called my parents, she called an ambulance, she sat by me and encouraged me even when I was throwing up. I told her if i looked at the vomit Id pass out again due to anxiety. This woman waited for an ambulance for 20 minutes and rode with me to the hospital. 

I feel. so. guilty.

There was a crowd of people around me (duh) and I totally ruined everyone's routines. She was on her way to the store with other lesson girls, but ran over to catch me, and didn't leave me until I was in the hospital. She probably cleaned my vomit. She probably missed her other lessons. I know for a fact I forgot to pay her for today's lesson. I feel so guilty! How in the WORLD can I ever repay this amazing woman? She kept me calm and safe. I want to bring her flowers and apologize, but... I don't know. I am so ashamed.

84,Okay so me and my girlfriends relationship was going really well until I messed something up last week and she ended up telling me that she sometimes feels like a second opinion but I really don’t mean to make her feel that way. She works over an hour away from mine and I’ve told her I will come down and stay with her when she’s working and I spend as much time as I can with her. We both are sorting it out in a reasonable way to try avoid arguments and we still say that we love each other but I’m scared she might end the relationship soon which in all honesty would probably break me but I also care more about her wellbeing than our relationship. Also whenever we’re together in person things seem normal but whenever we discuss it online things get deep and I don’t feel as much security in our relationship. I don’t know if anyone’s been in a similar situation and I’m really not sure what kind of advice is going to help but more than anything I wanted to get it off my chest.,09Apr2019,1
85,"TLDR: at bottom. 

A week ago my girlfriend broke up with me because she realized she was still in love with the man who has been abusing her for the last seven years. I was so distraught over her leaving me, but my kids were equally as hurt because the last conversation she had with them was telling them that she was happy to be in their family. My kid's mother hasn't done a very good job of raising them, so I as the father, have full custody, and my kids have no female adult role models , so they were excited to hear this woman say these things to them. 

Anyway I was so angry with her when she broke up with me via text, that I told her she burned any bridge we had and will never be welcomed in my life again. 

Just over an hour ago her mother called me to tell me she was found dead this afternoon. More than likely as a result of her current boyfriend hitting her. Her cause if death was blunt force trauma. He's being held for questioning but all signs are pointing to this man having done this to her as he was seen beating on her as recently as last night by his neighbors.

Her mother really liked me and even told me once that she wanted me to be her son in law , and since she has no grandchildren she wanted my kids as her grandchildren.  Now she's asking me to attend the funeral for her daughter which will more than likely be this Wednesday or Thursday. 

Here's the thing. I know it sounds horrible to say this, but I'm still angry at her. Angry that she hurt me. Angry that she broke her promise to me. Angry that she chose an abusive man over someone who did everything to build her up. I'm angry that it was so sudden. I'm mostly angry that she let down my children. I'm not so sure I want to go to her funeral. I don't want to be looked at as the guy who should have protected her but allowed her to go back to this guy.  Already I'm getting uncomfortable messages sent to me by her family that has my contact info. Things like ""I wish she never left you"". To be honest I don't want to hear that. I've even shut down my social media accounts to specifically avoid this. 

Am I being an A-hole for not wanting to go? I feel sick to my stomach that's she's dead, but I can't let go of the anger I have. 

TLDR: Ex gf left me for an abusive ex. She was found dead today more than likely as a result of abuse. I'm being asked to go to the funeral but I don't want to. But I'm feeling guilty that I'm not wanting to go. What should I do?",09Apr2019,0
86,"This was a mix of r/advice and r/trueoffmychest so it is rather long. TL;DR: I’m scared to leave my friends in my current career for the career of my dreams, and I think the excitement of getting into my dream school has overwhelmed me to the point of tears.

I’ve been in the Navy for two years. Last year, I started working on an application to the United States Naval Academy, the school of my dreams. I put in a lot of work for it, and everyone knew I was trying really hard for it. I spent nearly four months waiting for results, and yesterday, I was accepted. I wanted this school so badly, and I spent several nights sobbing that I didn’t think I would get in, but I wanted to so much. When I received that email yesterday about my acceptance, I was so in shock and completely happy to the point that I forgot how to function like a basic human being. Everyone was congratulating me and shaking my hand, because nearly everyone on base knew I was working for it. The number one question I’d get from someone walking by everyday was “were you accepted to USNA yet?” And the answer was always “no results yet!” I had the greatest day of my life yesterday, imagining that I had merely enlisted into the Navy two years ago, and all the people in my hometown thought I was a waste for it. They thought I was throwing away my intelligence for an enlistment instead of a degree. This enlistment got me in to an insanely selective school that I could’ve only dreamed about for so long. 

So I decided to read up on the information packet for USNA. And instead of happiness, I started to feel regret. Not because of the work load coming up, but that it read a *lot* like my enlistment information. It said things along the lines of “this will be physically and academically demanding” and “there is a curfew every night in the barracks” and things like that. That reminded me so much of when I first enlisted. I was excited then for all of this because I didn’t know what to expect. And now, I still don’t entirely know what to expect, but I do know that I will be essentially restarting my military career and dumping my old one. I knew that the whole time, but it never hit me so hard until now that I’ll be leaving all my friends and my career and my house and my life that I’ve grown to love in the past two years. I love all my coworkers and friends. I love my work environment. I’m too excited to have a degree in a field I love and obtain the career I’ve wanted so bad, but I’m just so scared of change. I’ve been crying for over an hour about this. Nobody else knows that I feel this way. I think the overstimulation from getting the thing I wanted for over a year is just overwhelming me. 

What should I do to accept that change is a part of life? Any advice for feeling lonely in the sense that I’m going to leave all my close friends that I’ve gone through so much with? Has anyone else experienced something that you’re so excited but overwhelmed that it’s too much for you and you break down?",09Apr2019,1
88,"Hey folks!  This is just your average throwaway account asking for advice. Firstly, I must say thank you for taking some time out of your day to read this post and (perhaps) post your suggestion.

Let the story begin:
I met this gal back when I was in seventh grade (now I’m in twelfth grade). We weren’t *close* from the start, but I always felt like there was a spark as time brought us closer together simply by the vibes she gave off.  She has always been there listening to my drama, she has always been there listening to my dumb ideas, and she just makes me feel so cheerful whenever I see her throughout the day at or after school.  Coming home from a dreary day to friendliness was comforting. Her eyes always sparkle with joy and she’s extremely kind. She has a beautiful smile and her laugh just makes you laugh (in a good way duh). Man I wish I could say all of this to her. But it’s weird, right?  

I’ve tried to get over her with two girls, but those didn’t work out simply because of lost connections. I realized after my last girl friend that I didn’t want to keep finding substitutes for this *special girl*.  I feel extremely terrible saying that—that I found substitutes for what I wanted—but it’s true.

Fast forward to my junior year, prom comes.  I didn’t go and I truly regret it.  I had an opportunity to ask someone out, but it wouldn’t have done me any good if I went with someone I didn’t want to go with. Now some of you may say that I could’ve just went there as friends with the person who I had the opportunity with, but you see, from the very beginning I told myself I’d ask this *girl* (the one that this post is about) to prom and I didn’t. I was too afraid it’d disrupt our friendship since I have the tendency to ruin things (cliche but I’m asking for advice so I might as well pour my heart out here).  When that *girl* found that I didn’t go, she asked why and I said it was due to school work and because I didn’t feel comfortable going there without the special one (note - I didn’t give away the name of the special one).

Fast forward to now, senior year, ball is coming up...  For her, prom is here (she’s a year younger than me).  Basically she’s in a situation where multiple people have asked her out to prom, but she’s unsure who to go with. And she’s unsure who she “likes like” ya know?  Me on the other hand, I want to ask her out to ball, but now I’m unsure if I should even give it a shot after what she’s been telling me about her situation.  I could ask her to go there as friends, maybe?

She has asked me if I was going to ball and with who. I told her I’m unsure. I told her the situation I’m in, of course making it sound like it was about someone else, and she said to go for it. Now your initial reaction could be, “she’s waiting for you bro!”, but I don’t think that’s the case here. I don’t think she even realizes that it’s her who I like and want to take to ball.

Don’t get me wrong.  I’m not saying that she can’t do what she wants—that’d be insane—and I truly want her to figure things out, but I’m unsure if I should take a shot at her.  I felt like I had a chance at prom, but now I’m just skeptical about all of this. The feeling of regret keeps hitting me in the gut. 

So what if I don’t ask her?  Well, she’ll never know I liked her, but I won’t know if she liked me to the slightest like I feel she has in the past.

I won’t see her next year since I’ll be heading off to college so I guess I should ask her because if I don’t, I’ll regret it?

At this point, any support would be appreciated. Should I take the shot?  Or is it a lost cause?   What are the odds that this special girl sees this post and talks to me tomorrow about it?",09Apr2019,1
89,"If it matters, I am a school bus driver. Just started the beginning of this 2019 year, barely old enough to do this, 21 F. About three months in, I ask a coworker I see who rides his bike to work, where he parks his bike. I just so happen to be on spring break because I am also a college student. So I had a lot of free time and we ended up talking for a few hours (which is really odd because i'm usually quite introverted) but I hadn't socialized in a long time so eh why not. The conversation was really interesting but on Monday when school picked back up I thought it would go back to the usual small talk and barely passing by each other. 

&amp;#x200B;

Instead, this coworker (we'll call him Taylor for this posts sake) follows me around like a puppy. Every single morning Taylor goes out of his way to say Hi to me and after the end of our morning route they wait for me to finish my post trip (which honestly they are distracting me from) and then proceeds to walk me to my car. When I got a cold he bought me cold medicine ( I told him not to but he did anyways) and then earlier this week I mentioned how I collect coffee mugs because he said he collects transformers so now he's telling me that he's ordering me a coffee mug. Then today (I am no longer sick) he brings in a thing of orange juice and a can of pineapple for me??? It was really awkward cause I was like I don't need this but he insisted so he left it in the community fridge for me to pick up when I was done in the afternoon run. Taylor gave me orange juice and a can of pineapple in front of my other coworkers...

They don't wait for me on our PM run but this is bizarre behavior I've never experienced before. He says he's not interested in women at the bus lot yet he is acting like this towards me? I have made it pronounced I have a boyfriend. Tomorrow I think I am going to say no more gifts because it's too personal for work. This is making me not want to attempt riding my bike into work oh I forgot, along with the cold medicine he gave me a bike lock. Is Taylor lonely?

91,"So, basically I'm one of those people who always covers my phone/ laptop cameras with either tape or one of those sliders that you stick on. I've heard so many stories about women who had naked images of themselves posted to the internet and it basically ruined their lives. My boyfriend doesn't seem to worry about this at all, which is fine that doesn't affect me. But the problem is that he has two computer monitors with cameras on them on his desk pointed right at the bed. This worries me for obvious reasons. 

So, I ordered a small pack of those camera stickers that slide open and closed for easy access and easy protection. But for some reason he doesn't want to use them? Last time I was at his place and we were heading toward intimacy, I used a couple sticky notes from his desk to cover those two cameras. He laughed it off a bit and didn't seem to mind me doing that but also didn't see any point in it. But now I feel like I'll need to do that every single time? I probably just sound paranoid or weird for making such a big deal about this. I just can't stand the idea of being a victim of revenge porn and having those images follow me for the rest of my life. Do you think I should try to convince him to use the camera stickers I gave him? Thy wont damage his device at all, they just pop right off.",09Apr2019,0

103,"I have a boss who makes me feel very uneasy and disgusted on the inside. He is a ""flip flopper"" who will flip his answers to any questions of doubt to make him not look incorrect or knowledgeable. His goal is to ultimately take over the company that I work at. I know him personally and the agreement when I got the job was to help him achieve this. Although now I'm aware that the reasoning behind his motives was a lie. He made claims that people were screwing over and stealing from the company, how he would make a better fit as an executive because he truly wants the company to succeed, and how the current leadership is failing the company. For me it was a win-win I get a job and I can help him this guy out too. Currently he is a Vice President already so I don't understand why he wants the ""power"" so bad but I can tell you this. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. The people he claims are stealing and trying to screw everyone over have been watched by us (I work in IT) and after a year there is still zero proof for any of those claims. The only thing I've noticed were mistakes caused by break down in process or true mistakes. 
2. He flip flops his answers to sound knowledgeable or to not be incorrect. For example he calls 2 specific people lazy although his own direct report literally does not do anything internally or with our customers but we hide that anyways because ""he has been through a rough year"" and he states if he got rid of him he wouldn't be able to hire for that position again. I assume this has something to do with wanting more people reporting to him to make him feel more powerful.
3. He is ultimately a liar and has no problem with taking a half truth and making an exaggerated story with his half truth that makes it sound believable. For example one employee who works at a different office of ours said the same thing to me when I had enough one day and vented when I went over there to drop something off.

The problem is more so this. I don't mind cutting ties with him and finding another job. I do mind leaving the others as I have grown to like them. I started out as a contractor then hired on later. The company refuses to raise my pay and I make less than the guy who does nothing as mentioned above. I was told by that VP that I was coming off as ungrateful for wanting a pay raise because they finally brought me on full time and gave me health insurance after a year. I do not feel like I own anybody anything for receiving full time with health insurance. That is something almost every single job requires for full time employees. Right now if I leave I feel I will burn my bridges with everyone, but the thought of having to work with that manipulative, selfish, and greedy shit head makes me absolutely angry and bitter.

We are in the same major so we share the same classes where the assignments are usually done in groups. When I've done assignments with this person we would usually do things last minute which I was okay with at the time but due to bad experiences and stress I want to change and start on assignments earlier. Recently, our classes are now all individual assignments so i've been trying to start early on them and I've been going to class everyday. Whats been bugging me recently is that my friend constantly asks me whats happened in class and asks for help on the assignments. My friend rarely attends class and does not start on assignments early.

110,"Not entirely important information below, mostly just context.

Currently I’m at a Disneyland senior trip, the second to last day. I was having a great time but tonight I was just really grumpy and upset. As me and a friend I’m rooming with were walking back to the buses a sorta semi-friend (friend of my pal who I don’t really know) tagged along. Usually I’m the clown of the group but tonight I was just exhausted and it seemed like semi-friend was just super energized. I was getting a taste of my own medicine and I was tired. We have a 11 p.m. curfew and it is about 10, we needed to take a bus to all star sports. So when we left to the buses semi-friend says “hey let’s take the monorails instead., then go on the buses there.” The entirety of the other seniors were just taking the buses at epcot, where we were. I really just wanted to take the buses. But he kept egging us on, and saying stuff like “Nah it’s the scenic route and it’ll be quicker, etc.” I was really just upset and wanted to get back to the hotel ASAP. Semi friend then puts a hand on my shoulder, I say “please don’t touch me,” and take off his arm. He then (jokingly, I hope,) puts his arm back on my shoulder

The part with the bite

So then I get really angry and give him a sorta bite on the hand. Honestly I can’t sugarcoat it I pulled a stupid move. Thankfully I didn’t gnash him like a werewolf, it was more like a rough-housing bite, something a pissed child would do I guess? So he says ouch, Then we both apologize. And then I realize: “Shit, I bit him,” and we notice I broke the skin. On the bright side the “wound,” is a little red dot, semi friend claims there’s a bit of swelling around it though. So now I am fearing that I’ll end up infecting or hurting semi friend from what might be the stupidest thing I’ve done around my peers. He forgave me pretty quickly, and says he’ll be fine and he’ll put on a bandaid and wash it, but tbh I’m still a bit worried. 

Any advice on what could be done or if my semi friend will be fine?",09Apr2019,2

114,"I’m 16, in high school. So ever since I got my new phone, I’ve been playing mobile games on it behind my parent’s back, for a few months now. Not gonna lie it is a bit addictive, I play it for like 1 or two hours per day. My parents always had a strict rule on me playing games, growing up I never had an X box or ps4 or any real gaming system. That’s why I was so into it once I got a change to finally play online with my friends. A few minutes ago I walked into my room finding my mom looking at my phone, and i that’s when I knew I finally fucked up. Damn it, I put months into this game, so much time wasted trying to connect to my friends from school, learning how to play(keep in my this is my only real experience in online video games), and honestly games really helps by giving me a escape from the stresses of life. Though I do see my parent’s point, I got college admissions and SATs coming up, I shouldn’t be playing games. But that’s why I am playing games, I needed something to relief my self from the stress of all this studying. Anyways that’s the least of my worries, now my mom doesn’t trust me anymore because I lied to her for months and I don’t know what do to.

Ps:

117,"Any help on any of the following issues is much appreciated. On phone. Long one, I'm sorry!

First, some small background info. A year ago I had to quit my favorite job because new leadership deemed that my lack of a Master's did not qualify me for the job, even though I had been doing the job for 4 years AND I had the support of my supervisor and all of my coworkers. Proceeded to take a job I knew I was going to hate because I have a lot of student loans and I need the $$$. Pretty sure this job is the main reason for my depression. Now onto all of the other issues that have stemmed from that.

Hate my current job and have spent the last 6 months applying to everything and anything without even an interview. I desperately want to quit my current job but I REALLY new the money. 

My mom and stepdad are living their life and travel about 6 month out of the year. I moved out a yr ago and they asked me to check on the house, shovel if it snows and pick of the mail the last 6 months. They just got back. Stepdad promised to pay me for shoveling but not anything else. I asked my mom if she could tell him I need him to pay me. She says no because I had to live in their house for 3 weeks because my room flooded and that's how long it took for my room to be liveable again. She had also said, and she's said this before, that she'd pay me to take care of the house. Haven't seen a penny.

I specially need the money now because I got accepted to a Master's program and everything and anything would help to pay for it. I'll be working full time and going to school part time. Due to it being part time, I don't classify for any aid. 

Finally, I live with my boyfriend. He's an excellent writer but doesn't work. He does all of the cleaning and cooking and house related things (reversed gender roles) and I bring home the bacon so to speak. That being said, I feel like I can't explain to him that I need him to contribute more. We've been together 5 yrs. He is so close to finished his writing and I believe if he gets published it will be amazing but I need help now. 

I feel like I'm going everything myself, and bedding backwards for everybody. I've already started not doing my work properly and not taking care of myself or my relationship (emotionally and physically)

I feel trapped and I need help but with what time!?

I'm sorry for the long list. Any advice is appreciated.",09Apr2019,1
118," 

Hello.  I don't use Reddit often, but a friend of mine suggested I come here  for some advice. I don't really like to put myself out there, but I'm  really having a hard time trying to figure out what to do.

As  the title states, I have a car with negative equity-- a 2015 Mitsubishi  Mirage DE that I financed back in July of 2017. I'm not a huge fan of  the car itself, but my problem doesn't necessarily stem from the car  itself, but more so the monthly payments I make on it. I pay 410/m on  the car note, and was told when I initially purchased the car that I'd  be able to either refinance for a better rate, or get a better car that I  actually enjoyed. It turns out the dealers lied to me (huge shocker),  but because of my desperation to obtain a new vehicle (my old car  wouldn't pass the smog test and thus couldn't be registered), I actually  followed through with the purchase, hoping the dealership would keep  its word.

As things stand now, I'm  currently in a rough patch, having been asked to leave my current  household and find my own place. I desperately want to get rid of this  car, as the current payments put a huge dent in my paycheck, but all the  options I found online suggest that even if I sold it, I'd still have  to make up the difference out of pocket. I tried refinancing with  several companies, but all of my applications were rejected  unfortunately. Any advice would be much appreciated; and even if none  can be offered, thanks for letting me vent.",09Apr2019,1

I can hit the gym, go to work (in sales), deal with issues I don't know how to solve, but not lose control/confidence along the way. Then drive home with a smile and sense if accomplishment, even if I know I messed a few things up. Cook a healthy dinner for myself, maybe clean a few things up, do some reading and then head off to bed. 

But sometimes, I just can't deal with it. I wake up feeling demotivated. I have to really push myself to smile, and get through the day at work. Then once I leave for the day, I forgo all self care. Forget the gym, I'm too tired/anxious to go. Forget making a healthy dinner and saving money by cooking at home, I can just grab some McDonald's. Why read when I can just watch Netflix till 3am, even though I've got work in the morning.

Exhibits: 

A. My ex boyfriend whom I broke up with 6 months ago, is no longer relevant to my life, is barely even a friend at this point, and gives zero fucks about me. 

B. Random people on Tinder and questionable chat servers - More right swipes provide assurance that I am attractive. People I chat with on chat servers are also sometimes a source of validation, through NSFW images.

C. Reddit - I've started relying on Reddit for social validation when my comments receive upvotes. It's nice to know that someone cared about and liked my opinion or witty remark, which is spurring me on to seek more validation. 

D. Briefly, a few years ago, I started smoking more regularly because a person I was crushing on smoked. Then he pointed out my lips were turning darker and I decided to stop entirely. Wasn't an addiction at that point. Either way, realised I seek validation from crushes very regularly. Currently I have no crushes. 

E. Friends and family - Less reliant on them for validation. More inclined towards ""you have your beliefs and I have mine"" and ""agree to disagree"".

139,"So I am a 23 f living with my single 51 yr old mom, and we live with my younger brother, 19, and my younger sister, 21.

I go to school but work full time as well to pay Bill's.  My mom works full time and pays rent, and my little brother works full time to pay bills as well.  However, my younger sister had a job for 1 day, quit because she didn't like working, and has not had a job since.  She also decided school wasn't for her, so is not doing that either.

My mom has been paying for everything for her - phone, computer, clothes, food, personal hygiene, makeup, etc this entire time.  My sister also relies on me to pay for her to go out to the movies or for dinner if she wants to go out to eat.  After 3 years, my mom and I have had enough.

My mom told her she has until June 1st to get a job, and after that, my mom will no longer be buying her anything, groceries and personal hygiene included.  My sister started screaming and slammed the door to the room she and I both share (while we are between houses).

I slept on the couch last night, and this morning, when I went to shower, I found a pair of her shorts laid out flat in the middle on the bathroom floor with 2 lines of blood in them (they were turned inside out to show the blood) and bloody tissues were laid out right next to it, all organized in a line.

I don't know what to do.  I ignored it, and I don't want to tell my mom because she is going through a lot right now.  My sister has no history of mental health issues or self harm, and I'm not saying that ignorantly. From the ages of 12 to 21, I was a severe self-harmer.  It was very hard for me to come out to my family to receive help.  After 9 years though, I can recognize the signs of another cutter almost instantly.  My sister is heavy set and wears underwear and tank tops around the house to stay cool, so we all see pretty much her whole body.  She also swims a lot at the rec center in a 2 piece, and again, no scars or cuts.  I have also done her laundry for the past 3 years, and there has never been any blood in her clothes. 

I feel like this was a one time thing to get out of having to work, and I feel awful saying that.  She doesn't have issues going out of the house or anything, because she goes out to eat or out with her friends or out shopping ALL the time.  I truly believe she is just lazy and thought that because I got ""special"" treatment with my self harm, she might too.

145,"So sorry this is very long!!!! I’m not sure what to do about this and I need some advice so here I am. So my mom has 2 best friends and they work together and both of her friends are basically my other moms and they have kids my age and I’m closer to them than my own family. It’s like we’re one big family.  Anyway one of the daughters has a lot of reptiles and her mother practically takes care of them for her. Well one day she went to a large pet store chain and noticed that they weren’t taking good care (obvious animal abuse. It was bad) of their animals and told the employees that she was going to call the authorities and obviously they didn’t want that. So they offered her a job there in charge of all animal care of all the stores around our area. Most of the reptiles were in critical condition. She had to take over 30 to her house and way more to the vet. Over all the vet had to put down A LOT and I mean A LOT of them and many died of their injuries or diseases etc. Now is where I come in. I offered to go to her house and help out with the care and stuff since there’s a ton of animals that need constant care and attention. She only really knew how to care for snakes and leopard geckos. Not that I know more than her or anything but I’ve had a lot of animals of many different kinds in my life. I would go over there and give the snakes their shots because she didn’t want to when I noticed one of the many baby bearded dragons. She had an issue with her eye and bad stuck shed on her tail. The tip of it was even dead. I already had a bearded dragon who was very sick when I got her a few years ago and I also knew that the bearded dragons weren’t getting proper care at her house or at the store so I wanted to buy one of the ones in bad shape to care for at home since whenever I would say something that she wasn’t doing well she would blow it off or ignore me. There was one that needed a hand amputated, one who was very sick, and one I mentioned. The sick one ended up dying and I wouldn’t be able to take the baby with the hand injury to the vet as much as she needed so I chose the one with the stuck shed and the bad eye. I had to go to the store with her to buy the beardie so I helped out when the animals were able to go back to the store. When the day came we packed up 25 reptiles into her car and went to the store to bring some back and pick up more animals to take them to another store location. I live in Michigan it’s cold outside and she left them in the car for over an hour when we were in the store and she didn’t even care about it but I was very worried bc they were obviously freezing. When I was in the store packing up more animals one of the snakes snuck out and we found it in another cage and that kept happening. We kept finding snakes in with other animals because they could easily sneak out of their cage. Then the rats. They were all banged up with many bad wounds and as someone with pet rats I was very worried about it and she said “oh yeah. Hmmm. They’re fine.” And then proceeded to just shove them into a box and poke holes in it and tape it up then go outside and put it in her trunk. It was a very small box and she would be driving for hours before dropping them at the next store. Then I saw the hamsters. There was about 15 of them in a tiny cage with one that was completely hairless with deep cuts all across his body. He hid in the corner and shook. It was a horrible sight. I pointed him out to her and all she said was “I hate hamsters. “ I persisted but she still didn’t really care. After we left and I got my new 3 month old bearded dragon home she was already looking better after I gave her food and warmed her up. The next day I easily got her tail to shed and saved the rest of it. So I started thinking, I never saw the bearded dragons get fed or given water in the whole week they were at her house and you could tell my new bearded dragon was starving , cold, and just lacking basically everything she needed. What I’m worried about is that she’s the only one making sure the animals are all taken care of and I just don’t think she would look after or care about any animals she didn’t like. I don’t want to start drama, make her mad, or have her loose her job if I call someone about this. These animals deserve better but the only two people who have knowledge about all this is her and I. It would be obvious I called. I don’t know what to do. Do I call someone about this animals abuse or do I trust she’ll do her job?",09Apr2019,1

149,"Hello! Recently I have noticed that I am not very keen on paying attention to fine details or focusing on them for that matter.  To put it bluntly, I would say I am careless when it comes to certain things, but in a completely unitenitional way. Here are some examples:

-I am horrible with grammar and noticing mistakes. 
-I am bad at riding/balancing on bikes
-I am very clutsy and drop/break things constantly or fall/hit up against things alot. 
-I am bad at remembering things about people when its small things such as things they are doing this weekend, or favorite things of theirs. 

I know that these arent all directly put together but I feel like there's a common thread between them. I feel as if they fall under a ""focusing really hard and fine detail"" haha. Anyways, are there any tips to be better at this area of my life?",09Apr2019,1
151,"Sorry for the length.

TL;DR: I love a certain car and I've found one in Arizona that I really want. But I can't justify the purchase mostly because I don't need it. Need help making up my mind.

I've been a huge fan of the Pontiac Firebird for a long time, and a few years ago I bought a 1987 Bird. I love that car to death and I think she's a beautiful piece of automotive history, but I've always wished that it had a bigger engine (currently has a small v6).

The car is plenty quick, gets decent mileage for what it is, and gives me the style I want. But I just feel that without a v8 it's not the same.

I looked into replacing the engine but the general consensus is that it's easier to buy one that already has it; putting a new engine in it would cost about twice as much as the car is worth.

Recently I've been looking at other cars just to see what's out there, and I found what looks to be a great deal: an '85 Firebird Trans Am with a v8, t-tops, etc., for about $4000. The car is located in Arizona, so it's in great condition for its age. For reference, the same car where I live would cost about $10,000.

I have an opportunity to have my parents look at it for me and possibly purchase it, with my money. It would cost about another $1000 to have it shipped up here by truck.

Bottom line, I really want this car. It's a good price and it has everything I want and more. But I can't seem to justify it to myself. I don't need a car with a big V8, my v6 does the same job just fine for fewer resources. It's something that I really want but I can't convince myself one way or the other. I feel like if I pass up this opportunity it will be a long time before I see another like it. But it's a large purchase that will drain most of my money until I sell mine and start working again. Plus I have to save for college on top of that.

So, I've come to get the opinions of internet strangers to ask what to do. Any insight would be appreciated and hopefully you guys can help me make up my mind. Thank you so much!",09Apr2019,1
152,"CW: Death. Also, I'm long-winded.

My wonderful, hilarious, well loved brother-in-law and best friend breathed his final breath on April 2nd; he suffered a catastrophic asthma attack, followed by a massive heart attack a few days earlier, and despite all of the best efforts, he passed away after fighting for his life for three days.

He was thirty-two.

We laid him to rest yesterday.

At the funeral home, we chose the largest room available, the one that could accommodate approximately a thousand people. The director of the home warned us that the room could very well be too large for our needs, but wasn't pushy. We told him that we would rather have the space and not use it over having too little space.

The wake and service was scheduled from 12PM to 3PM with a reception afterwards at a local family restaurant that we use for every family event.

Folks started showing up at eleven.

The funeral home employees were wonderful, though. They didn't try to sell us urns or floral arrangements. They ^(against the rules) scurried around to find me aspirin. I was comforted while crying over my daughter's letters. They put away all the floral arrangements in the building because my BIL was allergic. It was an inane request, but they still goddamn did it. 

And my brother-in-law. They made him *smile*? But just a little; it was the same smile he had on when everything was just *okay*. When he was content. You could barely see the bruises under his eyes. I thought I was going to see him like he was in the hospital bed forever, after we took him off life support and his color faded away. They gave me another image. Instead of him sleeping with tubes in his nose and mouth, hooked up to a ventilator, or laying there, turning pale and gone forever, I can see him with his eyes gently closed and that soft smile on his face.

They let the extended family in at 1145AM - the immediate family, myself included, had all been there since 1045AM. We were supposed to stop condolences at 2PM for the sermon, but there were so many people, the funeral home allowed us to continue until nearly 3PM. We monopolized that funeral home until 4PM, despite the fact that we were only scheduled until 3PM, and we heard nary a peep.

They did not charge us for this additional time. 

We didn't expect so many people. The room filled. Then the hall. Then lobby. They had to turn on the building-wide intercom system-thing so everyone attending could hear what was being said. They stopped admitting people into the room at ""a little bit"" past a thousand.

So what did this funeral home do?

They - somehow, someway - found out the restaurant that we had booked, and called and told them to expect an additional hundred people for our party.

And how does the restaurant respond?

They're like, ""oh, you thought the funeral home made this process less painful? *Hold our beers*.""

They stop seating people. We had their banquet hall reserved, but it only had the capacity for our party before the additional people. They emptied out their restaurant for us.

Oh, and, by the way, the cost of the additional people? All that extra space, all that extra food?

A grand total of $0.00. We still only paid for the original headcount.

Yesterday was one of the most painful days of my life. I had to say goodbye to one of my closest friends. I had to watch my family grieve, my mother-in-law sob, my partner collapse into a chair with dead eyes, my children weep until they slept. I had to face the fact that there will be a hole in our lives, exactly the shape of the man that laid in that coffin, forever.

But it could have been more painful. It could have been filled with so much more anxiety and stress and sorrow. But it wasn't, thanks to those two establishments.

How to I recognize this beyond nice Yelp reviews and phone calls? I'm so filled with gratitude, the everyone family is. The funeral home is newer and oftentimes passed over for a more established home... Partly because it used to be an arcade of some sort. I have connections at some local papers, would it be appropriate to post something publicly?",09Apr2019,1

last night at 1am, i had a dream when it went off extremely loud. it woke me up instantly. when i was awake however, i felt like i couldn't move at all. i was shaking and trembling very much. when i finally was able to move, it felt almost like electrical shocks. it took me an hour to get back to sleep.

161,"(Sorry this got long, turned into a ramble about everything on my mind)


Bit of background: I (21f) grew up on a farm in the middle of nowhere, and moved to a coastal town to study at 17. I lived in share houses for the first two years, lived on my own for a year, and just signed a lease with my partner (22m) 3 weeks ago for a large townhouse. 

In the entire time I’ve lived here, I’ve barely made a single friend. In all my classes, I’ve been a bit of an outcast because everyone already knew each other from high school. I feel like I don’t have much in common with people around here, being a coastal town everyone is into surfing etc., and as much as I like being near the beach, it’s not that big of a thing for me. 

I’ve become more and more depressed, but I don’t know whether that’s from learning how to stand on my own 2 feet, my friends and family living 3 hours away, or if it’s because I don’t do much with myself here. I don’t know what my hobbies and interests are, and nothing has really stuck. I know I do love live music, but that’s a pretty rare occurrence around here. 

I have a job working nights. I like my job, I like the people I work with. But maybe I just don’t like working nights? I honestly don’t know, because I don’t really have anything to do on my nights off. I just spend my time sitting around waiting to go to work that night. 

I feel like I should have moved to the city 2 hours away. It’s closer to my friends and family. I can still study the same degree, just with a few change ups and might take me a little longer. There’s things to do, places to explore, live music, record stores to hang out in, a million places to go out and just get coffee for something to do. I keep thinking that it would be easier to make friends there, but I’m worried I’m just romanticising it and just trying to run from my problems here, and it won’t be much different. I feel like I would love to live in a small inner city apartment and be surrounded by constant busy-ness. Again, don’t know if this is just romanticising. 

This would be a much easier decision if I didn’t just move in with partner, only 3 weeks ago. I genuinely love him and he is the most perfect partner and we have a future planned together. But moving to the city likely wouldn’t be on the table for him as he needs to finish his apprenticeship, and work in his field is extremely hard to come by in the city, and he already has a stable, well paying job. He also has 2 cars that are his passion, in addition to my car, and 2-3 car garages/parking is near impossible to find in the city. I also don’t know how we could go from living in a double storey townhouse together into a small apartment. Plus, we’re only 3 weeks into our lease. 

I have no idea if moving away from this town is worth uprooting my entire life, especially because there’s no guarantee that it will work out and things will be different. Some advice on where to even begin would be much appreciated, I’m just so lost on what to think and what to do. 

Tl;dr: moved to a coastal town 4 years ago, have made no friends and have little interest in doing typical coast town activities. I feel like I belong in the city, but don’t know if I’m just romanticising it and things won’t be any better. I don’t know what to do since I just moved in with my partner 3 weeks ago and moving to the city likely wouldn’t be an option for him. What do I do, where do I start?",09Apr2019,2

172,"I turned 21 on April 1st. Since then I've not had one person spend time with me. I invited thirteen people on my birthday, thirteen people couldn't make it. Half of the excuses were so blatantly bullshit that I spent the night drinking and crying. One person completely ghosted me and I don't even know why. It was this cute girl who had come over to my place and we just talked and talked for hours, got along wonderfully and just whoosh. Gone. It's not that people simply don't like me, I'm not even the one who's always inviting people to do things, it's just that when it gets around to actually doing something or getting out of the house, they make up some bullshit excuse so they don't have to. It's like it's just too much effort to be social anymore. They just don't want to do things. They all just want to watch Netflix. It's not like I'm unlikable, I'm an outgoing individual. I stay in shape, work my ass of so I can afford my own house, I snowboard, sing, play guitar, play ball. But I do it all alone, because nobody wants to do anything. It's too much effort to go snowboarding. 

What set me off tonight is I gave up on everyone tonight. I didn't ask anyone to hang out with me. I just planned on being alone because I just assumed nobody would leave their homes. I got a text around 8 asking what I'm doing. I just said that I wasn't doing anything. No response. Finally at fucking 10:00 they text me back, ""sorry my phone died, me and McKayla were out cruising, was gonna invite you but my phone died."" I tell her ""y'know you coulda just knocked right?"" Nope. That's too difficult. That's too socially awkward. That's too much pressure for the wee millennial. The concept of just actually communicating with someone without a phone is just too complicated. ""I don't feel comfortable going to people's houses."" 

It's not just this instance that's got me all wound up, it's shit like this that has prevented me from seeing anyone outside of work for over a week. It's like 95% of time nobody wants to do anything fun and the other 5% they're lying because they feel like it's the most socially acceptable thing to do so they come over and it's like they're just waiting for you to look the other way so they can crawl out your window or sneak out the back door to go watch Netflix or Hulu or sleep. Why does anyone need 12 hours of sleep?? I don't understand this shit anymore, this society is fucked up. Everyone is SO fucking scared of being judged that they can't even knock on doors. They are so crippled by social anxiety that actually talking to someone is too scary. They have to have some barrier between them, they have to talk on phones and over messenger. 

It's not like it's just this town or these people, it's everywhere. You'd think that when everyone's turning 21 they'll be hitting up the bars, but no. I've been to 6 bars, some in little towns, some in big cities. Everyone there is... Older. Nobody within 10 years of me at a single one. This was split between Friday and Saturday nights. I'm so fucking lonely, and it's because of everyone else. I don't mistreat people, I give literally everyone a chance but I'm constantly disappointed. And I can't just cut the bad fruit off the tree so to speak, because then there wouldn't be a tree. I talk with a lot of older people, and they tell me all these stories about the shit they used to do in high school. Their lives were my fantasies. A dance every Saturday night, bumping into friends on the sidewalk, meeting a girl and just talking.

181,"So I will start this off with I am an 18 year old male graduating high school this year and thinking about college. I am accepted in college across the country from me currently (I currently live in AZ but college is in VA). I just got my Financial Aid award letter saying that I got a loan from the government. But with the loan the college is still a lot of money that I do not know how I am going to afford it. I have been applying to scholarships but not getting accepted to any because I do not have the best grades. So thinking of this I do not know if I want to go to college. But if I do not go to college I don't know what to do. I know military is an option but I am not interested in it. I know local colleges are also an option but I do not want to stay in Arizona.

184,"So I'm 21 in Australia, never went to university, and my prospects fall in line with ""working just to pay the bills"". Since 2015 when I was nearing the end of school, I got sick. And my illness stopped me from really chasing something careerwise.

Fast forward several years I've worked different odd jobs that didn't work out. Still dealing with my illness still to this day, though it wasn't officially diagnosed until mid 2017. It's all leading to start working with my dad in agriculture. 

I've been, and still am, very interested in I.T, such as software development, coding etc. I wouldn't be learning from scratch, I would be more of a beginner.

I've plotted out a path to chasing a career in I.T. I'd be starting from more of a  beginners level:

1. Certificate III Information, Digital Media &amp; Technology at TAFE (July-Dec 2019). TAFE is an adult learning school in Australia. 

2. Certificate IV Information Technology at TAFE (Jan-Jun 2020). 

3. Bachelor of Information Technology at my local University (minimum of 3 years July 2020-2023).

I believe this is quite achievable, but I'm very conflicted considering my age. Sure, 21 is still quite young. But if I did chase this career, it'd be like starting school again as an adult. I'd be on student welfare payments for years. I'd be 26 if I did follow this path. I'd be 26 years of age looking for a job. And that's only if i succeed in school.

It's scary. Knowing I wouldn't be starting a career until I am 26. And there's the other side of compromising, and just working with my dad that wouldn't make me happy. But I know this is real life. A job is a job, and money is money. Plus a guarenteed job is also a very good thing.

What would be your advice? I'm scared. Scared I'm too old to study from the beginning, but scared of working a job I didn't choose.",09Apr2019,1
185,"So I’ve been thinking, a while back my ex started messaging me again. We’ve been apart for about 5 years now. It’s been a back and forth boggling experience.

It’s clear I still had feelings for her when she messaged me it kinda sparked. She ends up coming over to my for “a drink” while she has a boyfriend *Her boyfriend is a abusive prick.* is that’s a shitty defence, but we ended up kissing and I stopped it at that. *mainly because she had a bf but I was still in the wrong anyway I guess* she instigated it.

190,"Hello all. I have many questions for advice. But, this is for today.

I struggle with occasional aggression issues and pent up rage/resentment or whatever it's called. I exercise read and write to get it out/dissipate it. Other activities too.

This is about the occasional possible physical fights that ""could happen"" in everyday life.

I don't really want to fight anyone,yet at the same time if it happens i get excited as fuck. 

Most of that aggressive thought i have i know is towards myself, while doing the whole blame game on others but in reality it's just my inflection/projection(right word?).

Today is a regular day. Nothing crazy, helped my Grandma's gardener trim her tree. Didn't workout or work etc. 

I was walking home from the bus stop after some shopping downtown. Decided to zoom my flashlight down the street of the intersection before my house(its dark out now). Some tweaker fuck got mad, coasted by in his truck and wanted to start something. Started talking to me in spanish. I told him idk what he's saying. Then he smacks his lips and drives away saying something.

All the meanwhile im thinking. ""Get out out of the truck, just get the fuck out and step to me"". I even thought of steeping to his door. I hesitated/thought again. He pulls a u turn on my street, sadly its so close to my house, i throw my shit in my yard and run up the side walk to meet him. He just keeps going down the street. Pulls to the side and stops for 15 secs or so about a 3/4 block and then keeps going. I lost sight of him after about 1500 feet down or so.

I am not a physically violent person/instigator that i objectively see. Besides exercise. I wait for ""that"" time, like many others do. Neither right or wrong just that fluid moment of ""okay"". I try not to artificially create it but whatever naturally happens, happens. I don't know any martial arts besides ""Don't kill me fu"" and ""i hurt you fu"". Cant say r/iamverybadass lol

I get that i created that situation. In my defense, motherfucker shouldn't be tweaking​ out in public so obviously and i didn't know he was creeping in the car. In his defense, i shouldn't have shined my light like some wanna be cop asshole. 

Sometimes this happens in all of our lives, that little incident that can get blown up. I just feel and felt guilty if it comes back to my loved ones, not myself, just innocent affiliation thst whole shebang.

My question is, whether ""you"" started it or not, is it wise to take advantage of that altercation. Is it wrong to think like that? (Yeah, but i do) even if its some mental case looking for that scratch to your itch or vice versa etc..

Is it a male thing, psychological or something else?

Maybe i didn't word this coherently. Since im getting lost myself.

Please, i am not asking for some pretentious judgements against me. We all have these thoughts/days of wtf was i thinking. Reflection is good, I'm not asking if im a good or bad person. Just, is it normal, healthy? Its not like im super aggro. There's just those certain times that it all clicks.",09Apr2019,1

We're very good friends and I am very grateful for that, it's just that I don't know what to do if we become a thing. I'm also a half extrovert and half introvert and she's an introvert and it makes me feel that I can't be myself. I also think that she's loosing interest in me because I don't talk to her in person.

194,"Hi, 

Having a bit of an issue that’s weighing really heavy on my heart and brain so I just wanted to air it out somewhere to ensure that I’m not crazy. 

About a week ago my boyfriend of 10 years told me he wants to move to Colombia. He’s been struggling with his financial situation here in the States. He went from a business management position at a corporation to working the real estate entrepreneur life and has had some success. Still he’s struggling with the burden of paying his student debt and working hard for relatively little return/reward. 

He told me that he doesn’t really care about his family and doesn’t feel that happy with me. He said his friends are whatever to him and he just wants to go somewhere and start fresh. He’s definitely a very moody person. He actually said that he’s been struggling with depression because of his financial situation. But he can’t afford to see a therapist.

I’m trying to empower him to do whatever will make him happy - if it’s not money or working for yourself - and not his family or me - I told him he should go and figure out what actually makes him happy. He can reposition his life however he wants. 

Honestly I’m trying to be there for him, but I can’t help but feel disposable. Like I’m about to graduate law school (3 weeks away) and finally about to start my life. I thought this would be a happy transition and we might finally start our life together. I just feel lost, disposable, like I don’t matter. Of course, I haven’t told him any of this bc I’m trying to be there for him and support his decisions. But whenever I bring up our future, his plans, or question his decision - he blows up on me. 

Idk what to do. Am I crazy for feeling this way? Like what.",09Apr2019,1

197,"So a little bit of context here, I'm 16, and do not have my full license. The law reads that I can travel to and from school for the purposes of attending. When school is on session. I'm a fairly good driver but not full yet. 

My highschool recommended that I apply for a local community college to work on getting some computer science classes done so since  that is what I'm interest in. I applied and was accepted under dual-enrollment and to take the class Id like to take, I need to arrange a waiver test for the fundamentals class I think I have a pretty good grasp on. I asked the Prof when I could take it and she said tomorrow is her only day available until enrollment (in which the classes fill up really fast). Here is where shit hits the fan.

I don't have a ride and both of my parents are at work that day. My mother is okay with letting me drive down there (on back roads) to take this test and come back. (About 35 minutes away). My father does not want to let me. He repeatedly said he wasn't changing his mind and half assedly said my mother could override him. After she presented her case he do whatever you want. I think it's a bad idea. 

Now text doesn't put to justice the emotions. My father is highly against letting me drive down there and is aggregated by the situation. This has been framed as a who do you listen to more my mother or my father.

199,"I'm 19 and she is 14. We have been clashing for countless years now. When she was like 8-10, she used to bite me and draw blood, stabbed me with a very sharp object in the side of my wrist, hit me, etc. When I was growing breasts at like 13, she used to hit my chest when it was super painful and I had to go doctor because the mass was so swollen from how she used to always hit my chest. Always has had some hatred for me, even though I am an extremely reserved person unless you annoy me. I find this behaviour in such a young person so odd... and I never understood why my parents never took her to a therapist. I never dared to hit her back when she was that young though. However, we have been in physical fights, but not recently as I don't want to be apart of that stupid behaviour. (btw, she is not small, she is almost 5""6, almost my height, and MUCH stronger than me, doesn't excuse me reacting to her hitting me but .... don't want anyone to think I was in a fight with a literal baby lmfao) I feel like she needs to put her internal anger and strength into some damn tackling sport or something, lol.

Today, she has a disgusting attitude. She acts like entitled brat/wanna-be instagram famous girl. It's obviously from social media and high school. However, it bleeds into everyday life. It's very irritating to deal with someone with this sort of complex, especially when even my parents can't put her in her place. (they have given up, which is very annoying) She is never wrong and will never admit to being wrong. If she doesn't get something she wants, she throws a tantrum and calls my mum a bitch, and if I interject, she tells me to 'shut the fuck up you stupid bitch, I hate your voice.' This triggers tf out of me, and most of the time I'm relaxed, but I can explode back at her and tell her she needs to watch her attitude and that shes disgusting, I hate being around her, etc. It's bad but I've started controlling my hurtful words and I always say sorry afterwards because I feel super horrible. She says super hurtful things though, things I wouldn't expect someone of her age could say. She tells me my parents talk trash about me when I'm at my partners house, and that I should f-off and move in with him because she can't stand me around the house, that I'm a ugly skeleton (i'm just naturally thin), etc etc. The list could go on. I'm a pretty sensitive person, but the physical insults don't really affect me, but when she says my parents talk about me behind my back, and that I should just stay with my partner etc etc, it gets pretty hurtful. I am really starting to dislike her, which sounds super horrible, I know. I love her, but I don't like her as a person. I really, really don't. There are times where she is okay, and we get along, and its nice, however that is short-lived. Sometimes if shes forced or coerced into it, or she knows she really upset me, she will apologise, which is nice... but It's super hard to talk those apologies seriously when 4 hours later, she becomes the devil once again. I try my best to ignore her and focus on myself, but it's hard. Am I in the wrong for ignoring her?

I can't live in this house and do my CS degree and actually do well in it, but then I can't just pack up and move out because I don't have money for weekly rent. (I get student payment help) She also has no care for my personal space. I've had to go to the effort of getting a lock on my door, as she has stolen countless things from me, ruined them, hidden them from me, etc. She blew up when she saw I got the lock, lol. She would constantly say that I'm trying to separate us, and I'm a 'selfish bitch' for wanting my own personal space.

The most latest thing was steal my very expensive straighter I saved up for. She stole it from me and I was looking for it, asking my older sisters if they took it with them to their homes, etc. and I did accuse her of taking it and telling my mum she took it. But my mum obviously didn't believe me, and said I misplaced it. The little one started a fight with me for accusing her, even though I knew by my gut feeling that she took it. 2 weeks later, she uses the straighter before school, and leaves the wire hanging out from the place she was hiding it in. She lied to my face for 2 weeks straight. It's fucked up. The day I saw that it wasn't in my room, I was going to an extremely important event and I have naturally wavy/frizzy hair and wanted to look very presentable, therefore wanting to straighten it. I started crying (i know, dramatic :P) because I really, really needed it and begged her to give it back to me. She would not, as she claimed she didn't have it, even though she has dead-straight hair. She knew I had to go to the place too. It's just really fucking insensitive... insane a 14-year old can lie this much. She also stole my new shoes I got and wore them to school and basically, lets just say they are unwearable now. They are white shoes, now are a disgusting brown. I ask her to clean them, she tells me to fuck off. She steals them again the next day while I'm sleeping and ruins them some more. It's a joke. This is just what has recently happened. There's so many more times that she has stolen things from me and ruined them, hid them from me, etc.

In terms of her help around the house... it's non-existent. She is 14, it's time for her to help around the house for once in her life. She can't clean a plate up without someone forcing her to. She literally can't do anything without someone firmly telling her to do it, AND EVEN THEN, she starts yelling and telling me to 'stfu, can't stand your voice, just f-off', as she continues to watch TV... lol. This morning she and her friend made a huge mess in the kitchen after cooking, and I simply asked her 'will you clean that up or no?'. Yep, that caused a fight. I got mad at her for getting mad at me, because she couldn't answer a simple 'yes or no' question. I'm not even going to bother write out what she said to me. I tried my best not to raise my voice, and just reinforce that all I asked was whether you will clean it. It's actually insane how one person can be so stubborn and pig-headed. This sort of clash happens daily. She just throws a tantrum when someone asks her to do a simple task that every human being living under a roof should do.

My mum and dad usually just tell me to be quiet and leave her alone, which makes no fucking sense to me. It infuriates me how they just let her behave like this, and always excuse it by saying 'you're older and you are fighting with a 14 year old... blah blah blah'. I don't fight with her, I try to discipline her but obviously that doesn't work because she doesn't listen to me.

In terms of friends, she back chats everyone, even her own friends, and the stuff she talks about then is really disgusting -- only to be all cutesy when she's around them. She recently made a ""diss track"" about two girls in her highschool, and it was the most depraved shit I've ever heard come out of a 14 years old mouth, absolutely embarrassing too. She spread it around her school and said everyone thinks it is cool. My older sister and I urged and begged her not to spread that dumb shit around, but she told us to shut up 'coz its ... cool........' and that 'everyone likes it.' It's literally just her bullying two girls. It's horrible. I don't ever remember bullying, or being rude to kids at that age when I was in high school. I laughed when I heard it, and I think this offended her. But it's hard not to laugh when you hear something you'd expect you never would come out of your 14 year old sisters mouth, when we were definitely raised better not to be like that.

What the heck do I do? Am I the asshole? Am I doing something wrong? I have run out of options. I've asked my parents to take her to therapy. I believe she has a personality disorder, or something like that.. but I don't think I articulated everything well, and in fact, I've left out a lot of other important details but I feel like this is too much and I'm starting to feel a bit guilty for posting about her -- but I've really lost all hope lol. It's really hard for me to go to university, and do things I love when she's constantly screaming or putting me in a bad mood, and if shes not doing that, she's listening to music in her room at 100% volume, and if I ask her to turn it down coz im studying, she tells me to close my door. Nice.

tl;dr My little sister has major attitude problems, and I am starting to really dislike her.",09Apr2019,1

202,"(Mobile format)

I recently started at a new job(high school job minimum wage) like most jobs there is one main clique that essentially everyone wants to be a part of. Me and two of my friends who started working before me are all partially in this group in the way that we get invited to things sometimes but only if convenient for the rest of the group.  Example: everyone goes out to eat after work, we only get invited if we are working that night or we are at work for some other reason where as everyone else comes up to work before close to go to eat. This group is going on a big trip to another state in the summer as a number of them are seniors in highschool and want to go on one last fun trip. Me and my friends were only invited because they didn’t have enough people to afford the air BnB. 

I just came from a highschool sport where this dynamic was so extremely present and I was so extremely on the outside of it that when I first started getting invited to things with this work group I was so excited. Then I started realizing that they post everything they do on social media without any regard for the people who aren’t in the group seeing it. They will post something that the inner-inner circle will be doing in the group chat while the rest of us half-in half-outs are confused. My friend asked what was going on and nobody responded and the ringleader pm’d him and told him it was dumb to ask. 
When talking to all of these people individually and not together they are all fine and easy to be around and you don’t feel excluded but that doesn’t excuse anything.

Part of me feels so shitty for being a part of this group in the first place, but I know if I leave the group then work will be miserable. The other part of me really wants to continue to get closer to the inner circle so I am more accepted. I hate that part of me for wanting so badly to be accepted to a group that is so toxic. I feel like a coward for not saying anything about how toxic they are because I know if I do then I’m out of the group forever because I have no power as someone who just started and work will be miserable. 

Does anyone have any advice on how I could decide what choice to make in this situation? Should I stay or leave? Should o try to incorporate more people intro the group or should I start a whole other group? I just don’t know",09Apr2019,1

204,"(I'm 19M 6ft1 and I have always had this, but it never concerned me before this and I thought it'd go away after a few days of dealing with it... apparently not.)

So as a developer I afinally decided to buy into the hype and connect my spare monitor for side-by-side use. In theory it sounds *extremely* useful. For me, in practice, not so much. My brain is a fan... but my neck isn't. I've tried 3 configurations:

* Monitor 1 centered, Monitor 2 right side
* Monitor 1 centered, Monitor 2 left side
* [Both monitors evenly centered](https://monitorfanatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/dual-monitors-800x416.png) (poor wording? what do you call that)

I gave the first 2 a couple days each, and now I've been using both evenly centered, all day at work for almost 7 days now. My problem has maaaybe improved a *slight* bit, but it's still pretty terrible:

I can sort of compare the feeling to ""eye strain"" from looking at a bright screen too long in a dark room. Turning my head around 10 to 20 degrees in either direction is moderately uncomfortable, turning over 20 degrees is *very* uncomfortable for my neck. **It doesn't hurt at all,** there's absolutely no pain whatsoever, but it's quite uncomfortable and distracting. It feels ""tired"" or ""strained"" even though it really shouldn't. It feels like it takes a non-trivial amount of conscious, physical effort to look off-center; as soon I relax my neck it strongly gravitates back to center like it ""wants"" to be there.

This isn't something that becomes a problem after doing it for awhile either, glancing at the very far edge of my secondary screen for even a couple of seconds to peek at information can be a bit uncomfortable. I have always paid attention to my posture (especially the last 2 weeks), even if my posture isn't perfect it's definitely above average.

I don't have a hunchback or forward neck. My monitors are 22"" and ~1.6 feet away from my face. I've tried doing neck stretches and paying extra attention to posture and relaxing. None of this helps. The problem is somehow still there and it's annoying the shit out of me, what the hell is going on?

***

It's doesn't seem to be actual muscle tightness, it's not from sleeping a certain way, it's not from exercise, and it's not painful or sore. It's just a super fucking uncomfortable fatiguing feeling, like eye strain. It's hard to find anything about this, everything is about the former mentions.

I like the idea of using 2 monitors but I just can't go on like this! I would go to the doctor right now but money and shit. Maybe later. Thanks USA.

I'd say im slightly overweight (thicc), covered in cellulite, lots of stretch marks, and bruises from walking a lot/just general redness and skin imperfections. Oh yeah, and shitty tan lines.

And the other day he overheard me friend zoning some guy I never hung out with or even really talked to. 

Then on later, I ask him about his emotions then he friend-zones me? Is he messing with me? Just flirting for fun? I find out he isn’t as himself as I think, that maybe he just wants to set an impression. And it worked awhile back, because I found him different and interesting.",09Apr2019,1
212,"I’m a 15 year on female in high school and I want to know how I can eat healthier before health problems bite me in the ass later in life. 

One thing that is important to note is that either I’m not used to normal tastes or my taste buds are sensitive (i’m not really sure). I’ve never been able to enjoy vegetables because of the tastes and textures of them. Yes, I have tried multiple ways of cooking multiple vegetables and my parents have tried everything. The only way they can get me to eat vegetables are to put them in smoothies or eating soup. 

Most vegetables either have an extreme bitter taste or a horrible texture to me (most of the time both). I enjoy most fruits, but some fruits like strawberries are too strong for me if I eat them directly. I don’t really know why I haven’t adjusted, or why I’m still sensitive to these flavors.

I was born in LA and most of my closest family lives there who I love very much, but my parents already had their lives back in Mexico so I've lived here all my life but I visit my family every summer. I love being in LA so much and for years I've known that I want to live and form my life there but a few months ago I got accepted to college and I was very happy about it.

However, it's been about a week that I started doubting that **a lot** and have thought if moving there really is the best choice.

I've lived my whole life in Mexico, I have my dearest friends here who I don't want to lose, I know I'll keep in touch with them but still, I'd love to attend college with them or just live in the same city (a lot of them are moving to one city and it's a great place). I'm a very shy introverted person and I've actually never formed a friendship with anyone over there and I get so nervous even while ordering food, not like this is a dealbreaker but I know how uncomfortable and closed I get while this. The cultural differences are HUGE, I know LA has a big latino population and culture but it's obviously not the same.

But there's also a very big problem here, I don't know how far I can get with my major, I want to study programming, and in Mexico I dont know if there's a big field of opportunities for that, there's always unemployment problems in Mexico anyways but for this I don't know how it'll play out; the city I want to live is one of the most modern cities and one of the biggest economic regions in Mexico and half of the people there are young students (also a point because I know how many people will move there), maybe this can help with my profession but I have my doubts.

I figured this new job would help ignite my love for my career again. I made the leap and moved and I hate it. The job is actually even better than I imagined. My boss is incredibly kind and genuinely wants us to be better. She takes time out of her day to help me improve and it is better than any job I could have asked for. The only problem is that the passion isn’t there anymore. I’m not excited about it and I can’t wait for the day to be done as soon as it starts.

219,"Backround: Im M18 and im dating a F18, and I have been for about 2ish weeks

$BF refers to the aforemention and yet to be described best friend F20  
$GF Refers to my girlfriend, f18

&amp;#x200B;

How I met $BF:  


I was introduced to $BF through $Mutual\_friend. And we conversed over the interwebs for about 6 months to 1 year. This was back in 2016/2017. We never met in person, even though we literally lived in the same city. Over this time, we built a deep emotional connection. We were both still single and I was in highschool, I was 16-17 she was 18-19. There was this spoken but unacted upon love for eachother, and neither of us built up the courage to ask the other out. Things happened with her family, they were kind of strict etc, and she stopped talking to me for 1.5-2 years. I felt really sad and I had lost my best friend. I had gotten out of a relationship that was pretty emotionally abusive and all she did was use me. After that happened, I kindof wanted my best friend to talk to again. So I tried to contact her through usual channels, and asked $mutual\_friend for a way to contact her. When I did, i wasnt recieved well. She had a boy friend, she said that she didnt want to talk to me because I ""made her feel guilty"" etc (probably because she still loved me but she was in a relationship.) and she eventually blocked me. This was about 3 months ago.   


Incomes $GF who is great. We have been dating for 2 weeks, we went on 1 date, and ive visited her at school a few times. She was also in a play which I went to.   


Recently She has been moving things pretty fast, today she said she wrote me a song, and in it she said she loved me. Now this is after 1 date, keep in mind. I dont exactly have a commitment to her yet?? IDK but we are dating. She is commiting to me HARD and it is freaking me out.   


Now naturally, I call up $BF. I was thinking she was still dating her boyfriend, and I wanted a friend to talk to. I was hoping that the fact that I now have $GF will clear up the ""im only talking to you because i still like you, not because i need a friend"" and OF COURSE... she is single. Now this girl, is perfect for me in nearly every way. and I still have feelings for her. I hadnt intended to try to cause a fissure between me and $GF  


So in essence, I REALLY LIKE $BF and We have a deep emotional connection and mesh together so well. on the otherhand $GF is trying to commit, and go really fast, but i wanna go slow. Its scaring me. None the less I still like $GF, and I would want to be in a relationship with her, if $BF wasnt in the picture. Basically here is how I feel. I want to keep $GF in my backpocket while i see how things play out with $BF. The problem is, That isnt fair to $GF and I dont want to use her. HOWEVER, I want to be with $BF. yet, im not willing to let go of $GF either. IDK what to do, and I dont exactly want to go with the ""I found someone else."" The frustrating part is, im not totally sold on the idea of even breaking up with $GF ATM.   


Also side note: I met $GF working for her Mom, who is in a band I am the sound guy for. So me dumping her has more fallout than just her being sad. (i dont want to make her sad)",09Apr2019,0
220,Okay so I was best friends with this girl(17) and we eventually dated after 1½ month. But then she wasn't ready and kept getting mood swings for the entire relationship. She broke up with me after 1½ month saying she needs to fix her self first and we distanced ourselves for a month. We then began talking a bit and decided we'd go back to being besties but nothing has been the same. She then cut contact with everyone (all her close friend from school &amp; her area) except one guy(22) who is a close family friend of hers so I don't suspect anything. She even went off social media today saying she doesn't want social contact for a while. But I find out she made a new account and follows him and 2 other meme pages. I'm just hurt that I got replaced even after we decided we would stay friends. I feel very hurt but she told me we will get back to that once she's fine and can think straight. I just want my friend back :(,09Apr2019,1
221,"I'm 18f and I'm currently in university studying psychology but I really want to be a songwriter/producer.

226,"Ok so let me first start off by saying I've had a few drinks and tokes tonight, Feeling good. 

I met up with an old friend tonight, I hadn't seen her in 7 years. We had some drinks and decided to go back to my parents place (where I'm living right now) and had some dinner and wine.

We watched music videos with my dad, singing along to Queen and dancing, she had a blast. 

We had veggie dinner and wine with my mom, followed by some music videos I wanted to show her, she was laughing and we would always touch each other when we felt really connected, just a light touch on the leg or shoulder.

We got more drunk, smoked, and went on a walk to the elementary school next door for a swing (it's 930 pm on a Monday.). We laughed more and hugged, and we told eachother than we are bi. She said she has been in a poly relationship with a man and woman before, and it was interesting to me.

She told me she has kissed her friends (non intimate) on the lips when saying goodbye. But when she went to leave, I gave her a kiss, and she pulled in for more. Then twice after, we parted, and she pulled me back for a kiss. 

She got in her car, and the last thing she said was ""Oh my God I'm so turned on right now, bye"". 

Ahhh I'm so intruiged, she makes me excited and happy. I've never been with a girl.

Basically, I would love to ask, how should I persue this? 
Do I just pounce on her when I see her next? Should I take it slow since I've never been with a girl?

He told me that we can start going places to start his process to the weight loss. I told him that he needs to eat healthier and take his dog out on long walks.

But we were so young we didn’t care, and would text and FaceTime a lot. I really liked her, even used to sing to her. *cringes*
But after a while we didn’t speak as much, I got a new girl and we didn’t speak much after that.

But last year we started speaking a lot, but she has a boyfriend. Not like it mattered we used to be really flirty over the phone and we sent each other nudes and stuff. I wasn’t falling for her because it wouldn’t work but after 2 weeks of chatting she blocked me from all her socials and IMessage. 
So I’m like oh okay, whatever.

Then a few months pass she unblocks me starts speaking to again, she says she blocked me bc she’s scared her boyfriend will see the messages. I don’t care that she blocked me I just wanted to speak to her again. We still are super sexual when we speak and continue sexting. And then after a week or two she blocks me again. 
Now I’m annoyed bc she’s just blocking me out of nowhere.

Then she hits me up again recently asking if I’m mad, I am being a complete idiot say “nah it’s all good, how you been?” 
Like a fucking idiot, I just wanted to talk to her you know. We still are incredibly sexual when we speak and have really R rated FaceTime calls. 
But then yesterday she blocks me again after a month of talking.

232,"Hey guys for soon-to-be obvious reasons I am using a throwaway account to ask for this advice involving a situation with my girlfriends sister that may have occurred the other weekend.  I have finally built the courage to post to this subreddit so I am hoping people could do their best to reserve judgement as I understand how unethical my potential actions were. To briefly set the scene my girlfriend and I were visiting her sister at school for the weekend out of town and decided it would be easiest to get a hotel. On the Saturday night after the bars had closed the three of us and another couple decided we wanted to go back to the hotel to keep hanging out/drinking, this was most likely decided on since we had a nice suite at the hotel with enough room for everyone to sleep if needed. 


After some time my girlfriend had fallen asleep and the other couple we were with had fallen asleep as well in the second isolated room of our suite. My girlfriends sister and I had stayed up for another couple hours into the early morning to keep talking and listening to music. This isn’t necessarily abnormal as I have a pretty close relationship with my girlfriends family. 

It is also important to note that all of us had been drinking pretty heavily through out the night and into the morning and the events that I believe followed are very difficult for me to recall. At some point we must have decided that it was time to go to bed. I would sleep with my girlfriend in one bed and the sister fell asleep on another separate bed. Again I have a very difficult time recalling the end of the night and making the decision to go to sleep. However, at some point (perhaps in hour or so after going to bed) I woke up in the bed my girlfriends sister was sleeping in with her. I do not know how I ended up in her bed but when I woke up we were doing what I guess could be described as cuddling. What also should be noted is that I was in somewhat of a dream state and am now even second guessing if this happened. I am thinking that this did happen due to the fact that I can vividly recall the shock I felt when I realized I was in bed with her with my hands on her. I got up and quietly apologized  to her and she responded by saying that it was okay and then we both went back to sleep in our original beds. While in someways I can vividly recall this happening, I was also pretty drunk and some of it is blurry (maybe it is because I don’t want to believe this is something I was capable of doing). 

Anyway my advice I am seeking is if I should confront the sister at some point on my own and ask if she recalls this happening? My concern would be that if the small chance this was just a weird lucid dream that I would jeopardize the close relationship I have with the sister by even bringing something like this up. I apologize for the long post and do not want to sound like I was using the alcohol as an excuse for my actions. This is not something I have done before or have even thought about it which is why I am confused on what I should do next, as it keeps crossing my mind.",09Apr2019,2
233,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I will try to change the story a bit in case the individual responsible lurks around here. 

I quoted the word racist because I am not sure if the incident qualifies as such or if it is a case of discrimination. I guess you all will be the judge of that.

Anyways, I met up with a group from one of my university classes several days ago. To be frank, it was a sizable group (~15 people). We had to collaborate on a project showcasing the lack of water in several African countries and how Western countries aid these locations. 

Our group started discussing a “hip” way to introduce this topic. Essentially, we would record a classmate donating materials or to a monetary fund and then we would show the child or adult in the country receiving water. 

None of my groupmates made any racist remarks, except for one. Some people volunteered to do the scene. Then someone suggests that I act as the African child and then starts laughing hysterically. 

This person then tried to apologize and dismiss their behavior as simply being a “jackass”, stating, “that’s the way I was raised”(?). Something around those lines. I tried to shrug it off so that I would not come across as weak and sensitive but deep down, it definitely hurt me, as much as I wish it did not. 

This kind of behavior is quite common in the Hispanic community, where I am from as well as the majority of my groupmates. They expect you to take the blows they throw at you. I understand that this happens a lot within groups of friends but I hardly know this person from the minimal interactions we have had. 

Some people laughed in disbelief at what this person said. I felt embarrassed, uncomfortable and humiliated. Being the darkest person in the room already made me feel like an outsider and this only added insult to the injury. 

Perhaps I am being a bit too melodramatic about this but I had a similar incident happen to me when I was ~6 and it has haunted me to this day. No one likes to be humiliated for their skin color (or so I assume). 

What can I do to prevent situations like these from getting to me? Some people have an awakening later in life where they become immune to people like this. I hope to one day develop this way of thinking. For those who have faced situations where you were humiliated in front of people, had derogatory names thrown at you, etc., what made you immune to it?",09Apr2019,1
234,"So when I was 4 I broke my elbow. I needed surgery and so I got it. It was around 2008 when I broke it. I needed two surgeries, one to put a metal pin and to take it out. I don't remember much but I remember the Doctor saying that I will never be able to make it go straight again, and that it would be a (little) painful. So years go by and my elbow begins to hurt more and more to the point where I can't handle the pain. But I kept quiet because I thought it was normal for pain to happen. I couldn't handle the pain anymore so I asked to see the doctors. I got Xrays and MRIs and then met the best joint doctor (I will call him BD) and he looks at my MRI and says ""Who did (Me) surgery?"" 
At that point I realized the doctor who operated on my arm in 2008 messed up my elbow. BD said that My Cartilage hasn't healed at all and that the only thing supporting my elbow was a loose bone. Now I have to go to another state to get a opinion on what they will do to my arm. Basic Surgeries will not stop my pain because the doctor in 2008 messed it all up. What do I do?

Hi everyone,

First of all, thank you to anyone that responds.

These past few years have been very hard on me (nobody's fault but my own and I accept that). To begin, I am 22 year old male. I currently attend a University (US) in hopes to get a degree and make something of myself. Here are some of the problems I am currently facing:

&amp;#x200B;

\- 2 years ago I was arrested 4 times (8 total since I was 16) I have roughly 10 charges on my record (serious and simple misdemeanors; DUIs, Poss. charges and a few random other non violent offenses)

\- I have lost my license for 6 years due to my two DUIs, poss. charges and a repeat 

\- My mother and father are hardcore drug addicts (Dad- meth, Mom- terminal brain disease/hardcore opiate addiction)

\- I am almost failing out of school, it has never been my cup of tea, but I'm desperate to make it work

\- I have an incredibly hard time obtaining a job due to my driving restriction and criminal record 

\- I am diagnosed and suffer from Pure O-OCD, Major Depression and General Anxiety

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like my life falls apart due to my past no matter how hard I try. I sold drugs for a majority of my teen years (14-21 to be exact), but I no longer do. I'm trying to keep my life positive and avoid crime any further. I have existential problems such as ""What am I on this Earth for?"" and shit like that, but I'm more concerned about the time being currently. 

I can't find a decent job, I try in school but its not for me and I feel like I'm simply wasting money at this point... I can't even see any of my family due to not driving (college is 4 hours away from all family). If i were to drive it would cost me roughly $3,000 a year for my breathalyzer and insurance (no, I am not exaggerating, that is the price to pay). 

I have a very hard time earning and ESPECIALLY saving money. My path currently feels very on track to being a 35 year old fuckup. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. Financially, emotionally or anything of the sort. I went to rehab and don't do hard drugs anymore, I haven't been arrested in 2 years (3 if it wasn't for a past due warrant), I try very hard to stay straight and eventually make something of myself... But I can't do it alone anymore. I can't use my girlfriend as a personal therapist and the family doesn't call anymore (I don't have a lot of friends, I don't necessarily consider it an issue, but I may be wrong).

Your advice would be so generous and I will always be in debt to you kind strangers.

  
Thank you.

237,"Hello fellow pals! My name is Ryan Sinclair. I’ve recently achieved the first steps of landing my dream job as being hired as a tattoo apprentice. I’ve been with the shop for a few months and done a handful of tattoos which I’m very proud of, the only problem I face now is deciding the perfect name for my Instagram/Facebook page. Our studio relies heavily on social media to get our work out there, and almost 80% of the artists clientele come through their social media accounts. I know this isn’t exactly a life or death decision, but I would really appreciate getting the opinions of some people to see which potential name would be the most eye-catching and memorable.
I am tossing up between a few names such as; (rysin-tattoo) (ryansin-tattoo) (rsin-tattoo) (rsinner-tattoo) or any alterations. So if you want to help a very indecisive fool pick his name or even pitch in a few others, I will be forever grateful. Thankyou",09Apr2019,1

242,"My friend (f20) isn't able to move on from her ex. 

A little context: she falls in love very, very deeply and is often obsessive with whom ever she dates. She was interested in a guy in high school and when nothing came of it, it took her 3 years to get over that crush. She dated her ex, whom she met in college, for around 8 months, but broke up because he was going to transfer to a University over 2 hours away (he did not want to try long distance.) 

A little more context: about a two weeks after she broke up with him (he made her do it since he said he couldn't say/do it himself), her ex began dating one of her friends in the same program as her and would try to hide it. This destroyed her even more than the break-up itself.

Given this, its been over a year, almost a year and a half, since she broke up with him and I can understand why and how much she was hurt and why it would take longer from her to heal. 

I try to be there for her by listening, checking in on her every now, and then by asking her how her healing is coming/how she feels. 

The things is, nothing has changed. She says the pain is still fresh and that it feels like it just happened. I don't know what to say to her to help her. Ive told her to take her time and focus on herself and she has. 

Multiple guys have come to her and have asked her for her number, but she isnt ready to move on. I dont want her to miss out on something amazing. I just dont know what to do or say to her to help her.

244,"I live in Arizona. 
Long story so I’ll try and sum it up. 
- company is B to B wants to be B to C
- they hire web designer who copies 90% of content from competitor 
- I teach myself web design and redo site so it’s not copyrighted 
- I signed NDA with previous employer and this new employer constantly pressures me to break this by asking me to provide multiple documents so they can copy for new business structure 
- person starting new B to C is an older man and I am a 25 yo female. He has asked me three times to visit out of state location to see warehouse and vet employees and I have declined because of bad gut feeling and fear that he plans we will share hotel room and I am out that cost to get me own. He also insists we carpool in his vehicle to off site meetings. He touches my shoulder/arm when he talks to me and looks over my shoulder which makes me uncomfortable. Last conference call I was sitting and he sat next to me where our legs were touching until I moved from him. 
- they do not have an HR so their makeshift ‘HR’ did not know I worked for the company until 3 days after I started. 
- they did not pay me my full paycheck last pay period and when I addressed the situation it turned into a hostile environment where he yelled at me for 30+ minutes and was so disappointed that I would ‘question their integrity’
- after that conversation I walked out and did not go back. 
- I had the company computer (which I signed nothing saying I had) and returned it this morning after doing a reset to wipe it. 
- (I know nothing about the law) he sent me an email at 8:30pm this evening telling me if I do not send all files to him for the new company (forms I made as well as forms from previous employer that I can’t share) that he will file a police report on me and the cops will come to my house and arrest me. 
I have never been in any legal trouble, never even pulled over and I’m terrified. I don’t know what to do. I can send the files in an email but they owe me about $2k and I’ll have no leverage to get me check. (I did not sign any wage agreement or anything other than a W-2, I know, I’m an idiot).

252,"First off I ONLY have manic depression and anxiety. Things have gotten better after coping healthier but this one thing has stuck with me all my life since elementary school. 

So there is me (19F) , the sweet nice side, and there is this dark side of me I can’t control and that’s what has been with me the longest. 

So the sweet nice side is sociable, friendly, and popular with everyone in my community. All animals love me and neighbors praise me for being a good kid. 

The dark side is going home and having the urge or impulse to do something not so good to those that love me or anyone. I look down on my own mother, my entire environment I despise. I wish bad awful things secretly on people and laugh in my mind. My cousin may be wrongly indicted recently and I had the urge to laugh about it thinking he should suffer. It’s like I have this thing with suffering to make myself feel valued. 

I purposely out people so they can be rejected. I’ve excluded the weaker links and stole and cheated,etc. I lie 24/7 about anything to anyone including my family and I hate it. I can’t control the lying where I just say things to be accepted. I never had friends because it was obvious I was trying to fit in and be accepted and went as far as exploiting myself online, drugs, sexual favors, abusing myself and just a lot. I regret lying in the pay so I LIE even more to do better which is worse. 

I like to dress sexual so women can stare and men can want me. When they don’t I know someone does. I alter whatever people want me to look like. 

This doesn’t effect my schooling I am in the honors program and very active on campus. 

But last year, I dated this guy who sexually assaulted me and I purposely stayed with him because I felt it was my fault for him doing it so I stayed and even faked killing my self so he could stay. He didn’t and I raged at him. That was the moment I knew there was something wrong with me. I think I’m somewhat better than everyone but really know I’m a piece of shit. 

I just made a real true friend recently and I’m catching feelings for him because he reminds me of the good me. His so beautiful and intelligent. But the dark side keeps talking to me. Any advice or ideas of what’s happening or what I should do? I don’t know if I can forgive myself for ruining this one chance.

256,"So I am nearly done my second year of college. I'm studying a bachelor of arts in criminal justice (half law and the other half made up from sociology, politics and public administration). My exams are in three weeks time and then I will be going on to do full time work experience, unpaid, in a field not at all relating to my course, for 9 months, and then I'll have a year and a half left until finishing college. 

Since I've started college, I haven't felt settled. Like, I don't necessarily belong, I've struggled a lot with assignments and studying. I've hated every single module I've taken so far, and looking at the modules for next year I'm not looking forward to them. I find I cannot learn in the college lecture environment and took to just not going in and teaching myself the course. That slowly stopped as I started working full time hours at my current job, and I find I'm a lot less stressed and I don't miss college in any way. In fact, I'm kind of relieved I don't have to go in now and I have an excuse to not go (working). 

The more I think about it, the more I want to drop out and work full time. For a lot of reasons - The stress, the strain, me just not feeling right, the toll on my mental health and physical health, etc. My mum, who is very serious about education, wants me to stay. I'm only staying in college because she's told me to, because I'm so scared of her reaction if I really drop out. She didn't have the opportunity to go to college, as much as she would have loved it, and she has struggled her whole life with crap jobs and an abusive family, leaving school at 16 so she could work and sustain her family full time(she would have to pay for bills/cook dinner/etc with her wages for her dad and two older siblings), she's had a shitty adult life having an abusive man as a husband for 12years (my dad) and when she finally left him having a string of dates until settling on another not great guy as a boyfriend for another couple years. They've split up now, and she's on her own and depressed at home. My younger sister is there but in her final year of school before college, so isn't around a lot as she is studying a lot, and my mum is in a crappy not well paid, insanely stressful job so she's pretty exhausted in the evenings and weekends. 

I have already broached the subject with my mum, who's response was a number of the following reasons; it's only another two years, you'll have wasted two years of your life, all you have to do is pass, you don't have to enjoy it, it's a good opportunity, you'll have a better life because of it, when you're done you'll be glad you stuck it out, it's a test of endurance. 

No matter what, I don't feel college is right for me. And the more I think about it, the more I feel I'm only staying in college because of my mum. I really do hate what I'm doing, and more than that I hate the whole ""college experience"". I've made some incredible friends there who I know will stay my friends even if I left. How do I explain me leaving college as a serious idea to my mum in a way that she won't disown me? (Kinda a joke but also kinda serious, I'm real scared)",09Apr2019,1

258,"Hi, I'm still shaky on all of the details on this. This is happening in Las Vegas (actually, Henderson). This morning, my mom wrote in our family group text that my grandmother received a phone call from an unknown man saying my uncle is going to France. She hung up and called my uncle and the call answered, was hung up and texted ""he is going to Europe and his sister is not waiting at the airport"". He was supposed to pick my mom up from the airport today. The police said if he wasn't at the airport to let them know and they'll file a missing person's report, even though we advised her not to get in with him if he was. Sure enough, he was not there to pick up my mom in the evening so my grandmother did.

He was last heard from 8pm a day ago in text talking about my mom flying in. His car is missing. He was supposed to have a doctor's appointment this morning but we're not sure if he made it or not because we aren't sure where. My mom's cousin called a lot of hospitals in Vegas and none had him. The police were called to do a walkthrough with my mom. They first dealt with a call of a dead person in his adjacent neighbor's condo (apparently unrelated?). When they finished that call they said they would not open the door to his condo as his car was not there. They said they would file a missing person's report but couldn't do anything because they couldn't be sure that my U=uncle willingly left or just didn't want to meet with my mom even though my mom and my grandmother tried to explain that this is not normal behavior for him and he has never done anything like this before. We suspect he was abducted and will maybe be killed or held for ransom. I personally don't think it's possible for them to take him to France through our airport security.

Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 25, British and lacking in several areas, for which I am seeking advice. I have a bittersweet life where I have a good family and live in a good area but I have barely any friends, no partner and several autoimmune issues which inflict on my life daily.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have had jobs primarily in teaching and have worked mostly in EFL, though I have certainly been through the mill in in other jobs too. Recently I sat down to really think about my situation. I have no professional dedication or interest in any particular area, I'm currently in landscaping but work is work to me and I've not got any personal investment in it. As such this led me to the liberating conclusion that I might as well get into a field which is well paid, irrespective of the training and study which maybe required for it. I figure that I should work now for a possible decent future, possible early retirement, good savings etc, otherwise I will probably end up doing something I regret or radically changing my life for the worse.

&amp;#x200B;

So primarily I'm asking for advice on a professional field to get into. My hobbies are the typical kind whereby making a living from them is just a pipe dream and I'm past it, so I don't see the point in pursuing those. Despite my earlier description I am still physically fit and have a Bachelor's degree, so I'm not just a dolt. I'm willing to put the effort in but I want to put it into something which is likely to have a good return on my investment. Most careers open to me right now are dreary, suck-ass dead-end jobs where I won't feel needed or accomplished in any way.

&amp;#x200B;

If you yourself cannot give direct advice then I'm certainly open to other subreddits/websites etc.

Thanks for taking the time to read this. All the best.

He texted me when he got home from work today, he seemed pretty happy. He was talking about the pizza he was having for dinner and seemed fairly normal. He's usually pretty cheerful. All of a sudden he told me he was really upset about something. He said his parents might make him quit his job (that he really likes) because of his grades and they won't make an effort to get him help for his mental health. I asked if there was anything i could do and told him im here for him and i love him. I gave him some time to calm down and then checked in on him about an hour or so later to see if he was ok, he said he was feeling a bit better. Later on in the night, he called me like usual (we fall asleep on the phone together every night) he was really quiet. He's not usually like that and i was a bit worried. I asked how his day went and he said ""eh"" and nothing else. He'll usually tell me about his day. He never said anything without me initiating and didn't give me more than one word answers. I asked him if he was ok again and he said yes. There was a long pause and then i said ""i love you"" and he didn't say anything. He usually says it back and it stung a little but i figured he probably just fell asleep cause from what i could tell, he sounded tired. However, this is unlike him too because he'll usually tell me when he wants to go to sleep. I went to bed and woke up around 2 am (i never sleep through the night) and i heard what i thought was him waking up and he hung up the phone. Maybe he just rolled over onto it, its happened before but it just seems different. He seems different. I'd like to think that i know him pretty well, he's my best friend and the love of my life. He kept saying he was fine but i can't help but feel like he's not telling the truth. I sent him a text saying he didn't have to lie about being ok if he wasn't but it's late and i doubt he'll see it till morning. What do i do? Is there any way i can help? Im really worried.

265,"this is lengthy, i apologise!

my ex boyfriend broke up with me four days ago. he told me he just couldn't handle a relationship right now and that he just wanted to be alone. he stated that he doesn't know if he loves me, however he literally hasn't felt anything as of late (he has severe depression so this has happened to him before). he told me that he stopped feeling for me 9 days prior to the breakup, when he had tried to break up with me previously for the same reason (wasn't ready for a relationship). 

leading up to the first breakup, he had been as affectionate as always, still told me how much he loved me, still kissed and hugged me and still wanted to spend a great deal of time with me. the only thing that was different that he wasn't really interested in sex anymore, however we did still have sex occasionally and i did still turn him on. his reasoning for this was depression, which i understand as my sex drive drops to zero when i'm depressed.

what sparked that previous breakup was a fight we had where i ended up in hysterics (i'm very ashamed of this) after which he told me he couldn't handle being a relationship right now as his mental health was too bad.

we talked it through properly and he told me that he loved me so much that he would compromise his mental health for me and would stay.
despite my begging for him not to do that because all i truly want is for him to be happy, that's what ended up happening.

after this point his affections began to die down greatly. he eventually told me that my kisses had been making him uncomfortable since the first breakup and he felt pressured into being affectionate. i expressed that this was okay and i would hold back while we worked through it.

fast forward three days, we ended up in yet another fight because i was scared of him going home in case he left me. i cried a fair bit, but i thought we had worked it out. he then proceeded to leave and take all of his stuff home. 

the next two days after that were fine, then we had another fight but he insisted we stay together because he loved me. the next two days seemed fine again and he had even began to be more affectionate with me. then four days ago, he broke up with me (which he told me he had been planning to do since the first breakup anyway)

now the biggest problem here, in my eyes is that, we had no space apart from each other leading up to either of these. leading up to the first breakup, we had had three days apart the previous week, but had been texting and calling each other the whole time.
leading up to the second one, we had one day apart, where we again, texted and called the entire time.

prior to both of these, we'd spent two months together with about three days total apart, which i think was a terrible idea. he has insisted and kept consistent with the fact that his feelings literally just stopped the day we first broke up and what is sort of interesting, is that a similar thing happened to me a few months back.

one day, during a period where we had been spending every day together and when i was deep in depression, i woke up and i suddenly didn't feel ANYTHING when i looked at my ex. i panicked and ended up having an actual discussion with him about it (again, bad idea!!!), however we stayed together and after we had spent some time apart the feelings came rushing back. 

so i'm curious, is it possible that he still loves me and that this is similar to what i experienced a few months back and that we just need some time apart for him to feel again? or can somebody really just fall out of love at the drop of a hat like that?

thanks in advance.",09Apr2019,1
266,"A close family member that I really respected and loved had passed this past January, because where they asked to be buried was frozen our family decided to wait till summer for them to be able to bury them. So their funeral is a week after my birthday. I’m turning 20 this year and can already feel the “I’m no longer a teen I’m just ‘adult’ my childhood is dead” (I realize that 20 is still young but it’s still the “no longer a teen” thing is what hits me). And with that I comes with what I plan on doing for my birthday. I don’t consider myself that social I have a small group of friends but nothing that’s massive, and some of them are going to be out of town on my birthday. In the past I usually spent it with family and a couple of friends but I live several states away from family and traveling isn’t really an option. So I’ve been getting more and more depressed about my birthday as it plays into the “I’m not a kid anymore” realization, as childish as this seems, I miss having those kind of birthday parties I had in high school which was just my friends and family, but add that with the constant circling thought of that this is the first birthday I’m going to have where I don’t get a happy birthday call from the family member that has passed. And this just thinking about it makes me cry. There’s a part of me that just wants to forget the day and spend it alone knowing full well that I will depress myself because that’s how I spent my birthday but I don’t know what to do. I live in a small college town so there’s very little I can do. And the more I think about it the more depressed I become. All of this lead up is eventually going to lead to my questions.

Is it normal to be this depressed about your birthday?  
Is it normal for me just to cry about it over and over?

267,"Hey so Im mostly look for people who have already studied online for advice but I don't mind other people chiming in. So since January 6th the pain in my pelvis is... The fucking worst. I've become better at dealing with it but going to my school is still too far and the bus ride kills me because its so bumpy. I really miss studying and even working(don't miss the friends, but that's another story entirely). Is studying online as incrwisblh hard as everyone says or is it like doing homework as I can imagine???? Like everyone tells me I need so much self disapline and so much focus, but that's coming from people who I know can't concentrate at home and who I know are bad at doing homework. These people are huge extraverts who need people around them. So yeah I just need to know if it really is that hard adn if I can get some extra advice I wouldn't mind. Thank you.",09Apr2019,1
268,"Today at my school, our teacher asked us to swap a paragraph we'd just written with the person sitting next to us in class. , which happened to be a new friend I'd made. When I handed it back, I joked ""You got on A+"". He went ""Wow, an A+ from sirchris69?? Amazing!"". I didn't quite realize he'd been sarcastic until I repeated it to my brother.

Another time, at work, I was explaining to a coworker how to do something, and he said ""You explained that very well. You should be manager"". I didn't realize he'd been taking the piss until another coworker made it obvious they were mocking, ""Oh, sirchris69 is already the manager. He's sooo much better than all of us. Like a million times better""

And here's a big example of one in my life...when I was 6 years old, my teacher told us we were going on a trip to Egypt. I actually literally thought we were going to board a plane and go as some field trip. When she pulled up Egypt on Google Earth, I was taken back that not many other kids seemed to be surprised.

I don't feel as if sarcasm/jokes/etc. go over my head often, it's just the odd time it does that gets me worried. Does this stuff sound strange or can it be normal?",09Apr2019,1
269,"This is a throwaway: My main account has some personal information.

So I maintain a pretty serious open relationship with two girls from school. Both of them are my age (14 and 15) and both are really smart and kind people.

The three of us are best friends and all three of us are bisexual. We do drugs together and we spend most of our time both in and out of school hanging out and doing shit together.  Almost all of my sexual experimentation and sexual activities I’ve done have been with the two of them. 

There have been other guys that have been with them and that they’ve experimented with that’s fine with me their bodies their choice. But recently both of them have revealed to me that they are pregnant, not at the same exact time but within the same week. I don’t know if they told each other but given that we are all very very close I’m guessing they are.

I knew that this was a risk when I started to get sexually active, but I never really thought it would actually happen. One of the girls told me they plan on having an abortion, the other is still panicking and we haven’t talked in a few days. 

I’m smart, I’ve got good grades and a good work ethic. I’d be fine with raising both children if I needed to, but after reading another story on reddit where another guy like me lost the love of his life when she died in childbirth I can’t do that. 

What are my options, testing for fatherhood, government support for helping raise any kids that get kept, I’m not afraid of telling my parents but some help telling them the news in a way that won’t fuck them up.


TLDR: I might have two kids, I’m 15, help.",09Apr2019,6

she destroyed the apartment while moving out. i even went to go to sleep after cleaning and there was a whole bottle of lotion emptied into my comforter so i could sleep in the bed. what can i do to get this bitch back or at least save myself some headache. also utility bills are due in 2 days and she ran off with the money for the bills her and i shared together.

272,"I got slightly tipsy a couple of days ago and ended up talking to a friend of mine who has a pretty out-there and crazy fashion sense. The topic got round to how i look. She thinks I'm pretty plain, which I agree with. She also offered to help me change how I look. I took her up on the offer, because I've been wanting to try something new for a while.

She didnt know I'd had anything to drink, by the way.

She said she'd help me out and give me a makeover on the condition that I let her do whatever she thought would look good, and I promised she could. I think I must have forgotten how crazy she was at that point though, because I wake up the next day to find her texting me pictures of guys with brightly colored mohawks asking if that was something she'd be allowed to do to me.

I really want to honor the promise and let her do whatever she wants, and the thought of making such a big change to how I look is kinda exciting. I think I'd quite like the change. But something so drastic does have me concerned. So should I let her, or should I go back on my word?",09Apr2019,2

276,"My whole life I’ve never really enjoyed school, but I do well in all my classes (90’s). But ever since the the start of my 12th year things have been so stressful cause I have no idea what I wanna do with my life. The thought of working for a living and spending 40+ hours a week in an office or whatever blows my mind. I’d also never want to work for someone, but unfortunately, that’s how most people make their money. So since 2 years ago I discovered that I would not mind becoming an airline pilot. But now, I’m not so sure anymore. There’s a lot of pros and cons with it. The bad parts are how expensive flight training is (100k), the lifestyle is not really a stable one to have a family, as you spend a lot of time away for home, and I’d have to move about 6 hours away from my home to pursue this career. I use to want it really badly, but now I am not so sure. Now that I’m not sure about becoming a pilot, there’s nothing else that I’d wanna do with school. I did get into business at the University of Western Ontario but I’m not really sure I’d like it. So now comes the important part!!!! My mom and I have always been so close, and she’s my only family, as I am for her. Everything she has in the end is mine, as she says. So the house we live in (400k) is technically mine. Anyways what I was thinking for a while now is to just start working full time, even though I don’t have any post secondary education, and start saving all my money. My mom is gonna do the same ( she makes around 60k a year). And as of right now, together we have saved up 90k. We barely spend any money -  I don’t buy much stuff. Soooo what I was thinking is to start working at the bank in a call centre (she can get me a job there as she works there) and they pay 19/hour to start and it can go up to $30 depending on seniority. So what I was thinking was to work there full time, and get another job also and try my best to work 70-80 hours weekly ( I know, crazy). But then hopefully I could have made 40-50k by the end of the year, plus my moms income. Then next step —— buy properties! I’ve always wanted to be my own boss, so being a landlord would be such a good job. Sure it will take lots of hard work to get all the money to buy like 3 properties, but once it’s done, I won’t have to work, as the rental properties will give me income every month and then I can live my best life. Where we live rent is expensive and like I could make 1500-2000 a month depending on the house I rent out. So obviously this plan is kinda crazy but I feel like it’s smarter than going to school but I don’t know to be honest. It would probably take me and my mom 10 years to finish, but I’m only 17 right now so it’s not too bad. Do you guys think this is a good idea? Or should I be going to school? My mom thinks it’s a smart plan, but she would rather me study business, but I really don’t care about that.",09Apr2019,1

She’s been sick for almost a week leading up to this but it wasn’t this severe. I keep asking her if I can take call the hospital but she threatened me to prevent me from it. I believe it has to do with some financial issues and her believing she’ll get through it. She’s never told me her symptoms in detail.

282,"Hello all!
Using a fairly new account to post this...
I just need some help with deciding what I do next...
I moved to a small town in the south almost 2 years ago. I had moved here with my at the time boyfriend. He had a new job opportunity and we decided together that it was something we wanted to do. We broke up almost a year ago. It was a very difficult break up and it happened for lots of reasons. I got my own place and moved the next town over (still a really small town). I ended meeting someone. It was not a healthy relationship to start. Neither of us had anyone else, no friends or family. We moved in together back in December. 
We got a bigger place together about a month ago, and one of his friends moved across the country and is now living with us. Ever since his friend moved in, things have been very rocky between my current boyfriend and I. Yesterday we got into another argument, and he told me he didn’t want to be with me anymore. I almost feel like because his friend is here now, that he no longer feels he needs me around...
I don’t know what to do. I’m not sure if I should try to continue to make it work for me out here. I have a few friends, and a job I love, but I don’t make much money at all. 
The thought of moving back to my home state sounds very tempting. I have family and close friends there, I could get a job that pays very well. I just don’t have much right now. No car, no money to cover the cost of a Uhaul. I know my family would help me though. I’m not sure what’s holding me back from doing it...maybe because I would be doing it on my own?

286,"I took a peek at the sub and it's mostly dating/sentimental advice, but the sub description says ""advice on any subject"" so I think this goes here.  
Anyway, here's some backstory:  
I've been living in a double bedroom since september 2017, while the son of the landlord, let's call him M, lives in one of the two single bedrooms (His role is pretty much to ensure everything in the house goes fine). I've changed a lot of roommates over this period, and the last one was S.  
Now the problem is that recently mold started forming in my bedroom, and while mine and S's living habits (Rarely opening the window, keeping the drying rack in the bedroom) surely contributed to this, I'm not sure to what extent.  
Now S moved away (He's still in town though), but me and M were talking about fixing this bedroom. Essentially M gave me two options: He hires someone to do the job and me and S split the bill, or he helps us two to fix the room ourselves, while me and S pay for the paint, the tools etc.  
He told me that to avoid the reformation of mold we have to do a complete job, meaning we have to undo and redo the whole plaster under the paint, and then give it two coats of paint with an anti-mold product.  
While browsing the internet I read on more than one site that simply redoing the paint (And not the plaster) with the anti-mold will fix the problem permanently.  
So I want to ask the following questions:  
\- What are the odds me and S are the only culprits, considering that my previous roommates had the same habits  as well (Rarely opening the window, keeping the drying rack in the bedroom)? Meaning, how much time does it take for the mold to form?  
\- What kind of job is needed here? Do we have to redo the plaster, as M says, or is redoing the paint enough?  
\- If redoing the plaster is not necessary, how do I convince M that it isn't?",09Apr2019,1
287,"So all my life I've had some serious mental health problems and didn't know it or if I did and didn't know how bad. It was about in my mid to late twenties that I realized something was off but I didn't until I was 27 didn't I understand to what extent. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was a child and was taking medication for it until we fell into that who ADHD isn't real and it's all in your head bull that was going at the time then I stopped  (this was late elementary) this decision had consequences I didn't fully understand till my late twenties. It was when I recently started noticing gaps I'm memory when important things were happening is when I realized I needed to do something, so I went to the doctor and was prescribed adderall. Now understand that most of my life I had a lot of trouble controlling my emotions with depression and feelings of anxiety; it wasn't at all what I intended to happen but when I took my first pill those issues had become much easier to manage and my life changed for the better. Unfortunately I had to cancel my insurance because the refused to pay the doctor that prescribed me the medication because it was ""too expensive"" and I couldn't afford to pay over 200 a month for them to not do what I need them to.

289,"Long story short he was in an abusive relationship. Long story long.. They got together at a time when he was depressed and too young to understand (22) I find it really creepy on her end. Shes attractive.. for her 30s.. but he is absolutely gorgeous and could get any girl. Hes tall, blue eyes, blond hair, slim and toned beautiful smile, strong jaw line, hes stunning, so funny and super intelligent and manly. He said it was a very dark time for him and wants his past to just be that, his past. But I think about it and my mind wonders to dark places. I think about them together and it makes me feel like hes a weak person. And it makes me unsure of him and unattracted to him at times when we are apart. This is what I have pieced together since he tries not to talk about it. 
When they got together he had just been heart broken from a previous girl. They 'clicked' and about a year in or less than, he thought to himself he didnt want it, they broke up but he was depressed and didnt want to be alone so they got back together. She was older (obviously).. and kept pressing him to make the steps to take the relationship to the next level (marriage and baby). He wasnt in love anymore or maybe he thought he was but really wasnt, and his depression worsened. He thought that because she wanted these things that maybe he wanted them too. She manipulated him to believing it's what he wanted. They got engaged. He tells me ""I knew I shouldnt have done it, I just thought it would be better if I did the things she wanted."" They would fight all the time, week long fights about small things. They got married and he told me he almost walked out and he kept asking himself why am I doing this!! But just continued. She wanted a baby more than anything. And that's what she got. After the baby that's when things got super bad. They were constantly fighting. He told me the night they split they had had an argument. He bought a bottle of whiky and downed the whole bottle. He drove to a bridge and decided he wanted to jump off. But he didnt. He went back to the house and told her it's over. The baby was 7 months. -- Notes to add that also weird me out.. she had 30k worth of debt when they met. He helped her pay it off and she used his credit card and gave him debt of 15k which he is now almost cleared off. She has been in a Visa marriage before twice!! She was extreamly abusive after the breakup and would threaten to not have him see his baby boy. 

Note: me (25f) and him broke up a week ago. I was/am devastated. It's hard being in a relationship when someone has a baby we got together when the baby was 9m. (Hes trying to balance crazy work having a relationship with his son and me) But we broke up for the reason of distance he had to move to another state and it just got too hard. And there is no saying we wont get back together. I just want to know why it weirds me out so much.. I think about them together sometimes and my mind just wanders to dark places. How could he let this happen? The thought of him thinking shes attractive makes me feel ill. Part of me can read this and think well the answer is right in front of you! He was manipulated!! And then I still just have this sick feeling when I think about it. I dont judge him. He doesnt not deserve to be loved because of his past stuff but it weirds me out!! Why!",09Apr2019,1
290,"My girlfriend recently confessed that she had something she'd like to experience that would turn her on. I don't find the idea that attractive, but it's pretty much the only fetish she's mentioned.

She really likes the idea of us messing up/ruining each other's hair, by rubbing/smearing things in it mostly. This would obviously require a lot of cleaning up afterwards, as well as probably making the place stink for a while if we're massaging food into each other's hair. She's described the kind of thing she wants us to do quite a lot, and I've never committed to it since I've been unsure. For example, putting glue and flour in my hair will probably fuck it up for a while...

This sounds fun/humorous to me but not sexual, so I was thinking of agreeing to trying it with her with no expectation that we'd have sex afterwards. I can handle it being gross if it's for her, and we'd both be fine helping to clean up afterwards. Still, I'm worried about offending her if it doesn't do anything for me.

And I moved around a lot as a kid. I'm talking every 2 or 3 years of my life. 20 different schools. And as soon as I realised I could get sexual attention from boys I would tease them. But then it was like i couldn't stop. I would do things that i didnt want to do. Oral sex on guys and stuff. They thought I was easy and they would sexually assault me like pull down my shirt or grope me. I dont know why I was this way. I would wear low cut shirts and people would come up to me and RIP it down to get my boobs out. When I would get drunk they would take advantage of me. I hated it but I acted like It didnt bother me.

298,"Just turned 20 a few months ago. It's still young, I know, but I feel like I've already hit a dead end before I even got a chance to begin.

The biggest thing that I've always struggled with is mental health. I've been dealing with anxiety since I was 5, and other things followed suit. It took a toll on my ability to perform simple tasks, and nearly cost me my education later in high school, which I had to work my butt off to fix. I look back on that now and realize I was more okay than I thought. Not good still, but generally okay. This, however, led me to realize that I'd never be able to go through college, even if I could afford it in the first place.

I broke my tailbone and had a few major leg injuries when I was a kid, and it's affected me in the long-run. I can still walk and move around, but it becomes excruciatingly painful after long periods. I experienced this in my first job (food service/retail), and I nearly crippled myself from working only part-time. Thankfully I was out after a week (fired under unfair conditions by a manager that was later fired for going against a few different laws, but that's a story for a different subreddit), otherwise I think it really would have immobilized me completely.

So with horrible anxiety and some long-term injuries, already I was feeling bad by 17.
Come post-high school graduation. Try looking at colleges, way too expensive even with scholarships and financial aid. Say okay, whatever, I can figure something out.
Never learned how to drive. Don't have my own car. Town doesn't have a good reliable transportation system. That, mixed with no college degree, and inability to work in super physical jobs, means it's pretty much impossible to find a job here.

No job means no money. That means no doctors, chiropractors, or therapists. Stress levels reach Pretty Bad.
Try applying for medical and other assistance. Get pretty much squat, still not covered for medical anything.

Stress continues to rise. Lose interest in lifelong hobby/optimal career choice. Stress more from that. Start developing anxiety-induced hallucinations, leads to more anxiety, with more hallucinations, and throw in some severe depression. Still can't afford a therapist/psychologist, so can't get help for any of it.

I feel like a burden, and like everything crucial is completely out of my control. Everything I've tried has backfired completely, and left me back at square one.

TL;DR, I have mental problems I can't afford help for and bad bones, along with no college education and no car. State gov won't even bat an eye in my direction.

I need a job for money, I need money for medical help, I need medical help to help me get a job. Vicious cycle of dead-end continues.
Family is also poor, so I can't ask for much help from them either.

How do I fix any of this? Where do I begin?",09Apr2019,1
299,"Today, I had an optometrists appointment at a specialist (Australia). After some tests, the optometrist discovered I had some eye problem which means my vision deteriorated over time, I can’t remember what it called. She recommended that I keep around 5 meters distance to screens when I can (Fair enough).

My parents have taken this to an extreme level (As they always do) and are now rearranging my room so I am as far away from my t.v as possible.

They have made it so I must sit up and be at far away and possible (I have near sightedness, but I do wear glasses) and I can’t lie down while I play, which is my preferred position. They have also made it that I cannot watch YouTube on my laptop and must watch it on the T.V through the PlayStation which is just inconvenient and my punishment for being ‘too close is being banned from all electrical devises for the entire school holidays.

I think they have taken a recommendation to far as I will still need to use my laptop for school work almost every day and it’s not going to make much of a difference.

303,"hello fellow redditors. 

i don’t know what’s wrong with me. over the course of 2-3 months, i’ve found myself slowly losing touch of reality and who i am. i am a 18 year old girl, and english isn’t my mother tongue. yesterday i had a whole meltdown. my brain just feel all foggy, and i can’t think. i can’t do any of my assignments. i can’t concentrate at all, and i can’t say anything when i have class. i have a hard time writing this, because i can’t come up with anything to write. i just know, that i have problem, but i don’t know what it is. the only thing i can is to be sad and have this heavy feeling in my body.


 i’ve started on a new school, where my psychical abscene and assignment absence really counts. i also have a spare time job, where i work 2 times a week. (16 hours). my participation in school isn’t doing too well. i’ve no friends, and i always feel like everyone are looking weirdly at me. sometimes its sympathetic, other times they just laugh. i have friends who isn’t going to my school, but lives far away from me. 


i really try to be the best me i can be. but these last months have definitely been hard. all these assignments, my phone and laptop screen, just everything around me puts my brain in a foggy mode. i don’t even think i can remember what i’ve written at all, but i hope it makes sense. what i’ll like get advice on, is my mental state. why am i feeling this way, why can’t i concentrate on anything, and why do i feel like my brain is getting squished all the time?
i hope somebody know what’s wrong with me.  i’m sitting here, not knowing who i am, as i’m writing this.

I dislike to take random calls, so I looked it up but no information appeared, and since I wasn't waiting for any specific calls I thought it was spam (I get lots of spam calls). So I responded once saying ""Stop calling"" and blocked it. I thought that if it were something important they would have already contacted me via email or something.

Anyway, today, after WEEKS of this number trying to call, I received an email. It was the student advisor from a potential university. The email is very polite, just saying that they haven't been able to contact me. They told me months ago that they would call, but I totally forgot. I'm MORTIFIED. 

What can I tell them?? It's gonna be super embarrassing when we talk on the phone, so please someone tell me what to respond.

312,"I'm a young woman with fairly long blonde hair that I was looking to change up. I'm also totally out of money to make ends meet for the month. A male roommate of a close friend, someone I know but not that well, said he'd pay me a substantial amount to let him mess around with my hair. Enough to fix most damage he'd cause, and probably to help me get by for a few weeks and build up some savings in case something happens.

Obviously I asked what this involves - he said nothing directly sexual even if it seems like a fetish thing, so no nudity or bodily fluids. He also confirmed nothing unhygienic. But it could and will involve my hair getting messy or dirty, him cutting it, basically anything else he likes. I'm not concerned about the possibility of sexual assault or similar since I checked with her and she'll be in the next room the whole time. Plus the guy isn't at all physically intimidating.

A little back story....I fucked up, I mean I didn't told them everything while I was getting everything organized, meanwhile my mother got possessive because I got a boyfriend, shit went crazy. So when it was time to tell them I was moving out, but to a new city, with little money, trying to find a job and housing (my partner has family there and a house a bit far from the center but we can use it) they didn't react well. (I'm a female, 23 years old)

We live in the city of Lisbon, and we are trying to move to a more calm, cheaper place. Here is impossible to rent with our income and we are going to the center of Portugal, everything is cheaper. Obviously we have to find a job and I know we will. But since my family didn't react well and brother also made me feel pretty shitty saying I wasn't mature enough because of the way I managed things and if it worked out it would be luck (I had my reasons that they wouldn't understand and also I was super protected when I was younger because my dad died when I was 9 and after that my health declined).

I only have the support of, well... myself and my bf. But my mind sometimes goes dark and I don't like that.

In the next meeting, it became clear person Y wants to pursue a relationship with X, but they don't directly say it, they gave hints. X realized this after their meeting. Now, the question is if X continues the friendship, are they being a jerk for playing with Y's emotions and using them for their own needs? X is senior to Y in college, thus feels responsible for Y and doesn't want to hurt Y in any way. X likes y a lot, it's just that their sexual orientation is different.

I’ve also recently noticed how much she puts me down and mocks me. (Everything from the clothes I buy to my hairstyle) Fantastic example a few months ago shopping together. At the checkout, she pays, stands by me while I pay... “I hope you don’t ever wear that when you’re out in public with me.” The cashier looked awkward, I looked dumbstruck. She looked at the cashier with a snigger for an approving response. (She didn’t get it) We left. Fuck that. Penny dropped. I don’t need that shit, I’m not 13 and if I want to wear my floral DMs and a black jumpsuit I shall do that, zero fucks given.

For the past week I have been running 3 consistently, it's physically exhausting and leads to a lot of mistakes because of the sheer amount of paperwork they generate. I barely have time to take a lunch break but I will get written up (along with other things he has threatened).

During one of my lunch breaks I clocked out and had around a 10 minute chat with a co-worker. My supervisor passed by and grabbed a snack and stayed till we finished talking, I had some time left on my break so I left. When I get back my supervisor asks me how long we were talking (I said 10 minutes maybe I honestly wasn't sure) and then he warned me that I can't take my lunch break and 15 minute break at the same time. I informed him that I was in fact clocked out during that time. He says 'oh' and I believe that is the end of it. Unfortunately the next day he calls me over to look at my time sheet.

S' ""Your time sheet says you clocked out at 4:23, I remember you guys left at 4:37 that is 14 minutes not 10"" 

Me: ""yes I guess it was 14 instead of 10""

S: ""well it's against policy to take your break with your lunch break"" 

Me: ""like I said yesterday I clocked out at 4:23 and then chatted with cw and then clocked back in""

S: ""well to be honest with you cw is known by management as a talker and I'm not saying he makes mistakes but management will believe you've been making mistakes because of talking. Now I'm just letting you know this as a warning""

Now I barely talk to anyone during work, and I find this completely unreasonable to be given a warning for talking to a co-worker during my lunch break, and being accused of lying.

I've put on weight, I'm not fat but I have certainly never had as big a belly as I do at the moment!at first I thought this was tied to my drinking more heavily that I done in the past, especially beer but I've pretty much cut this down to a very minimal amount and yet no change. 

Today I'm sitting in my office and wondering is this my life now? Really what brought this on was me thinking ""screw it I'm having a McDonald's for lunch"" and then thinking why am I doing that, can I just not be bothered any more? 

Anyone that's been in a similar situation, your perspective is appreciated.

My BF's close friend was T-boned in a multi-vehicle accident 1,5 months ago. He broke many bones, including something in his back, but miraculously and despite coma, he is slowly recovering and is not paralysed. He will have many operations and physical therapy ahead, 6-12 months it looks like. He is obviously glad to be alive (his family were told at first he would most likely die), but he is angry and depressed, anxious and sad as well - emotionally he can be very detached or angry when you talk to him. He also cries and looks happy at the same time. 

&amp;#x200B;

To my BF, he is very close friend, although they do not talk that often. My BF and I live in Europe, while friend lives in Canada. We have been in close contact with friend's family since we found out about his accident, but we cannot physically go and be there with him, since flights to Canada cost a lot of money and the family thinks it would not help friend much anyway since he is mostly bedbound. Friend also does not really want to see or talk to anyone much. 

&amp;#x200B;

What are the ways we could support this friend when we are so far away ourselves? A letter? An email? A care package? Everywhere it says that the best help following a major trauma is to physically be there for a friend, but my BF cannot.

344," 

I recently broke up with the ''huge love'' of the last school years and the first years at university. We were together for 3 years, with a pause of 6 months in-between (she broke up then, now it was me). There were times when I really thought that she is the love of my life (I feel like this even now sometimes). The reason I broke up was because I was very unsure about my relationship for the last 2 months and I couldn't handle it anymore. Also, in the last 2-3 months we were arguing a lot and we didn't really discuss, we just confronted each other. Basically, in the last 6 months or so we created small problems that weren't solved, because someone would apologize and the other one, because of endless love, would accept it and hug him, without the issue really having been solved. I love her from the bottom of my heart and of course I would really like to keep in touch with her but you know how these things work. Now I feel like I can't handle it because sometimes she sends me messages and I want her to respect my decision but on the other side I can understand her. When we talk, what I do is not telling her things like that I miss her or that I love her because I don't want to give her hope so that she can move, as I don't know how long it will take me to clear things in my head up, instead of always telling her the truth.

347,"For some backstory,
So my fiance &amp; I have been living in this apartment complex for 2 going on 3 years. 
He is very hard working. I'm talking wakes up at 5am for work gets out 4pm goes to school at 4:30pm until around 8pm on most days. Those are not even the busiest days...
When he doesn't get enough sleep he can be an angry &amp; voilent (not abusive just to clarify) man. That describes both our moods this week.  

Recently our apartment complex managers i guess, decided to install individual boilers in each unit. This comes after weeks of an eyesore giant hole in the ground and yellow caution tape all around it from where they failed to fix our ""no hot water"" problem. Mind you at this point there had already been about a month of the water being cut off unexpectedly at odd times of the day. 

We learned about this boiler installation by a note on the door. Plumbers will be working in the apartment for one week, cover your furniture there might be saw dust. That's what the note said pretty much. It had dates, March 25-29.

The first week they never came and we heard loud noise in the apartment next door all through the week. Music blasting and loud noise. Impossible to sleep on our schedules. Second week (when they were supposed to be gone) they began to work on our apartment. I WHILE WE WERE LIVING IN IT. 

It was five or so men going in and out tracking mud leaving coke and water bottles everywhere putting our shower curtains on our BED (apartments are in a tropical humid environment w tons of moisture and no fan in the restrooms so yeah there's mold and mildew if I don't wipe down furniture for 2 days) wet damp curtains on our bed is a major no. 

They tell me I have to a)completely empty out our closets. B) basically out our restrooms. C) rearrange our bedrooms so that they can work. I'm still standing there at 9am not having showered or peed realising they will have cut the water. So our bath are basically unusable for a week while they install veiny exposes plumbimg pipes all along the top of our walls. 

Then they leave in a puff of saw dust just as suddenly as they appeared leaving an eyesore of a hot boiler in our bedroom in our closet and sawed open walls, mess, mud, dust and one of our toilets was shut off.  

That was last week. 

They said that this week workers would be in to fix the exposed piping to somehow cover it and the holes in the walls. The sheetrock and lumber lay outside our front door, untouched. 

Yesterday I called the office about a leak I noticed after the plumbers left. I was kind and gracious when I really wanted to reach through the phone and yank them through to come and see the mess then have the same plumbers work on their house for a week while they live there install a boiler in their closet and see how they like it. 

So they sent a man over to ""fix"" the leak. That was yesterday now this morning early around 4am (my finance was up early studying for an exam and I got up intending to iron his shirt) and guess what? The toilet isn't working now. The one working toilet they left us that the apartments had someone come and fix yesterday is no longer working. Our second toilet is currently sitting full of.. Well you can guess because my fiance used it after they disconnected it because the plumbers unexpectedly switching the toilets they would have us use while they connected or disconnected one. Without telling us anything ever. 

My fiance called and complained after the week the plumbers were at the apartment mostly for the money we had to spend on a last minute hotel when we'd finally had enough. The best they did was knock a weeks worth of pay off the rent, which I'm not sure they intend on keeping but I hope. I should mention a city inspector was supposed to come by and validate the plumbers work but no inspector has showed. 

We're calling today about the toilet. So am I being whiny, or am I valid here and this is not right? Is there anything I could and should do in this situation? 
Aslo completely out of curiosity, can I do anything from a legal standpoint?",09Apr2019,1

349,"Lost a bet to a friend. Terms of the bet were loser gets a fucking mohawk, rn I have long dark hair and I can't imagine losing it. She's shown me a picture of what she's going to make me look like (yes she's doing it herself which means at least nobody else sees it happening). Literally going to end up with my hair bleached, then dyed different colours (blue and green), then shaved into a mohawk and spiked up. And I have to keep the colour and spikes for a while. I always honour my word up until now so I could get away with backing out just this once. But I know I wouldn't have let her back out so isn't really fair on her if I do, right?? And there's always the chance she'll agree to another bet later so I can get her back. This isn't something to lose a friendship over, it's just my hair. Which I'm immensely proud of.

I don't think a mohawk would suit me at all (does it suit anyone??) but it'd probably make my friend happy, she's been wanting me to change up how I look for a while. But this might be too extreme.

361,"Some backstory. I've been married for 5+ years (husband and I have been dating for 10+years). My dad and my husband didn't get along in the beginning, we were teenagers. I have one kid with one on the way currently, I am 39 weeks pregnant. My dad lost his job over a year ago and has been unable to hold a job since, he has gotten increasingly socially isolated and recently found a southern Baptist church to go to, which has ignited his old habits of being over religious and pushing when it comes to God. My husband and I do not go to church, however have our own relationship with God/religion that we are happy with. 
This pregnancy has been an emotional and very stressful time. My anxiety has been through the roof almost the whole time, including sleep disturbances and insomnia. And my father knows that. I am not a person who loves being around people all the time. My work requires me to talk and interact with people constantly, and so my home life is very minimal. I like to be alone. 

My dad last week came over to my house after I told him not to after he asked to drop by. I told him my kid was sick, which he was running a fever. However once my dad got there the tylenol had kicked in and he was acting like he felt better because he did. 
My dad did the same thing yesterday, called and asked randomly if he could stop by. I kept my answer short and to the point ""no not today"". He came by anyway, rang the doorbell three times. I ignored it. He then sent me an ugly text message, calling me a liar from last week. My husband, who has had many run ins with my dad over the past few years, and usually always holds his tongue/doesn't stir the pot, sent him a nicely cordial and restrained text message to kindly please leave me alone right now, that I do not want to see or talk to anyone at this time. 
My dad fired back with a hateful text, dragging up lots of old things (seriously things that happened 10+ years ago), including threatening to fight him in our backyard (yes how classy of my father). My husband answered back you will not see your grandchildren, do not come over or the cops will be called etc. My dad then called my husband telling him ""guess what? YOUR CHILDREN ARE GOING TO HELL!"" Husband told him those are his grandchildren, he then says ""take that! punk ass!"" 
Seriously......
My husband at this point has put his foot down, has banned my dad from being involved with his grandchildren, including the new baby THAT I COULD HAVE ANY DAY NOW.

My mom is involved, she keeps apologizing for his behavior etc. This morning she calls me and tells me my dad is crying at the house, that he's realized what he has done. But its too late. I don't feel the need to explain to him how what he did is wrong and he's going to need to live with his decisions and actions. My husband and I have spent the better part of our relationship looking the other way when my father has acted out and holding our peace. 
It's unfortunate that this is all happening at this time, but I don't feel like its my fault. He's the one who pushed and pushed after I told him point blank no don't come over. He comes over anyways, and all because I don't answer the door, he spirals all of this out of control.
I blocked all contact from my dad, phone/text/facebook. If he shows up to the house today, I was going to call the police and ask them to escort him off property as he threatened my husband yesterday? I've never done ANYTHING like this all before.

363,"Before college, I was a really happy person in high school through me junior and senior year. I would always wake up feeling a little bit sick to my stomach, but I wouldn’t let it get to me and I would continue my day telling people how I much I appreciate them, how much I thought the world was beautiful and I was interested in so many things and was always a positive person.

During my senior year my parents told me about how they are getting a divorce and everything went downhill from there. I’m constantly listening to my parents fight because their room was next to mine, and I would constantly see my parents physically fight each other. Eventually if I tried sticking up for my dad my mom would constantly hit me for even trying to say one thing that was positive about my dad or the situation and she would constantly corner me in my room and scream and cry at me till I told her she was right. The fights before the divorce lasted about 3 months and endured the abuse for this long as well, emotionally and physically I felt broken. I’m still in between them, trying to help them solve their problems as they are both awful people.

I don’t enjoy video games, MTG, anime, reading, or anything anymore. I’m obviously still interested in them because I just bought a game and some magic cards but they just sit in my room.

First of all, sorry for the bad English, please correct me as you wish in a PM. 
Secondly, I don't think this is a very long Story, so I'll get straight to the point.

I get Meds for my ADHD, which is not a thing I like to talk about too muc,  but the Meds are helping me getting things done so I'll take it.

Anyways I don't take them on regular basis (sometimes I take them bc I think I'll need them, sometimes I don't). Adding to that, those Meds, give me some good feelings in my gut, which is, on a bad day, a not very helpful side effect. For this reason, there are some Days, on which I am very teased to take one or two pills more than I should, even though, I know I shouldn't take more. I can't help myself!

I tried some Strategies to stop this impulsive habit, like waiting a few minutes to re-evaluate my impulsive thoughts, but most of the times I can't control myself. And while I'm re-evaluating the desire, to take more of them, gets even worse.

I already thought a lot about getting rid of the Meds. But I don't think that denying my problem and avoiding it, is the long-term solution. I fear that this habit could shift to other things, which might be even worse.

369,"I (19/F) have suffered from crippling social anxiety and mild depression since i was 12. I lost all my friends after high school (i haven’t had real friends for over 3 years now, it’s really messed up i know) and i quit school after 9th grade (in my country you go to a different school after 9th grade that are for 10th - 12th grade) so I never went to high school and i never finished school because i couldn’t handle it, school before that was hell. Since then from age 16-18 i did pretty much nothing with my life, although i  worked at a dog center for a couple of months over the summer when i was 17. I also began studying online when i was 17, to get my high school degree.  

Last summer, when i was 18 i decided i didn’t want to live like that anymore. I wanted to start a life. So i looked for a job and i got a job at a cafe where i worked as a cashier and waitress. Working there changed my life. It was really hard, because it was a really busy reaturant with sometimes 20 people standing in line when i was working as a cashier. It’s located at a very popular street in my country where many tourists and locals come, so It was extremely stressful at times, and now looking back at it i can’t believe i managed it.  

My social anxiety became so much better after i started working there, and i felt free for the first time in my life. I could do things i never could before that because of my social anxiety. It was great. I even met another girl my age that also worked there and we became friends at work. I thought that was my time to finally change my life, and begin my life. I was somewhat happy for the first time in 7 years. I even went on my first date, and me and the guy i was seeing had so much fun together. We went on 3 dates but while i was on holiday in France (my first time traveling since i was 11) he met someone else, and he told me when i got home. I was sad of course, but i wasn’t in love with him. He felt more like a friend to me i realized later.  

So for the first 4 months i worked there it completely changed my life. I still had anxiety, but it was so much better than ever before, and at times i almost forgot about my anxiety. I did a lot of fun things, on my own and with my family. And about the friends thing, i’m a very independent person so it is ok to me. Of course i desperately want to have friends, and it makes me sad about how i’m missing out. but i’m used to being alone and only having my family, i have a great relationship with them.. so it is ok.  

However, in September (i started in may) my anxiety came back full force, out of nowhere. I don’t understand what happened. Before that, i would also have moments of anxiety in certain situations, but i managed to go trough them without it affecting anything. But i started having panic attacks, sometimes even in front of costumers. It was so scary, because i couldn’t just leave. My boss and coworkers were depending on me and i had to do my job, even if i was having a panic attack. A couple of times i had to run into the bathroom, without telling my boss. By boss was not happy about that. My boss was not the nicest person either, there were times where i really liked her and times where i hated her because she would sometimes be very harsh on you. One of my coworkers was also not the nicest, because she was grumpy and irritated at me most of the time for literally no reason. Going to work was horrible, i felt like i was going towards my death sentence every morning. One of the last days i even called in while i was on my way to work, saying i felt sick and needed to go home again. I was not sick at all, i just couldn’t handle it.  

So i quit in October. Since then i’ve been very depressed, and my social anxiety is worse than ever. I can’t believe everything was going so well for me last year, and now i’m worse than ever. I have no friends, no life, no social experience and i can barely go outside my house because of my social anxiety. I also have a really tough family situation, because my brother is also struggling with anxiety and depression, a lot worse than mine. Last year he used to cut himself. He is only 13. My parents are divorced, but still live together and i can tell we are all sad because of our situation, especially my dad. I started seeing a therapist last year, but i didn’t connect with her at all and i disliked her for a lot of reasons. It felt as if she didn’t care about me, like she was just waiting for it to be over. It felt like she wasn’t listening to me or cared about me. It’s hard to explain, but she reminds me of a strict teacher. So i asked to change to another therapist, and i got another one with the exact same issues i changed in the first place. It was weird how similar they were. I haven’t been there for 2 months because seeing those therapists made me feel even more depressed because of how they acted. But i called them today and said that i wanted to change again.  

Yesterday my old boss asked me if i wanted to work there again this year, but i said no. I don’t know what to do. I tried so hard last year and i can’t believe how far i got, only to fall back lower than ever before. A part of me wants to start working there again, and in a way i regret saying no, because all i want is to go back to how i felt last summer. But i’m also terrified, what if i start having panic attacks like before? I can’t hope for the best and hope that it will go back to how it used to be when everything was going well. I can’t just stop working there again, and i can’t leave work. If i start having a panic attack, i’m stuck there. I can’t handle 20+ costumers waiting in line again. I have no energy to do everything over again when i already tried so hard to get myself out of my anxiety bubble. I ask myself “is it even worth trying again if the same thing will just happen?”. I don’t know, i know i should be looking for a new job, something less stressful. But i have no motivation or energy.  I have even started asking myself if it would be better to die, but at the same time i know i want to live. I can’t leave my family, it would break them.",09Apr2019,1

371,"I’ll start with saying I’m an introvert in college, who has also become a stoner who likes to be alone moreso than not. My core friends in college are all from highschool, as i only went to this school to be with my (now ex) girlfriend at the time. They aren’t really there for me at all, never ask how I am, if I’m good, whatever. They just want to smoke every week or so, and any time we hangout more they just want to get fucked up. Moreover, when I was going through my breakup, I told my friends (4 college, 2 others who each go to separate schools) about joining Tinder (first time single in 2.5 years so why not). I didn’t enjoy it, and didn’t say much about it ever again. My ex, who blocked me when we brokeup for 9 months until last week, told me the deciding factor in her moving on was reports from guys that I was talking to other girls. I asked her what guys told her, she wouldn’t say. So, that leaves the 6 closest friends I have. I know 2 never liked the ex, so they are safe, and 1 is a cool chill religious guy so he is good too. All 3 of them go to my school. So I have 1 kid who is a blabbermouth who is very absent minded who is good friends with my ex, 1 kid who TRANSFERRED with my GF into the same college last year, and 1 who is dating one of her friends at another college. But the kid who is dating her friend, who doesnt go to uni with me, we have been very good friends since elementary school. He told me all about his fuckups in his relationship and I never once told his girlfriend. I’m just stunned that more than one of my friends turned on me. And the kid who is a blabber mouth is better friends with the other 3 who I’m sure didn’t say anything. So I’m just stuck. Do I end the friendship with all 3 who I suspect told her, which would essentially be ending all 6 of the best friendships I had? I was and still am in love with this girl and to think a friend betrayed me when I trusted them in one of my worst places hurts. I’m also going to see a therapist about my past relationship and will bring this up; just want your thoughts.

tldr: only have 6 good friends, who aren’t actually good friends. Found out at least 1 was telling secrets to my now ex who i still love. Ending the friendship with 1-2 of them who i think told her would essentially be ending it with all 6. Not sure what to do.",09Apr2019,1

374,"My parents recently bought me a home that I'll rent to own. I have significant medical issues, but can still work. One major reason they bought me a home was because my last couple of renting situations have hurt my health and they are financially in the situation to do so. I also have dogs and this new place has a large backyard for them.

We really lucked out in purchasing this place. It's beautiful, large enough that I can stay there the rest of my life and raise a family if I choose, and it's in a great school district near where my parents live.

I’m different though, have always been the odd one out. Kinda been a loner my whole life which I see now as an adult helps me to travel solo.

It is isolating being different from everyone else, different as in I never really fit in with people my own age, materialism has never been my thing.

I’m planning a trip out of the country soon, but I worry about becoming a hypocrite and leaving and never coming back. My family that left home almost never come back to their hometown, staying only one night every few years like their better than this environment.

Cities and towns I believe are lost when we do this. When we talk bad about the very place we grew up in and produced us. I think it would be better to go out and explore other places, but return home and give back to the people that helped us.

It’s why I’m so upset when things happen like I lose a photo or a fancy pen a man at work gave me, these things mean something to me even though I’m only 25. (Old soul) my best memories are of my friends and I playing with their kids, babysitting and having a network of people where I live.

Another year went by with Hair flips, hugging, and major flirting. And we started “going out” we would go to McDonald’s all the time after work and we would drive around, talk, and even walk in trails while she told me all about how she’s a really big Catholic (Me being a Christian) I didn’t know much about the saints she talked about. But it was time spent with her and I loved it. She got a boyfriend during all of this time, and rarely spoke of him and when I would ask about him she would always tell me that her heart was his. I only met the guy once. After one of our car rides. After she skipped her 1st year Anniversary dating this guy, to be with me at McDonald’s.

She kissed me on the cheek during one of our car rides while she was dating the dude, and it always confused me so much she said she did it “platonically” but it didn’t feel like it.

380,"So i had written a previous post about where to move, but maybe i should have written this one first. 

I have been battling with my lack of confidence, depressive episodes and my families opinion of both for a long time. For whatever reason my sisters seem hell bent on coming together to tell me what i do wrong and all the reasons why i do it. They are frustrated with my choices and because i have such low self-esteem i unwittingly follow their lead, agreeing with them at every turn, ""yes you're right i do do that for attention"" ""yes your right, i make things up all the time"" ""yes your right, i shouldnt say or do that thing i've always wanted to do, it is a stupid idea""

Just constant, and if i dont comply and act the way they think i should... i get the cold shoulder at family events, i get eye rolls at the dinner table, i get left out of outings, i stop getting phone calls.  I get pretty much excommunicated from their mean girls table. To be honest its starting to feel a lot like bullying and although maybe they are right much of the time... I dont make the best life choices...i'm a grown woman who should be much more sure of myself and more willing and able to make my own mistakes, regardless of what anyone thinks of them. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is in the end, a me problem. I cant change how anyone sees  me, or how they treat me.  At my age (32) , it should be how i react to it that is the key... not changing their persception of me, but changing my perception of myself. Their opinions shouldnt change who i am or what i do. Those choices should come from my own gut, and i should be strong enough to stick to my guns and do what i want regardless of what they think or how they'll react. I cry almost every morning and night now for months, feeling alone and bad about myself because they dont agree with my choices or what they've decided are my motives. Tossing and turning thinking ""they'll never talk to me again""  their opinions matter that much it that affects my sleep? Thats not healthy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Look i am fully aware of the old adage, ""no matter where you go, there you are"" moving isnt going to change me, i clearly have a lot of self-esteem issues to work out. But being away from them to do it might be an option......In fact it feels almost like a need! I actually need to get away from them to think clearly and hear my own thoughts, not the ones they tell me! Even if the ones they tell me are out of their best intentions..... I still want the voice in my head to be my own. 

 what do you guys think? Should i try my hand at getting the fuck out of here and building myself into a confident self-reliant woman? or should i try to just distance myself from them here?

They took him the the ER, but had to sedated him because he was being “combative” 

bm says that they have run blood work, a spinal tap, a Tox screen, and a CT scan and they all came back negative. He was moved to the ICU because they have no idea what caused this and think it could be a virus like meningitis (not spinal) or west Nile or something along those line.

During the ""zone off"" I cant feel my body and I'm not aware of whats going on outside me. Some times I'm either have superpowers and are fighting something, this is one of the best ones because I get loaded with adrenaline, or I could be in a depressive cycle.

Two years ago I met a guy  at my best friend’s birthday party. I immediately fell in love with him despite the fact that we never talked; I just thought he was hot. He wasn’t feeling the same way however (back then he didn’t like black girls and I was kinda ugly lol) We texted over instagram for a couple months before eventually not talking any more.

Fast forward about two years later (a couple months ago) and I add him on my instagram again. We start talking but it’s nothing serious because he is dating and has been dating a girl. His friends tell me that he’s having issues with his girlfriend though and that he’s going to break up to be with me, however I take this with a grain of salt. 

His girlfriend breaks up with him, and what do you know, he’s started to message me more now. I at first was bitter because he didn’t take the chance he had two years ago, but I still texted him because I enjoyed talking to him and we get along well. 

Our talks shortly turned sexual as in him saying things like “come over and lemme drop a baby in you” and other things, as jokes. This goes on, and we continue to talk a lot more. Eventually this all culminated to us arranging to hang out last Friday, because he had an event and wanted company and I had nothing better to do. We hung out and the whole time I could kinda see he was in awe of me, and would compliment me a lot. There weren’t that many sexual jokes other than him bringing up how he wanted to makeout in his car. 

After the event was over, we drove around for a bit and eventually ended up fooling around in his car. All while we were doing stuff he would just stare at me with this huge smile on his face. He would also just hold me and kiss my forehead and cheeks and smile. To be honest I was weirded out because I’ve never ever gotten this from anybody. I even ended up crying a bit because I felt good enough for somebody for the first time in my life. He just held me harder and kissed my forehead and wiped my tears away.

When I got home that night I asked him why he was smiling and he told me because he loved the moments we had together and that he likes spending time with me and that I’m “Really beautiful and should never forget that” and that “I’m worth much more than just a hookup”. 

So of course, after hearing all this, all five of my brain cells went into overdrive and I immediately fell in love with this guy, even though one of the first things he mentioned to me while driving to his even was that “he doesn’t want a relationship because he just got out of one and is probably going to wait until summer”. 

We are really sexually and emotionally compatible, and I’m pretty sure that he likes spending time with me, because he asked to hang out more. Is the fact that I really like him causing me to think too deep into this? To friends with benefits normally do this shit?

I lost my father the day before Halloween 2018, my mother New Year's Eve, and I have to make the decision to end life support for my little brother (34 years old) in the next few days due to a failed suicide attempt. I don't know how to mentally deal with this. 

I kept it together for my mom after my dad passed, so I never got to really deal with that emotionally. I was a mess after my mom passed and I'm still working through that. But my brother seems to have broken me. I can't lie I just want to curl up and bawl my eyes out. I have no other sibblings so everything I've known my entire life has been taken away in 5 months. 

Back story on my brother, my dad died in my brothers arms. He went way off the deep end and ended up making some bad choices in the weeks after my dad's passing. He wound up at a place he shouldn't have been and killed someone and had been in jail since early December. He's been pretty down about the situation but it was starting to to look more positive and he knew that. We talked Friday night and everything seemed great. He was happy and then Sunday the jail calls me. I had a gut feeling why. I kept it together until yesterday when I visited the hospital and saw him. 

I have so much going on I don't know where to begin. I don't know what's normal to feel. At this point I feel lost, devoid of life, and like I'm on autopilot. My wife doesn't understand though. She's amazing support, she's there, but it gives me no comfort.

I don’t care how headass that sounds, I want it all, the whole experience of being ridiculously hopelessly head-over-heels for someone. I’ve never had anything close to this. I’ve liked boys before, and they have liked me, but unfortunately those two never seem to overlap at the same time. 

I feel like I’m “left out” and also running out of time. Everyone always talks about love as this big, huge important thing that life is sort of pointless without. I mean I love my friends, but my parents aren’t really in the picture and I’ve never had a good understanding of what love towards me should look like. Love seems to comes so naturally to people, but that “feeling” people describe when they are first smitten with someone has always just felt like anxiety for me so I back out. I feel like I’m not experienced enough for guys to want me (not talking in a sexual way specifically more like relationships in general) anyways and I get so scared that nobody will ever want me, or that if they do they’ll find someone else better. 

I can’t, for the life of me, figure out why I am so fucking sad about this. I just feel so alone, I know no one wakes up in the morning thinking about me and there’s no one for me to think about when I awake either. Nobody is interested in how my day is going or what I did. There is no one I can point to and say “that’s my #1.” I get anxiety listening to sappy love songs because I get so scared that I will never know what it feels like.

409,"Little Background -- I am (24M) from a conservative Muslim country. As a result , I didn't have many chances to explore my sexuallity . Even worse , I was brought up in conservative values and would frown upon watching porn . I knew it existed but never have I ever tried to find one . Until , I had enrolled in Engineering College and moved out from my city . Living so far from my family has changed me a lot especially the values I held dear no more mattered to me . I watch my first porn at the age of 21 ( Believe it or not ) and I masturbated for the the first time at 22 .

&amp;#x200B;

As I have entered into the realm of masturbation a bit too late , I left no stones unturned to make up for it . I think I have masturbated in average 2-3 times per day for the last 2 years . And consequently, my body reacted that way . I could actually sense my libido decreasing and my genitals hurting . But I didn't care . To keep my libido level up , I changed the genre of porn I was watching -going deep into taboo stuffs .

&amp;#x200B;

A few days back ,while being in an exploratory session to find a good porn video to masturbate , I stumbled upon to a gay porn video . I just clicked it without giving much thought . And oh boy ! it did turn me on ! I closed the porn asap as I was afraid . Watching porn is taboo around here . But watching gay porn ? I will be deserted . But I just couldn't stop thinking about the scenes and it felt so good .

&amp;#x200B;

Finally yesterday , I searched gay porn on pornhub . Found some quality ones . For the first time , I fully masturbated to Gay porn and I loved every bit of it . But now as I had a chance to think I can't find myself a good reason being so turned on by gay porn . So folks --

&amp;#x200B;

* Am I actually a homosexual who didn't have the chance to explore himself and now it's coming out ?
* Can it be possible that my low level libido caused me to get turned on by something which it is not accustomed to ( Straight porn) ?
* Can it be a phase as I am new in this masturbation thing do any of you guys have similar kind of experience ?

The good:

* I’ve actually come to quite like myself.
* I’ll make 45k euros a year before taxes working 32 hours a week in shifts.
* Decently successful amateur MMA fighter, thus a pretty fit guy.

The bad:

* The tough guy facade fades when I’m in bed all by myself. I haven’t had a real conversation with a girl in the last 4 (maybe 5) years. All my physical contact comes from punching people and getting punched.
* I live with my mom and have exactly 50 euros on my bank account. No car, only a moped I drive to work every day.

418,"I (19/F) have suffered from crippling social anxiety and mild depression since i was 12. I lost all my friends after high school (i haven’t had real friends for over 3 years now, it’s really messed up i know) and i quit school after 9th grade (in my country you go to a different school after 9th grade that are for 10th - 12th grade) so I never went to high school and i never finished school because i couldn’t handle it, school before that was hell. Since then from age 16-18 i did pretty much nothing with my life, although i  worked at a dog center for a couple of months over the summer when i was 17. I also began studying online when i was 17, to get my high school degree.  

Last summer, when i was 18 i decided i didn’t want to live like that anymore. I wanted to start a life. So i looked for a job and i got a job at a cafe where i worked as a cashier and waitress. Working there changed my life. It was really hard, because it was a really busy reaturant with sometimes 20 people standing in line when i was working as a cashier. It’s located at a very popular street in my country where many tourists and locals come, so It was extremely stressful at times, and now looking back at it i can’t believe i managed it.  

My social anxiety became so much better after i started working there, and i felt free for the first time in my life. I could do things i never could before that because of my social anxiety. It was great. I even met another girl my age that also worked there and we became friends at work. I thought that was my time to finally change my life, and begin my life. I was somewhat happy for the first time in 7 years. I even went on my first date, and me and the guy i was seeing had so much fun together. We went on 3 dates but while i was on holiday in France (my first time traveling since i was 11) he met someone else, and he told me when i got home. I was sad of course, but i wasn’t in love with him. He felt more like a friend to me i realized later.  

So for the first 4 months i worked there it completely changed my life. I still had anxiety, but it was so much better than ever before, and at times i almost forgot about my anxiety. I did a lot of fun things, on my own and with my family. And about the friends thing, i’m a very independent person so it is ok to me. Of course i desperately want to have friends, and it makes me sad about how i’m missing out. but i’m used to being alone and only having my family, i have a great relationship with them.. so it is ok.  

However, in September (i started in may) my anxiety came back full force, out of nowhere. I don’t understand what happened. Before that, i would also have moments of anxiety in certain situations, but i managed to go trough them without it affecting anything. But i started having panic attacks, sometimes even in front of costumers. It was so scary, because i couldn’t just leave. My boss and coworkers were depending on me and i had to do my job, even if i was having a panic attack. A couple of times i had to run into the bathroom, without telling my boss. By boss was not happy about that. My boss was not the nicest person either, there were times where i really liked her and times where i hated her because she would sometimes be very harsh on you. One of my coworkers was also not the nicest, because she was grumpy and irritated at me most of the time for literally no reason. Going to work was horrible, i felt like i was going towards my death sentence every morning. One of the last days i even called in while i was on my way to work, saying i felt sick and needed to go home again. I was not sick at all, i just couldn’t handle it.  

So i quit in October. Since then i’ve been very depressed, and my social anxiety is worse than ever. I can’t believe everything was going so well for me last year, and now i’m worse than ever. I have no friends, no life, no social experience and i can barely go outside my house because of my social anxiety. I also have a really tough family situation, because my brother is also struggling with anxiety and depression, a lot worse than mine. Last year he used to cut himself. He is only 13. My parents are divorced, but still live together and i can tell we are all sad because of our situation, especially my dad. I started seeing a therapist last year, but i didn’t connect with her at all and i disliked her for a lot of reasons. It felt as if she didn’t care about me, like she was just waiting for it to be over. It felt like she wasn’t listening to me or cared about me. It’s hard to explain, but she reminds me of a strict teacher. So i asked to change to another therapist, and i got another one with the exact same issues i changed in the first place. It was weird how similar they were. I haven’t been there for 2 months because seeing those therapists made me feel even more depressed because of how they acted. But i called them today and said that i wanted to change again.  

Yesterday my old boss asked me if i wanted to work there again this year, but i said no. I don’t know what to do. I tried so hard last year and i can’t believe how far i got, only to fall back lower than ever before. A part of me wants to start working there again, and in a way i regret saying no, because all i want is to go back to how i felt last summer. But i’m also terrified, what if i start having panic attacks like before? I can’t hope for the best and hope that it will go back to how it used to be when everything was going well. I can’t just stop working there again, and i can’t leave work. If i start having a panic attack, i’m stuck there. I can’t handle 20+ costumers waiting in line again. I have no energy to do everything over again when i already tried so hard to get myself out of my anxiety bubble. I ask myself “is it even worth trying again if the same thing will just happen?”. I don’t know, i know i should be looking for a new job, something less stressful. But i have no motivation or energy.  I have even started asking myself if it would be better to die, but at the same time i know i want to live. I can’t leave my family, it would break them.",09Apr2019,1

In my last relationship we didn’t have sex for a year and it wasn’t the best anyway, I’ve never really had great sex but whatever.

Bad thoughts immediately flood my mind about “she’s gonna tell all her friends and no one will want to do anything with me” or “she won’t talk to me anymore and she’ll just find some loser who can fuck better than I can” and my mind has started to give thought to not pursuing sexual intentions to avoid this embarrassment as a whole.

433,"Very long text. Thank you all in advance for your time. 
tldr: I get toxic, stay up late, play till I win, be sleep deprived, have shit day, but feel fine by the time I'm home, play game, get toxic, repeat (but not every day). I want to learn to control myself instead of stop playing entirely.
  
I play an online game called overwatch. As any online game, you win some games and you lose some games. Anyone knows that when you're having a losing streak, you just stop, drink some water and do something else. But I keep falling for the ""I spent all this time playing so I have to keep playing until I win at least one round otherwise everything up to now was for nothing"" and because I'm already so tilted, ofcourse I lose even more. 
  
This causes me to keep on playing, even when it's past midnight and I have work the next day. I always keep track of the time and even though I know it's really late, I just can't stop playing because I don't feel satisfied and everything feels like a total waste of time (because no satisfying wins). 
  
I keep on playing thinking ""fuck this, fuck my life, I don't care if I fall asleep behind the wheel and kill myself on my way to work the next morning"" and only stop playing after I score a few more wins.
  
I finally stop playing but now it's very late. I get in bed but still feel unsatisfied/angry/shit and I have a hard time falling asleep. I wake up next day feeling like a total useless piece of shit garbage, cursing and hating myself for being so irresponsible and stupid over a just game. 
  
I somehow manage to stay awake while driving to work but my whole morning is still shit from the residual negative emotions from the previous night. By afternoon, I'm completely over it and I'm fine, as if nothing bad happened, which is good. But when I get home, I play the game again, telling myself not to take it too seriously this time, then end up taking it seriously, get tilted and toxic, and.... you can carry on reading from the beginning (I'm stuck in this constant loop). I put myself in this stupid loop and can't come out of it.

The good thing, however, is that I don't take my toxicity out on other people. I stay quiet and just yell in my head, or just keep it under my breath. I don't blame others and instead try more to focus on myself and how to improve, to do it differently next time. But once in a while I just snap and get very very bad. I don't always get this bad. Some days, even after a losing streak, I keep my cool and accept that today is just not the day. Some days I stop playing and do something else. But some days, I just can't control myself and make stupid choices and put myself back in that loop.
  
What should I do to stop myself from getting into that loop? How do I remind myself to keep my cool and to not take it seriously? 
  
I know that one sure way is to just stop playing the game entirely, find something else to do instead, but that's just a workaround. I want to learn to control myself and prevent myself from falling into that loop. I enjoy playing the game when I'm not feeling toxic so I just need to learn to control myself. 
  
What should I do? What do you guys do in your similar situation?
   
Thanks.",09Apr2019,1
434,"When I was 17, my doctor had specifically told me that I should see a psychologist or a therapist because she thought that I might have anxiety (this is after me telling her about a few of my panic attacks) My mom was there, and she told the doctor, ""Oh okay"" but shortly after, when we got home, she basically told me that it was pointless and that I could get though with getting better by myself.

A little more than two years later, she found cuts on my legs, and she had no problem makeing a scene and basically making sure that my younger siblings knew about it. She later took me to see her own doctor when I was starting to develop pink eye. While we were there, we also planned on telling her about the cutting as well, to see what we could do about it. While she was in the room, I couldn't go through with telling her, i was extremely nervous, so my mom finally justbdid for me, and as soon as she did, I broke down crying. The doctor talked about it and made me feel a little better, and then suggested that I see a psychologist or psychiatrist to see if I had depression. My mom had never sent me to one since. I don't have a car, insurance, or the money in my bank account, so i don't think I can just take myself either. (Also want to add that it's not a money issue with my parents either, we can easily afford it)

I just want to get better and be normal. I feel behind every one else my age and I think it's my mental instability that's holding me back. I have friends, a job, I'm a college student, and those three factors have helped my mental state a lot. Just being out of the house and away from family makes me feel better, but only temporarily. I feel worthless and weak all the time. I'm a screw up, a shitty person, and I'm overly sensitive and therefore make irrational decisions to avoid being abandoned by friends or be told upfront that they no longer want to talk to me. When people ignore or ghost me for long periods of time, I just unfriend them on social media, then tell myself that, ""They're horrible people! So disrespectful! How can they treat someone this way?"" but am I any better for ditching them after they ignore me?  Is it the worst thing though? I can't be too forward towards people or criticise anything they say, because I'm afraid that they'll start to think, ""Oh...so this is the real (my name) and how she really thinks. Also how dare she feel that she could criticise me, look at her!"" this isn't even the way that Most of my friends think, but I'm scared that they might anyway and then stop being my friend. I'm so clingy that I'll be friends with anyone, even when I know that they are toxic.

All in all, I want to stop being this person and get help somehow. Should I just speak to my school counselor, I feel like for my case, she wouldn't be able to do much about, but who knows? Anyone else been in the same situation?",09Apr2019,1

438,"I’m in a training group at work of about 15 people. We are nearing the end of training, and it’s a highly secure environment so you must lock your pc if you walk away for any reason.

I had to use the washroom so I got up and went, when I came back my boss was sitting in my seat, smiling at me. I gasped and apologized, because I didn’t lock it up. The other supervisor in the room said “we’re almost at the end of training now so were gonna have to start shaming people!”. Then about 10/15 people stood up and screamed it at me over and over “shame! Shame! Shame!...” the ones who didn’t thought it was hilarious and laughed hysterically at this event. I could see the blood drain from both my supervisors faces. I felt humiliated, I’m pretty sure I turned bright red and my chest was hot so I knew it was all blotchy.

I was crushed, I held back tears for the rest of the day.

I cried myself to sleep and I’m still so hurt over it, I just don’t want to be the laughing point of the rest of the week and I honestly don’t want to socialize with any of them anymore. On the last break of the day the supervisors both apologized to me which I dodged basically because I didn’t want to cry in front of them.

I've been working since I turned 18, and since last summer I've been arrested twice, lost a job (and now going to lose another one because loss of license), and have fines and bills riding my ass because of a sudden change in houses and in my lifestyle. 

I used to smoke a lot of nicotine and weed, but I quit the nicotine and still smoke weed but I conserve it a lot more. I've been going to the gym everyday. I've been working everyday. I'm doing everything I can to get to a stable place in my life where I can make money and save for my future while also investing, which is currently the only thing I can think of that interests me as a career, but sucks because you need money if you're going to invest, and I don't have shit right now.

442,"I'm 17 and I live in the Philippines. Now the traits and what I look in for a girl are super rare, particularly here in the PH. Last week on Saturday, my family and I met up with my father's uncle and we went to a water park. 

Fast forward a couple of hours, I tried water skiing and it was fun and all, my father was talking with his uncle and I was getting bored. I saw this really stunning girl from Wales, she had the sexiest body I have ever laid my eyes my upon, no girl here has her body because we're Asians, Asians tend to be petite and short, she was a fucking goddess compared to the girls here, she was 5'9 and on top being super hot, she was confident, smart, decisive, assertive and outgoing, again, rare traits in here, because Asians, especially Filipinas tend to be conservative and shy. If she is who I really think she is, then I'd fucking marry her if I had the opportunity.

I approached her and introduced myself, we talked for a bit in a bar located in the water park, but it was too noisy so she told me to come with her and talk somewhere else more quiet, we got to know each other really well, we had a few things in common. I could tell she was getting attracted to me, her body language, she was flipping her hair, fixing it, she felt comfortable around me. We just connected, I just felt this aura from her, and I've been thinking about her ever since. And let me tell you, I haven't felt attached to a girl in such a long time, and I've approached and met a lot of girls already, none of them were like her.

In my head, I'm thinking, ""If I can attract the girl of my dreams effortlessly, why should I waste my time pursuing girls who don't even come close to being the girl of my dreams and that make me work hard just to simply get a date with them"". 

Here's why the odds are against me. Well being the dingus that I am, I forgot to ask her for her social media, partly because I only realized she was the one after I left, that place is like an hour a way, and the only way I can get her contact info is by borrowing a bike from my friend, and convincing my other friend to ditch school and navigate to find that place with help from Google maps, we can easily do that though. She also has a boyfriend and she told me she's only staying here for a week and then she's off to Denmark. But I want to keep in touch with her in the case she happens to be single and she happens to be in the PH again.

The question is, is it worth it? Do you guys think I should just forget about her and move on, because I'll probably find another girl I really like? Or do you guys think it is worth it, and it probably wouldn't hurt if I just went there and asked for her contact info?",09Apr2019,1

448,"**Background**

My uncle, we will call him Jack, just passed away a few days ago due to an accidental fall. I feel like I should preface this by saying that Jack wasn't living the healthiest lifestyle and had a history of alcohol/pill abuse. He was also on his second marriage. His first gave him 3 children who are all now in their 20's and the second resulted in a daughter who is now 12. His second wife, we will call her Babs, has always been eccentric and a little kooky. She has also spent time, about a year, in prison for practicing physical therapy under a false license right after they had gotten married and had the 12-year-old.

&amp;#x200B;

**Leading Up To His Death**

3 days before his death, Jack fell off a ladder and hit his head. He complained about ongoing headaches the next few days but never saw a doctor. Jack and Babs were closing on their house that week so he was fixing up light fixtures, removing furniture, etc. This strikes me as a severe concussion and this could definitely be a factor in an accidental death. The day of his death, the day before the house-closing, Jack stayed home to clean out the place while Babs and the daughter went to her mother's house to stay the night - they left around 2PM. They supposedly never spoke again, not in person, not over the phone. There's a very real possibility that he was drinking and they had gotten into a fight, though she never mentioned that to us. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Body Discovered**

Jack never wasn't answering his phone and never showed up to the meeting that next morning to sign the papers. Babs went to the house afterward and discovered Jack laying on his back upstairs, unresponsive. She claims to have administered CPR and then begins to call family. She calls his mother and his children, but not 911. When the children arrive, Babs is there with her friend who also happens to be a lawyer. The police show up shortly after the children arrive. We don't know how long she waited to call 911 but the children are about 20min away and they arrive before the police but after the lawyer friend. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Scene**

Jack is found upstairs on his back, laying on the hardwood floor in one of the bedrooms. There are clothes from a bin tossed all over the place and an empty bottle of vodka at the bottom of the bin. Jack's arms are raised above his head, vomit/foam all over his mouth and his shirt is raised up halfway. He is in his underwear and socks and has a big gash on the right side of his head.

His pants are found downstairs rolled down perfectly like someone just stepped cleanly out of them, next to his boots. To the left of the pants is a smudged blood stain. There were empty packets of Xanax-like pills scattered around. The presumed cause of death at this point is that he had somehow lost his balance - whether it be from taking his pants off, or maybe it was a side effect of the previous concussion - and he fell, hit his head causing further damage, walked upstairs to lay down (which wouldn't be unusual for him even on hardwood floor) and never woke up. He may have overdosed as well. The autopsy has not come back yet.

To me, when I heard this - I thought it was weird but I didn't think much about it. At this point, I believed wholeheartedly that this is what happened. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Wake/Funeral**

Babs is acting unusual. She is flaunting around like it is a dinner party and doesn't seem to be in mourning at all. She insists on a closed casket though the siblings/children want it open. She is ignoring her 12 year old daughter. Babs is spending time with her own friends while the daughter is with my family both during the day and at night. We literally receive a text from her at 9PM asking if we are with her daughter. She literally spends no time with her throughout the entire 2 days. 

Babs is complaining about money and pins the funeral/mercy meal tab on Jack's mother. She is telling everyone that she is now a ""poor homeless widow"" in one breath but is booking vacations in the next. Something is off. Maybe they were talking about divorce? Maybe she feels free now? He probably wasn't the easiest person to live with. I don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

**New Discoveries/Thing to think about**

\- They were indeed talking about divorce but it was Jack's idea. Babs shut it down repeatedly and wasn't having it.

\- They sold the house for over a million. Since the death happened before the official closing, she receives the full amount rather it being split into their 2 separate bank accounts after the closing.

\- She tried selling off his car the day after his death

\- She tossed his clothes in a dumpster the day of his death

\- She is complaining about not having access to his 401k

\- The blood stain was on the left side of his pants, the cut on his head was on the right side

\- She administered CPR, but his airway wasn't cleared

\- An anonymous call from a neighbor came in and told the police to look further into it. There had been serious reports of fighting in the days leading up to his death.

\- The 12 year old daughter has been sleeping over a friend's house since the funeral

&amp;#x200B;

We also bought our home less than 2 years ago, and at the end of February my Sister in Law and her boyfriend who was my friend before they got together and their two cats moved into our basement.  We only have one shower, only have one kitchen.

I am always upset and stressed out with messes, sharing space, parenting, tired, no free time and jealous that my friend and sister in law can leave the house whenever they want, and do fun things when if I want to leave the house it's a fucking production of planning, packing, gathering, bundling, and managing expectations.

459,"This isn't as serious as other posts on this sub, but I would still appreciate some advice. I'm interested in languages again and want to slowly learn a second language, but I'm not sure which one to study. This is mainly for personal enjoyment but if it could be useful in other ways that would be great too. 

First option is French. In Canada this would be very useful, especially with certain jobs. I did take a year of French in university, which was a long time ago, so it might come back easily. It would also be useful when traveling.

Second option is Spanish. There are a lot of immigrants in the neighbourhood, mostly Mexican and Guatemalan, so Spanish could be useful there. I took three years of it in high school, which was a long, long time ago. Also very useful when traveling. 

Third option is sign language. A friend is an interpreter and strongly suggested this. I think it would be a different new way to learn a language. 

Fourth option... is open. Maybe German? I've had an idea of working in Germany in the past. Mandarin is also common in my area. Same with Arabic. Or anything. I'm open to suggestions.",09Apr2019,2

He is very popular and is loving his first year of high school so it's not a problem at school. He is increasingly angry all the time towards me and his younger siblings. He told me to shut up last night several times when I was trying to ask him to clean up after dinner with his siblings. My husband doesn't say anything when he speaks to me like that. Anyway, normally I wake up and have to go to his room several times to get him out of bed but this morning I was tired so when my daughter told me he was still sleeping despite his alarm going off I just yelled: ""Honey are you out of bed yet"". He yelled back to shut up so I told him he can walk to school for speaking to me like that, at which point he told me he's not going then. He has pulled this before and refused to go to school for being late, he also has been tarty over 30 times. I drive him to school every morning but he walks home and can walk to school in my opinion, it's only about 20-25 minute walk. I finally did get him out of bed and he continued to yell at me for not taking him to school and making him late and when I left to take my other kids to school he got my husband to drive him.

467,"I'm an introvert, I've had social anxiety my whole life and due to childhood abuse by my father I have a destroyed self esteem, I have been working to better myself though. 

I'm at a point where I force myself to talk to people, I'm not the type of person that others usually approach, I don't know the exact reason why, no one really shows interest in me, maybe I have the vibe that I don't want to talk to others, maybe I'm just boring and have nothing interesting to show, but anyway, I'm always approaching others.

I have moved to a new state for work, and obviously this sucks ass, new life new people, I'm 27 so I'm at the point where college is done and you gotta work hard to make friends, even at work most of my colleagues are in the range of 40s-60s. 

Anyway, one of older friends told me to use meet up app, which I have never used before. I liked the idea, and joined volleyball and soccer groups. 

I have RSVBed to 5 games so far, which I have enjoyed, but at the same time I don't feel like I'm wanted there, maybe I'm just negative about it, you guys tell me.

My first volleyball game I went there early to talk to people, I'm new in the area and I don't know anyone, I have met a sweet older lady that was on my team and she was nice enough to have a conversation with me. She had been supportive throughout the entire game as I was a beginner and honestly was a bit nervous and made some mistakes, I thought others were friendly too, I tried to have conversions with them but didn't feel like anyone wanted to talk or had any interest. 

The next game I went to was a soccer game (open to all skill levels), I used to play soccer a lot but haven't in years ago obviously I knew I wasn't gonna do great, but I wanted to use this as an opportunity to meet people. Well, the soccer guys had no interest in talking to me, it was a small group and they all knew each other, I played with them but no one bothered to even ask my name, I kept approaching them before the game and tried to actually be part of whatever conversation they had, you know I was trying to initiate the part where they would acknowledge me and I would introduce myself, never happened and I got ignored. Oh well. 

So the game started and I wasn't in a great shape, also didn't help that literally all of them were very skilled, the moment they saw how I played my team literally ghosted me and stopped even passing the ball to me, even if I was the very last option they would still not pass and instead let the other team take the ball, so didn't feel great about that, but again I knew I sucked but at the same time I felt disrespected. After the game again I tried to talk to them, I introduced myself to two of the guys, they literally showed no interest, never asked me and questions, just said their names.

The last volleyball game I went to was with a new group, again everyone seemed like they knew each other, I tried to get close to them to acknowledge me, no one looked at me, I asked if they need any help (they were sitting up the net and other stuff) they said no. I just kept moving from one small group to another trying to get involved but no one would look at me or ask who I am or involve me in a conversation. 

The only time someone would ask my name is when I make a mistake in the game and they try to give me advice (which they were friendly about), but then again after the game when we sit on the porch I try to get involved but no one even looks at me, I did try again to introduce myself to some people next to me, but they just tell me their name then look the other way and start talking with the other guys/girls. 

First of all, am I doing something wrong? I hate doing all this but sitting by myself quietly has never worked, no one would approach me, but it seems like even when I approach others no one is interested to even ask me where I came from. I don't know if it has anything to do with my ethnicity, I'm not originally from the U.S. But my English is pretty good (I have a slight accent), but then again I didn't think those people were racist or anything, they seemed friendly but no one had any interest about me at all.

I felt awkward and not wanted, I tried to make things not awkward by trying to talk but that didn't work, I don't know what I'm gonna do, normally I would give up and stop going to these events, but I don't wanna do that yet. 

I would appreciate any advice.",09Apr2019,1
468,"Since the beginning of my school year which was about 5 or 6 months ago (I think) I haven't had any friends or people I hung out with, over the previous summer I had lost a friend/girlfriend and after the emotional effects that had on me I basically just stopped talking to my only other friend. After that I think without anyone to talk to all those negative emotions I felt started to fester inside me, when school started back again I just couldn't help judging everyone or at least at the time I thought I was being perceptive and thought I was clever for guessing things about their character based on their looks (I was a fan of sherlock back then). I would sit alone at lunch  in the same spot at the back of the school where there wasn't that much foot traffic to kind of brood I guess but that's what I hate most about being alone, it leaves me to my thoughts which usually aren't that good i.e. regrets, past mistakes, thinking that everyone doesn't like me and they just pretend to be polite while they talk about me behind my back. Sometimes I knew that if I sat they're long enough thinking I would end up crying, so that's why I picked up sketching and writing hoping they'd drown put my  demons. 

Eventually my usual spot starts getting crowded so I end up hiding in the stair well and at that point I start to think if some reason to stop feeling so lonely I think to myself ""You dont need other people, you've never needed them but in reality you know it's not even that hard, really all it is, is just saying something, anything at all but you wont because of the small chance of rejection  and the fear that you might not be able to handle it, so you cant be mad when they dont notice you"" and that's kinda how I thought to cope every time I felt angry or jealous when I saw a group of friends or people having fun together. 

These days I feel kind of emotionally blank although that's pretty standard for me. I dont think I'm in that dark place I was a year ago when this started but I'm not exactly good either. I'd like to hear your thoughts if you have any, sorry for the read.",09Apr2019,1
469,"I'm in the US, I have short hair, and I have no intention of ever cutting it to be longer than a buzz cut. I need new hair clippers because my current ones are busted and I need to cut my hair.

I bought my busted clippers when I was living in Japan, and they came with one adjustable attachment that you could slide up and down to adjust the length to six different settings for different desired length of hair. But all the hair clippers I find on the US come with a dozen-or-so pieces that can be swapped out in order to create the desired length. This seems like such a waste for me because I will never use any of the pieces except for maybe the shortest one, and they give SO MANY PIECES. Like, I'll just throw them all out.  

Does anyone have any suggestions of clippers that I can buy in the US that don't have an insane number of pieces? Or should I just buy another Japanese one online with one simple piece for length adjustment, since the electrical compatibility shouldn't be an issue?

470,So I (18F) like to lay out and tan when it’s warm. The issue I have is that my neighbors on both sides of me are a bit attracted to me. The teenagers like to watch me and take pictures of me when I’m out and go out side and watch me while I tan and when I go inside they leave. They’ve been doing this for about 3 years now. And my other neighbor(60M) was talking to me and out of the blue asked me to go out on multiple dates and I told him I’m busy and he just kept pushing at it and he tries to talk to me EVERY time I go outside to do walk my dog or literally throw trash away. Is there anything I can do to let them know to stop and that I’m uncomfortable? Like I’ve tried to hide while tanning but then they just play in the middle of the street i front of my drive way. And as for the other neighbor he just sits on the deck and waits to talk to me? I’m just uncomfortable and I’m nervous that it might escalate to something worse.,09Apr2019,1
471,"So like 30 minutes ago I had an massive argument with my shitty step dad.

But before I begin describing what happened I'll tell you why he's such a shitty step dad and why I hate him.

So around 4 years ago my mom started dating this guy, in the beginning he seemed nice and all but after a while he failed at hiding his flaws from me. He's an alcoholic and I mean big time. He actually steals money from my mom just to buy some booze and refuses to go to work to fund his alcoholism (which he should get rid of in the first place).

 About 2 years ago he started having arguments with my mom almost every day(he was the aggressor 90% of the time). In front of me he always tries to look good (tries to give me money and shit like that) but behind my back he always talks shit about me and tries to make me look bad in front of my mom, also he talks 3 times as loud as any other person , gets aggressive very easily, has no manners and in general is just a massive douchebag.

 I'm usually fairly quiet and calm but years of bottling up the negative emotions that he caused just burst out when he once again talked shit about me and I overheard it. So I came out of my room and said ""shut the fuck up you dumb bastard"" and followed up with ""you stupid son of a bitch ""x2 (I didn't mean to insult his mom since she is a very nice person but I didn't think about what I was saying). So ofc everyone started shouting and he started throwing stuff at me (like his beer cans and random shit he found lying around). My mom eventually broke up the whole ordeal and pushed me into my room. (this happened 30 minutes ago)

 About 2 months ago they actually broke up and I loved that time because my grades improved, I attended school frequently (I skipped school a lot before because I got so depressed about my situation which in turn generated even more stress)  and my social life improved since I was much more happy.  But ofc because my brother got born one and a half years ago my mom got back together with him recently since she didn't feel like raising a kid alone (although she did the same with me and everything turned out fine)(I'm still in contact with my biological father and we have a healthy relationship for anyone asking) . Right now my grades are still good and so is my school life but I fear if they keep things this way everything will go downhill from here on. 

Basically I have no fucking idea on what to do since my mom won't listen to me when it comes to him (she's normally very nice and understanding) and I can't force him to leave. 

I'm 17 and live in Germany in case anyone wants/needs to know. Here in Germany I could go to the ""Jugendamt"" which basically deals with problems teenagers have. But I already know what would probably happen. They would likely give me either my own apartment or put me in a apartment with other teenagers (more likely) and pay for it, but I can't bring myself to actually do it since my mom already almost cried when I told her I want to move to Berlin when I'm older and I don't think I would be able to handle it right now myself. Moving in with my father most likely isn't an option since he already has problems with providing enough space for his kids (my sister and my step brother (from his new wife)).

&amp;#x200B;

Also about like 6 months ago I had a panic attack because shit got to hot (my mom and him were arguing again).

I had to go to hospital for that. Of course he tried to look good and worried again even though I know he doesn't give a fuck.

479,"I returned to college after a two year break and switched my major to something that I thought I really wanted to do. I also got an entry level job in the field I'm majoring in, and although it isn't the exact job I want to have in the future, it is still in the same field. I am now two semesters into this major (still finishing up taking prerequisites, only taken the intro class for my major so far) and have been at the job about 3 months. 

I am really disappointed in myself because as days go on I'm starting to question whether this is what I want to do or not. I enjoy school, and sometimes enjoy my job, but feel like I just do not belong at the job. My personality is just not a good fit, and recently I've found myself slacking, and even getting anxious when faced with tasks at work because I know that I am not a good fit. I also feel guilty and beat myself up when I am not as good as the other people at my job. I would just quit the job but I feel like I can't because this could be what gets me a career when I graduate. I also feel like I will not be able to find another job in the area that pays as good or gives me the flexibility with classes. I have mental health issues and find it hard to work as it is, so the risk almost isn't worth it to me. 

When I do graduate I would like to find an online job in my field, because it sounds almost unbearable to me to have to work a 9-5 job the rest of my life. I know these types of jobs exist, but again, I am afraid that if I can't find one of them, I'll have to work a 9-5 and will be miserable. Recently I've been considering starting to stream myself playing video games, and eventually make a YouTube, because I know that that is something I'd enjoy doing, and could potentially make a lot of money from. Obviously I don't want to just drop everything to do this because it may not take off. 

So basically I am struggling with what to do from here. Should I continue to put myself into debt in a field that I'm not positive I'll stay in? Should I stay at my job until something better comes along, or should I actively look for something I enjoy more and risk not getting a career in this field straight out of college? Should I just begin streaming/YouTube while continuing to do what I'm doing now and see if it takes off and then act accordingly?

481,"My mom has a history of hiding things from me until it's too late. Like really important things. She won't tell me if she has something wrong with her medically. She won't tell me she had surgery, or if I'm lucky she'll tell me a day before!

Another example recently is that when I went away for a trip 5 years ago, she was watching my cats. She fell in love with my 7 year old cat, so I gave her to her even though I was really attached to my cat.

This past week I was away working another state over for an event, and the cat had passed away and she didn't tell me until afterwards and the vet visit was done. She didn't even tell me the cat was ill. This greatly upset me because I feel it is very important for me to be with animals during their passing due to my spiritual beliefs. She knows that too. I would have canceled the event or came back since it was just 3 hours if I knew the cat was ill.

I got in a petty bad argument with my mom about this, and I asked her to promise me she will tell me when something like this happens as soon as she knows and is possible. Her response was, ""I cannot and will not make that promise!!""

Now today, I just found out that she has a cancerous spot AND kidney stones from my dad that she didn't tell me about.

What makes it worse is once I asked a couple years ago why she doesn't tell me things, she told me it's because she knows that I care.

Out of my dad and sister, I'm the one that actually cares about her.

How backwards is that!! I tried talking to her multiple times about this, telling her that it hurts more to find out late, and she just doesn't listen.

489,"I'm 23M and I have a brother (27). I used to work as a s/w engineer but I left my job recently and moved back with my parents because I had a terrible imposter syndrome. I've been coping pretty well staying here and I'm going to go for my masters and hopefully reset my foot in working and be successful in life. 

My dad was never involved when we were growing up; it's not that there is no love, but there is definitely not much emotional involvement with me/my brother and my mom. He does not know how to make a marriage work and leaves my mom disappointed in everything in life. But he never cheats/drinks or does anything of that sort.

My brother is trying to startup something of his own and still not settled financially. He's been kind of a dick to my parents because he's never show enough love to them and still lies to them to the point that my mom gets hurt emotionally. Again, it's not that there's no love, it's just that my parents have given us so much freedom that he doesn't feel grateful to them. He roams around the world with his friends and girlfriend by never offered to take his parents on any kind of trips. He doesn't support the family financially and it's not like we are rich by any means.

My mom has taken the biggest blow ever. I don't think someone could care about their children enough like she did. She gave us the best of everything - food, house, education. If there's any kind of good characteristics in me and my brother, it's because of her. But still, the 3 men in her life have been disappointing (including me).

Now with both of us - me and by bro unsettled financially, my dad not supporting her, I'm worried. She's been like the head of the family but she's growing tired and old and losing hope. I've been with her for the past 5 months listening to everything she goes through. i really really want to make her feel like she's not wasted her life investing in us. How do I start to do this? How can I be matured in this kind of a situation and bring some peace to my parents? Should I take up more responsibilities? Please help how I can make them feel proud.",09Apr2019,1

495,"Hi, I'm 19 F. For the past few months I've been really unhappy almost all the time and the only thing that really brings me joy is being with my boyfriend who I really really love. 

Because he's one of the only good things in my life right now I've built my life around spending as much time as possible with him. This has resulted in me intentionally failing job interviews or quitting jobs after only one or two days. I don't really need money but I'm going back to school in August and I know that once that time comes I'll be mad at myself if I didn't at least save a little bit. 

I just found a job that I should really enjoy and yet I still feel sad because I'll see my boyfriend less (he lives a bit far so I can almost only see him on the weekends). I can't stop crying because he is away right now and won't come back until next tuesday. Plus my job has put me on a really boring project that I do not enjoy at all (I am supposed to test games but for my first job they put me on a boring website project with no games). The project ends in a week.

I know it's just a tough week to get through but I'm just worried that I'll still be miserable once the week passes just because my job prevents me from seeing my boyfriend more often even if I enjoy the next project I'm put on. 

Also I know that if I keep being too clingy I'll end up losing my boyfriend and I'll probably die if that happens.

496,"(19 F, freshman in college)

I'm not going to get into the major details of everything, but basically I've consistently had horrible luck with men (and just people in general) and I don't know if i can take it anymore.

I let a guy into my life a few months ago who completely betrayed my trust by fucking  my best friend (who is also my current roommate) behind my back. After that, I was pretty traumatized, but I cut both of them out of my life (as much as I could) and tried to not let it affect me. Well, after that, I told myself I wouldn't let anyone psychotic in anymore, and that I wouldn't ignore red flags. Eventually, a guy that I had been admiring from a distance for a while showed interest in me, and I couldn't be happier. He was cool, nice, attractive, and didn't seem anything like the desperate/horny asshole I had dealt with before. Because I was pretty desperate to move on, I let him in way too fast. Basically, we established a hookup relationship, and I ended up losing my virginity to him. in the beginning, things were great. I was so happy to have him in my life, even though it was clear we weren't going to date, I guess he just filled my need to be wanted and admired by someone. Eventually though, things went to utter shit. He started cancelling plans (to hookup) left and right, but would continue to ask to hang out. His excuses would get increasingly more and more ridiculous, it started off with him being ""sick"" and eventually he wouldn't even try to lie anymore and would just say he's ""busy"" or ""tired"". I think in total he has cancelled on me like 6 or 7 times in the month and a half we have been seeing each other. After he cancelled on me the first few times, I thought he just wasn't interested anymore and I kind of let it go and started to get over him while we were on spring break, but of course, the second we come back to school he is asking me to hang out again. I guess I just kept coming up with excuses for him, like maybe he's just not very considerate or maybe he just gets cold feet every time, or maybe it took him time to realize how much he valued me and he didn't want to lose me. But basically I kept agreeing, and I started to like him again.

Finally, a few days ago, I absolutely had it. In the past week, he has cancelled once 30 mins before we were supposed to hang out and then moved it to another day. Then, on the other day, he cancelled 20 minutes before we were supposed to hang out, even though he had confirmed he was coming an hour before. His excuse? Too lazy to walk over. He then proceeded to make a crude joke about sending a friend to ""tag team it for him"" followed by a ""jk"" and a ""but for real im not coming"". I was literally so shocked by this, mostly because, up to this point, he had been a really nice guy (aside from the cancelling) and seeing him dismiss me as if I was nothing was like a slap in the face. I had been looking forward to us hanging out all week, i cleaned my room, got ready, kicked out my roommates, all for him to just cancel and insult me 20 minutes before he confirmed he would come an hour earlier.

The next day, I decided I wasn't going to let myself deal with this anymore. i sent him a short paragraph basically saying i found the joke really rude, and that I liked him initially but he clearly had no respect for me. He responded by saying he was sorry and that he was being a dick and that we should probably end things from here. I agreed, and he apologized for wasting my time. Even though I'm glad he recognized he was in the wrong, I still feel cheated out of a real apology, and out of answers. I don't understand why he did this to me, and anytime i tell my friends or family they have no idea either. You would think if you didn't want to fuck someone anymore, you wouldn't ask them to hang out, or agree to plans, but he still did that, and it kept me from cutting him off which I should've done a long time ago.

I understand it was my fault for letting this happen. I should have cut off the cancer before it consumed me, but I was stupid and insecure and somehow I managed to come up with excuses on why he was treating me this way. I convinced myself he was just bad at communicating, or that maybe he was a bad planner or just nervous. But i guess this whole time he just genuinely didn't give a shit about me.

One of the worst parts about this is just thinking about how this entire time I was giving him the benefit of the doubt and letting him slip back into my life when all along I meant absolutely nothing to him and this was all a game.

I guess I'm just really angry that he gets to treat me like an animal and is able to move on with his life and be happy while I feel like I have nothing left. I feel like such an idiot and a loser letting him use me so much and take my virginity, my time, and my self-esteem. I just really need advice on how I move on from this. I don't know if I can ever trust a man again because of him, but at the same time I don't want him to steal even more opportunities from my life than he already has. Every time I try and think about how I shouldn't take this personally, I think about how he saw me at my absolute most vulnerable points that nobody else has ever seen before and it just makes me want to curl up and die because when he saw what I had to offer he decided I wasn't even worth common human decency.

Just having multiple people in my life use me, betray me, and treat me like actual dirt has completely destroyed any self-esteem I had before all of this happened. This made me feel really insecure about my looks, but also I'm starting to question myself as a person. I just don't understand why I attract toxic people into my life, or why people feel like they can fuck me over but not anyone else. 

I hope I'm just being pessimistic, I just really need a voice of reason to help me through this. Also if anyone has any insight into why someone would do this, please lmk, idc how mean it is.",09Apr2019,1

So I really wanted to be a university professor (fiction writing is my passion, and I would love to write and teach at a university level), but my parents pressured me into teaching, especially after I was offered a scholarship that pays for everything as long as I teach high or middle school in the state of Mississippi for five years.

508,"**Here is some backstory (2017):**

Two years ago I moved schools, in one of my classes there was a boy, and immediately  i was attracted to him; he was very good looking. Soon after we became really close and talked everyday. We both developed feelings and eventually asked me out (of course i said yes!) We dated for 6 months however it got really hard for me. I wasn't in a good place. One of my closest friends accused me of doing something (that i didn't do) and it caused a whole lot of drama. My boyfriend didn't do anything to help, infact, he made it harder. I would cry so often and I was always scared to see him at school. Eventually I broke up with him because it was too toxic.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now into more recent times (2018-2019):**

A little less than a year has gone by and we haven't talked. Our relationship was over in every possible way. I started to miss him... a lot... our friendship to be exact. We were VERY close prior to our ""romantic"" relationship. I really just missed him. I wanted to talk to him but I was unsure how, I thought it would be weird to suddenly message him, so i never did. Our school had an inter-school athletics carnival and both of us were in the team... we went but all day didn't do much because we were only reserves or in one event. It was only us, for the whole day. I was actually really happy about it. We laughed, walked around together, joked about the past and overall had a great time! I was very glad and from that day on we started talking again. After school everyday for a few weeks we would talk for hours. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our chats were very.... well let's just say there was a lot of chemistry. We would send hearts, flirt endlessly whilst also having fun. Sometimes we'd call for over 3 hours. Basically, we spent a lot of time talking. Eventually my feelings came back for him. They never really left but I was sure that they were back. He would tell me he cared for me that he liked talking to me etc. At first I didn't mind but what would happen is we'd talk for weeks, then suddenly it would stop for about 2 weeks, then that would repeat. This happened for more than half of 2018. I was head-over-heals for his boy. I would talk to my best friend about how happy i felt talking to him. It felt too good to be true. I really, really liked him.

&amp;#x200B;

The end of school rolled around (december 7th) and once school break came we slowly stopped talking... naturally I was really sad for a while. I was also mad. I didn't understand why it stopped, we had so much fun? it made no sense to me. I was really really upset. For a long time I fell asleep to sad music and I'd spend hours thinking about what I did wrong, or what happened. I would rant everyday about my feelings. Then, I dedicated my whole summer break to getting over him. Luckily I was going to Europe for a month so I had that to distract myself. Honestly, it was working. However, once I got back, i found out he and one of my friends sent photos to each other... I really didn't mind too much as I was over him during that time (only the occasional nights where I would became really sad)

&amp;#x200B;

**2019**

School started back and it wasn't too bad. I didn't have any classes with him so I was a little sad about that. To say I missed out conversations is the biggest understatement. I so badly wanted to talk to him again. I tried so hard to like another guy to get over him (it didn't work obviously). I was managing... though I would have weekly sad rants. I felt it was so unfair that I was going through all this emotion and he seemed fine. I wanted to talk to him and I missed him but I wondered if he felt the same. There was one big mystery regarding him. I had no idea if what happened between us meant anything to him at all. All these questions only made it harder for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Now we are up to very recent times. Last week my friend messaged him and they got into a conversation. Somehow it ended up on me. The friend that was talking to him was the one that listened to ALL of my rants about him, ALL of them. There isn't one rant that she hasn't heard. Anyway, she brought me up subtly asking about me and him talking. He told her that when we actually talked we could really connect but we didn't talk much. When she told me this i was overjoyed and happy as hell. However, this euphoric feelings turned into some form of anger. My question was ""WHY? did he stop talking to me then? If we had such a connection, why would it stop??"" my friend then asked why we stopped and he dodged the question... The next day my friend and him are talking again, once again I'm brought up. Somehow they get onto the topic of crushes. He tells my friend that I'm his ""never ending crush"". I literally screamed I was so happy, however I love to overthink and question the legitimacy of this statement. I didn't know if it just meant I had a place in his heart or if he felt how I felt. Everything about him was just questions. I had too many and it really just ate me up. 

&amp;#x200B;

I still really like him and It's so confusing. I don't know how to feel or if i should just get over him... I feel like he will just play with my feelings again. Ugh it's so hard :( I've liked him for so long now... idk what to do. Please help.. I just want to talk to him again and get the clarity I so badly need. ughhh",09Apr2019,1

I was still on his insurance, but switched to my own insurance. Everything was approved and I got my card in the mail the other day. The hospital helped me do all of this, and “explained” everything so that the bills wouldn’t be sent to my dads house. 

They said before I got my new insurance, I would just have to pay up front for OGBYN appointments and hospital visits, then my new insurance would go back 3 months and cover it. 

I said repeatedly to the staff that was helping me that none of these bills could go to my dads house, and that I would be paying for it. I paid soo much money going to appointments to avoid this from happening. 

Last night I get a text from my dad wanting to know why I went to the hospital around Valentine’s Day. I freak out and call the hospital, and it turns out that they are sending him all my bills. They said because I was on his insurance at the time they have to bill his insurance first before they can bill mine or it will deny the claim. 

They never told me that this was ever going to happen. At the hospital they even promised to take his insurance off of my chart so that it wouldn’t be billed. One of the bills they sent him has detailed information about the ultrasounds they did. They are also saying he could potentially still have to pay for part of my visit. 

I’m so confused and upset about all of this. I told the hospital before they even saw me that this could NOT go on his insurance, this could NOT be billed to his house, and all of the staff insisted it wouldn’t.

Believe me I'm looking for a new job, I just want to find a better way to respond to my manager when she asks if I can work late shift.  I know they are legitimate, but sometimes I feel guilty even though I shouldn't....I don't get paid extra to work late; I'm salaried.

TLDR I ended up recently handing in my two weeks notice because of my boss's behavior, bs, etc and it was taking a serious told on my physical and mental health.  I was placed there through a program and I've been in contact with the program's lead from the beginning and they've been kept updated about everything I've been through.  I told them that I resigned, bcc'd them the email, everything. At this point I didn't hear anything from my boss. Last week the program lead called to give me a heads up that said boss had emailed the person above them to complain that I had quit suddenly. 

Because of my experiences with boss, I'm worried that they may have tried to do something negative or tried to paint themselves in a positive light afraid I'd say something about their treatment of me.

515,"I \[26m\] had a truly best friend since my childchood until time I was about 22. There was a misunderstanding between us. I have made some kind of stupid joke and he though I wanted to hook up with him (he was wrong). He told some of our mutual friends and his family (that liked me much) that I'm a gay (I'm not btw) and I wanted to hook up with him. We argued couse I was embarassed and felt kind of betrayed by him then I cutted contact with him (and his family cutted contact with me). He tried to repair it some time after it was happen but I didn't give him a chance. Soon after I had to move to another city and I didn't see him since that time.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I'm planning to visit my hometown soon for few days. I still like him and I was thinking last time that it would be great if we can be best friends again couse I have never had friend like him and I am sure I won't ever never have friend like him in the future. I saw that he didn't remove me from friends on Facebook. Our last conversation was in Spring 2014. 

  
I want to text him on Facebook and ask if he want to meet with me couse I will visit his town soon. But I affraid. I affraid couse he probably still thinks I'm gay and he has a lot of new friends right now. I don't even know if he likes me anymore. Maybe not. It can be very embarrassing if he will see my message and don't answer or will tell me that he don't like me.

516,"For some context, we're both female. The friend I won the bet with has had the same style and looked pretty bland for a few years - shes a girly girl with long dark hair and I've been trying to convince her to try something new for once. She's really proud of her hair even though she doesn't really put any effort into styling it or anything, and refuses to take any advice regarding it.

So I made a bet with her, details don't really matter except it was fair, so not rigged or anything, and the winner got to give the loser a mohawk. Obviously, I won. I'm quite happy about this bc I get to make her change things up a lot. I'm planning on making her go all the way, shaving most of her hair, cutting the rest short... I'm even gonna dye her hair a bright colour (green/blue probably) and make her spike it up. I know for a fact she would do the same kind of thing to me so I don't feel too mean about this, and I think she'd pull it off really well, it'd definitely suit her.

However, earlier today she texted me asking if I'd consider anything that isn't a mohawk. I said no because I really want to see her change things up, and she replied a bit later telling me she's fine with whatever I do. Obviously I'm glad she'll let me, but I'm not sure if I should go through with it, even it's it totally fair of me to.

I know this is long but please bear with me. 

About two years ago,  I was not in a good place. I had depression and depressive tendencies and had even attempted taking my own life but always backed out and went to the hospital myself. Almost no one knew about this; I kept it as hidden as best as I could. The only person who knew about it was my best friend. 

I’d moved to an entirely new city for university, and she wasn’t with me, but her childhood friends were. I knew them before university started and we truly got to bond, and I always thought of them as my friends too. My close friends, even. We always hung out together. 

I kept in touch with my best friend. I talked to her every single day. My depression got worse and I started having more episodes, and she knew about that. Meanwhile, she started having her own issues. This caused us to fight a lot. Neither of us was in the right mindset. We both made mistakes and hurt each other. 

It was wrong of me, but at that time I tried to make her jealous of a new friend I had. I only wanted to feel that I’m still important to her. I admit and acknowledge that this was wrong of me and I never realized it hurt her this much. I soon realized my mistakes and the terrible things I did and I tried to fix things. But she wouldn’t have it. 

We both said terrible things to each other. We both took it too far. But it only escalated when she involved her childhood friends. 

I always thought of them as my friends, so I was devastated when they turned on me aggressively and started treating me like I’m the villain in the story. I realize that what I did was wrong, but my best friend said and did her own share of wrong things too. 

One of them threatened to get physical with me. They kept tweeting things about me that I can’t even repeat because they make me cry. I was truly sad because I thought they were my friends, and I thought they’d look at the situation without bias. 

If I had been mentally okay at that time, I don’t think it would’ve affected me as much as it did. But as I mentioned, I was in an awful place. My depression spiraled out of control. My best friend knew about it, but said nothing, and kept setting her friends against me despite the fact that she knew about my tendencies. 

One night, I cracked. I couldn’t take it anymore. It was right after one of her childhood friends berated me online and told me that I’m being fake and playing victim. I hated myself for everything. I believed them; I believed that I was the villain and that I should die. That everyone would be happier if I do. So I made what I thought was my final and damning attempt to take my own life. 

I swallowed all the pills I had, and waited for death. 
Instead, I woke up at the hospital. 

I was angry at myself for failing. I was angry at everyone for forcing me to stay alive. I was beyond devastated when I saw how sad my mother was and how confused she felt. I watched the happy image I built of myself fall apart in everyone’s mind, all from my hospital bed. 

My best friend apologized, and I told her she didn’t have to. It wasn’t her fault. Her childhood friends knew about what happened, but they never deigned to talk to me. They just blocked me everywhere online. My best friend told me that she cut them off and she’ll never talk to them again, so I stayed in contact with her. 

It was a long journey from there. I was put in a psych ward. I was very uncooperative, and for the first few months all I could think of was how angry I was. I was so angry that nobody else saw the truth about me. That I was useless and mean and deserved to die. 

For the next year I still blamed myself. It still haunted me how I caused my best friend pain and insecurity for making her jealous. I hated myself so much. 

I spent so much time trying to redeem myself to her, trying to redeem myself to my own self. I spent so much time trying to convince myself that I’m not the villain in the story, to no avail. 

It’s been a couple of years, and thoughts of it still haunt me. Only recently, I learned that my “best friend” had reconnected with her childhood friends and was talking to them again. It was the first time in a long time that thoughts of attempting again had come back to my mind. 

I understand that they’re her childhood friends, and that she shouldn’t leave them just because they hurt me. I understand that people contain multitudes and that one evil action does not define them. 

But they never gave me the privilege of seeing me as a multi-dimensional person who’s not a paper-cut villain, so I choose not to give them the privilege of empathy. I know they were trying to protect their friend, but I also know that they’re not remorseful at all for what happened. 

I told my friend that while I respect her choice to befriend them again, I cannot remain friends with her if she’s still friends with them. She implied that I’m being immature and petty, but I told her I’m sorry and she agreed that we should cut ties. We did so amicably, but I still feel terrible about it. 

Am I the asshole for cutting her off and not trying to see things from her point of view? I don’t hold any anger towards her anymore, but I cannot deal with the fact that after everything that happened, they all came out unscathed. Except for me.

I feel really petty and immature. And I feel like it’s not a reason good enough to cut her off, but I know that I had to do that in order to save my mental health. How do I feel less guilty about it?",09Apr2019,2

I get to a point where I am doing good work. I'm happy, my boss is happy, everyone is happy. This is where the trouble starts.

I don't receive what I believe to be appropriate recognition. Lower than anticipated raises, passed on chances for new projects, denied promotion opportunities, that sort of thing.

This eats away at me and I become bitter. I hate my job and start performing poorly at work. Management talks to me which makes me more bitter because I'm only angry about their failure to properly recognize me.

I met this guy when I was sixteen. I went to a party with his friends, I got wasted, and two of them brought me to a different house and had sex with me. I bled I felt baffled. The next day they told all their friends they were 18 and 19. I was already getting bullied and had slut rumors spread about me, so they thought I wanted it. They called me gross.




I just lost all confidence at that point I felt like damaged goods. I still hooked up with one of them after that because I felt like no one would want me after that. John would hook up with me when he was drunk but ignore me during the day. 



He left for the military but still kept in contact with me. I would send him pics over two years and see me when he was home. He cheated on one of his girlfriends with me.  I didn't know because the one social media I had he posted no photos but on every other platform he did. He would have sex with me then ignore me for a month. He implied I'm attractive enough to fuck but not be seen with




I graduated I turned 18 he was 20 that is the last time I saw him. I left to volunteer outside the country for two months. My phone broke while I was there while I was gone he blew up my phone sending me dozens and dozens of messages. He also made tweets like ”if you have to think if I care about you I probably don't fuck everyone.”


When I got back, I talked to him some. Then he got weird and was like ”do you tell anyone I talk to you. I don't want to ruin my reputation.” I felt like a dirty secret and gross. I kept asking why he would say that he said he had a girlfriend. I said if you have a girlfriend, then you shouldn't be talking to me and focus on her because she's probably a nice pretty girl. He said he was joking and send nudes. 


A couple of weeks later I ask why we haven't talked. He says he has a girlfriend and doesn't want to see me. I ask why he lied to me, why I'm not good enough. John called me annoying and said ”thats just who he is.” that he wants me got sex nothing less nothing more.


That girl ended up cheating on him and him, and he started texting me again, but I never saw him in person after that. It's been almost four years. I moved to LA to finally be happy.  I started working in production on TV and commercials. I met a lot of nice people, no one has been mean to me since I moved here and guys are always so lovely.

I feel so ugly by the way he treats me. Two years ago he texted me after having a girlfriend for eight months. At first, I didn't know when he told me that I said I don't feel comfortable talking to you with a girlfriend. He sent me dozens of texts saying he missed me and sending old pics he had of me from three years ago. He asked,” if I was single would we be cool again.”


I kept ignoring him, and a couple of weeks later he got a new girlfriend. Posted lots of pics of her saying she's gorgeous. He went on deployment we stopped talking. After his deployment, he got discharged and moved to the east coast with his girlfriend. Before he left, he tried to see me and tried face timing me like 60 times. Thank God I was in a different state.


Now he's been messaging me like crazy saying he misses me and that I'm beautiful. I just blew up at him after six years of this I couldn't take it anymore. I called him a rapist, a douchebag, self-centered, a cheating loser, a sociopath, a liar, and a coward.

He just kept saying ”why are you mean to me.” and ”if you're going to put me down stop messaging me.” he also tweeted stuff like ”if you can’t respect me. Then at least have the decency to leave me alone. be your own problem.” after I blew up at him the first time he tried apologizing for a couple of months later, but I just started saying the same stuff to him.


I feel like shit I feel like this is my fault why would anyone treat me like this? Was I too mean to him? Did he treat me this way because of how I look?

533," 

LONG BACKSTORY: This ""friend"" of mine has been in my life for 5 months. I (23F) met her through my new workplace and we hit it off pretty good. However, after a couple of weeks went by, I started to find out she had more problems than what she was letting me see. A girl at my mothers workplace (we will call her ""L"") just got back with her boyfriend after he cheated on her. The girl that he was with was this ""friend"" of mine that I had recently met. Between the two women, I was hearing stories of how my ""friend"" was stalking ""L"", constantly calling, threatening and doing other stuff that was uncalled for, while my ""friend"" told me a completely different story. Either way, I tried to be friends with both girls BUT I (unfortunately) was persuaded by this ""friend"" to choose her, because of how we bonded over a situation that recently happened with me in which this ""friend"" and I related to. Clearly this was a horrible decision, I understand that. After having numerous bonding sessions, she did me random favors at work such as helping me out with understanding my machines better (I work as a machine operator) and giving me rides home and clothes she just bought. She even introduced me to her mom (who also works in the same building).

After a month or so, I started getting attention from other coworkers and apparently that was a big no no for my ""friend."" I was getting attention from practically everyone in my department because I like to make jokes, and make people laugh and I feel like I get on well with people. Before I knew it, I became well acquainted with everyone and as soon as I began talking to this ""friend"" about my new friends, she quickly shut me down by claiming I was ""thinking too much"" about them, especially if it was male coworkers despite them being taken/married (which I have no intention to do anything with). The problem I have with this, is the fact that she herself can do and say whatever she wants but when I did it, she would constantly shut me down. This included her talking inappropriately about a married coworker to me, which makes it a double-standard in my eyes. Meanwhile this was happening, she was controlling who I talked to (constantly watching me, following me, asking questions about what I was saying to people) and constantly obsessing over the same guy she was with at the beginning of this post, claiming he gave her dirty looks and even taking me with her to drive by his house.

During that month, I fell for a guy who she didn't want me to see (of course) and during my relationship with him, she got her best friend to start serious rumors about me sleeping around, and sexually harassing my ""friend"" which never happened. ""Friend"" would also talk poorly and make crude jokes in front of me, bring up people she knew I didn't like when I was in earshot, snickering at me, etc... After I reported her, and went to HR about her, it still continued until another coworker from 1st shift decided to rip her an asshole on something on the same level of what I was dealing with. This ""friend"" decided to put on the crocodile tears after this coworker left, and apologized to me. I fell for it like an idiot, and the same shit slowly started to develop.

Now in present time, I decided to take a stand to be my own person by telling her I'm going to be focusing more on me. I did it in a way that still gave her hope of me remaining to be her friend. At the same time, I'm dating an ex of hers whom she used as a rebound to get over the only guy mentioned in this post, and dumped him after a week. She told me that it probably wouldn't work out and gave me the ""If I can't do it, you can't do it"" bullshit. At the same time, she told me to ""go for it"" and so I did. When my boyfriend who was single at the same started talking to me and smiling at me, she began to constantly message/stalk him like she did with the girl ""L"" in the beginning. Instead of telling her about it, I let her find out on her own today and have just been completely ignoring her. She now snickers and says mean things just to get the attention of both my boyfriend and I, but we just ignore her and avoid looking at her. I've also blocked her without her knowing, but she probably will know very soon because i'm ""ignoring her"" when I actually have her blocked.

Now onto the question: Am I doing the right thing by ignoring this person, or should I confront her about it in person? She also is on her phone and on FaceBook a lot at work so messaging anything to her would just give her what she wants.",09Apr2019,1

541,"So I'm twenty four years old now and I'm really tired of the jobs I keep getting. They are always factory types and I honestly feel like its aging me to the point I don't see me living past forty. I fight with some undiagnosed mental disorder (could be anything from depression to bpd,  scared and can't afford to actually get looked at). So I've been thinking of going back to college.  I tried once before but not only was the subject matter ill fitting I ended up getting sick during my first final and I couldn't go. I had a collapsed lung that went down again a week after. I don't even know where to start or how to do any of this. I can't ask my parents for any sort of support, emotional or financial,  as they have never really been the supportive type. I don't even care if the job I get from my degree isn't the highest paying. I just want to do something I'll actually enjoy. 

I plan on going to a college with an equine science or management program. Maybe even a farrier program with it. Any advice would he welcomed though I will say advice pertaining to ""dont go to college do a trade!"" Is not really welcomed as I've already looked at that option and most things seem out of reach or unrealistic to me.

BACKSTORY: This ""friend"" of mine has been in my life for 5 months. I (23F) met her through my new workplace and we hit it off pretty good. However, after a couple of weeks went by, I started to find out she had more problems than what she was letting me see. A girl at my mothers workplace (we will call her ""L"") just got back with her boyfriend after he cheated on her. The girl that he was with was this ""friend"" of mine that I had recently gotten to know. Between the two women, I was hearing stories of how my ""friend"" was stalking ""L"", constantly calling, threatening and doing other stuff that was uncalled for, while my ""friend"" told me a completely different story. Either way, I tried to be friends with both girls BUT I (unfortunately) was persuaded by this ""friend"" to choose her, because of how we bonded over a situation that recently happened with me in which this ""friend"" and I related to. After having numerous bonding sessions, she did me random favors at work such as helping me out with understanding my machines better (I work as a machine operator) and giving me rides home and clothes she just bought. She even introduced me to her mom (who also works in the same building).

After a month or so, I started getting attention from other coworkers and apparently that was a big no no for my ""friend.""  Before I knew it, I became well acquainted with everyone and as soon as I began talking to this ""friend"" about my new friends, she quickly shut me down by claiming I was ""thinking too much"" about them, especially if it was male coworkers despite them being taken/married (which I have no intention to do anything with). The problem I have with this, is the fact that she herself can do and say whatever she wants but when I did it, she would constantly shut me down. This included her talking inappropriately about a married coworker to me, which makes it a double-standard in my eyes. Meanwhile this was happening, she was controlling who I talked to (constantly watching me, following me, asking questions about what I was saying to people) and constantly obsessing over the same guy she was with at the beginning of this post, claiming he gave her dirty looks and even taking me with her to drive by his house.

During that month, I fell for a guy who she didn't want me to see (of course) and during my relationship with him, she got her best friend to start serious rumors about me sleeping around, and sexually harassing my ""friend"" which never happened. ""Friend"" would also talk poorly and make crude jokes in front of me, bring up people she knew I didn't like when I was in earshot, snickering at me, etc... After I reported her, and went to HR about her, it still continued until another coworker from 1st shift decided to rip her an asshole on something on the same level of what I was dealing with. This ""friend"" decided to put on the crocodile tears after this coworker left, and apologized to me. I fell for it like an idiot, and the same shit slowly started to develop.

Now in present time, I decided to take a stand to be my own person by telling her I'm going to be focusing more on me. I did it in a way that still gave her hope of me remaining to be her friend. At the same time, I'm dating an ex of hers whom she used as a rebound to get over the only guy mentioned in this post, and dumped him after a week. She told me that it probably wouldn't work out and gave me the ""If I can't do it, you can't do it"" bullshit. At the same time, she told me to ""go for it"" and so I did. When my boyfriend who was single at the same started talking to me and smiling at me, she began to constantly message/stalk him like she did with the girl ""L"" in the beginning. Instead of telling her about it, I let her find out on her own today and have just been completely ignoring her. She now snickers and says mean things just to get the attention of both my boyfriend and I, but we just ignore her and avoid looking at her. I've also blocked her without her knowing, but she probably will know very soon because i'm ""ignoring her"" when I actually have her blocked.

Now onto the question: Am I doing the right thing by ignoring this person, or should I confront her about it in person? She also is on her phone and on FaceBook a lot at work so messaging anything to her would just give her what she wants.",09Apr2019,1

I have been supportive of him the whole time and he is nice back but randomly I assume during these episodes starts getting a bit mean with his messages. 

Anyway last night he called my other friend (Tony)  when we was round mine and said that he’s coming down to Sawbridgeworth Friday. And he says he’s gonna come see us like old times etc. Then starts talking about how one of us are the only people that would set him up.

547,"A bit of context. 
I’m currently 17, studying A Levels and I’ve always been very academic. 

In the last few months though, I have become a massive perfectionist and been giving the impression that I think I’m superior to my peers, due to the grades I achieve and the workload I do. 

Through always being a high-achiever, I always see anything less than the top grade as a personal failure, which has made my stress levels increase a lot and caused my mental health to deteriorate. I’ve been diagnosed with Bipolar type 2 for a few years ago, which isn’t helping my mindset. 

But even with my minimal sleep and depressive emotions, my teachers have told me that I give the impression that “oh I’ll get 3 A*s next year, I’ll be going to a top university, I’m better than all of you”. They say it’s a more recent thing from the last few months. 

I don’t know how to fix this, I don’t even notice it to be honest. But I know that I don’t want to be seen as a full-of-herself bitch, I want to improve myself and work towards bettering my relationships &amp; my mental health.

549,"Okay, so I moved in with my fiance in December, so about 5 months ago now, and I couldn't be happier living with him. The only downside to the situation, his nephew (D) also lives with him, now us. Even though by blood D's my fiance's  nephew, they literally grew up together, being only a year apart in age, they're like brothers. Which bother me none whatsoever, in the time that I've known D, we've gotten pretty close too. 

The problem I have with D, is that he's literally a neck beard in the making, and does absolutely nothing to help around the house. We all work full time, 10+ hours a day, 40-60 hours a week. Yet whenever I get home from work, I still manage a little housework, and some form of dinner being made for all of us. My fiance always helps me when he can or when I ask, whereas D sits in his room all alone, and plays video games. He only comes out to eat when i come tell him it's ready. 

Recently I've gotten sick tired of my fiance and I doing EVERYTHING, because we all live here, we all need to help. And everyone does but D. 

The most annoying part has to be that he'll clean up his room if his gf comes over, but that's it. He also brags about how he's had to live on his in before and has had to do everything for himself, yet he never does, and waits for one of us to do everything for him. 

I've asked, begged, told, pleaded with him to help me out. I've even bribed him with pot, (major stoner), making him food. And even allowing him to eat the food IM BUYING THEN COOKING FOR HIM. I've started telling him if he doesn't help me, then I'm going to stop letting him eat mine and my fiance's food, that he can then cook for himself and clean up his own dishes. But it still doesn't work. 

What do I do? I can kick him out, he'd have nowhere to go, and it's not my call, it's my fiance's. They have an agreement that if D loses his job, (that my fiance got him) he has to move out cause we can't support him...and I find myself hoping he does lose his job, or hoping everytime we all get into a big fight about D's lack of compassion, and maturity, he chooses to leave.

553,"I am a student at the Politecnico di Torino currently finishing my first year of master in mechatronics engineering, and to be honest I am very tired of this university, its style, and the city. I wanted to go to Switzerland in order to get a better education as well as integrate into research and work on a Ph.D. later on, but I got rejected. So the scenario I am stuck in or rather need advice on ( I am very thankful for the opportunities provided) is that: 

1.) I got offered an internship in Hamburg, Germany at Fraunhofer for 6 months. (starts July or now depends on me)

2.) I got admitted into a double degree of master in mechatronics engineering at TUHH and master in business and technology at NIT both in Hamburg, Germany. (starts September and going to last around 2 years considering what credits are transferred from poly Torino)

3.) I am almost done with my first year of master in mechatronics in Italy. (Finishes next year)

I am lost and I don't know which path to proceed on considering I'm not sure what I want to do with my life after I got denied Switzerland. I also mentioned the dates because the timeline is important, I am not Italian, I'm Lebanese and have some health issues, have had them since I was born and they're not life-threatening at all but require surgery. 3 Surgeries to be exact and the plan is to do them in my country in the summer so depending on what I decide I might have to postpone the surgeries considering the paperwork to be done if I leave to Germany. On a further note, I also don't know whether I want to proceed with a Ph.D. or start working after the master degree, however, I do love research. The problem is choosing one will affect the other considering what I think, not speaking from experience, but I think the double degree would be great for work, but not research. And, Poly Torino is better for research considering it is a superior university compared to TUHH. I hope I managed to summarize everything as efficiently as possible.",09Apr2019,2

557,"I had a difficult year last year. It started beautifully, I was going to move in with my then-boyfriend, traveling around the world... then we ended things badly, my friends didn’t give me any support because according to them I made up the entire relationship because I never posted pictures online and they’d never met him (to be fair, we both had lived abroad), I’ve been battling depression on and off since two years ago, I’ve overcome suicide attempts, those same friends bullied me online and sent me hurtful messages on my birthday...

I went from having 20 close friends to none. I know I should be grateful for this. They used to mock me as “unrelatable” because of my privilege and who I was dating. They used to make light of my mental health problems. I certainly did most of the work and effort in our friendship. I should feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulder, but I’m just sad I had 21 relationships ended spectacularly bad in a span of four whirlwind months.

Since then, I’ve been holed up in my room. I haven’t gone out or eaten out in one year unless it’s with family. Even then I keep to myself because making a conversation is tiring. Socializing is tiring. On top of that, I don’t feel like I could trust anyone anymore. Sure, family’s different so I hate myself for even having that thought.

I’ve become a recluse and as a result, I’ve lost any form of social manners. I get easily upset over simple things. I often throw tantrums over random things. Furthermore, I’ve been relying on my parents too much and I couldn’t get a job or go back to school because I just don’t want to. It’s a huge effort to even want to wake up in the morning.

I really don’t know what to do with life. I feel like I’ve peaked and my best times are behind me. Traveling and movies used to excite me but now even the thought of it just feels like a chore.

My current job is one where,  if I put in another year or two I could POTENTIALLY make a good living, but this new job is one where I could certainly make a good living NOW, learn great skills and if I absolutely hate the company and people I could move to another company in a year or two.

563,"To make this short as possible which I really can’t~
I’ve been at my job for about 10 months now. When I first started this guy (who is really attractive) seemed to almost be flirting with me. I was shocked because I’m me and he’s him. I’m not awful looking but I’m definitely not that attractive lol. Also, I’m for sure not really thin and he is, so I always assume guys aren’t into girls my size (it’s just an insecurity, I’m 5’3 and weigh around 145). Anyways, nothing was ever really obvious or anything but he was really nice, asked about my past jobs, high school etc. he had also done this by coming to my desk and sitting on it. He also had messaged me on our business Skype but again, nothing was super obvious or anything. I was obviously flattered and was just nice back, considering I have a boyfriend. I’d obviously never actually do anything, like I said I was just being friendly and honestly I just can’t imagine him actually “having a thing” for me. It wasn’t like we talked much at all, it was literally maybe 2-3 times a month. Then after 3-4 months I found out he is engaged and is getting married in September. I was so puzzled. I was just confused because he definitely did not seem to be engaged, and is only like 23. Regardless, as I’ve made friends with more people at work we don’t really talk unless other people are involved. Nothing is outrageously flirty but I almost find it odd that 1. He doesn’t really look at me when he talks to me, and 2. He won’t just talk to me alone. 

Then, a week or so ago my boyfriend met me for lunch that happened to be where a few of my co workers also went for lunch. He was there and pointed out who was who to my bf just to tell him. Nothing was said, but that weekend my boyfriend said “oh yeah, the dude with he dark hair kept looking at me all weird, he probably has a thing for you.” Inside I was like wait...WHAT. The fact that he thought that just confused me so much, considering I’ve never mentioned any of this to him. Now, before there are negative comments about me having a boyfriend and even caring about this- we have been together for 5 years. We’re both 21 and although we are young I’ve been ready for the next steps in a relationship (we have lived together for 3 years and have pets together) and he is not at all. Unfortunately it’s something that bothers me 24/7 and yes, I’ve talked to him about this. All he says is “if you want to get married right now then I’m not the guy for you” it’s really hurtful as disheartening. I love him so much and do everything for him, so it’s really hard to wake up everyday knowing you aren’t loved the way you love someone else. So, yes it’s absolutely flattering to have someone maybe thinking I’m cute or something. Like I said before I would NEVER act on anything while in a relationship.

 I’m just asking if this is even possible so I can change my attitude towards him. I mention my bf all the time at work so he is very aware of him, and actually has negative thoughts I think. The only reason I say this is because I was talking to him and my other friend about me being a sugar mama to him because he was seasonally unemployed. He was really irritated by this although I was saying it in a joking manner, I don’t know I can’t quite explain it; it was just odd. He also mentions his fiancé around me, but only when he’s talking to someone else. I don’t know I just want to know if it’s even a thing for a guy that is getting married to look at someone else like that. Any insight would be extremely helpful and appreciated!!

I have a couple questions.
1. Is there an appropriate time I should re-ask
2. Should I try and talk to her online and irl a little more or should I leave her be?
3. Do you think asking her to tell me when she'd be ok to hangout would be a better thing to do?",09Apr2019,1

574,"  

It’s almost my boyfriend’s birthday. We’ve been together for a few years, so I’ve hung out with him on his past birthdays, but he confided in me that he’s never had an actual birthday party (had friends over, went somewhere, etc.), not even as a little boy. For this year, we planned to go out to eat as his favorite restaurant then stay at a nice hotel he picked out, but I wanted to give him a little party when we got to the hotel room. He works a job that’s 7 days a week and supports our family (me and our cats), while I go to school full-time, so I appreciate him very much and how hard he works. He’s my closest family and I’m so excited to give him a party, even if it’ll just be the two of us. I love him so much. 

&amp;#x200B;

I made deals with our families, to get him gifts that I know he’s been wanting. His parents are doing it in the form of a loan, so he’s technically buying those presents for himself :/. His birthday is in a couple weeks, so I don’t have much time to plan, but I had an idea to bake him some kind of birthday desert. He doesn’t like cake, so I was thinking cookies, brownies, or rice crispies. The last idea I had was, instead of getting things I usually do with the next check, I’m going to use that money to buy a pinata and party decorations and surprise him with everything in the hotel room. I just want this to be special for him and to give him the kind of party he’s never had. I need advice, especially from men 20-30, on anything else I can do, make, or get him that would help make this a fun birthday party. Thank you.",09Apr2019,1
575,"Quick backstory: i went to boarding school with this girl, we didn't talk throughout the year, but like a year ago we started talking and became really good friends, this weekend we hung out and just chilled, no problems whatsoever. Today though for some reason she just blocked me on everything, instagram, snapchat, etc. she hadn't blocked me on messenger yet, and i tried asking her if i had done something wrong. She instantly blocked me from sending messages(we're still friends on facebook i just can't message her) I have depression, and she was one of my closest friends, i felt like i could tell her anything and she wouldn't judge or anything, but now i don't know what to do..

578,"I moved on to the second stage of applying to a prestigious art school, which is a 30 min interview. The questions will most likely be about your artistic process, your application work, why you want to attend their school and your vision as an artist etc, but I can't rule out that they'll spring an unexpected question on me and I'm terrified of messing up!

When I get nervous I look away and my voice gets really shaky, almost like I'm about to cry. There'll be two teachers interviewing me. I'm 19 and most people applying seem to be older so I'm scared to come off as scared and young. 

I got to know the date a week beforehand so I've been trying to prepare. But I feel so incredibly scared that sleeping is difficult. I'm utterly terrified about it and it feels like it's ruining my life. I know it's dramatic but I am not exaggerating how nervous I am. I'm trying different methods, bullshitting my way and giving generic answers, which feels more safe, or giving honest answers that don't always work. Giving them what I think they want or being myself. 

How do I make them like me?

I know it's pathetic but I kind of desperately want to be accepted. Most people don't get accepted on their first try, there's a ton of competition. They cut half the applicants after the interview. If I don't get in I know I'll be extremely disappointed in myself and feel like they disliked me as a person. I'm honestly going to punish myself very harshly. This whole thing just feels awful, and on top of it I have another art application for another school due Monday and because I've been stressing about this unexpected interview I'm behind, and am stressing about it too.",09Apr2019,1

581,"Over the last year my life has gone incredibly downhill. 

I was with a boyfriend, for a year and a half whom I loved so so much. However, we broke up due to faults on both sides. We split up for 3 months and I had an extremely hard time emotionally getting over it and felt like I changed as a person in a bad way. I developed BPD (borderline personality disorder) and I feel so taken away from who I once was. We got back together then broke up again recently and that’s it now. He doesn’t really want anything to do with me now and I’m heartbroken. He’s the only person who I feel truly understands me and my past so now I’m really sad that I have no one like that. I’m currently trying really hard to build up new friendships with people but honestly.. you try living in an environment where you know everyone around you hates you. It takes its toll. 

As you guys don’t know me as a background. I’m f/19, I generally consider myself to be the kind, quiet kid. I tend to make lots of jokes and make people laugh but as a general I like to keep to myself. 

Over the last year my life has been very fucked up to say the least.. 


• I drove my uncle to want to commit suicide after spending 2 weeks with me. He acted really strange towards me, creepy strange. I’d wake up to him staring at me sleeping a lot. He came into my room one time and sat on the end of my bed, leaned over me to see if I was asleep then tickled my leg and feet with a feather. He had a problem with his hygiene.. I’ll be honest.. his hands smelt like poo. He constantly wanted to touch my face, which I HATED. And when I vocalised this... (politely asked him not to) he got really mad and angry up in my face and said how ‘he can touch me if he wants to touch me and I can’t stop him.’ A lot of shit happened, which is too long a story to tell. He was reckless driving and got us into a car crash. He also fell asleep on the motorway speeding for the car in front, thought I was going to die. A lot of bad stuff happened I wasn’t okay with.. and I ended up leaving screaming at him to please open the door whilst dragging out my luggage and having a panic attack. He then stalked me for the next hour in the streets begging me for forgiveness. After this, sent messages to my mum saying how he’s going to burn his money and kill himself. &amp; how he wishes the car accident was more fatal. F u n.

• I cut contact with my friend of 7 years over it being too toxic. He kept telling me how I wasn’t good enough and how I should give up on my life goals.

• I lost 2 really good friends I moved in with at the start of uni because they started being really malicious over smoking around me when they know it’s dangerous for my health. This time last year I choked and inhaled my vomit and almost died. I got bronchitis and aspiration pneumonia. Very poorly. But permanently damaged my lungs so I’m now very sensitive to this kinda stuff. I developed crackling in my lungs again from the smoking environment so I moved out. 

• I redid my first year at uni and I’ve had this girl who’s been bullying me, even slapped me at one point for not saying goodbye to her bf because I was busy. I tried reaching out for help at uni because mentally I couldn’t take it anymore but SHE FUCKING LIED, and told the tutors that I did everything she did to me. As a person I’m very confrontational so I just tend to say nothing and suffer in silence. Im not one of those big mouthed bitchy girls, but just my luck.. she was. She turned all of my friends and people at uni against me. I sat there at uni for an hour yesterday hearing this girl bitch about me (after a month of nothing) She was being indirect but made sure she was loud and obvious so I heard. She said how she thought uni would be different and not so bitchy, how she’s met some really childish people, about how her life is great and why would she ever waste time thinking about someone like me, how I must be jealous of her. I have nothing, NOTHING, to be jealous of. She’s a nasty human being who’s extremely fake. I was living in the same flat in accommodation, the room next to her and she was threatening me through my friends at uni saying for me to keep my distance from her otherwise she may “say or do something she’ll regret”. 3 weeks prior she had a fist fight in the laundry room and before uni beat someone up to the point of breaking her nose. She’s aggressive and so manipulative. It hurts me no one else can see this. 

Honestly I want to transfer universities but I don’t have the grades for anywhere else to accept me so I’m really sad. I honestly just want to die. She’s made my life miserable and I feel like I literally have no one anymore.. I decided to delete social media because I can’t stand all the hate. 

• My mum got diagnosed with cancer in March and is in the process of treatment at the moment.

• Also, my new flatmates hate me because I stupidly put a post on my insta saying “I wonder what happened 🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️” of the kitchen table covered in alcohol and Nos. I got sworn at a lot and basically made up to be pathetic. I personally am used to being around much harder drugs so Nos is just air? Also I didn’t say which flat I was in or tag anyone so I don’t think I did anything that bad but idk. I take full responsibility for that. 

I just don’t know if I’m super unlucky or the problem is just me.. but no one really wants to be my friend anymore and I feel really hopeless. I just want the pain to end.",09Apr2019,0
582,"My best friend who just recently became my girlfriend is currently away out of country with her family and she just had her baby. (Who I love and feel extremely happy and very excited about) I have never been any kind of Dad/Step-dad before so I am pretty excited and nervous at the same time. She just delivered the baby this weekend and got back to her sister's place. She is currently trying to adjust and get used to having to wake up every 4 hours to feed him.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a little concerned about there being a chance of her experiencing PPD because of how the pregnancy affected her in the first place though.

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout the Pregnancy she did close herself off somewhat because of how she was feeling. The downside is that she doesn't actually say much right now because of it. And to add to it, when she is tired she also doesn't like to talk much, so we haven't had much in the way of audio calls. But we do talk often with texts over messenger, and even sometimes with pictures. 

&amp;#x200B;

I make sure to tell her every so often that I am praying for them both, and that I love them both because I honestly do. 

My question for advice is this. While I know constant but not over-bearing contact is important, what else can I do for her and the baby while they are both still away? Are there certain topics I need to bring up with her, or things I need to tell her? Or is there anything outside of talking to her that I can do besides just working my job for income for us both and praying?",09Apr2019,1

584,"Some key factors before I get to the ‘advice’ part of this post 

1. I make $19/hour working at Tesla and get paid weekly as I’m working as a contractor through Volt. About $200 from each paycheck are taken out for taxes. 
2. My rent cost is about $1,200/month. I also have to use Uber/DoorDash for transportation and food since I had to sell my car.
3. My ex-girlfriend is a full-time college student and has no time to work.

Now for the ‘advice’ part. 
My ex-girlfriend and I have remained close friends since we broke up and I frequently support her financially for things like food and transportation. We both struggle financially and we know it, but I still support her anyway because I get paid weekly. Because of this, she feels like she’s an added expense when it comes to how much support she gets from others. I’ve never thought of her as an added expense and I wish she wouldn’t think of herself that way. I’ve told her numerous times that I support her because I want to. Whenever she express any concern that I won’t be able to cover my rent or transportation to get around, I tell her not to worry and that I can handle it, which most of the time, I do. I know I don’t force my support on her. What else can I do or say to help make her feel like she’s not a burden?",09Apr2019,2

587,"Title sums it up.

I used to be a very quiet and to-myself kind of kid. But in recent years, I began developing myself and improving my life. But nothing has changed when it comes to how people treat me.

People still ignore me, still gang up on me, and still meet me with completely unnecessary hostility. I know what I'm like when I'm an asshole and I'm not being one. I'm a generally pleasant person, but i know I have many demons/skeletons.

Usually when I'm first meeting people, they're friendlier. But then a week or 2 down the line, they no longer want to be friendly or my friend. I don't do anything to invoke this treatment. It's not like I just suddenly start mocking them or something. People just like to run away.

A perfect example was this girl who I went to high school with. We ran into each other little over a month ago. We hit it off splendidly. I took her out for sushi and we couldn't stop smiling and looking at each other. She would invite me over to her house and we would talk, watch Hulu, and get physical. Then one day, after I departed from her house (not before hugging and kissing), she just stopped talking to me. She gave one sentence; ""I'm busy."" But she continued to update her social media accounts she added me on.

I have other examples but I think this one sums them up best. I genuinely don't understand. I've improved significantly over the past 3 years, yet i am still abandoned as if I'm taking my first breath all over again. Is this my burden to bear, being horrifically alone? I know I have merit. I know I have qualities that people like. But I'm basically a ghost to people; I'm forgotten and left behind. 

I don't understand it. This kind of treatment has pushed to many attempts of suicide. My most recent attempt was 2 months ago. I stood over a bridge with a shotgun but I couldn't bring myself to fire. Something in me won't allow myself to end it. But I don't see the point in life if I can't even have a single friend.",09Apr2019,1

My ex-girlfriend asked if i was still going, I told her that I am still my friends plus one and that “I’m guessing you don’t want me to come”, she said “It’s okay, you can come.” I am suspecting she wouldn’t want to tell me the truth to my face.

589,"I know I have my own issues to work out—believe me, I do. Plenty of issues. The thing is, as much as things suck right now, I know at the end of the day I'm going to be fine. I can handle it. I can control that part. What I can't control is how my friends and family cope. 

A bit about me—I'm a very secretive person. I'm not quiet though. In fact, I'm very outgoing and love to joke around. People would describe me as insanely easy going and go with the flow. I don't like to vent or be emotionally vulnerable. I've just never had to deal with something as serious as this, so it's all new to me. 

That being said, I tend to bottle things up which leaves my husband worried. And it's not just him—I have a lot of people who're worried about me. I can tell they have no idea what I need right now and are struggling to cope. It's pretty obvious my brothers are having a hard time processing all this but are afraid to bug me about it. And it doesn't help that we live far apart (though thankfully I'm moving home soon). Then there's my best friend; I can tell she's struggling because the assault happened at her house and she blames herself no matter how many times I tell her I don't blame her. I just feel like they're all walking on egg shells and trying to do what's best for me, but ignoring what they need and it's driving them crazy.  

Anyway, I guess what I'm looking for is any advice on how can I help those around me. Yes, I know I have to take care of myself, and I am trying. But for those who have been in my friend's and family's shoes, what things would've made it easier for you? Be honest. Anything at all that'd ease the pain. Because even though this is something that happened to me, it affects more people than just me. If anything, it'd help me heal to know I'm helping them.

590,"I know some people will read this and call me selfish and childish or even a brat. Ive come to the conclusion though that I need to do what feels best for me, and being around my family any longer does not feel that way. The problem is that in reality my family is filled with pretty good people, most of what I feel is my own fault. 

My mom is a very caring person, and since she was not able to achieve her goals in life she really projects the need for a successful life onto me. This means trying to have a great high paying job so I can buy a house and do all the things she couldn't do.  For the longest time I was fine with trying to achieve so much and pushed myself to the breaking point. I now realize that this is not how I want to live at all. I am miserable every day because life feels like never ending moments of stress worrying about money and comparing myself to how everyone else is at this stage in life. 

My dad is an extremely nice person, but he has his flaws like everyone else in the world. His main issue arrives with food, I can tell that he suppresses his emotions through food, and he projects that onto me after. I can no longer deal with being yelled at about trying to figure out what I want for dinner, or being scolded for not wanting to eat every hour. 

I think my problem is that I want an extremely different life than what they want for me, and we have come to an impass. I want to do simple work, being a park ranger and helping people while they visit National parks, that way I can spend most of my time outdoors. They want me to pursue an engineering degree. I want to spend some time traveling even if it is just within the US, they believe travel is a waste of time. 

I can no longer sit here and feel miserable for myself, so I have decided that once I have my money saved and my camper car completed, I am leaving. I just don't know if I should tell them my plans now for fear of them taking drastic measures to keep me here. Does anyone have any advice for me?

597,"I've made a throwaway account because my real account has some past posts that include my job title, and I don't want anyone who may look at this to put two and two together.

For some background, I recently left a job that I had loved for about 3 years, and left after I spent my final year there completely miserable. It was at a start up that had been doing well, and is now floundering due to lack of direction. I poured my heart into the company and the work that I did for them. I really had a personal stake in how things turned out, so I was disappointed when they started to treat me (and other OG employees) poorly. I definitely stayed *too long* \- I probably should have left about 6 months earlier to avoid feeling burnt out and resentful. But I didn't, because finding a new job is hard and scary.

I did find a new job, and I should love it. There's a lot of exciting stuff, a lot of ownership involved, and it's in a field I'm passionate about. But even since the second week of working at this job, I have felt just bleh. I don't have energy or motivation, I feel like large projects are daunting when they should be exciting. I don't feel like finding solutions, just having answers given to me. It's not like me **at all**.

I'm really scared that I have ""trust issues"" now with work, that I was abused so badly at my last job that I'll never feel love for what I do again. Has any experienced this? Is this what life is like, you just drudge through work and then you die?

I decided to let this guy from work go with me since we get along well enough and he needed some help financially. I figured free groceries may help him. As were were driving we started talking about when it would be ok to keep secrets from a spouse (we are both married) and he said that he suppresses his secrets so that he cant even remember them.  The car fell silent and then he said, ""oh shit, yeah, I remember doing that.""  I asked what he was referring to and he told me that he murdered a guy in a hit and run. He says the guy was just in the wrong place and the wrong time.  I didnt know whether or not to take him serious because he jokes around a lot.  Then he said, ""No, but for real, I was the 'transport' one time.""   I didnt know what he meant by that and I didnt want to pursue the conversation any further, but he never outright said he was just kidding.  He left it at that and that was it.

It worries me because I know he has a criminal history of drugs and other shady things hes told me about I just dont know how serious he was. I'm afraid to mention it to him and ask if he was serious.  I'm also not sure what my responsibility is in this scenario.

I've had a myriad of family/friend troubles, which have decreased my trust in others to the point where I literally trust no one. I'll list them here for reference:

* My grandmother on my dad's side favors my uncle and  constantly spews hatred at my mother
* My aunt on my dad's side has tried to kidnap me at a young age and harassed my wife at her job(I think she also wanted to kidnap my son).
* My uncle on my dad's side wanted him to sign away his rights on the will that his father signed.
* My grandmother on my mom's side has pitted my family against my her brother's family and values them more(even though we've done so much more for her).
* My grandmother in my mom's side sped up my grandfather's death by giving him conflicting medications on purpose because she was tired of dealing with him.
* My parents have still yet to really embrace and accept who I am so I constantly have to put on a mask and pretend to be someone else in front of them.
* My parents caused a lot of trauma as I came of age and was struggling with depression, as I still am.
* My best friend from college recently lied to me, and I don't know why, so I cut him out of my life.
* After cutting my best friend from college off, I realized that I really have no real friends that reciprocate enjoyment of my company.

I'm currently working as a developer after having received my Computer Science degree. I love the type of work that I do, but I still don't feel fulfilled in my career in many ways. That's why I've wanted to pursue things like hobbies as enjoyment, but I still find very little happiness. I love the time I get to spend with my son, but he's still small so we can't really play ball or do anything that I find as enjoyable. I wrestle with him and play with toys, but I quickly lose interest in these activities.

609,"I'm 21, currently studying medicine. I know that one of my biggest fear is incompetence, be it mine or other people's. It made work hard in order to maintain the quality of my little work. But I didn't want to study medicine in the first place. 


I happened to be a gifted and hard working pupil, as some said. I was fascinated as long as I could remember by sciences and how they could describe and predict real world phenomena. I prefer things to be exact; I didn't like biology or subjects where you were told that things are a certain way without at least an attempt to a proof. 


I live in a rather small country and participated in maths and chemistry Olympiad during my middle and high school years. I had some good results (always in the top 10 of my grade). Rarely did i feel like I belonged there, though. I was scared that someone would notice that I don't deserve it, that I don't know that much, that my knowledge is low quality. I was kind of dragged along by my parents who thought being a doctor would make a great job. I somehow silently expected (wrong, I know.) for them to change my mind and realize it doesn't fit me.


I have started my first clinical rotations. I hate them with a passion. It's draining and it doesn't help that I'm not really great at interacting with people. I don't like this field, yet I'm scared. I'm scared of leaving. At the same time, I know that I started forgetting whatever I knew about maths or chemistry. Afraid of going forward, afraid of going backwards. I feel lost and confused.


I ask myself if I'm really capable of getting into chemistry-related higher education. (it sounds a bit pretentious to my ear, but English isn't my mother tongue, I'm sorry) If I'm really capable of doing it WELL and entering research. It's scary to fight through it, I'd like to have a mentor along this long journey, but I don't know who I should turn to. I'm terribly scared and I wonder if I have my head up my ass. I wonder whether I should readjust my views and throw my dream away and come to terms with the fact that I'll be a doctor.


Probably important to mention: chemistry isn't exactly a 'blooming field' around here. While medicine seems to be that impressive thing regardless of where you live. Please, don't mention a degree related to biochemistry and pharmacology as an alternative, since they happened to be some of the subjects I hated the most during these years, along with anatomy.

611,"Lots of backstory so you can get the full picture. 

So I had this friend we will call Jay and his girlfriend who we will call Shelby who also used to be my friend. 
 
Now a little background I was very good friends with both Jay and Shelby and I actually got them together (which I now regret) and Jay used to have a crush on me and it was well known by everyone in our friend group including Shelby and this sparked a jealously for her. We used to hang out everyday and I was such good friends with her that she basically lived at my house for 2 weeks. Then something changed, she changed. 

She became for a lack of a better word, unstable. She started driving us by places in town to tell us that she was beaten and abused here and there and she used to do hard drugs there and was thrown out of a car here, She would say we all hated her and if we hung out without her she said she was going to kill herself. She was pregnant by another man at the time of her and Jay's relationship began and we were supportive of her, but she could had not cared less that she was pregnant. She drank, smoked a pack of cigarettes a day, smoked large amounts of weed a day, took Xanax, dyed her hair, ate raw seafood, and got a tattoo. This girl with so far to just get even more attention than we already gave her. All this information is important to tell you just what kind of person she is. 

About a month ago she invites me to her home she shares with Jay ( they where only dating a few weeks before moving in together they have been together for maybe 4 or 5 months at the time I'm posting this) to tell me that her and Jay fight constantly and that it is because of me. She is so jealous of a crush he USED to have on me that they fight to the point that she has punched numerous holes in the walls. I am completely shocked by this information and tell her that I love my boyfriend and would never cheat on him and that Jay loves her and wouldn't cheat on her. I thought the issue was resolved. 

It was not.

They then proceed to ignore us do not look or talk to me in public when I see them. I am then informed by their roommate that she made Jay break the gift I got him for Christmas to prove that he is not in love with me and has told him he is not allowed to even be around me. 

Come to find out she cheated on him. With someone we all consider to be a friend. We as a friend group try and tell Jay that she had cheated on him and he doesn't believe us. Shelby then finds out that we told him and proceeds to explode on all of us even come to my home to tell at me about how I don't have proof and I'm a liar and that o am lying because I want to date jay. 

She has blocked all of us on social media and made jay block us as well. They are still together because she has managed to manipulate him into believing that she is the only one he can trust and has pushed away all of his friends so it is just her and him alone all the time and I just dont know what to do. 

I want to get this person out of this toxic abusive relationship but how can I if he doesn't believe us?

(TL;DR included at the end)

Hi,

I'm 25, British and lacking in several areas, for which I am seeking advice. I have a bittersweet life where I have a good family and live in a good area but I have barely any friends, no partner and several autoimmune issues which inflict on my life daily.

I have had jobs primarily in teaching and have worked mostly in EFL, though I have certainly been through the mill in in other jobs too. Recently I sat down to really think about my situation. I have no professional dedication or interest in any particular area, I'm currently in landscaping but work is work to me and I've not got any personal investment in it. As such this led me to the liberating conclusion that I might as well get into a field which is well paid, irrespective of the training and study which maybe required for it. I figure that I should work now for a possible decent future, possible early retirement, good savings etc, otherwise I will probably end up doing something I regret or radically changing my life for the worse.

So primarily I'm asking for advice on a professional field to get into. My hobbies are the typical kind whereby making a living from them is just a pipe dream and I'm past it, so I don't see the point in pursuing those. Despite my earlier description I am still physically fit and have a Bachelor's degree, so I'm not just a dolt. I'm willing to put the effort in but I want to put it into something which is likely to have a good return on my investment. Most careers open to me right now are dreary, suck-ass dead-end jobs where I won't feel needed or accomplished in any way.

If you yourself cannot give direct advice then I'm certainly open to other subreddits/websites etc.

Thanks for taking the time to read this. All the best.

TL;DR: I'm trying to focus my professional energy somewhere in which I'll be rewarded well for, can you help?",09Apr2019,1

She broke up with her boyfriend two months ago. They were on and off for over two years and it took her a whole year to understand that it was a toxic relationship. When they finally broke up she was really happy and she apologized for never listening to the advice we would give her.

The problem is that few days ago she called me cause she had “crazy news to share”.  She told me that she’s been smoking for one month now and that she met this new guy at her gym. I was happy for her till she told me that he’s 35. 

They had sex in his car even if they barely knew each other. And worst thing they didn’t use a condom or any type of protection. She was late for over 16 days and she was obviously panicking. (She’s not pregnant)

I was shook and I got really mad. I told her that she risked so much from STD to pregnancy and that the whole thing is illegal since she’s a minor!

I was depressed for the better part of the past decade, feeling insecure and inadequate in front of new people and even my own friends. I felt like a loser and a failure and so talking to people felt embarrassing. This basically ruled out me trying to date.

I also suck at maintaining friendships. I feel guilty about it, but I never thought to change my behavior of never calling up friends to chat, never investing anything in my relationships such as giving them a birthday present or even just texting happy birthday. I'm just never the person who makes the first move, basically a passive participant my whole life.

I have had good people in my life who I've lost contact with now, because I never cared. The only one friend I have remaining is a really good person and hasn't given up on me, but even he is probably getting tired of sending me event invites that I never answer or turn down.

To be honest, finding that ""someone"" has always been at the bottom of my pile of urgent to-do list. I figured that no woman would want to be with a guy who had no confidence, no social skills, lived with his mother and didn't have a proper career.

Recently I've made some changes with the help of professional counselling. I'm at a turning point in my life where I've started to make positive changes to my life slowly but steadily. I've realized that perhaps I should actually be seeking out a partner if only to help me grow and mature as a person. I know that sounds like a selfish reason to be with someone, but I also want to try and turn myself into a loving, caring kind of person.

But I'm a basically a freak. I've never touched or held hands with a girl other than my mother. I still don't see myself leaving any time soon since I'm both a financial and emotional support for my mother who I love very much. I still don't see myself going into some kind of proper career - in fact I want to just put everything I've got into becoming a composer despite the fact that I never had a musical upbringing as a kid. That probably means another 10 years of investing learning and practice before I can actually be proud and confident of myself. 

It just seems like such a hassle and I ask myself do I really want to or need to? Yet on the other hand ever since I stopped being able to feel entertained or distracted by video games, I've found myself getting up at night and crying over how lonely it feels.

631,"Hello

I am a guy , 26th year of age , gamer, irl socially (and overall) lazy and a loner. 

Majority of my life ive been living with my parents (upto 24 years) , now finally living on my own in downtown, 25min walk away from work (electronics retail of all places, moving towards sales expert). Finished basic school and highschool just fine, got into college with good grades from highschool - goverment paid spot in Techotronics.

As i was living with my parents, their say was absolute - as long as i attended school , i was fine living with them, under their roof (along with 2 brothers and a sister, me being eldest). The subject of technotronics when i enrolled seemed interesting then - computers , programming (as a lively gamer seemed perfect for me). As years rolled by though , it became more and more obvious to me that it might not actually be a subject for me, but as i was too lazy to look for a part time job of any sort and living on parents expense, i just rolled with it - attending and passing courses to eventually finish college - as my parents who've told me that a degree opens up alot of job and money opportunities.

 Im at a place where a 4 year college road has turned into 6th and still running and i really dont feel like this degree is going to change anything substantially or boost my cv in any way for my future jobhunts. Why it has been dragging out so long is bc of the 4th year where i had the option of doing thesis alongside with my 4th year subjects - those subjects, as the semester rolled along, got pretty out of hand with the homework, presentations and reports , just had no time for it realistically , unless i really tore myself apart doing allnighters after long collegedays after all those presentations and reports. 

5th year dragged out because thats the time i started my full time job along with moving out of my parents place to a downtown area. Ofcourse i was saving up money and paying parents back what i could, mostly like a laptop lease my mother took for my college years and such. As i got enough saved up i got lucky with my uncle having a newborn coming into his family and him with his wife(pregnant at the time) and son moving into a bigger apartment, so i got to rent their old place. Having only the essentials for an apartment, started building my own gamernest with wide enough table , dreamy new desktop pc setup with what eventually turned into dual monitor finisher - contempt with what i have.

Fresh out of parental support, their rules and ways, i am finally living my own life. I can cook fine on my own - though i need to seriously work on my weight which has been the problem for majority of my life , but that isnt the topic or subject for this time. Happy with my work in retail and only trying to get bettet at it, giving the best experience for customers, even if i dont get yhe same experience back.

Long long story a bit shorter: here i am, in gamers point of view, best setup i could have ever hoped and dreamed for (and it has been a VERY long dream, finally fulfilled - dont give up young pc-masterracers) still this college thesis looming over me, which i have had 0 desire and will to do, even though it is the final hurdle to finally get done with it.

 The dilemma of this post stems from - having spent so much time to get to this point for a degree/subject i dont really love (found out it too late on my college road realized around 3rd year, solidifying in 4th year but now dragging along 6th year), so it would feel all the time and effort my parents  and I put into,  have gone to waste and the dissapointment I would be for them AND actually focusing on my current job (which i like and enjoy), on my current self (weight, social life in general and eventually a girlfriend, finding a job even more enjoyable/applicable in life that pays more for future family) 


If there are spelling/english mistakes, english is not my native language, just years of gaming shaping and forming my english as it is right now and i tried to make paragrahps as coherent and easier to read , but its very impulsive move of me, totally not like me, and written entierly on a phone.

Any and all feedback and thoughts are welcome, i usually check reddit often. Ive left alot of personal stuff out, esp regarding my parents on this entire road, but they've been supporting and loving the entire time and i thank and love them from the bottom of my heart, even though ive never said those words to them in person.

Although I've never personally thought this of myself, many people have complimented that I'm a very good people person and I feel very comfortable picking up on any conversation. I'm also a reasonably handsome guy and I have women approach me and talk to me when I'm out at the bar, club, restaurant, party, etc. I speak confidently and honestly, and lots of women also compliment me on my looks and my fashion, so you would think I'm a total lady-mancer but sadly that's not the case. 

When I do talk to women we both have a genuinely good time and I can tell the obvious cues that they're interested in me (sitting close to me, laughing at my dumb jokes, touching my arm/thigh, rubbing up against me, lots of smiling, etc). My only problem is that I have no idea how to approach women and women always have to approach me. As a guy it's a bit embarrassing to admit that I have trouble with this. I assume that they won't be interested or I'll be boring or say the wrong thing when I approach them. It's much easier when they approach you because it's obvious they're interested in having a conversation. Also, I almost never flirt (at least I don't THINK I flirt with women but I do compliment them, but it's out of being genuine to who I am and not a woman-specific thing) or try to suggest any romantic interest in women that I talk to, although they clearly are trying to flirt. I'm totally casual with women but I kinda don't want to be, if that makes any sense at all...

635,"I’ve been in a relationship with this girl for roughly 10 months and her mental health has finally caught up to her and it’s put us both through it these past few days. She’s finally taking the initiative to focus on herself (which I’m very proud of) and that also unfortunately involves us not being together for the time being. We agreed to wait for each other and get back when she is better but what do I do in the mean time?

She’s really my best friend so I sorta feel lost but I know I’m going to hang out more with my roommate and my family and also find a new job as I’m currently unemployed, so those are the easy steps. I’m also intending on writing and learning more music because that’s my biggest hobby.

Deep down I sorta feel lost so what are some proactive things I can do to help myself aside from what I’m already doing. Maybe suggest some new hobbies or activities. Thank you in advance!",09Apr2019,1

637,"Yes I mean the ass hole itself. My fiancée, who is transgender, desperately wants me to give her oral in a different than usual spot. Yes she’s pre-op so this is essentially her vagina I’d be licking and giving pleasure to. 

Thing is, it took me a long time to get over going down on her in the first place (I refused to go down on my ex-husband for various reasons, taste being the big one). Now I very much enjoy giving my fiancée pleasure. Just can’t get over the mental block of what exactly I’m going to do. I accidentally insulted her by taking two shots of whiskey last time before I started.

It’s not that there’s even any taste. Like, there’s actually none. It’s just like licking her cheek, or breast. But there is a distinct smell. And it’s not “ass” smell before you assume that. No. It’s like any cis gender female really would smell. But the thing is, I’ve never enjoyed going down on women or men before (I’m Bi and trans myself) and I don’t actually care for the scent of a woman down there.

639,"Basically... i feel myself disassociating from reality. Not hallucinations or anything, but more like.... I don’t feel anything anymore, I want to engage in risky lifestyle or behavior (I haven’t but I want to) just to feel something. 

I don’t feel like myself, like I’m running out of time while at the same time having all the time I need as I don’t really do anything during the day.

Back story: under intense stress every freaking day. Not financially independent to live on my own, so I live with my mom. I’m not close to my father at all, I just call him by his first name. My mom gets high on pills and sleeps for days at a time - when she wakes up during these times she acts not normal; stumbling, no pants, leaves stove on with food cooking, if she attempts to drive she may crash the car (has happened and I no longer allow myself/ sibling to be in the car if she’s driving if I’m there), and overall reckless behavior. My father yells at my mom, insults my mom/ insults my mom to his kids when she’s high - and then yells at me for not ‘doing anything about it’ - essentially this has been my reality for most of my growing up. 

As a result: No one can cook ordrive my sister(she’s old enough to cook for herself but not old enough to drive), so I take over being ‘mom’ / super sister for my sibling. I, obviously, don’t HAVE to do this, but I do because I care and love my only normal family member. 

I also have sick pets who require a lot of attention, and medical bills which I take care of and manage. I don’t mind doing all of this alone, I can handle it. I can handle taking care of my sister and my pets, and the house. I can do it. The problem here is, I have to do it knowing my mom is high and the minute she comes downstairs and my father is home he’s gonna be yelling and insulting her and try talking to me while insulting my mom, and having to deal with that every freaking time she decides to go on her pills for days. Just knowing that I have a mom at home but I can’t even rely on her on simple things such as feeding my dog, and instead have to worry about her burning down the house, crashing the car, killing my pets (not on purpose). Instead of being relieved I have a mom, I have to worry. 

On top of all of that, I’m trying to become more financially independent to move the hell out. But every time I leave for work (not often I only work 1-2 days a week and not even every week), it’s just regret and guilt because I’m leaving my vulnerable pets behind, my sister alone to deal with the mess my parents create. I still go cause it’s literally a couple days a week at most (though I’m trying to find another job), but the point is: I’m constantly under stress and regret and guilt. 

I just feel myself changing and I no longer feel any emotion. The only time I’m happy is when I get to go to work (which is almost a blessing since I’m ‘forced’ to leave my home and not by choice like as if I’m hanging out with a friend, but to earn money and I can ‘breathe’ and PRETEND to be normal, PRETEND to be happy/ social, and just for a few hours - pretend I’m someone else). I’m great at faking everything, I’m super happy and sociable in public, so I’m sure it’s believable. 

Should I see a therapist? Can a therapist help me? I just desperately want to feel something, to have ambitions again. I almost feel like that isn’t possible for me anymore. Can a therapist help me?",09Apr2019,1
640,"I won't go into too much detail, (if you're very curious, you can check my history) but essentially I was raised very poorly, and as a result, I'm horrible at social situations.

In the past, I've always been very quiet around my husband's friends, and even around mine, actually. I'm trying my best to change that. I really want to start talking to people, but I don't know how.

Usually when we go out, we will arrive at the restaurant a little before everyone else. My husband will warmly great his friends, usually by either a hug, or a half hug, half handshake. I sit at the table, avoid eye contact like the plague, and sit in an awkward silence until everyone has been seated.

I'm always unsure as to how to greet people. Do I stand beside my husband? Do I smile and offer a handshake? Do I offer a hug? (I really don't want to hug them if possible.) Do I just smile and offer a ""hello""? Do I tell them how nice it is to see them?

Then comes conversation while we wait for the server. This is easily the most uncomfortable part of the evening. 

I don't really talk to people outside of a few of my friends, and my husband. I get really anxious that I'm going to say something dumb, so I just avoid it all by remaining quiet unless I'm directly addressed.

The times in which I am addressed goes as follows:

Person: Hey, CanNotAdult, how have you been?

Me: I've been well. Thank you for asking. How have you and [wife] been?

Person: Oh, we've been great! The kids are getting big! [Wife] is in line for a promotion at work, and things are getting crazy at work. You know how it goes.

Me: *Smiles* I'm glad to hear you're doing well.

And then I usually go really quiet, and they move on to talk to someone else. I wish I could be as comfortable as so many of my husband's friends are in conversation. I never know what to say though. Do I ask more questions about his wife's upcoming promotion? Do I add something about my or my husband's career? Do I ask about their kids? Do I ask about other parts of their life?

After that, we order food, and by this time, luckily enough, most people have stopped trying to engage me. I eat quietly, and listen to conversation. At the end of the night, the tab is paid, and then commences the goodbyes. Usually someone makes a joke about how they couldn't get a word in edgewise with all my talking. (Haha, get it? Because I'm so quiet? Haha, aren't they funny?) I usually force a smile, and wait patiently for them to leave.

It isn't until we are on our way back home, that I can relax. I don't think my husband knows how very scary social interactions are for me. I know he knows I'm shy, but I don't think he knows how incredibly clueless I am when it comes to social situations.

642,"Hello All! This is my first post on this account, and my second of all time. Anyhow I have dreamt of starting a business my entire life. I currently am a retail manager at a huge national company. During this time I have spent learning and gathering real life experience of the retail industry from the perspective of three companies (one closed down, TigerDirect, the other is on its way down now Sears) I won't disclose where I work currently unless its pressing. 

I have decided that this is the year I will dive into business after 7 years of working retail, and 10 years of researching Shark Tank. The idea of the company to me is something simple, something that represents a lifestyle. I don't want to make a ton of money, I just want to be part of the community, and make a change I can be proud of my whole life.

It is going to be a collectible store (Funko, action figures, statues, art, etc) with a game lounge so we can host gaming competitions and rent out for parties or gaming events, and lastly a used/new movie store, occasionally doing binge marathons. What a perfect place, the friendly neighborhood store that represents pop culture, and everything fun and good in life. (Maybe one day if my state makes legal cannabis in public places legal we'll do that)

643,"I'm going to try to give a little background about myself and hopefully, that'll help people offer up whatever wisdom they've got for me. Anyway, I'm 32 years old, and have been through a great deal in the last ten years. I've battled an addiction to food for most of my life. I'm currently 287 pounds but used to weigh 380. At 26 years old I had a total thyroidectomy due to Hashimoto's and multi-nodular goiter. In 2017 I had my gallbladder removed and had pancreatitis. And finally, in 2018, it was discovered that I had a brain tumor and a condition called hydrocephalus. I almost forgot to mention I also got diagnosed with a rare syndrome called Cowden's Syndrome and that puts me at risk for six different cancers.  All the issues have been taken care of but I have this lingering obsession with death. I'm not suicidal and in fact, I'm petrified of dying. I want to do whatever it takes to stay alive. But my thoughts are not why me but rather why not me. Being that's the case how do I come to terms with the things that have happened? Time has definitely made coping easier, I've seen a psychiatrist and a psychologist. I'm medicated to help with depression, I have a loving and supportive husband. My family is great and I couldn't be luckier. Even after ten plus years in the hospitality industry I changed my job and did a total  180 by now working in education. Why the change in jobs?! The job change was a result of me being stressed out and needing employment that could offer a better future for my husband and I. Nevertheless, I still feel restless and emotional. I'm thinking in the back of my mind that any day now could be my last. I'm trying to get back on track with my weight loss, but use food as a way to cope with my feelings. Previous to my addiction to food I was pretty much an alcoholic. How do I come to terms with everything?

This backfired. The students found the post, realized it was me, and told their sponsor. Their sponsor texted our sponsor, notifying him of my actions and implying that he (the sponsor) thought the post was about him. 

I realize that I was wrong and impulsive for complaining on reddit. I’ve even deleted the post and apologized to my sponsor (a good friend of mine). But I still feel guilty for doing something that I definitely shouldn’t have done.

646,"Made a bet with a friend that had an unspecified forfeit. As in, the winner got to choose something to do to the loser. Of course, I lost. Now I'm stuck in a pretty odd situation. I'm admittedly really vain, quite proud of my hair and really don't like it getting messed up or dirty, so the forfeit she's making me go through is sitting there while she completely trashes my hair. She told me to prepare for my hair getting covered in things like food, elmers glue, toothpaste etc. next time I'm round her place.

Obviously this is a cause of concern to me, but I don't really have any ground to stand on here. She offered to call it off if I paid her $50 but I don't have that money to throw away. And I know I'd probably do something equally embarrassing to her if I had the chance. Any pleas about her being a bad friend are going to fall on deaf ears. The way I see it, my options are to either flat out refuse to let her touch my hair, let her do it and endure the absolutely disgusting experience or try to get together the money.

Intellectually, it's best to just let her do it, since it's nothing that won't wash out and she's going to enjoy it. On the other hand, eww, it's gonna be gross. What do you think my best option is here lol",09Apr2019,1

So for now I've just been trying to ignore my feelings and make sure she doesn't find out I like her, as that would be very awkward. We're both working on a school play which requires that I see her outside of normal school hours fairly frequently, and as such I'm hesitant to tell her how I feel bc I don't want to make that an awkward scenario.

We do each have our own issues we deal with - I have depression and anxiety, and I'm VERY introverted. He has depression, anxiety, bipolar and is an alcoholic on top of it. His alcoholism has been pretty controlled up until about the last year, and it's just slowly gotten worse and worse to where it's affecting his health and our relationship..

653,"Hi everybody, thank you in advance for any answers. I have been putting off job hunting because of fear of change, but now I am finally ready.

To preface, I do self medicate with Cannabis (including THC and CBD products) so I know going into the search that my options for jobs without drug testing is narrowed even being in a Legalized state. I respect everyone's opinion but this will not be changing anytime soon.

Background:

For the past year, I have worked the same schedule at two separate jobs. Job 1 is at a studio earning a little above minimum wage, and job 2 is at a strip club making more than double what I make at job 1. I am not an entertainer, I am only a waitress, so no, not really making big money, but depending on tips I can make an average of $17-33 an hour. For having only an Associate degree this is big money for me, but I am finding myself wanting to quit more and more recently. Both jobs have served me in many ways, teaching me about myself and others, giving me the self-confidence I never had, and when to throw in the towel, knowing you deserve better.

Now for my needed advice:

While looking for jobs I have found several that sound amazing and I want to apply, but then I think about how my resume is going to look and get discouraged all over again and end up not applying for any. Do I include my time at the club? I would have amazing references from my bosses there so I would love to use it. It shows consistency being with a job longer than the 90 trial period, but then again most people see strip club and think ""oooh..."". It gets people's attention, but not always in a good way. The club has been a large part of my life since starting there and it doesn't feel right to not recognize my time spent working with them. I guess my question is, do I embrace the fact that I've worked at a strip club the past year and use my experiences to give me an edge, or do I try and hide the fact I've been working there and ask my boss to lie if they get called as a reference?

I know it sounds really really stupid since I'm an adult (21) but I have an anxiety disorder. A lot of my anxiety has to do with medical professionals. Specifically that I've been verbally abused by doctors in the past and in recent years now that I've had to make my own appointments its gotten a lot worse since often times the nurses have opinions over the phone about the medications I take or simply telling me that they think the issue I am having is just because I'm anxious/female and not because of some other physical issue that I need to see a doctor for. 

Basically, I have a really hard time calling because I am afraid to the point of tears of having another conversation like this. I've tried doing online appointment making but, they always just email me and say I have to call no matter how overly specific I have been in email. My mom is not helpful and basically tells me its something I just have to do. The fact is though if it is I will never get help from medical professionals for my needs because I'm terrified.

I hate that it is the case, but i cant seem to do anything about it. Nobody in my family is racist, in fact everybody is fairly accepting of everyone.

This is something i didnt fully realize until i started going to college where there is a high percentage of asians.

658,"So this might be long and complicated but basically I'm a freelance designer and one of my good friends referred a friend of hers to me as a client. He's located in Japan and he's basically a big-shot who owns a bunch of businesses and he was opening a new restaurant chain and wanted to find a designer to help create the brand. We agreed through emails to meet up for a week in New York, and the company was supposed to fly out there and meet me. I fronted the money for the last minute air flight (even abandoned my family on Thanksgiving) and arrived in the city. As for why I didn't write out a contract or anything is because my friend knew this guy personally really well (so I trusted that he wouldn't scam me and I've also met him in person prior), she assured that he would pay me back for everything, and I was led to believe that in Japanese work culture asking for a contract and such would come off as distrusting and rude. Basically, I just attributed the lack of legally binding documents to difference in culture and because of the 'friend' aspect. My friend was also employed to be part of this project and was basically the point of contact/translator between me and the boss, so I really went in trusting.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I show up in New York and no one is there to meet me for the entire four days that was planned. Apparently the boss got super drunk and hungover, missed his flight, and just cancelled the trip. They apologized to me, and said they would pay me back for the entire four days even though no work was to be done. I ended up having to front the hotel cost and I was pissed off the entire time, but I thought, hey at least I'll get paid for doing nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

Four weeks go by and no one has paid me. My friend tells me that in Japan, usually people are paid monthly. So I wait a bit longer. Two months go by, and he still hasn't paid. My friend (basically only point of contact) tells me she brought it up to him and he said he will pay. At the three month mark I'm so desperate, I basically say ok you don't even need to pay me for the work hours, just pay me back for the airflight, the ubers, the hotel etc. My friend says ok she'll tell him. Four months go by and every time I bring it up she replies very coldly. I can tell she's getting annoyed that I'm asking and part of me thinks she's just hoping I'll forget. It's making me super pissed off, and part of me feels like if she's not going to push harder for him to pay me back, then she should pay me back herself? ( I know this sounds selfish, but she's the one who said he's a trustable client and referred him to me ). She's also never apologized to me for what happened, but seems more annoyed that I'm asking for the money still. But it seems like to me she's not really caring or trying hard to get my money back. But I also feel like on her side since he's technically her boss, she doesn't want to ruin work relationship with him by persistently asking.

Dumbbutt had used Taco to cheat on Cookie before breaking up with her. 1 day after Dumbbutt's breakup, Taco and him began to date. Taco had also just gotten out of a relationship and was heartbroken because the guy had left Taco to get back together with his ex girlfriend (who he discovered he was not over). Over spring break in March 2019, Taco called Dumbbutt and found out he had been talking to Cookie a lot over the week and Dumbbutt told Taco that he wasn't over Cookie and that he had gotten back together with her. Taco was once again heartbroken and called me everyday for 3-4 hours and would cry and tell me about how nobody had ever hurt her as much as Dumbbutt did. Then when college started again, Taco couldn't even bare to see Dumbbutt because every time she did, she would cry because of how much he had hurt her. Taco told everyone she knew how awful and mean and cruel and untrustworthy Dumbbutt was. Then Dumbbutt decided he wanted Taco to be his friend and Taco wanted so much to be with him again, she agreed. Taco had decided to get back on Tinder and talk to other people. She met one guy and hooked up with him. She enjoyed it and decided to do it some more. She ended up meeting up with a guy (we will call him Satan). Satan ended up being a lot more dangerous and threatening than Taco expected. Satan ended up sexually assaulting Taco. Taco shut down after that. Now Taco has started to do better, but Dumbbutt is back in the picture. Dumbbutt broke up with Cookie again and is now dating Taco. However, he doesn't really help her in dealing with the assault. She has severe nightmares now and sleeps more during the day to cope with the lack of sleep at night. She is seeing someone about it and working on it, but Dumbbutt gets upset about her not giving him attention. Today he called her 17 times within 30 minutes and then began texting me about how he doesn't get enough attention. I explained that he needed to support her and help her go to her appointments, but he said he doesn't really want her going to appointments because he would rather be with her himself. She feels that since he left Cookie for her (again) she should be doing whatever Dumbbutt wants to keep him in her life. However, because she told everyone how awful he is, nobody is supporting their relationship. My birthday is coming up and Taco wanted to Dumbbutt to celebrate with us, but I don't want him to because I don't like what he has done to her and I don't trust him and he isn't my friend. The celebration was just supposed to be my boyfriend, Taco, a friend from home and me so I told Taco that I don't want Dumbbutt there. Do you think Taco should stay with Dumbbutt?",09Apr2019,1
660,"A little background:

My roommate isn't  very considerate when it comes to shared spaces. He will let the kitchen sink fill up with dishes(for days) to the point where I often have to wash utensils before I need them. He also leaves stuff all over the common  area(Backpack, jackets, dirty dishes, shoes, etc.). I've talked to him about this stuff before and he will ebb and flow with keeping after himself.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't left yet because I am waiting for when it suits me and that time is not now. I'm choosing to accept it for now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the issue:

Last night I asked him to put his open hot dog packages in a plastic bag( that I bought, BTW) so it doesn't leak ""juice"" all over the bottom of the meat and cheese drawer.

He responded by saying ""OK"" and followed it up with that he wants me to turn the knob to the bathroom door before I close it because the ""click"" of the mechanism wakes him up at night. Mind you I am woken up often from his bedroom door because it sticks from not fitting the frame properly. I don't care because I live with someone else and that comes with noise in the space I exist in.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what  say you Reddit? 

Am I being unreasonable for thinking he is insane for this request?",09Apr2019,1
661,"So last month, my then girlfriend of almost 5 years, came to me and basically told me she was unhappy with things and she wanted to break up. I'll admit things hadn't been the greatest the past few months but I actually thought things were getting better and I honestly felt blindsided. When she started making her case as to why she wanted to break up I'll also admit she made some valid points and I agreed it was probably for the best.

We were together for almost 5 years like I said, our lives were very intertwined and she was heavily involved in my family. She  wants to stay in touch because she really likes my family even if things aren't working between us she enjoyed being a part of my family, and my family honestly enjoyed her. 

Well it's been a month and I haven't been able to move on at all. We've been talking pretty infrequently and it's been mostly awkward small talk. She came over last night and we traded the things we had of each others, and my younger sister who adores my ex started crying and it turned into a big crying mess between them. Later she texts me and said she really doesn't want to not be around because she enjoyed my family.

Shes said stuff in passing like ""oh you never know what the future will hold. Things might change. Etc"" in reference to us getting back together but I really think shes just sparing my feelings, and I really feel like it's over between us for good, or at least for the foreseeable future.

basically i've been fucked over by a lot of people, one recently, really badly and i'm now down to basically 2 people i can trust but one's always busy so theres not much time for hanging out. So im out to reconnect with some people i used to talk to but the issue is some of the know the group that now hates me, and i don't know which people have heard what 

( The guy that particularly told all of them very sensitive information that i told in confidence and basically talked shit about me to them, i know this because his gf came screaming at me about it, saying some really hurtful things ) 

So now i don't really know which people have a good opinion of me and i'm afraid of trusting and getting attached again only for it to end the same, but if i dont try i can't make friends with them. But at the same time i've learnt people are really good at faking being friends with people and i have a hard time picking up on subtle hits and red flags.

I dont want my fear of trusting to ruin the way i make friend but at the same time i dont really want to waste my time only for it to hurt me in the end.

664,"I come from a long line of people with heart problems and today I got a sharp dulling pain in my upper left chest on my back side, which caused my leg to shake and I started to sweat. Myself being who I am am far from a hypochondriac and even though its happened before I chalk it up to an anxiety attack (which over time I assume is what develops heart problems). I was feeling weak and shakey and asked to go outside for a moment. I was given a terrible response from my manager, who started talking negatively behind my back and making personal attacks about my work at me after coming back in only a couple of minutes later. As a note, this was my fourth day on the job, the things I'm getting blamed for are things I am not being trained on, and have no way of knowing. My manager however, decides to leave for large swaths of time and go smoke pot out in the parking lot, up to and past 10 minutes at a time, and on my second day even left alone in the building with things in the ovens to go smoke (I'm not a cook btw). A few other things came up where she's berating someone behind their back for dropping off their child to a dentistry appointment that the manager knew about and then forgot, and trying to train people secretly to take over someone's position so she can fire him without notice. I've gotten confirmation from other coworkers that this is just how she is and she's like this to everyone, but it doesnt seem right that she can act so irrationally and when something medical comes up act so heartless. I know she doesnt take my health seriously but I do and it's important to me that things run smoothly because other than her this job has been a pleasant one. Is there any one who has experience with dealing with managers like this without losing their job. Being employed is very important to me and I do not want to get fired for sticking up for myself and my coworkers. Thank you for reading.",09Apr2019,0
666,"Sorry for any grammar mistakes english is my 2nd language.

School is getting harder and harder, since 6th grade it has gotten worse. In 7th grade i switched schools thinking my bad grades were because of my classmates and teachers, it was not. 

Since 7th grade everything is getting harder and i can’t keep up with my classes, math the most. Every subject involves having to remember something word for word and i have a terrible memory and things like the multiplication table are very hard to learn. I told my mom about the possibility of me having dyslexia but she just brushes it off.

I’m just lost in life right now, i’m too young to do anything about this without my parents.

I haven’t told him my feelings because he used to pretend flirt with a lot of different girls and I’d hate to tell him how I feel and look dumb when he says he was joking.

It caught me off guard so all I could say was “awh nice”. After that he seemed weird and changed the subject quick.

671,"3 and a half years ago I moved to Florida from my home town in upstate NY. I was 21 at the time. I'm now 25. I didn't pick where I moved, I just had the opportunity to go because my best friend had family down here and we were able to stay with them for a couple months until we got on our feet.

Well, soon after, I met my current boyfriend. After about a year of living in Florida, I wanted to leave. I just don't feel like it's the place for me. Too hot, too humid, doesn't have outdoor activities I enjoy (hiking mostly), and all of this is compounded by the fact that I live in a really small retirement community that's full of 65+ people and rednecks. I haven't made any friends the whole time I've been here. 

I want to move again so badly, I just don't feel like I belong here. I'm really unhappy, and I only stay because I love my boyfriend and he can't move right now. He says he is preparing to, but it's taking him a really long time. He's quite a bit older than me so I'm sure this plays a part.

I'm young, and I feel like I'm wasting my life here. But I can't help to wonder, if I move and the same thing is going to happen again? That I'm going to get tired of the place I choose?

681,"I am 28F, attending community college. I got in some trouble and was kicked out when I was 17. I’ve been on my own and working since then. I managed to get a high school diploma, so I’ve been taking community college classes a few units at a time over the years. My general education and transfer requirements are complete now. So, I just need to focus on my major and am getting impatient. 

In 2017 I was laid off from a good job after five years. I got on SSDI (I’m Deaf) and went back to college full time. I have a good possibility of transferring to my local university by Fall 2020. I’ve been indecisive with my major as I can’t decide on any career prospects. That’s a part of the reason why it’s taken me so long to transfer. At this point I’m a declared math major and taking Calculus 2. I’m doing pretty well, and I also tutor algebra and Trig. 

Problem is, I still don’t really know what I can do with this major. There are many general possibilities, but not concrete (not like chemistry or biology). I like to have a plan. Many people seem to express concerns and uncertainties about this major, as it doesn’t seem to directly lead to any type of career unless I want to teach. I considered becoming a professor, but I don’t think I have the stamina to pursue a MA just to teach community college. I want to go back to work as soon as possible. 

With some research, I’m becoming more interested in becoming an auditor for the public sector. I can use a Leap Certificate as a leverage to get my foot in the door, and hopefully work my way into an entry-level auditor position. But I’ve noticed that auditing jobs require a background in accounting. Majoring in accounting would require me to start all over again with lower division prerequisites before transferring to a different university not under my transfer agreement, delaying my graduation by 1-2 years. An accounting certification can take anywhere between 2-5 years on top of my math degree. 

I was told that now is the time to apply for an entry-level state job. I live in CA. They may not be so abundantly available in a few years. 

It seems like my best bet would be to transfer to an accredited college that provides an online undergraduate program for accounting. At the same time, apply for a state job. If I did that, which program would be recommended? Is this a good plan? Or should I stick with my math degree? My goal is to invest myself in a secure career where I will rather sooner than later have a salary of at least 60K. 

Tl;dr: I’m a community college student who plans to transfer to university in Fall 2020 as a math major. I want to become an auditor in the public sector, but I will need a background in accounting. To do that, I’m considering getting my bachelor’s in accounting online while working an entry-level state position. Is that a good idea?",09Apr2019,1
682,"I'm a 21 years old male, I started college 4 years ago and my life has been downhill since then.

I had my first girlfriend and she suddenly started avoiding me after a while, that was devastating for me, then i failed some classes and had to repeat a lot of classes.

After that, I met some people, and got to know girls over time, some are friends, some a bit more, and I met yet another one who wanted to be more than friends, she had a boyfriend and didn't tell me until after the act, weeks, if not months, after meeting her for the first time. We entered on a somewhat toxic relationship after that until I cut off things with her after her fucking a very close friend of mine.

I kept failing courses and slowly becoming a more toxic person, obsessed with being abandoned and, very often, with that leading to said abandonment.

Sometimes I think I don't have the willpower to go on, failing both socially and academically at this point of my life is making me sadder and sadder, every social interaction is me nervously trying not to screw up and mostly ending in more awkward situations than needed, making me feel even more insecure.

I met a girl whom I spent some time with and we somehow tried to go out, it didn't work after all, but she has been the most sweet and supportive girl I've ever met and until today, but just as a friend, made me want to keep going, she recently asked me if I ever considered seeking professional help for my insecurities and for trying to fix my life, hence, I'm here to ask you the same.

I want to stop being toxic to those around me, I want to finish talking with someone without thinking that that person is tired of me, I want to have again the will to work hard and get things done, and I want to stop thinking that there is no real reason for me to be here.

683,"Here is some background in regards to my life : Junior High school = Tried to be as social as possible, imitated style of popular guys, totally ignored school, had relationships and sex all the time, was very immature, started working as a pr on clubs for a couple of years with success. Had sex on first grade. High school = was well-known among st people around me, still ignored school, became intrigued by history &amp; philosophy &amp; theology thus started reading on books related to plethora schools of thought, started working and working out every day for an entire year and felt the sense of achievement, wanted to become a personal body trainer-nutritionist. After high school = jobless for 6 years, went to the army because it’s mandatory for 9 months on my country, stopped everything related to well-being, became depressed, couldn’t handle the people on the environment because I thought everyone was mindless and not a good person inside. After the army, I engaged on gaming for countless hours, I went to study programming but this specific school had no future. I completely ignored it. Switched to major psychology on a university. All went well in the beginning but then I ignored it once again since I was living with myself and had no control of myself and I didn’t discipline myself. I lost 1 year because of that. Then I passed the module. My relationship was toxic as hell, I lost the confidence with myself and gradually I became anti-social. I feel very awkward in social situations with people I do not know and I was the entire opposite a few years back. I keep many things for myself since I was betrayed by people around me. I feel very lonely nowadays. I lost my best friends but unfortunately it was not my fault. I wish none of that happened. My ex best friend A has a demeanor of a child. He has been very supportive throughout our friendship but he lost his father. I was there for him but since then he has been raging on me over meaningless matters. He always tries to belittle me. He knows I would do nothing to retaliate from his actions, he understands that he is on the wrong but he still does it. My ex best friend D is a sociopath with feelings of grandeur. He belittles everyone, mocking the girls around him, mocking his friends. He wants others close to him to do his bidding. He is a racist thinking that a white privilege exists and should be enforced on the world. He thinks so high of himself that he doesn’t take the time to criticize his actions and words or even see how others are feeling and why they act the way they do. He thinks he is God Almighty. Another ex best friend of mine called G is literally a psychopath. He had me as a friend over the years just to exploit being with a “good” person and feel like normal only to toss me on the garbage once he left where we lived to exploit his family which is rich. My ex girlfriend of 2 years was an angel. On our first month. Later on she started being Over jealous of everyone, even my friends. Luckily, she doesn’t have feelings of grandeur but she has so many problems that one can’t even handle them. She is afraid of death, afraid of talking anything in regards to science, afraid of people around her, afraid of the entire world. She things everyone is a bad person. She is very depressed. I have been there for her through our entire time together. It is not her fault but since then, she fed me only with sorrow. She started fighting with me everyday, throwing tantrums for unimportant things 2,3 times a day. And still, I was by her side the entire time. But then I couldn’t take it anymore and I told her that it’s over. A few months later, she started messaging me. Being the sensitive and protective idiot that I think I am, I returned by her side but not as her boyfriend. Only as a close friend. We meet from time to time, and talk with each other almost everyday. She still is depressed, talking about how bad the world is. My father doesn’t love me, he never said “good job” in my entire life. He is unemotional. My mother does, but unfortunately I can’t talk with her over complicated matters. I have a brother, around 12, which plays games every day through his day, and has sociopathic traits. We cannot communicate. I do not believe in Jesus or a deity to guide me in life. I see all the injustice on our society, and why a person wants to overcome the fear of death by believing. But i do believe in Buddhist teachings. Which i stopped following because of the way i feel. You may think i am exaggerating but i am trying to be bold and stay true to what i say. The thing is, that i was happy a few years back, ignoring the bad things, focusing on the good things with a clear goal in mind. Help others find happiness. Now i feel that i shattered my dream. Lately, I am surrounded by feelings of worthlessness, depression, and suicidal ideation. I truly have no one around me. I have been trying to keep my depression a secret from the ones close to me. I have been spending my time on things like anime, series and gaming just so I can get my mind off of real life. I fell so bad about who i am and what i have achieved, which is nothing. I feel like I will fail university again. I daydream a lot. Being away from the capitalistic society which markets the way of life i despise, living peacefully on nature, providing on a community living outside the norms, peacefully, or even to become a Buddhist monk. But I don’t know where to start, where to continue the path of my life, how to act. I truly feel, on the western society everyone is faking their friendship and attitude.

684,"So, this is a tough one to write without sounding insulting but i mean none of this in a bad way despite how it may come across initially. My girlfriend and I come from very different backgrounds. Her mom had her at 18, neither of her parents went to school, her family is very old school in terms of values and they are also slightly racist &amp; homophobic along with think things like if we get married in the future it HAS to be at a catholic church. Her family are mostly those without an education working minimum wage jobs at 40 years old and just to be clear there is NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. 

&amp;#x200B;

Her mom and dad are divorced and do OK for themselves, solidly middle classish. Her dad is a control freak who has to control every aspect of her life. We were discussing religion and i told him im nothing not religious not atheist just nothing and he proceeded to say i ""still have time to convert..."" He wont even let her drive home because the 40 min drive isnt ""safe.."" Her family believes a lot of things that are not true and they are very closed off to new ideas. If you so much as suggest they might be wrong about something they lose their minds and get insulted even if they ask your opinion you have to lie and agree with them..

&amp;#x200B;

I on the other hand came from a privileged up bringing. my parents had me at 30. They raised me to be open to all and accept others. They were not religious but taught me all about all religions and gave me the choice to go to church. They always taught me to educate myself on everything i can and listen to others and accept their opinions. They gave me the freedom to do what i wanted and never push me to this day. My parents and theirs are the TOTAL OPPOSITE therefore so were our upbringings. We share id say 80% of the same values and opinions and she does not have many of the traits that her family does. BUT, i have NO clue how to act around her family 2 years later.. I just cant figure it out. I feel like if i say something i will insult them or when i talk about my life they cant understand my job or education or background. I mean i tried to explain that i dont have a religion and im not kidding, they thought there were only TWO.. you were either catholic or worshiped satan.. not exaggerating either. I just dont know how to act around them.

&amp;#x200B;

To be clear, i am in NO WAY saying i am somehow better than her or her family or that there is anything wrong with her family other than some of the controlling aspects of her father and the racism/homophobia. They all treat me well. I know this post can come off bad, but i simply just want to know how to act so i dont feel like im walking on egg shells or feel uncomfortable around them. Can anyone tell me how to deal with this? Anyone have similar experience?

686,"God I'm so motherfucking tired of everyone being so difficult. This life is about to make me snap. I've never lead an easy life, I grew up with actual psychopaths as parents. They were some of the most awful people I've ever seen/met in my life, and that's saying something, because I've met a lot of real shitty people. They're everywhere in fact, but, more on that in a minute.

My first 17.5 years of life were spent living under the control of two absolute monsters hell-bent on taking out all their rage, sadness, and isolation on me. It was fucking raw. I was so fucked up coming out of that house. I remember wanting to die at a very early age. Not because I was isolated, or anti-social. I'm not a ""butterfly."" It was because my own mother told me I was a mistake when I was 8 years old, and because my father made threats to kill me. I was beat sometimes, but the verbal/emotional abuse hurt me far worse. It got to the point of absolute madness, beyond what I could even hope to explain. 

Then I got out, and was homeless for two years. I happened to get a scholarship to go to a college that I'm still going to, and I managed to couch hop with my friends who lived on campus. I spent the first year of college talking to the college therapist once a week, coming close to suicide, and sitting in dark closets in the music building in the dead of winter, crying in fits of rage and flashback like episodes.

The rest of my family has been very little help. They all suck. They're all ""victims""  of deep rooted familial abuse several generations long. In the mean time, I've been more emotionally resilient than anyone I've ever known. I went through all that, and then had a girl pursue me my first year of college. We dated for three months, and then they told an entire car full of people that I happened to be in at the time that she had slept with someone else the night before.

Then, I had my best friend call me and say he didn't like me, and that he wasn't sure he ever wanted to really be friends.

After that, I had yet another close friend completely chew me out like he was my dad. He sent me a barrage of texts, saying he didn't appreciate the way I treated school (I had very poor attendance, as I spent large amounts of time breaking down,) and that he thought I acted childish, and that we were in college, and that there was no room to act like that. I was trying everything I could at the time to be positive, and I was prone to acting childish from time to time. It was mostly when I was spending time outside of class with friends, although I did have habits of cracking jokes in class. Either way, he was a massive asshole about it, which he admitted a year later after I APOLOGIZED for not taking what he said better. 

Then, to top it all off, another very close friend of mine who was struggling with her own experience in childhood, and I loved her very much. It was the first fucking time I had loved someone in my life. I spent so much of it with total monsters, I had never understood what loving someone was, or what it felt like to give or receive love. She told me that she had been lying about large parts of her 'personality' for a long time in order to feel safe. She hated that she had done it, and I equally hated it, because while I understood it, I was at my breaking point. I had to be checked into a psych ward for several days, which was an awful experience, and I regret every moment of it. It was garbage, cost me a ton of money, and did virtually nothing except keep me from offing myself, which probably wouldn't have happened anyways.

Then my grandparents contacted me asking what had happened with my birth givers. I tried to explain, but they're fucking idiots and don't understand what emotions are. My entire family is emotionally blank. They experience no positive emotions, and are just a bunch of broken people that never tried to fix themselves or get help. Of course, when I was checked into the psych ward, they told me to go, and not worry about the bill (I had an apartment still, and was working full time on top of college.) They went back on this later, and told me I need to take care of the bills. It was THEIR FUCKING IDEA. I don't trust them anymore. They're awful. They're the type of people that do everything to keep up some kind of image to others, yet they have no friends, are bitter, worrisome, and have horrible tempers.

Nobody in my family actually cares, they've shown that again and again, even though they can actually see how awful my parents especially are, as well as the rest of the family.

I finally recovered some friends, thank god, and I have worked through the issues with almost all of the people in college. Of course, most of it started with me apologizing for the tiniest things I did in each situation that they blew up while simultaneously minimizing everything they did to me.

All I can say is that all of this was traumatizing further to my trust. Up until that point I happened to not be jaded because I could write off how awful my parents were to just being unlucky, but after all the stupid garbage at university, I've lost my trust.

Throughout all of this I've tried my absolute hardest to heal from my childhood and the other issues after. I did everything, I journaled, went to therapy, did my research, learned to love the people who were hurting me constantly. I Put forth herculean efforts to be positive, and be really nice to everyone.

I did all these things because I never wanted anyone else to feel how I did. Because I felt like I was absolutely cast aside, forsaken by everything.

I'm the type of person who is always positive, empathetic, and loving. I try to be funny, and bring everyone else up. 

&amp;#x200B;

God am I tired...

&amp;#x200B;

I started to truly pick myself up, feeling somewhat happy for the first time last fall. My repaired relationships with friends gave me joy, and I was proud of myself for getting through all that. It appeared, truly, that for the first time in my life, the ball was in my court, and that things were going my way.

I got involved romantically with a girl that I did not find out until it was too late, was horribly immature, and just led me on for two months. That was over winter break from school. Then I got fired from a job by a horrible boss. I arrived that morning and he started cussing me out, told me I was fucking stupid, and told me to leave. He fired me because I stood up in the back of a small cart to avoid getting raw pig juice all over me. I was fired for endangering myself.

I got a new job, and it was great for a while. Then one of the managers became power hungry as usual, and started being a total ass to me, even after I had attempted to make friends with him. 

I lost my apartment, and couldn't afford another, so back to couches I go! Yay!

I started feeling myself shut down again. Hippity hoppity here comes depression and rage.

I'm at the point where I may just fucking snap. I've never wanted to legitimately hurt someone besides in early childhood when I used to fantasize about beating my parents so they couldn't chase me down and running away. Now everybody makes me want to snap. I broke a mop in half at work with my bare hands the other night, and I wasn't even aware how angry I was. I've stopped breathing properly because I'm always so tense.

Help me Reddit, please, have some advice, some wisdom, something. I've tried everything, and my body, mind, and soul are just FUCKING DONE. I need something to get me out of this hole. I paid every last cent I had to take classes to become a personal trainer so I could make enough money to live off campus and not have to work full time. I start in 7 days. I'm in year two of the physics program at my school, and it's kind of my one love right now.

I can't keep going like this. Please, just pick me up a bit, some words, a smile, anything...",09Apr2019,3
687,"Okay reddit, I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place, atleast I think.

I'm 24, live in Wisconsin, and just recently realized how much I hate this state, job, environment, eeverything. I recently visited Arizona, and I want to 100% move out there now, I wasn't sure before I went, but I am sure now.

Upon getting back, I was near instantly miserable. I didn't want to go to this job. I didn't want to deal with the people I deal with. I lost a friend. I just feel like I'm losing everything and gaining nothing but money. 

This is what my heart wants to do.: Quit my job, pack my shit, and go to Arizona like I want to. 

Things preventing me: place to live? Job? 

Other then that.. I have money for the move, transportation, and.. That's it? 

I'm in school right now but honestly I don't even care anymore. This subject is rather unfulfilling and I found something I enjoy more, which I can do in Arizona. 

What does reddit think I should do? Should I be an adult, wait until I find a place to live (at the least, I can find jobs after I move there if nothing else), build up my credit a bit, finish this semester, and try not to kill myself working this Job? 

Or. Put my 2 weeks in to coincide with the semester ending. Find temporary living out there. And just go. 

I'm so distraught because like, I literally COULD go right now, but it just wouldn't be the smartest decision I could make... But even while it's not the smartest play, I'm seriously so miserable here it's not even funny. I feel like I left Wisconsin with 1 mindset, and returned with a completely different mind.

689," 

I'm an 18-year-old male, living in London. Currently doing my A - Levels, with my final exams just weeks away. I went to a party over the weekend. It was a birthday party of a girl that I know from school. I've always liked her, but not enough to actually really want to do something about it. She is in none of my classes, but I see her at break from time-to-time.

At the party, she got drunk and would constantly run out of the building to go and cry. I would run after her and comfort her. She was very thankful for me. She asked me, ""would you have kissed me?"" I wanted to say yes instantly, but I kind of played it cool and pretended to be surprised, to which she responded with very obvious embarrassment. That is totally my fault. I instantly told her that I took that as a compliment but I just couldn't get myself to say the word ""yes"". After that, she put her head on my shoulder and just cried as I comforted her. I loved it so much. She told me that she was sad because she thinks she is gay and that she loves a girl that is way older than her. I then held her hand and asked her if she wanted to go in and dance with me.

It's been 3 days since the party, and I just can't forget her. I asked her this morning if she wanted to hang out with me, but she's very busy with revision for the upcoming exams. I can't tell her my feelings because A. We have exams right now, and the added stress is really not needed B. I'm brown, she's white, my family will kill me and C. She may not love me at all because she told me she loves an older girl.

I keep praying to God for answers. My heart is very heavy and I can't stop thinking about her. About her kissing my cheeks, about holding her hand, about touching our heads together. I think I very much love her.",09Apr2019,2

I felt the same way about her and was attracted to everything about her. However, the last few weeks have felt different. When I’m hanging out with her, I don’t have that excited feeling anymore. I barely feel anything emotional. It hurts me because when I look back at her face I can genuinely tell how happy and content she is with our relationship. She hasn’t done anything wrong or hurt me in anyway, so I’m not sure why I suddenly feel like this. I’m also scared that if I break up with her, she’ll become super depressed or do something bad to herself. I just wish I still felt the same about her",09Apr2019,2

It was highly sexual, often either  them or me or both sharing video streams. Sometimes it was just  conversation though, asking me to come live with them or whatever.

699,"Listen- I know lying is wrong. 

With the exception of the usual embellishments on a resume, I generally an honest person. In fact, as my current partner and I were getting to know one another I found myself sharing raw, honest, and vulnerable details with him pretty early on. We built healthy communication strategies from the beginning, and it all seemed to flow with ease. Except for one critical detail... 

A few months into the relationship, the topic of money weaseled it's way into pillow talk (sexy, I know) under the guise of the pursuit of dreams, career paths, etc. I dodged the topic and diverted the dialogue on a few occasions, but it wasn't long before it eventually looped back around with a vengeance.....

 A little context may help. At this point in our relationship, I felt as though I had something to prove; Not to him, but rather to his family and friends. He's 11 years my senior and I was terrified of being typecast as the young broad after his wallet. This is an insecurity that likely arose from my the demons of my parent's divorce. My dad ended up with a younger woman who leeched him for everything he'd ever earned. I refuse to be (or even to be confused for) that breed of monstress. I've worked for everything to my name and I'm starkly independent. 

..... So back to my dilemma. About 3 months deep, he invites me to spend the 4th of July at pool party with a mix of his friends, family, co-workers, and their S/Os. I'd admittedly been nervous to meet many of ""his people"" in fear that I'd be judged, but I was really beginning to adore this man so it felt like the right step to take. Long story short- everything went extraordinarily well. I made fast friends with nearly everyone I was introduced to. Despite my anxieties, nobody seemed to give a fuck about my age. Nobody, that is, except for this one Benzo-fueled MLM-Cultess / Real Housewife of Skinny Tea. Let's call her 'Becky'. In summary, Becky spent the entire day referring to me as  ""Baby Bimbo"" as though I wasn't within direct earshot. She refused to shake my hand, much less get to know me whatsoever, and was just a stone cold bitch. I digress... It was, for the most part, a day that's remembered fondly even to date. 

Later that evening, I was reflecting on an otherwise positive day and processing this exciting step for our relationship with my partner. I eventually expressed some grievances over Becky's nasty attitude, and my partner tried soothing me with a sentiment to the tune of: ""She's a jealous bitch with the depth of a kiddie pool, and everyone knows it. You're an easier target if she troupes you as the pretty, young 'baby bimbo' after my money rather than the substantial woman that I know you to be. Don't take it to heart"". I don't know what got into me here, but I kind of just... lost it. 

I went on a rant (likely influenced by a daiquiri too many and a long day in the sun) telling my partner that I don't give a fuck about his money; that I was smitten by him well before I knew about his comfortable career; that the value in our relationship was defined by an exchange of energy, compassion, and respect rather than monetary or material measures (all things that he, of course, already knew)...

Without even thinking, I impulsively spit out **""I have my** ***own*** **6 figures!""** (... Spoiler Alert: I don't. I make $57K per year).   I nearly bit my tongue the moment I said it, but I didn't know how to backpedal in the heat of things. Instead, I welcomed the words of solidarity he offered and just moved on with our evening. I know I should have addressed it then, but I didn't and I regret it to this day.

Our relationship continued in such a promising direction that it never felt like the ""right time"" to risk blemishing the trust we'd built by telling him I'd lied about something that felt so trivial at the time. I was honestly just hoping he'd just kind of... forget... the figure that I'd blurted out that day. 

Sure, money has come up a few times since, but it's almost always in the context of his appreciation for the fact that I'm the first woman to ever treat him to vacations and massages, insist on splitting the bill at dinner, etc. Everything goes down the middle.

Recently, however, it's become increasingly daunting that #1. this wasn't such a trivial lie after all and #2 he most certainly has **not** forgotten what I said. We've been considering relocating to a different state, and thus we've spent a lot a time surfing Zillow for houses. After much research, we've decided to purchase some investment property (a DIY flip in a promising seller's market) together, and as I'll be earning my stripes as a first time home buyer- he's really taken the lead on factors of budgeting, finance, etc. I was kind of shocked when he showed me some of the homes in the running, and asked whether we could really afford something like this. He assured me that our combined incomes would more than account for this price range... *shit*.

He's also asked my opinion on a few rings, and propositioned the idea of elopement before I return to graduate school. We would undoubtedly sign a prenup and maintain separate accounts, but money and assets are obviously important factors in marriage and I'd hate myself for risking an otherwise happy, healthy, and strong relationship for what can only be classified as an impulsive defense of my ego.

I know that I have to say something. At this point, my fear is no longer that he (or his loved ones) will judge my intentions for the money that I make (or rather that I don't), but instead that he will **rightfully** call my character into question for being dishonest and not saying something sooner. 

Does anyone have any nuggets of wisdom on how to approach an admission of this sort? Does my relationship have any hope after this?",09Apr2019,1

I got a bit defensive because I feel like I don't talk about him that much or at least  not all the time(M even admitted she exaggerated).At first Ill admit I did talk about him a lot and she told me how she felt, I cut it down and it was never brought up until now.

My position is that I don't about him too much as I hardly talk about him randomly(if he does something cute Ill mention it but other then that not much).

710,"Apologies for the wall, but I need to get this all out...

For context, this time last year, I had crippling anxiety and depression, was nearing the end of a year long nervous breakdown, on medication and seeing a therapist once a week. 

After going through all that, I’m now off meds and no longer seeing a therapist (though I can go back at any time). 
I’ve calmed down so much and it’s made my head feel clearer, I go to the gym nearly every day and I love the way it makes me feel. 

But over the last few months, I’ve noticed that I get angry at small things more often. My road rage is awful and most of the time, other drivers aren’t even doing anything dangerous or stupid, it’s just my perception. 

This problem has been amplified with the stress of me moving into my first home. I finally have the freedom of moving out of my parents house and living on my own. 

However, everyone and their dog has been inputting “design suggestions” all of which I fucking hate. I know exactly what I want and how to achieve it. 
My Dad has just assumed he HAS to do all the re-decorating and is getting stressed because he works full time and is wondering when he’ll have the time. 
I’ve said I’m doing as much as I can - I’m physically disabled, but I’m still more than capable of stripping wallpaper and doing some DIY. I think with my Dad, the thing that annoyed me the most was the assumption that I can’t do anything myself. The whole point of me moving out is to be more independent!

When I told my sister this, she just borderline yelled at me for refusing his help! I said that I’m accepting all the help I can get and I’m very grateful for it, but I won’t take advantage of people’s kindness and be an asshole with it. 

I said that I was a bit annoyed because he assumed it was his project and not mine and he was going to take over everything. 
She simply wouldn’t listen to me... 

I know people want to help me and I’m grateful for that. What I don’t appreciate is everyone forcing their opinion down my throat and getting offended when I say “no thank you”... I know how to decorate a house and property/interior design is a hobby of mine, I’ve put a LOT of effort and thought into this. 

My question here is, how do I stop letting anger get the better of me at times like this? I very rarely get angry at all and when I do, it’s over seemingly unimportant stuff. 

I don’t think I have an anger problem, I’m normally level-headed and rational, but the last couple of months have proved otherwise. Could it be other people’s anger and negativity rubbing off on me? My family constantly vent about every slight or injustice they encounter. Am I taking their anger on board?",09Apr2019,1

717,"So a bit of backstory. about 2 months ago i moved down to Florida from new york to live with my dad and meet him for the first time, i moved because I needed to get away from my abusive mother who is ruining my grandma's life and mine. Things were great until a month ago, he started getting mad at me for joking around with my friends in a weird way and for not helping him work and being on my phone too much. First off im a girl that doesn't get along with a lot of other girls so almost all my friends are guys and i joke around just like a guy would with them, my dad is normally a pretty chill guy that likes to joke around about stupid shit so i told him how my friends and i were joking around and comparing chest sizes because they were saying that their chest is bigger than mine so i tell this to my dad and he gets unreasonably pissed at me saying im a whore and im just like my mom and that im exposing myself on the internet. Then a few days go by and he gets mad at me again for being on a voice call with one of my friends while i had no shirt on because of a really bad sunburn i got, and again he kept calling me a whore and this time he said if he finds out im exposing myself online he's going to kick me out knowing full well that i have no friends in Florida and nowhere to go, i tell this to my mom saying I wanna go back to new York and she just tells me to deal with it and talk it out. Another week goes by which would be today and he yells at me again for being on my phone too much and never helping around the house which isn't true, when we first moved in the new house i set up the kitchen and my room and cleared the living room of all mine and his crap so it could be painted, i do help out when im asked and when I'm given instructions i can't just assume what to do if im not told what to do and he yelled at me for it, and again he threated to kick me out on my 18th birthday if i don't get a job and help pay rent, and i would absolutely love to get a job but i can't do that without my ssc which my mom lost and he's now refusing to pay for a new one. I should probably mention that when he yells at me (and he's admitted to doing this too) he likes to really get under the skin and make me feel like a completely shitty person for not living up to his expectations. Now the obvious solution would be to go back to new york but then I'd have to deal with my abusive mother again, and since i have a lot of stuff i can't take a plane and my family doesn't have the money to drive all the way down here to get me and my dad refused to take me back.

721,"tldr; I have a very thick accent I have hidden with a fake voice for years and now that I'm trying to drop the fake american accent I've been doing for years nobody believes me  


I'm a high school student (End of Junior Year) in the Central USA, I'm also a 3rd generation immigrant. When I was younger the thick accent I inherited from my family got me picked on in school for having a ""weird  voice"" and on top of that I had a pretty bad speech impediment.   


My parents eventually got me in a speech therapy class where I dealt with my speech problems and where I finally picked up the American Accent and since thats what I practiced with kept it. The bullying stopped soon after (about my voice at least) and from that point I decided to not revert back to my accent. (I however still used my accent while doing things online like gaming which helped me keep my accent)  


Well its been 9 years and I've finally become confident enough to stop faking my voice when in person, but the thing is the friends I have now and even my lovely girlfriend have never known me with my accent and none of them believe its my real accent. (Context: this is partially due to the fact that I have developed a reputation as a trickster in High school)

724,"I have two Cellar Spiders who are currently handling my gnat problem in my bathroom. 

&amp;#x200B;

Background: For about a week, I have woken up everyday to use the restroom and as my slumbering body turns open the door, I am jolted awake by an infestation of gnats crowding my bathroom sink. These pests serve no purpose and have gotten increasingly annoying, congregating after I shower or use the sink. They are disrupted when I enter my own bathroom and annoyingly flood the air flying around and knocking into things. They are attracted by light and standing water (Ex. A sink with bad piping that doesn't drain easily) and do not like me as much as I don't like them. Every day there seemed to be more to the point I was killing about 20-35 a day until yesterday when two spiders took up residence. 

I saw these two sizable insects above the bathroom hanging in the corner. They are definitely D-L-Ls of sorts and I am going to determine whether they are Harvestmen or another cross-species. I have cut off any clear entrances to the bathroom (closing the door and windows) however they seemed to have started building around the vent where the gnats were entering. So far, there have been a significantly reduced amount of the winged pests, should I keep the spiders or not?",09Apr2019,1
725,"Hi guys, throwaway account because reasons.

So I recently got a new job that seems just awesome. People have been really cool through the hiring process. They did a background check and didn't tell me whether or not they found anything. The only thing on there might be a pending charge for simple possession of marijuana (cop found some in my car)--I've got a lawyer and plan to do whatever it takes to keep it off my record.

Either way, I start tomorrow and was told I'd need to do a drug test. Well no worries, I bought some fake urine for the test and feel confident it will work and produce a clean drug test.

The issue I'm running into is that the hiring manager was pretty clear about how they allow you to smoke marijuana, and that it won't stop you from getting the job and that I shouldn't do anything crazy like try to cover it. The way she said it made me think she knew I smoked it (especially if they were able to see the pending charges), and wanted to reassure me and was being honest. But I'm paranoid af by nature so of course I'm also wondering if this is a method she uses to weed people out, since people might let their guard down and not bother to cheat the tests.

Since I have that same vibe/feeling now.

Theres a girl i've been hanging out with in a group scenario, but she's always ***very*** nice to me, in a different way than most people are. It's like she cares about my opinion a bit more than others. It's strange to describe but whenever I'm talking it's like she's paying extra attention. Small examples I guess can be when I was waiting for some food to arrive, and she goes ""do you want me to stay out here with you or go inside"" I replied ""i dont mind up to you"" and she was like ""ailright, I'll stay with you"", which was strange because everyone was lit inside. Also one time when we were all smoking in a circle, I sort of glanced at her while rotating my head, and saw her staring at me, and as soon as I made eye contact she looked away. I might have overthought everything being high, but it would be amazing to get some other perspectives on this. Some more relevant info is that i'm 18 and so is she. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I'm really confused about this is because she's around 5'11 and I'm around 5'10 if I'm standing with good posture, which is annoying to do all the time, so slouching comfortably makes me look around 5'9 most of the time. I don't really want to clown myself with thinking theres a chance, if there isn't one.

737,"I'm 19M living with my parents. 

Past 2 years have been pure shit. Dropped out of high school half way, ""attempted"" to move abroad and failed, which demoralized me even further.

I haven't had many substantial relationships and I end up lonely every time. My late childhood and teenage years were hellish in that sense, being stuck in my own head while getting abused by my older siblings. (Out of coincidence?) I got a severe asthma the same years - that suspiciously went away after they moved out. These days when they visit, I just accept the shit coming at me, because they've crushed any self-esteem I used to have.

I don't like whining, but since my home cicumstances still trigger apathy and a freeze-response, I can't get over it too easy even though I want to. Constantly being in this fight or flight/freeze mode eats up my sleep and creates massive trouble concentrating. This destroys every relationship and achievment outside my head. I'm lucky not to have more health issues, but give it 5 or 10 more years and who knows what I could be suffering from.


I've known since childhood days that moving out will solve most of this, question is just: how?

I have roughly $2000 saved up, but my country has a housing shortage. You can either line up for decades or take on a huge loan. Neither of which will work for me.

He was bankrupt for good, To make ends meet he sold drugs back when I was 18 during 2011 (i was still in school and everybody talked behind my back),  I was playing life in hard mode from that moment, but we came through , I was ostracized and stigmatized as a son of a drug dealer from then onwards,I rarely go out from that point onwards, no more contacts with friends whatsoever, and I am still stigmatized till today for the hard decision my father had to make, when in fact I don't even smoke pot or do drugs or drink alcohol, but yeah life was a bit harsh  then 2013 came, my mom was diagnosed again with cancer, somehow we pull it off till 2015(with no drugs dealing whatsoever) , I got my first job at my birthday at 2014, I was 21 then, but things spiral out of control, my dad was depressed by June 2015, drank alcohol a lot and died that year, and then mom also passed away that very year. 2015 was tough for me, I lost my best friend and my parents, but somehow I make it till today and I don't even know how I did it, but things hit me lately, By now, I think most human who have to endure these shit will be a bitter cynic, trying to be an optimist and TRYING TO BE HAPPY WHEN YOU ARE NOT, IS EASIER SAID THAN DONE, I realized, how frail humanity is, How our mortal coils bind us to this very reality of life, of the nature of human suffering, and how pointless it is to have a gf who gives emotional reassurance.

744,"I’m not going to post the whole background of this story because it’s quite a bit to write. Overall, my future brother in law has always been a really nice and considerate guy. I basically consider him to be family because he’s been dating my sister for years and has gone on many family outings with us.... Long story short, I was invited to his bachelor party out in Portland. He originally specified that he did not want to go to the strip clubs because he just simply was not interested. Fast forward to the last night of the bachelor party, I decided I wanted to go fishing all day and hit up some good food places in Portland on the way back. They wanted to continue their drinking spree (his group was all of his fraternity friends) so they went out to the bars at 2pm right as I was leaving for fishing. I got back around 11:30 pm and fell asleep until I was awoken at 2:30 am. The house that we rented had very thin walls so I was easily able to hear their conversation that I originally tried to tune out. I overheard them talking about the strippers and how sexy they were - nothing wrong with that... but the conversation escalated into them talking about what happened when they bought private dances. Mind you all of these guys have girlfriends/wives except for one (group of 8). I heard at least 3 or 4 of them talking about how they got head from the strippers. Every time they were explaining the details they would lower their voices because they obviously wanted to be secretive about what happened (but they were belligerently drunk and the house had thin ass walls). I recognized my future brother in laws voice when he was talking about the private dance he got from the stripper, and he was definitely very happy about what happened. I swear I overheard him talking about how she took his shirt off and did stuff to him back in the private room of this strip club. After they were done sharing their experiences, they humorously agreed to not fill me in on what went down that night and laughed very hard about it. Once again, the house walls were extremely thin and they were right above my room so I was able to hear all this relatively clearly. I have been to the strip club that they went to and know that the previously mentioned things are possible because it happened to me the last time I went. When I asked them how their night was the morning after they were very closed off about it. I overheard them talking about a stripper named Ashley who apparently did extra things to them, so I asked if they met a girl named Ashley there (playing it off as if I met her last time I went a year ago). They completely denied it and I could tell that it was an uncomfortable question for them even though I played it off well. I tried to get details out of them acting as if I knew nothing about what they talked about the night before but they really did not want to talk about it, and I could tell. I don’t know 100% that my future brother in law cheated on my sister with a stripper, but I have a very strong suspicion that he did - along with a few of his fraternity brothers. My question to you guys is, should I mention anything to my sister or future brother in law? Or should I just let it go and let things play out? I feel like it’s a lose-lose situation for me either way... I would really appreciate some feedback. Thanks guys,

Like sometimes I like to sit in my room with my huge double doors open to make my room feel bigger and not to feel so secluded from the rest of the house, but every time I do, majority of the time she's standing in front of my open doors facing sideways to them into the kitchen sometimes having casual conversation with her family, I've glanced over maybe once or twice and we've both made eye contact which is what raised suspicion for me. Why was she standing there and why did we make eye contact if she was focused on the kitchen? There have been times where I've opened my door and she was sitting at her desk, and then she would (obviously without me seeing her turn) be facing my door in a matter of seconds looking at her phone. Often when I come home and she's nowhere to be seen, she'll quickly be in the kitchen leaning over the bench, you cant see my room without doing this, and playing on her phone. Or the rare occasion where I'll be inside and she'll be hanging washing, I'll come out into the living room and then she'll be turned towards me, playing on her phone. Wherever I go in the house as long as it's on neutral ground or a door is open, she's facing my way ""looking busy"" in quotes since I'm not convinced about that because I often feel eyes on me and when I look around I always make eye contact with her and it's so awkward.

So am I being paranoid or is this reason to believe that she is watching me? I really don't know why she would but I feel like I'm going crazy. To me, it's not so weird to be leaning over desks and benches, standing in front of doors, but it IS weird to put yourself there for no apparent reason, all the time. If you guys think it is reason enough, how do I address it? It's such a weird thing.",09Apr2019,1

753,"Basically long story short a friend of mine had her bachelorette a few weeks ago and I didn’t attend. She proposed the idea for it a week and a half in advance and it was a weekend out of town on top of that. I’m not a super social person to begin with so a weekend with other women I’ve never met in a different city wasn’t really on my radar plus my husband and I made plans for that weekend prior to me finding it out. I told her immediately that i couldn’t be able to attend but that I had planned something special the following week. 

Fast forward to after that weekend and i ask how it went and I get guilt tripped with passive aggressive “sucks to know blah blah blah is more important” and “my real friends did a fabulous job”,and so forth and so on. I expressed that i didn’t appreciate the guilt trip and that was up front from the moment i got the invite that I couldn’t go. It ended up being a whole deal and I quit talking to her and really have no intention of continuing communication. I didn’t ghost her the day of and I’ve gone completely out my way to do something for her and she basically said that was just a cop out. I’ve done a lot for this person over the years and honestly i ain’t even sad about it but i just wanted someone else’s perspective.",09Apr2019,1
754,"Hi everyone, I've been reading posts here for a while but I never actually thought I would need it. However this topic came up when I was talking to my friends last night, and it has been on my mind ever since. I'm a straight female college student (second year) and I have never had a boyfriend my whole life. Of course that's no big deal, but a lot of people were surprised when I told them this, since I don't come across as undateable. It doesn't bother me really, because I got my life together and I'm doing okay by myself; I have an amazing group of friends, loving parents, and a part-time job that pays well. 

A little back story: when I was fifteen, I was rejected by my high school crush AND molested by the dude's 22-year-old friend - all happened over the span of one month. So now, whenever a person expresses an interest in me, I instantly FREAK OUT. Not like ""omg he likes me??"" but like ""I'd block you on every social media platform and stop answering your texts until I come up with a good reason to reject you"" freak out. Not a cool move I know, but it has kinda become my go-to tactic - before they develop further feelings for me, I'd rather they just hate me. And it does work. I don't even understand why I do this. Whenever someone likes me I just instantly dislike them. This happens even to my crushes. 

Overall, I just need some advice on how to open up again. I believe that my experience might have scarred me, but I want to overcome it. Thanks in advance!",09Apr2019,3

Now I have some new opportunities because I am young and can go multiple paths. I need some advice. 


I interviewed this morning for a local plumbing company who is very well reputable. I don’t have any experience in the field aside from knowing tools and changing toilets. The company is willing to make an investment in me to teach me how to be a plumber. They do new construction and remodel plumbing for residential and small commercial. The pay is $15 an hour as an apprentice with the opportunity to earn merit raises. I got a call back this afternoon offering me the position and i can start Thursday morning, all I have to do is show up with my tools. 



The other opportunity, which isn’t necessarily set in stone, is a 2nd shift warehouse worker at the company my brother works for, picking, measuring, and filling orders. The company is very well reputable as well, has a great bonus that they usually achieve every month (and they have for the last 22months) as well as having a great culture and owner.

759,"My stepdad was a raging alcoholic, but also the man who raised me. Even though he would scream at us, destroy our home, and occasionally act out in violence toward us (primarily our mom because she would never allow someone to abuse her children), he never really meant to hurt us... I know he loved us dearly and hated who he was, but after almost fifteen years of begging to help him and him refusing, we gave up and left.
I haven't spoken to him since I was 18 yo and I'm now almost 27. The last time we spoke he told me he was hurt by the mean things I said to him and that he still loved me as his daughter and I told him I refuse to take back what I said because I meant it all. It hurt me, deeply. But this man would abuse us every night and beg for forgiveness every morning. I lost my patience with him by the time I was 18.
I've had time to cool down my temper, but he has forever changed who I am now and not all for the better. But also not all for the worse...
Our whole family knew his alcoholism would be the death of him and now here he is with liver failure. Doctors gave him six months to live. 
Would you speak to a man you watched attempt to strangle someone you love more than anything (in this case my mom)? A man who loved you but every night would drink himself into an unrecognizable monster?
My sister told me that when she spoke to him today he was plastered. Which I am both not surprised and don't blame him for. If I had six months left to live, I sure as hell wouldn't be sober either. But am I ready for the first time I speak to him after almost a decade to be with a smashed former stepfather?
I don't know what to do or what to think. We all knew he was going to die soon, but it still surprised us to hear the news. Anyone have any similar stories to share?

761,"Hey there,

this is my first post on reddit, I have been a very long time lurker on here, so I hope I'm doing everything correctly. ;)

I'm currently 21, live in Europe and have a decent job in a printing house. The salary is nice but I'm starting to doubt my past decisions - from day to day more.

2 years ago, in April of 2017, I applied for training school for being a train driver at our federal railways. Since there is a high demand (and will be for the next years) and they liked my application, they took me, which made me the happiest person ever. Since I can remember, I have been a huge fan of trains and everything that comes with it. You could call me a train-freak if you want, but I just like everything with big machines - still nowadays. And the salary for train drivers in our country is really high. Higher than many other jobs.

Long story short - the train driver school began and I liked it but I had problems with some colleagues. The atmosphere in my class wasn't the best and since I am (unfortunately) a very sensitive person who already had some problems with social anxiety in the past, I was very nervous throughout the training. So nervous, that I had problems with sleeping every night. I liked the train-part and was often the best at tests but I didn't like the socializing stuff that came with the classes. So one day, something snapped in my brain and I decided to quit the training. I just called in and said that I want to cancel my career at the company.

That's when I realized that I had to change something in my life. I went to a psychotherapist who diagnosed mild social anxiety and in the next few months, we worked really hard on it. Now, two years later, the symptoms nearly completely disappeared.

I'm still nervous in some social situations but I guess that's something that you can't change. I deal with it better than ever before and I kind of got a different attitude about most of the social situations I encounter in day to day life.

I'm sure that if I would get the chance to re-apply at the same company for training &amp; a job, I would pull through and complete my training. Even if there would be resistance and hard times, I know I can make it.

How should I re-apply? And how should I describe that I'm better prepared than ever before? I don't want to mess it up...",09Apr2019,1
762,"So a little back story. My friends and I have one table that we sit at at lunch and we sit there every day. Today there was a girl that lady her bag in the seat I normally sit in so I moved it one down and sat down. All was fine until she came and saw that I moved her bag and she flipped her shit. She started screaming at us and saying stuff like “imma pull up on you [n word]” and “I’m boutta rob y’all if you fuck with me again.”

Now I just gave her the benefit of the doubt and assumed she was just having a shifty day. I stayed calm and just apologized and she still threw a milk carton at me, but to be quiet honest I didn’t really care. While she was screaming at us it was clear she was on the phone with someone. As she was walking away I heard her say “nah bruh. Merc these [n words].”

That last part is what got me. I was fine until that. I’m freaking out now and I honestly don’t know what to do, or if I should even be sweating it in the first place. I’ve never had a panic attack before in my life and I’m freaking out. If anyone can give me any advice that would be greatly appreciated",09Apr2019,2
763,"Let me start off by giving a bit of backstory:

I've only recently acknowledged that my parents are narcissists. Not sure yet if my mom is an E or not, but there is definitely narcissistic parenting at work. From a young age i was constantly forced to behave per their wishes in order to be a true &lt;insert family name here&gt; and to be a child my parents are proud of having. At every stage I have been prevented from things that are NORMAL for that age and have always been told i am not receiving it because its not important or that I havent earned it due to some previous misdemeanor. Here are some previous things

* During elementary and middle school, my parents would make me cut friendships with children they didnt like. whenever i tried to stand up for myself they would get angry at me and say i was corrupted by my friends and would forbid me from meeting them. My mom would look thru my backpack and my room for evidence of my friendships and would yell at me when she found things like my 5th grade journal.
* In high school i got a boyfriend. They began to read all my texts and would not let me go to normal HS things like dances and hangouts. They said all of my friends had brainwashed me whenever i would fight back and demand more autonomy. At the end of freshman yr they ended up pulling me out of HS and put me into a private girls school. They made me delete my FB and monitored who i called and texted. I was forbidden from going out with friends because i needed to earn their trust.
* I got into a great (Top 15) college. My parents were finally proud, but attributed it to the fact that they MADE me successful by removing me from bad influences (my former friends all ended up at very respectable colleges and chose majors that funneled into high-income jobs). In college, I began to finally socialize and live my live as per my wishes, but my parents could not handle me ""not spending time with the family"". My parents began to use Find my Friends to track my location, when i wasn't in my dorm or school they would call me and yell at me to demand i explain what i was doing. My freshman yr i went to 1 frat party, and it was in the final week before finals, when my parents had gone to India on vacation. They began to micromange me, and would force me to come home (they lived an hour away) at a moments notice. when i would tell them i had plans they would yell at me for being a liar and would force me to cancel my plans because ""friends are always there, they arent as important as the family"". They also demanded my college login information to keep track of my grades and would call to scream at me or come to bring me home for the weekend and stage interventions each time i got something below a B. Eventually i started lying more and even would photoshop pictures of my grades, and my grades started slipping. I started suffering intense depression and anxiety and felt out of control.
* My parents pulled me out of college. they forced me to see a psychiatrist of their choosing (also a middle aged immigrant indian who was sympathetic to the ""parent are only doing this because they care"" narrative).They cut me off from my ""bad influence"" friends who corrupted me and drove me to and from Community College. Eventually i just gave them what they wanted, told my psychiatrist what she wanted to hear, and just focused on getting out. Eventually i was readmitted into my University after an appeal, and I regained friends, met my now BF and graduated successfully. To this day my parents think that my degree is not special, that it was an expectation and they are the reason i was able to go back to school. because it was all because of their rules.

I now have a job as a software engineer in the Bay Area. I make a very good salary for a 24 YO (100K+). I live with my boyfriend of 2 years who is also a software engineer and my parents like him. My parents opened a joint bank account with me when i was a teen and my mom has always had access to it. she monitors it and interrogates me over any purchase over 20 dollars. I decided to open a secret checking account for purchases that i knew would cause interrogation. i was never allowed to take loans (my parents could afford to put me thru school and paid for all my expenses) so I didn't have any credit, I got a credit card with a high limit this year and have a small balance on it(nothing I cant pay off in a few months). Last year my partner wanted to switch from chemical engineering to software engineering and could not get an educational loan on his own, so I cosigned a loan with him for 15K.

This is the last year my dad can file for taxes with me as a dependent so he forced me to give him my financial info. He filed my taxes and Turbo tax has a feature where u can run a free credit report, he forced me to give him my SSN and he found out about my creditcard and the student loan. He tried to make me cancel plans with friends (i didnt and later got called a selfish trash person for it) and made me come home this weekend. I went home, and basically listened to him as he called me a lying piece of trash who is a failure in his parenting. He told me once again to cut out the bad influence friends i have (lol all these years of their control have left me with like 1 friend) and he accused me of paying for my boyfriend and that my boyfriend doesnt really have a job (my bf is also a SWE at a VERY well known tech company). He demanded my credit card statement to see what i was spending on (i didnt refuse but i didnt say yes to this).

I have been avoiding contact since coming back to my apartment. Today, i'm at work and my dad texted me ""Looked at your bank account. Not good. Let’s talk this evening and make sure he is not there"" (he being my bf, he doesnt like to yell at me with an audience). he goes on to say "" If you tell us lies and misinformation I can’t help fix anything. It’s better you be transparent with everything""

I am so STRESSED AND ANXIOUS. I want to go NC with my family but i am also an emotional dummy who wants to have my family and not hurt their feelings. I dont want to be a cause of pain by cutting myself off from them. Im sitting here at work, crippled with fear and I cant live this way anymore. I dont know what to do.

765,"This is my first time posting to Reddit, but I could use some outside advice. I used to talk to this guy before I met my current boyfriend. This previous guy and I were talking seriously for only about 4 months starting around this time last year. Things didn't work out because I grew anxious over us not officially dating yet and he broke things off,  come to find out he was talking to another girl as well so my fear was justified. Shortly after our split he took her on the vacation to meet his family that we had planned, during which they began officially dating. It was a smack in the face, but I kept my cool and never reached out to him again as soon as I knew another woman was in his life. I have not interacted with him once since, but we are still connected on social media. He always views my Instagram story to this day, but I have not even viewed his once after everything.  I met my now boyfriend soon after they started dating and things are going really well for us. I'm thankful every day for how things ended up because I am so happy to have found such a great partner. When I was talking to this previous guy he got involved with a charity event to raise money for a great cause, I had really admired that about him at the time. I won't get into all the details but it is basically like a marathon type of event. When I was with him I struggled financially, but I still donated $20, it was all I could do at the time. This year he is getting involved with the same event in which he is raising the bar in his efforts to do more for this charity. I'm in a better spot financially and have had the urge to donate $50 to his fundraiser via Facebook. I stopped myself currently from doing so because I am not sure if I'm crossing some kind of unspoken boundary. He has been thanking everyone personally and I'm not sure if me donating would stir up drama with his girlfriend or something. I would like to contribute to the cause, but I would also like him to know that I am the one giving the donation, not anonymously. I want him to see it is from me because I want him to know that hey, I still can appreciate the awesome thing you are doing and respect that you are a good person even though we did not work out. Kinda just wanna kill him with kindness because I stayed silent this entire time and never lashed out over how things resulted. But it also shows I'm doing just fine, in fact better financially and overall a year later, so I'd like to do more than I contributed last year now that I am able. I still do not want anything to do with him, I don't even care for him to talk to me ever again either. I am happy and it looks like he is too. Everybody won in the end.

For the past few months, I've felt like I need a major life change - change careers, move to another state or even another country, or just make some other positive change to better myself. Every day I come home from work in a haze of confusion and restlessness. Small things like the cleanliness of my house give me extreme anxiety. My hobbies and friendships have suffered. I've actually felt jealous of my friends that get enthusiastic and excited because I don't feel that way about anything anymore. I'm a musician and a writer, but I've been feeling so unmotivated and that my passions don't matter. Some nights, I have such little energy that even the thought of playing video games sounds too taxing. I can't point to one area of my life that causes me to feel this way - my marriage is great, my child is wonderful and healthy, and I don't even hate my job. Unfortunately, this also makes me feel guilty, as if I'm not allowed to be upset for no reason because other people have legitimate issues. 

I don't really have anyone to talk to about these sort of things. My friends all have their issues, and my family means well but wouldn't understand.

But right now TF is going over the line.

&amp;#x200B;

Every so often, she feels like she needs to have outbursts where she takes out her negativity on others.

EX: Me: *Bumps into her on accident ""*Oh sorry"" TF: ""It's okay, I mean I already hurt myself so It's not that bad.""

I'm sorry, but this doesn't feel like a healthy way to reach out to other people. She feels the need to be oversensitive about things such as when the whole Momo gag was going around. I was telling her about how bad it was and she suddenly goes: ""Don't talk about that kind of stuff to me! My sister tried to kill herself!"" (basically r/nobodyasked crap)

&amp;#x200B;

So today I got sent home because I vomited after eating expired food and had to take time to rest. WELL, in the class before I got sent home, the pain was so unbearable that I ended up snapping a pencil due to pressure. So she goes: ""What did you do that for? For attention?"" So, as one might expect, I get angry because I'm in literal pain and she is accusing ME of trying to get attention even though afterwords when I'm not talking to TF and trying to get my work done she goes on a rant about how I'm overreacting and that I'm mad at her.

&amp;#x200B;

So I just say, ""I just can't believe you accused me of snapping my pencil for attention."" Then she acts like I just threatened to hurt her or something and fires back acting all accused: ""Jeeze! It was just a JOKE!"". At this point if I open my mouth I'm going to vomit and so I just focus on the two most important things: getting my work done and breathing properly. So, TF goes on a rant which looking back is just really attention seeking and making things about her. She going on about how ""she has no friends"" and how ""I'm mad at her"" and all that type of stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

As expected, the pain becomes to much to bear to I ask the teacher to use the bathroom and go vomit up some hellspawn and head to the school nurse. I felt better after walking out of the bathroom but I just wanted to make sure. Long story short: got sent home. cool? cool. Until my sister comes home telling me how TF was talking to others how I faked being sick. Is this son of a female dog fr? 

&amp;#x200B;

This person is my best friend but she is beginning to dump too much of her emotional garbage my way and I need the energy to help myself through mental issues. I can't imagine life without her but I can't waste my life away being there for he insecurities and hardships. I'm not a therapist even though I try to be and my health isn't going to be able to do the wash rinse repeat cycle. I have to take care of myself at the end of the day or before I know it, I'm won't even know who I am because most of my life was spent taking care of another person.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know what to do besides just telling her of the negative impact she is having on my life.",09Apr2019,2
777,"So my neighbors are unbearably loud. Their TV and music is so loud that it I can feel it in my floor. I’m a college student and it’s affecting my grades.

My last neighbors did the same thing, only they did it until 2am. I told my landlord and, after a court battle, he evicted them. I feel I can’t go to him with these new neighbors because he won’t take me seriously.

I’ve asked these people FIVE TIMES in the past four days to keep it down. I can’t focus, and when I’m watching TV, it’s louder than mine. I understand that hearing your neighbors is inevitable, but this is excessive.

780,"In 2015 I got diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. For a while I had felt pain in my head, and after a few weeks we went to get my brain checked out.

When the scans came back, we found out I had a tumor in the right cortex of my brain. It was still developing so the doctors thought that they could remove the tumor. I’ve been in and out of the hospital over the past 4 years, I’ve probably done maybe 100 scans and I’ve been on a large amount of meds for 3 years. Yesterday, we went back to the hospital and did an MRI.

There was bad news. Even though the doctors thought it would go into remission, it had gotten worse and they told me it was terminal.

So thank you teens, for helping get through this. The happiest moment on this sub was when in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.

How can I tell my loved ones that my cancer is terminal?",09Apr2019,2
781,"I haven't been in her life much at all, she was honestly a problem child which made me dislike her and distance myself. Her dad abandoned her, her mother abandoned her, she's just living with my mom and dad, my mom yells at her all the time, my dad doesn't even look at her, AND her being bullied at school was the cherry on top.

Even though her and I haven't spoken much, I haven't been there at all for her, I did hear her say she wanted to kill herself over kids help phone. This girl isn't even 14 yet. My mom heard too and has started to be sweet with her, and I'm going to try to keep my mom in check as well, as my mom does go off a lot, as she's approaching her 70s and she has a bit of a temper like my dad.

I just feel really bugged that little girls at school are bullying her and I want to do something about it. A lot of my family has gone in and talked to the principal, but he hasn't done anything. I heard of a biker gang that dropped a bullied kid off at school or something like that, which was nice. I was thinking of going with a group of my guy friends, we're all muscular, some of us tatted, maybe just our presence dropping her off and picking her up could do something.

782,"Posting this on a throwaway, this was written on mobile so sorry for any typos.

So basically I was looking for something quick to eat, &amp; I remember the time me and my friend had mayonnaise sandwiches cause he had nothing at his house. So I was like, hmm, they weren't that bad and they're quick to make so why not. 

So I made it and I was walking back to my room, and my dad asked what it was. I told him &amp; then I instantly thought ""oh sh*t"". 

I then remembered my mother telling me the story about when he was younger his mom would lock him in the basement, and him and his brother had to sneak upstairs and that's all they could really eat, so his brother would make those. 

After I told him what it was I realized what I did &amp; he instantly looked so sad and just walked away, the entire room just had such a depressing feeling in it. 

Now he's on the couch sleeping. I feel so bad cause I'm sure I brought up some bad childhood memories of that. He forever hates mayonnaise.

791,"I’m a F[18] About 2 months ago I moved in with my Biological Dad [BD] and his wife [W] whom speak primarily Spanish but know some English, since I moved across the country because of school(Can’t afford housing lol). They have two kids a 6month old girl [6MO]and a 3 year old[3YO] boy. Within the first week of living there I noticed the 3YO was not... “normal” and out of respect I didn’t want to ask about it in case maybe they were sensitive about the subject, but he definitely wasn’t as a 3YO should be. So just only DAYS pass and I’m almost certain he has some sort of developmental delay. I didn’t make this judgement lightly as I have another 12YO brother(Lives with my Bio-Mom) whom is on the autism spectrum and at his age exhibited almost the SAME EXACT behaviors. 3YO doesn’t talk a lot and when he does he doesn’t necessarily do it on his own. He Echos what others say and connects the dots but only for repetitive behaviors i.e: Asking for juice, asking for the tablet/phone. And his most favorite word is no. When 3YO gets upset he’s hysterical and is self abusive sometimes. Example: throwing himself on the ground or running into things on purpose. It’s troubling to see considering, I only recently found out that my BD and the Wife are aware that he needs speech therapy, and he will be going to specialized schooling. But all things considered they make *no effort* on their part to help or fix these behaviors. They don’t read to him, they don’t even talk to him that much. He’s always eyes locked into his tablet watching YouTube. I try to interact with him but he just shakes his head and runs away. He has no social skills, he does the thing where he makes grunts and noises and just runs away from the mother sometimes when she talks, he drinks A TON of juice everyday, and an extremely picky eater (Granted he has many allergies). Then, the 6MO is a big concern for me too. When the wife is busy doing whatever, she usually just leaves the baby in a bouncer that’s not even plugged in it’s just the bouncer.. and leaves her in front of the tv. She’s a really fussy baby, and cries a good portion of the day. Not to mention she’s a premature so she already is behind in certain milestones. I’m worried that she’s gonna end up worse if not the same as the 3YO and I want to interact with her but, I’d be afraid I’d be pissing off the wife trying to play, and interact with her baby and all of a sudden the 6MO starts crying or something. I have ample experience with children/little babies. One of my best friends had a baby and i had the honor of being in the delivery room and i helped raise her baby for months before I moved diaper changing and all. I’ve babysitted over the years for neighbors and stuff so I’m not new to the whole taking care of children experience. But the wife thinks pretty much thinks she’s doing nothing wrong and that only trained professionals should babysit.

798,"Hi my girlfriend has recently been feeling a lot of frustration with her family and I just don't know what to tell her to help her out, as I'm kind of bothered myself by what is happening. I feel a bit of it is jealousy but she feels kind of shafted.

The situation is revolving around her brother and her parents. Her brother is in the process of buying his first home with his girlfriend. They've been together for a few years now, and he's making a very good living for himself (around $30/HR with benefits) and his girlfriend works the occasional shift at a minimum wage job.

They've been renting an apartment for awhile and were spurred to start looking at houses by the fact that myself and the girlfriend just bought our house last year and they just decided they want to do the same, which is great for them. With the fact that her brother makes a decent living and has had this job for about 2 years you would think he would have a bit saved.... Well not so much. In fact he has $200 saved.

And here comes the situation. So my girlfriends parents have decided to pay for the down payment, lawyer fees, etc to help out their son in buying a house and this has upset us both as when it came to us we had no help from either of our parents financially and when it came to moving in only my family had helped. This is also with the fact that when we bought our house we managed to do it with only the money I had from a part time job at the time (granted I make $21/hr) and she was in school.

To add onto this we feel kind of bad for her parents because her brother likes to live a life more than he can afford and so he's decided to by a house close to $200,000 (a lot for our area) and they aren't going to be paying any of those initial costs themselves.

I guess in the scheme of things it is her parents money to spend, but she feels upset that her brother is getting all of this and she feels he doesn't deserve it. And I find it hard to console her as I'm in the same boat.

Any advice to help her and I come to terms with our frustration and jealousy would be appreciated.

I decided to go out today to the gym after spending the whole day in working and feeling restless. So at around 7pm I drove over and on a corner out of nowhere after a 70mph dual carriageway onto an unmarked road, a Police speed van appears. I quickly check my dashboard like I routinely do - 33mph in a 30. Shit. This is a nightmare.

My anxiety has been bad for several hours since. 3 years ago I received a speeding fine, the cops pulled me out of my car and threw me into a back of a police car and locked me in. They got in and told me I had been going 36mph in a 30. I protested because I did truthfully watch my speed as I entered the road, and they boasted how they caught 15 people in the last 30 minutes that were randomly selected. I felt sick. I felt trapped. I've been paranoid driving ever since.

And 2 months before I am due to emigrate and I have little to no money it happens again today. But this time it's a large fine and 3 points on my license. Right before my car insurance is due next week for renewal which I can barely afford.

800,"(The following was cross-posted to /r/legaladvice/ so I'm just pasting it here to save time. I've got an addition coming at the end.)

Some context! I am in NJ, USA. From 2013-2016 I worked at a very small business. It was a decently successful screen-printing and embroidery shop that we will call ABC. I loved the job and I was close with my boss who we'll call Rick. I launched an Etsy page where I sold t-shirts. Rick and I split the profits 50/50 and it was a lot of fun. We made some extra money and we learned a lot about online sales. He helped me with ideas and we worked together to get shipping costs lowered, we celebrated every sale. It was, all in all, a positive experience. 

Fast toward to now. I've been working at a larger screen-printing business for about a month. We'll call it XYZ. When I interviewed at XYZ, one of the owners (we'll call him John) mentioned starting up an Etsy and the fact that I would get a %. He was on my ass about getting the Etsy started but would not help me in any way. He wouldn't print sample shirts, wouldn't order stock, wouldn't sit down with me to input shipping information or bank/credit card info. His wife (the other owner, we'll call her Jessica) is also pretty consistently on my case about things relating to Etsy. When I ask them questions pertaining to the online store, they have no interest. In addition to the Etsy, it's a typical walk-in, word-of-mouth local business so most of my day is spent doing the normal stuff -- answering phone calls, taking orders, making art for those orders, etc. We had a small fire in the workshop that slowed down the day-to-day orders and production and I used that time to really set up the Etsy page. And in the first two days, I sold a dozen t-shirts. Pretty cool since they were all 100% my designs and I'd spent an entire week (at night, after work) doing market research and making polls and figuring out pricing and ideas for new designs and finding new ways to advertise, networking, things like that.

Yesterday, before starting production on those 12 orders, I approached John and said, ""Hey, before we continue with Etsy, we should talk about how we're going to split up the money, what my percentage is going to be, how we're going to calculate costs, things like that.""

His exact words were, ""If you come to me with this attitude, you're not going to get anywhere."" That SOUNDS really odd but this guy is a little unhinged. He is constantly screaming. I took video on my phone to show my girlfriend an you can hear him screaming himself hoarse at a customer two rooms over, behind two closed doors. Earlier yesterday, he screamed in my face about a shipping error that was ultimately his own fault. (More on this later)

Obviously I was perplexed and so I mentioned that at my last job, Rick and I split the profits. But John insists that Etsy is part of my hourly wage. I told him that the majority of my work for Etsy is done off-the-clock and he simply said, ""Don't do it off-the-clock then."" I tried to explain but he cut me off and said that HE pays for the machines and HE pays the rent so unless I also start paying for those things, I will not be receiving anything from Etsy. When I tried to ask more about that, he told me to follow him into Jessica's office. He shouted something at her in Russian, then there was a pause and she said (translated) ""He says you want to be partners?""

It was all EXTREMELY confrontational and unprofessional and it made me realize that I DO NOT WANT TO WORK FOR THESE PEOPLE. They don't actually give a shit about the Etsy but for me, this is my baby. I have done a lot of work on it. All the designs are 100% mine. I made them on MY paid Photoshop subscription (because they would not purchase their own) using MY own Photoshop resources. Yes, some of them were worked on using the work computer but does that make them their property?

I want to leave this business entirely and take my designs back to Rick where I know he will sell them properly (there's a serious quality control issue at XYZ and shirts are going out to paying customers that look terrible) but I am confused about whether or not this art is legally mine. They seem to think that everything having to do with the Etsy is inherently theirs (hence the pocketing of the profits and the laughing in my face about it.) Is it still mine? Am I free to remove my designs from Etsy, leave XYZ and sell these shirts with Rick?

TL:DR: Part of my new job was supposed to include an Etsy store AND a commission but now that my bosses are making money off my designs, they're refusing me that commission. Are my designs (made on my Photoshop with my resources but sometimes on the work computer) my property? Can I take them down, leave the company and sell them elsewhere? Or do they have a legal claim to them?)

ADDITIONALLY there are other weird red flags. Jessica does payroll and will not give us pay stubs. She required a copy of my SS card in order to pay me (maybe this isn't a red flag but I've had several jobs and none ever asked for this.) They keep talking in hypotheticals and very vague empty statements and refuse to give me concrete numbers about anything (like as the conversation went on and they said they COULD give me money if I start selling ""thousands"" of shirts, they'd just say ""If you take care of us, we'll take care of you. We'll just give you a bonus later, we'll just give it to you later.""

I can't quit tomorrow like I want to because I don't have another job on retainer yet, and I can't sit down with Rick until Thursday but I'm already worried about HOW I would quit. They mentioned yesterday that if I wanted to ""up and move to South Carolina"" that I'd have to tell them first and I'd have to stay until they found someone AND that I'd have to train them (which seems weird since I'm a new employee). I don't want to put in my two weeks. They've been rude to me from day 1 and they're actively screwing me out if revenue. He is a powder keg, randomly bellowing at everyone, yelling himself hoarse at customers. He's a big guy. I really don't want him screaming in my face and treating me like shit for two weeks. I want to just leave a note on my desk and never come back.

But I'm here to ask you, Reddit, what would you do?",09Apr2019,2

We're not dating and we were only sorta good friends before this. it's clearly a joke I think, bc if it wasn't, i feel she'd be more insecure to go to such an extent especially when we're friends. 

I can't tell if it's a joke making fun of me, it's a joke with me, or not a joke at all. It's definitely a joke, but i just don't get her. I know this all sounds cringy and out of touch and awkward which is why I'm posting on a throwaway",09Apr2019,1

805,"Just for background.  My mom is one of 6 and my grandparents live a plane ride away.  My mom has been feuding with 4/5 siblings and refuses to acknowledge that my grandparents are still alive.   My mom is also a plane ride away from me and instead of going to see her (I was there in October), I chose to see my 93 y/o grandparents for the first time in 5 years.  Some of my aunts and uncles were also there and now my mom thinks I’ve betrayed her and wants nothing to do with me.  Am I in the wrong for going to see my grandparents?

810,"I'm a junior in college on the cheer squad for the after trying to get on this team since I was a senior in HS. Just for background information: cheer has stunting where there are 3 main positions: base, back, flyer. Bases have to be the same height to effectively put a flyer (has to be light person and short) with the help of a back (the tallest person). I'm short (5'0) and... thicc (153?) as the kids these days say.  So I have the strength of a base but the height of a flyer. This past season I got left out a lot because of my height/weight combination. I used to be 174 lbs but worked on it. In order to be the ideal weight for my health and the cheer squad I'd have to get down to 127 (at least) and I'm scared I won't achieve that goal before the start of next season (early September). Do I just work on weight loss without putting this insane pressure on myself and quit? Or should I stay and possibly risk another year of being left out?",09Apr2019,1

About us/the wedding:

 \- Both pro wrestlers and into action films, stunts, swordfighting, adventure.

 \- Reception has a 007 vibe (not really a theme, but it's inspired by Bond).

 \- He's funny, down to earth, a little shy, and tough as nails.

 \- We're both homebodies... no bars/clubs for us on the weekend!

 \- We met in a wrestling ring and run a pro wrestling company together.

 \- We've both been though some tough stuff together (severe injuries, family deaths)

 \- We're looking for a song that's not overdone (so no Ed Sheeran please lol) and maybe a little unconventional. Uptempo songs are always an option!

 \- That said, we don't want it to be a joke.

 \- We had originally considered ""Sway"" or ""I Get A Kick Outta You"" sung by Buble (because of his jazzy romantic style) but we aren't sure.

Any suggestions would be great. Thanks!",09Apr2019,1

At the start of my new mindset I thought that making eye contact was something you were supposed to do, so I stared in my teachers eyes all class while they taught. That earned me a reputation very quickly and to this day my teachers take constant glares when I’m looking near them to make sure I’m not staring. Today I realized I still do it, and when I tried to cope with it by looking at random things around me people say I “look like I don’t know where I’m going”.

I found out she has a boyfriend, yet still decided to ask her to get coffee, explaining I’m cool with friends..

She replied enthusiastically about meeting up, which was surprising to me.

We’re both in our 30’s, and I am a male..
and of course she is attractive, yet I’m guarded and don’t date around...
is it possible for this to be a meaningful friendship?  

If a true friendship is all that transpires, then great... and if at some point we become a couple, then that’s great too.

821,"I've been thinking about this due to my ex...

My ex was sexually manipulative and emotionally abusive, he refused to acknowledge when he did things that upset me. In the end he started trying to convince me I was doing/saying things I wasn't, when I'd not apologize he claimed I was suffering memory loss so just didn't remember the horrible things he was accusing me of. 

I know this was him fucking with my head, but I had to consider 'what if?' - I had to listen to him, it's no good my being upset with him for refusing to see what he was doing to hurt me if I don't consider what he was claiming I was doing too. 

What gets me is that he still seems to believe he did nothing wrong, that I was the bad guy. 

This isn't really about him, just showing my train of thought on this question. It makes me wonder how you know you're not an asshole, when people can convince themselves they did nothing wrong then how do you know you're not guilty of doing the same?",09Apr2019,1
822,"I was recently unemployed from a long term job (8 years) so i went on unemployment welfare here in Australia, i was forced to take any job that was apparently suitable under the government rules or lose my payment, which i understand. 

Well they put me with a job provider who placed me into a job with a company that needed a lot of people and go through a lot of workers.  The job role was apparently something i had some experience in.
Fast forward a month, everyday ive been here i have experienced some sort of verbal abuse from the supervisor, its always my fault and never the machines fault which breaks or jams on the regular. If he is stressed he takes it out on me or another employee.

 im not doing anything related to the job i had been told i was going to be doing and accepted to do before employment, i feel like i was hired under one thing but he really only wanted another shitkicker not a skilled person. Feel like i was tricked into taking the position.

Today i had enough and i confronted him about the multiple problems i had with him and my job and it lead to him throwing his weight around etc. Pretty much saying i can never come back and my unemployment case manager will know about it, which could make it harder for me to go back on unemployment payments. 

So i just walked out and now stressing over having to deal with unemployment office again  as they punish you for quitting suitable employment by not allowing you back on payments for a month... I couldn't talk to anyone higher as he has been at this big company a long time and it will fall on deaf ears and i really dont want to work something out and stay there. 

 I feel like im the one being made to look at fault...

Did i make a mistake of walking before finding other employment?  Or quitting over this issue?",09Apr2019,1
823,"I don't usually put myself out on the internet  like this but I'm willing to hear anyone out at this point.

I (21M) have been having a rough couple of months. Probably the hardest thing I have had to deal with though is breaking up with my girlfriend. We only dated for a few months but things seemed very perfect between us. We only broke up because she decided that she'd rather focus on school and work rather than have a relationship. This made me really upset because it felt as if we had the components for a great relationship but our timing was off. We broke up. I grieved. I think I'm over it.

&amp;#x200B;

That was a bit of a backstory and now on to what I really need advice on. For the past 2 years I've been working really hard at my community college so that I could get into a good University. All of my hard work and late night studying has finally paid off because I've been accepted into every University that I've applied for. 

Now I come from a pretty stereotypical Asian family where it is almost unacceptable to be anything but a lawyer, doctor or engineer. For every college that I applied to in state, I applied as a Chemistry Major. However, this wasn't good enough for my mom. So in order to satisfy her I applied to an out of state University as a Chemical Engineer(this was the degree I was originally working towards) just to get my mother off my back. I somehow got accepted. When I told my mom she was so happy for me. We went out to a fancy dinner and got drinks to 'celebrate' and everything. At the end of the night I told my mom I wasn't sure if that's where I wanted to go and she got very upset. Not at me but just in general. Every time I see her now she just talks about how successful I'm going to be when I become an engineer and how much money I'm going to make. When I try to talk to her about how I feel about the situation and about my ex-girlfriend she just says that ""I'm worrying her."" This makes me feel like crap every time I hear her say that. I don't want to worry anyone and her saying that makes me feel like I'm not allowed to have feelings. Part of me feels like she was happy to hear that me and my girlfriend broke up because now there's nothing keeping me here in state. 

I've tried talking to my dad about things but he's your typical 'I'm a man and we don't talk about our feelings.' When I told him about me and my girlfriend breaking up all he said was ""There'll be many more."" Like I get the life lesson but I was reaching out because I was in pain not because I wanted to hear his 'grand wisdom'. 

I've been doing a lot of thinking that has done more help than good. Like do I even want this degree? Did I even want to go to college in the first place? Am I just the product of someone else's design (aka my mother)? I've never felt so powerless and unhappy before. The weight of everything feels like it's crushing me and makes it hard to breath sometimes. Things that should make me happy make feel terrible. I'm a huge superhero/comic book fan and when tickets dropped for Avengers: Endgame I immediately purchased two tickets for 3D IMAX showing on opening night. Right after purchasing the tickets, rather than feeling excited I felt so bad.  Everything I do makes me so unhappy and I feel like I'm avoiding my family like the plague. The only reason I go home right now is because I need a place to sleep. I haven't spoken to either one of my parents in days. It feels like I have multiple decisions but rather than being happy that I get to go to a University I'm just picking the lesser of two evils. No matter what I pick if feels like I'll be unhappy. It feels like I'm drowning. 

Sorry if this is all over the place and sounds more like a vent. I kinda just threw my thoughts onto the keyboard. I don't have anyone to talk to about this and I would really appreciate anyone's two cents on my problems. Sorry if it just sounds like a upper-middle class kid complaining about his 'hard' life.

830,"You never in life could have convinced me that this would actually happen, let alone happen to me. But. It’s happening. 

I met my life partner 5 years ago. Back then, he was in a relationship, and 6 months before he married her, she busted him having inappropriate conversation with a specific woman from a specific game, on his cell phone. You may have heard of it. Game of War. (Insert eye roll here). At the time, I was just an acquaintance to the both of them, and instinctively thought “well, if he feels the need to have in depth conversation with a woman online, there must be something missing from their relationship”. In life, I find people who aren’t fulfilled in their relationships do seek them out online. 

Tricks on me, kids. Fast forward 5 years later, and I am a early 40’s, seasoned in life, and convinced I’ve been with my life partner for two years now. The first year was amazing. Fun. Laughs. Games. Drinks. Daily sex. You name it, it was IT! Now, onto the second year. 

He hardly drinks with me. He hardly touches me. His phone is never out anymore. When he thinks I’m asleep, and I come downstairs, he jumps up and shoves his phone in his pocket saying “I was JUST coming to bed” (insert ANOTHER eye roll). It’s becoming the same song and dance. I’ve confronted him a number of times. He has lied. I have went through his phone and saw it all and he has lied. I know I know, everyone is like “girl stop. Why are you still in this relationship!”

I could say that he’s actually a great guy and then you can eye roll at me. But it’s true. He works. He takes care of his kids. He shows me attention (though not as much as he used too). And let me be frank. I’m just getting to that age where I am like, do I just deal with this? Or do I walk away? 80% of life with him is decent. Not good. But decent. And let’s be honest, decent can be hard to find. 

Spring break was a big family trip across the country. In the middle of the night I caught him AGAIN, on that stupid ass game he keeps removing and re-adding to his stupid ass phone. ON VACATION. And lied about it. Again. A game. A GAME. How can that be more important than real life?? He cannot go more than a week without re-adding the app to his phone. 

I’m tired of competing with a cell phone. And every time he hides it, I respect him a little less and love him even more less. 

Over a game. Are you fucking kidding me. 

For shits and giggles, google “game of war addiction”. It’s very real. And I don’t even know how to deal with such an issue!",09Apr2019,1
