0,"So about 3 weeks ago my girlfriend broke up with me. We both have pretty bad anxiety and I’ve learned to control mine in CBT. However, she never did control hers. The more the relationship went on, the more of a horrible girlfriend she became (note that I’m in high school and share classes with them so I can’t simply avoid them). Anyways before our relationship ended, the transparency went away. She made me miserable every day, and she would only filter anything negative. She refused my care and anytime she felt like something was wrong, she never said anything. Whenever I tried asking, she would say she’s fine, but then yell at me 1 hour later saying it is my fault for everything in her life when I’ve done nothing. She constantly tried fighting with me because I never get to see her and the times I do, it’s for one minute before she abandoned me for her friends and say, “We spent a lot of time together! You’re just a horrible boyfriend!” Then things with her friends got bad. Before the relationship, they hated me. They were envious of us and always tried to ruin it. They would constantly shout at her telling her to break up with me, and me and my friends could hear it from across the hall. And guess who was talked to about the actions of her friends? You guessed it me! I tried sitting down to talk to her about all of this, and she just ignored me and said the actions of her friends is my fault.

Anyways I go to talk to my councilor and she told me she is buying into this idea of fear from her friends. The next day she broke up with me. I was free sure, but I still cared for her. During our relationship, I tried calming her every day, and all I got was shit from her. That’s all I got. A month before the relationship ended, I started having thoughts of harming myself. I tried once. I came clean about all of this to my family after the relationship ended so they could know the magnitude of what happened and what my girlfriend put me through. Here I am now with the care I needed and the necessary therapy. I’ve come out alright. Somewhat. Every day, I have my ex girlfriend and all of her friends calling me abusive, and telling people I’m abusive, when the worst thing I did was try defending myself when my girlfriend said things to me and say that everything in her life is my fault. What should I do? I’m trying to let it slide off, but it just won’t go away knowing that I keep getting called abusive.",18Mar2019,2
1,"Hello all, 

First time posting here so thanks in advance for any advice and sorry if this gets long! 

So I have been working in the banking world for little over a year now, in 2nd mortgages at a bigger credit union in my home state. I unfortunelty do not have a college degree in finance or business (interested in going back to school though) and like mentioned I do not have 5+ years under my belt. But by the end of the year I might have the opportunity to relocate to another state ( fiance wants to take an internship in another state, and they often lead to job offers.) So I might be in the position of having to reevaluate/transition my career path.
 
So I'd love to know what kind of lucrative, engaging, in demand or pretty cushiony careers might be out there for someone with some experience and interest in the banking,finance,or buisness world. Or what I can expect as far as it's go without any kind of higher education in the finance world.  I've always found this envioriment really interesting and seams to be a good path for stability ( at least as far as working for a bank goes) 


Ik that's pretty general and probably my depends on alot of variables ( like location ) but she's got handful of offers from various states so unfortunelty  I don't really know where'd Id end up. 

Thanks!

2,"I usually wouldn't expose my problems in a public place like this but I'm in a lot of pain and need advice.
To start off with a week ago my friend shot himself in the head, and then the day after my dad was diagnosed with cancer. I was living with my girlfriend and her parents for the past 3 years, we'd been together for 6 years and engaged for 5. We had relationship issues along the road and many things happened to that hurt me and caused me to bottle things up and it killed the communication in our relationship as well as causing me to become so distant I rarely showed her my love. Apparently she lost her love for me and started to only love me platonically for the past year and kept setting dates to break up with me but never did because I was in the process of getting stuff done for myself like going to school and getting counseling for my depression and she didn't want to leave me before I had some stability and things accomplished but she chose to break up with me a few days after I found out my dad has cancer and said it was because she couldn't keep putting it off. That hurt me really bad and made me cry like a baby even though I'm 22 years old. I got really depressed and didn't know what to do so I went to go see my dad, I don't do drugs and hadn't touched weed in 5 years but because I was feeling so stressed I decided to smoke with my dad. I also had a beer that was frozen. Everything was normal for a bit and then it was like I fell asleep but started sleep walking (I hadn't slept or ate in 2 days) I started hallucinating and was totally not conscious, I only remember bits and pieces but what I do remember is shit like thinking there was a government agency out to kill me. I started speaking complete nonsense incoherently and scared my dad so he took me home to my now ex gfs. Apparently in the car I thought that my phone and drawing tablet were attached to me physically and we're basically like an external heart that if destroyed would kill me. I also was talking about how we only existed in a state of driving in that car and there was nothing before or after and I had to break out and die, so I busted out the window in my dad's car with my fist and threw out my tablet and phone on the highway. I've been told I just spoke more nonsense and kept hallucinating objects in my hands all the way there but don't remember much. I showed up to the house and my dad left as soon as I was out. I came inside and started speaking nonsense to my gfs dad and thought things like he was blind and also that I had no idea who he was and I must have broken into someone's house, at some point I'm told I grabbed him by the neck but I don't remember that I just remember coming to at a hospital surrounded by cops and I was hallucinating them telling me I had killed my gf. The cops could tell I was super high because my pupils we're giant and it was obvious by my nonsensical questions and statements but after they tested my blood it didn't come up with weed or anything so the cops told me I must have been smoking k2 and that it makes sense because it can make you trip if it's sprayed with some shit idr. Anyway I was taken to jail and my ex gfs parents got a no contact order on me and she refused to answer my calls after I told her what had happened that lead up to this. She didn't believe me and has told people I did it because I'm crazy even though I have no legal history and I've never been violent or crazy. My dad bailed me out and my trial is on Tuesday.
I have no idea what to do. I've known nothing besides her for the past 6 years and I love her and her family so fucking much. It hurts to think that they believe that was me and I meant to hurt them. I care more about their perception of me than I do about going to prison or getting a felony, and I've been trying to go to school to be a bail bondsmen and fugitive recovery agent so a felony will ruin all of that.
Thank you if you have taken the time to read this. What should I do? And what do you think was going on when this happened? Was it a bad trip from k2 or do you have another explanation?",18Mar2019,1

7,"I have a female friend (I am male) who I suspect has been upset or sad about something. She is a more reserved person, I've noticed for a month or so that she will occasionally seem a little down or quieter than usual, sometimes even silent until spoken to. I've casually mentioned it a few times and she just says that she is tired. She deffinatily has reasons to be tired as we seniors in high school, but it just seems a little off to me, especially since I have gone through things like that. I don't really know if whatever is bothering her, if there is anything, is something that she wants to talk about. I know that I wanted to talk about my problems, but would be be afraid to, and I would only lightly hint to my friends that something was off. I feel like if something is wrong. She is trying to hide it much more than I did. Im worried that if I confront her about it she may become even more upset or start distancing herself.

8,"Heads up I am using mobile so I apologize in advance. 

So I have a job opportunity in another city, about an hour away from where I live. I do not have a car and would have to take an Amtrak twice a week every week. I would have a place to stay and the job pays more than my current job. My predicament would be I'd like to move to this city so I can go back and forth to work with ease. My current living situation I pay $750 for a room in a shared living space, I'd have to opt out of my lease early and possibly pay a $3000 fine as well. The other issues that arise with the moving situation would be I'd be staying with another person who has 6 kids and I'd have no privacy (I'd find a apartment asap) but its temporary. I'd have to switch counselors which isnt a huge issue. But I think that is it. The job is within my field and pays decent, more than what I am being paid now and with what I'd be paid i could get a newer car and a place of my own more than likely within 2 months. 

I just need some advice on whether I should go out on a limb and do this or stay and miss out on a opportunity?

On the first sessions, she had told me that if I cancelled more then 3 times, we would discuss if I should continue the treatment. I told her I understood and that I would call her in advance if something came up. I cancelled once when I was sick, she cancelled a week after because she was sick and then we finally had an appointment. We had scheduled an appointment for 2 weeks ahead, but I had a family emergency and had to cancel. She never called me back to follow up or reached out to me.

Okay so on Wednesday I went to the doctors (everything was working fine down there) and I had low blood pressure for my age. I freaked out a lot and started stressing out a lot (also have hairloss so i was just depressed and stressed). After coutless researching info, my lower stomach started to ache (right above my dick).

The pain persisted for a day, then it went away, then it came back the next day but was very minimal, then it subsided (and i dont have any pain currently). I decied to fap to see if everything was normal, the stimulation and ejaculation was normal and the feeling was great! However I had very minimal pain when rubbing my dick at first, it felt like it was stinging. This subsided as i went to fully erect. 

After that I decided to take Tylenol just in case and to not to fap for a day, the next today aka today, I fapped. I had no pain down there or anything, ejaculation was still normal, but after fapping the tip was very sensitive it was weird. It felt like it was stinging whenever the tip touched something. It's not moderate or severe but minor and it's just weird.

When I pee, i have no pain, when i ejaculate i have no pain, nothing hurts down there. I never had sex and the only lifestyle thing i changed was my diet. 

Any advice on this? I just hope everything subsides. I'm still taking Tyneol for the pain thing and my arms kinda ache regardless.",18Mar2019,0

22,"Good evening. I am currently 15 years old and a dumbshit freshman in high school. I’ve never used reddit before so ignore my manners. 

When I was in seventh grade, it was the hardest year of my life. My parents were fighting daily and decided to split apart. My mom cried everyday and on a whim me, my older brother (OB), and my mom all moved to Missouri. That’s where my moms from. 

Obviously, this was.,,,, a huge decision. We got a small, shitty 3 bed 2 bath house and made it work. School was HELL. I was so absolutely depressed, 8th grade felt almost impossible at first. However, it got better. It always seems to work out even when you believe all odds are against you. I started really liking it. But everything reminded me of my home state, Georgia. I couldn’t stop thinking of the winter and how everything was dead but in Georgia it was warm and green and GREAT. Random backroads reminded me of evening car rides with OB. OB eventually moved out, also on a whim, during Christmas time, to Florida. Where my dad had moved. 

I would also like to mention my parents never legally divorced. They just.. kinda split. 

My mom asked me what I wanted to do when summer came around and I said with absolute certainty move back to Georgia. At that time I would have never imagined actually regretting that decision. But I kind of do..?

We moved back to Georgia in this cute little house that is an infinite improvement of our previous one. The only downside is that I’m in Georgia, but not going to the high school that all my middle and elementary school friends are attending. I’ve made friends at this school but I do miss my old friends. All I want is to just go to school with them. 

Remember how I said they didn’t divorce? Yeah well they wanted it to get better, so they met up in Florida and talked a bit last weekend. They want to move back in together. 

I think it’s also important to mention I fucking hate my dad. Actually, I take it back, I don’t.  But I wish I did. Because instead of hating him, I’m fucking terrified of him. He scares me so much. I don’t like being around him. 

He’s still my dad. Throughout this whole episode, he’s come over to my house and whatnot and seen me for a bit. Hanging out with him is okay until he’s upset. I don’t want to move back with him at all. 

Since my parents want to move back together, it brings up the question of where we want to move. Florida or Georgia? Now at first I thought well obviously Georgia lol?? Are you  stupid??
But,, my OB brought up a good point. I plan on going to college in California because my best friend in the entire world lives there and I’d give anything to go to school with her. But it’ll more than likely pan out that after I graduate, my parents will move to Florida and retire and chill out. Back to what OB said. If/when I come back home to them and say hey, I’ll just come back home to them. Not coming back home to any friends or any of that. Just my two parents. So it’s starting to seem as though Florida would be a good choice for school? What do you think? I really need help. 

TLDR : basically the last paragraph is all you need to know. :o)",18Mar2019,1
23,"Background ; for the last two years I've lived in an apartment complex with a roommate we'll call ""L"" and their 3 year old english bulldog.

The first year living together was fine, in the sense that he was being taken care of well (by me.) I stay home all day, so since L would be gone most of the day I would watch the dog. I had gotten the dog on a walking and feeding schedule, something he's never had before. The only issue was that I have high anxiety, especially when it comes to strangers. So walking him during the day was a struggle because he's very hyper. He has no social life besides interacting with my dogs, and he was never trained, so when he sees anything that moves he flips out. He's 70lbs of pure muscle and he will not give up. There has been plenty of times I have been hurt trying to control him. So because of this, if L was home I wouldn't walk him, which seems obvious but L would come home, not walk him and leave again. So I got into the habit of asking L before they would leave if they walked the dog, or fed the dog. Most of the time the answer was no, can you do it? But after a year L snapped at me about how hes not my dog and to stop asking them if they take care of the dog.

After that, L kept the dog away from me. If I was around or if L had to leave the apartment, the dog was locked in his crate and left in the bedroom until L returned. L never changed their schedule though, they would leave him crated most of the day. I would secretly walk him because I would hear him crying in the room. Suddenly the dog became ""allergic"" to my dogs, so he wasn't allowed around them either, and he was switched to a strict ""diet"" to help. Not taken to the vet for his allergy shot (which was seasonal, not my pets), but instead treated with internet remedies. Not only is his new diet not enough food, (I have no clue if he's getting all the right nutrients either) but L forgets to feed him so often! I feel like he's lost weight but I can't tell because I don't get to see him. When I do see him and he gets excited L gets annoyed and they take him away and crate him. It's gotten worse lately to the point where the dog is crated at night now. He's crated behind closed doors even when L is in the room with him. It's a large crate with plenty of room but he barely has any time out of the crate. I've started to notice pee stains on the carpet near the front door, as if his bladder is so full he can't hold it in while trying to get out the door. 

Talking to L is like talking to a wall. They don't see anything wrong with how the dog is treated. I so badly wish I could take the dog and leave but even if that was an option I couldn't afford him, and wouldn't be able to find a place to live with him. I want to call animal control on L but I'm worried that because of his breed and the way he reacts to people he'd be labeled aggressive and put down. He's a very sweet boy but he has bit someone before, the person themselves even said it was their fault, and that it was an accident - because the bite was a quick reaction to getting hurt. They yanked his leash the wrong way and the dog yelped and turned and bit the persons hand.

How can I help him and know he won't get put down?
Am I overreacting to what I believe is animal abuse and this isn't that bad?

So i am in my last semester of a 4 year program in university. I have an Hons. BA in Criminology and a double minor. One in Law, and one in Human Rights. 

I have a big interest in studying/ researching crime. Understanding why it happens and how to best prevent it. And one of the most common routes after graduation is becoming a cop as that is the usual expectation.

But i don't really want to be a cop. And every other option i see when looking up career options involve the lines of probation officer, correctional officer etc...

I dont know what the job field is really like after school, and was wondering if anyone had any advice on possible routes i could take or look into further. 

Is there any good paying jobs (besides criminologist which requires masters), that involves studying and researching crime or studying criminals that doesn't involve being a cop. I have considered being a lawyer but that requires further schooling after as well.

27,"My husband and I have been together for seven years, and since the very beginning, I just can’t get into sex.  We still do it like 3-5 times a week, but most of the time I’m just playing along.  It isn’t him. I’ve been like this with every partner I’ve ever been with.  Once we get started it’s mostly fine, occasionally even enjoyable, and I cum about 40-50% of the time.  

I’ve tried toys to no avail.  We’ve tried adding foreplay (boring and takes forever if I ever get in the mood at all).  We’ve tried getting rid of foreplay all together, in which case I NEVER got off and enjoyed it even less.  My husband is so eager to please and trying everything he can to help, but nothing seems to help.  

I was exposed to sex at a very young age through older cousins and parents not being around which led to a lot of experimentation by the time I was six or seven. I don’t think I was ever raped but definitely molested and shown porn since as early as I can remember.  Just about the only thing that turns me on is watching porn.  My husband and I are both believers that porn can be very detrimental to people so I’ve never told him this.  And I very rarely watch it because of that. I’ll go through months even years without it, then I’ll be on a week long bender of watching porn, masturbation,  and just attacking my husband at every turn.  He doesn’t understand then why sometimes I’m  having trouble becoming aroused and other times I’m super passionate which makes him think it’s him.  

If I could just watch porn occasionally and get in the mood, no problem, but it quickly becomes boring.  When I start down my normal weeklong porn binge I start with normal stuff, then within a day or so, it no longer works.  Then I have to watch more aggressive stuff and by the end of the week, if I’m not watching struggle porn or something that involves pseudo non consensual, aggressive sex, then I can’t get aroused.

He argued modify means to add onto an object, when I said modify has a more permanent connotation than accessorize which is more like adding something on. When proven wrong by the definition of modify (doesn't say anything regarding permanence), I said it has a different connotation. He yelled at me for using a smarty word, and I told him it was a middle-school level word. He said it had no basis in my argument, even though it was, ehem, modified onto my case. I asked him what the word connotation meant, and he did exactly what I thought he would do. 

""I know what it means! I just don't think it's apart of your argument and I don't have to tell you.""

 This tells me he doesn't know what it means and doesn't want to be proven wrong. He has a very hard time admitting he is wrong and will double down on anything. If I provide reasoning or provide factual evidence he either says the reasoning is wrong, the source is untrustworthy (even if its a dictionary), or he suddenly wants to stop talking. I struggle with it too as he has taught me admitting you were wrong is the worst thing to do.

Regarding the sock pop-filter, he said somehow putting a sock onto a microphone as a pop-filter (helps reduce the popping sound the mouth makes) will get micro-fibers into the mic and destroy it. How? Dust, spit, and moisture would certainly cause worse damage but it doesn't. I always see musicians put their mouth right on the mic, getting moisture into the mic. He said look it up and I found nothing. Nowhere does it say it is a bad thing to do this. Professionals only recommend using textiles as a cheap alternative to getting a pop filter. And that is what the google search had to say. But no, the youtuber with a home studio is an amateur and doesn't know what he's talking about, and the other sources were lying. He also didn't want to tell me what a pop-filter is, he alluded to it being a Windward though.

Today we argued a lot. We were driving to go somewhere and he turned the car around to go home. After I started throwing around the word abuse he started using it as well. Even though I'm the child and have been on the receiving end of yelling for numerous years, I'm the abuser. When we got home I went straight into the house and to the basement. He yelled at my mom, cursing heavily. After my mom retaliated as she did nothing, he went to his room and didn't come out. He is still up there, didn't come down to walk the dogs or make dinner as he was asked to do (My mother was at the movies).

So my dad has issues. I told you about his anger, borderline verbal abuse, inability to reason, unwillingness to admit defeat, surprising lack of knowledge of things he is yelling at me about, and pouting sessions. He also clearly has stress regarding being a bad father / husband (When was the last time I heard him say I love you to anyone? Did he ever say it?), short / long term memory issues, speech issues, bipolar / mood swings, knowledge issues, social interaction issues, and more I didn't go over. I don;t know if it matters, but physically he is overweight, has breathing issues, sleep issues, and mobility issues. It has been a month since I first recommended therapy for him. He said ""I promise I will look into it,"" after he tried and failed to reason. I hate my father and have told him multiple times to his face I do not like him (He tells me I am a jackass or mentally unwell).

So, is it a good idea to get him a therapist? if so what kind if any in particular should be pursued? Most importantly, how should I go about getting him one? Yelling at him to get one, or calmly telling him to get one, and having him promise he will get one all seem to not work. Thank you for your replies and if you chose to read all of that. Most of this is venting but it helps me out too.

TL;DR: My dad has some issues that may require a therapist. Should we get him one? How do we get him one? Is there a specific type of therapist we should look into?",18Mar2019,0
32,"Ok, where to start. 
So this is gonna b a question about love (aww), except not really... 
So there’s this girl I like (let’s just call her M) &amp; about a year and a half ago I talked to her on Snapchat (Sc) for about 2 weeks. I’m not the most extroverted person and many ppl my age are (2000-2005, dunno if I should give my real age or not) anyway, so we kind of hit it off, had a tiny bit of chemistry going. However, I was probably weird and messaged her about twice-a-day, she kinda ignored me, said she was going through a rough patch w/ her grandparents being ill or something. Now, i still don’t know today if she was just saying that coz she didn’t wanna talk, or for real. But she mentioned this about a week after we started talking. Anyway, because I didn’t (and still don’t really) know how to get a girl, I sent her some songs whose lyrics really resonated well w/ me (this is probably when I f**ked up). Also, to make matters worse, she put up a fake-deep post about rating her looks, to which I said “M, ur a 9/10. Body and soul” (she is very pretty), and I sent a topless pic asking what she thought of me (another mistake). Yeah sure, she said “9/10” but I feel like she was faking it for some reason (took her a while to respond as well). Eventually, I couldn’t take being ignored all the time (I wasn’t too obsessive, I just wanted to talk and get closer too her). So, what I did was send her a link to “Dancing on my own, by Callum Scott” and told her to listen to the lyrics carefully. Last thing I said was “I loved you” (i kno, cringe). I still feel that way today tho. 
Enough backstory, to present day, because of where we live and go to school, we cross paths at least once a week. But like I did before I talked to her, my heart sinks to my stomach every time &amp; I get butterflies. I’ve recently started to say “hi” and nod (guy thing). Even winked at her last week, heh heh. But I’ll always clean myself up and sort myself out to look as good as possible. I know roughly what time her train gets at the station I walk thru (I know it sounds creepy, ok). But I think I love her, but I’m probably in love with the idea of her (rather than what she actually is). She’s a rebellious, party girl, semi-basic b*tch type. But, I know there’s a spark of something special within her. I tried to lure it out, but I think she’s afraid of being called “a geek” (i.e someone who isn’t basic) by her friends, one of them being my long-time friend, R, who is a bit of a sl*t. But, M has been a constant thought in my mind, for a year and a half and I wonder if I should give it another shot. Because I have changed. I’m a lot more emotionally tougher than I was before. And I’m more of a liaison between, geeky memer &amp; cool kid. 
So the million dollar question IS...

SHOULD I START DATING M AGAIN OR NOT?!

I'm a student in one of the best universities in Brazil, but recently I'm feeling a little disgusted by all the academic bullshit that Brazilian science has become. I don't know how things are in your country, but here it just feels like everyone is competing with everyone for status and too sunken in their own academic world, this doesn't even feel like real life anymore. I was just supposed to go to university ever since I was a child, and that was kind of my dream, but now I'm just so frustrated that I want to leave everything and seek my own happiness elsewhere, I think this will be the best for my well being and sanity

I want to know a place, like ecovillages, that I can live a more quiet and nice life, planting my own food, collaborating with other people to make a living. But I also want that place to have some internet connection, and my own space to study and read the books I want, not the ones I'm obligated by the academic life. I want a place where I can make some art craft, and live near a waterfall if possible. Can I get all of this in ecovillages? Or there's some other type of community like this that accepts new people? Doesn't have to be in Brazil, but I need a place I can work to live there, or work for money to survive and buy me books and stuff.

Hi,

So, I'm not sure where to start with this exactly, but I wanted to ask you some questions because I've never been in a relationship before and am not sure if this is normal or not.

So, to make a long story short, I met this girl on Tinder a few months ago. We've been official for about a month or so (I explicitly said are we bf and gf and she said yes). She seems to like me well enough - always says she misses me, etc.

I'm on spring break from college right now, and I was gonna go home for break, but she was like omg I wanna spend so much time with you, so I'm like okay that'd be more fun than going home. She's not big on texting that much (sometimes she randomly won't answer for a day or so), but anyway, we hung for a little bit a few days ago. She made it clear that she was gonna come back to my place in a few days, like she explicitly said that basically, also left a few clothes (idk if that's a way of being like oh I'm gonna come back). Anyway, fast forward a few days and she hasn't answered any of my texts, and even posted a picture of her with some other mans (I think he is gay, not 100% sure but she has a shit ton of guy gay friends) at dinner.

Is this normal? I don't really know because I've never dated anyone. What should I do? Just wait for her to answer?

Or am I way overreacting and is everything normal? I really like her, don't wanna mess anything up, so was just looking for some advice. Or am I too involved or what?

45,"So I'm a 20 year old college student who, like the title says, has barely been keeping my head above water for the past two and a half years. My GPA is now up to a 2.7 or so but it used to be way down below 2.0 and I was on probation for a semester and was about 10 points on a final exam away from getting expelled. Out of the six semesters I've been taking college courses, there's only been one where I haven't either failed a course or withdrawn from a course to avoid failing. Although I haven't quite hit the limit, I've basically ensured that I'm going to get kicked out of the College of Engineering for lack of progress/failing too many classes (I have yet to pass Calc 2 and I'm a junior, its embarrassing). On top of that, the courses I've taken are either math or random elective shit to fill the time so I'd be essentially starting over (with my gen eds at least) if I switch degrees. The big problem, though, is that I've been lying through my teeth to my friends, family, and parents about it ever since I panic-lied in freshman year and told my mom I was doing fine when I was actually failing miserably. I've been INCREDIBLY lucky and my parents put aside a nice solid amount of cash for me to go to college on and it still has about 1-2 year's worth of funds left in it, but I completely squandered what could have been a big leg up in life by graduating debt-free on time.  Everyone thinks I've got a 3.7 GPA and am about to graduate with an engineering degree next year. In reality I haven't the slightest fucking idea what I want to do with my life beyond smoke weed and cry while listening to punk music for the next hour or two. I was considering a gap semester program going to Australia and New Zealand to try and figure out what I do want to do but then realized that I probably shouldn't be spending $10k-$12k on fucking around for a semester.

54,"throwaway account because these people know my reddit username.

background:

several years back I ended up dating up one of my friends that was there, and had a pretty bad breakup, but we became friends again about a year ago having a lot in common and her being open about being gay. I've been struggling with my sexuality a lot recently as well, to tell the truth, so I try to always be open and express shit about that. we all mess with drugs to an extent, but she is particularly smart about reducing harm in certain situations. I did MDMA with her forthe first time a couple months ago, and it was a really awesome experience where I told her about how I was (probably) bisexual and how unsure I was about all this

my other friend who was there at the time of this story is bi as well, but he is more open about it and also very knowledgeable about drugs, and home from college for spring break. 

so I decided to take a fairly substantial dose of MDMA with my these people the other night (for my second time). both of them are quite experienced with that sort of thing and very careful people, so I felt safe being with them, and really happy. we ended up just talking for hours and hours with our phones off listening to music about everything you could imagine, i said things i have never told anyone before and we all said how much we loved each other, cried, hugged, and cried again. we ended up all laying down on a bed being close to each other and hugging and cuddling and all that. we all just talked about how much we loved each other as people and how beautiful life is. it was the most secure I felt about anything in a long while. long story short 4am rolls around and we're all really happy and close, just all grouped together holding each other, sexuality completely aside. we were all really fucked up and boundaries were just sort of dissolving, and we all felt very secure and safe. 

the next part I don't remember much of since I took some xanax to calm myself down, being kind of anxious at this contact due to a bad experience I had in the past. I was sort of removed from this general cuddle and then I noticed they were kissing each other, and just felt so so alone and anxious for some reason since I had dated this girl years ago and she had told me she is gay. it felt really awkward for me, because I felt really lonely and just wanted more than anything to be in love with someone. it wasn't anything particularly sexual between them, (again she is gay and we were all really fucked up) but I just felt a little awkward since it was just them and I was just awkwardly off to the side. i felt really awkward saying anything as to not fuck their experience up, but it was definitely enjoyed by both parties and not a negative experience to the best of my knowledge. she ended up kissing me too a bit later, and it was really nice and  I felt super loved since it was not sexual at all. my guy friend and i got a little close as well but we didn't kiss because I felt kind of uncomfortable having that be my first gay experience, and that felt weirdly intimate. they fell asleep on the tiny ass bed while I slept on the floor and laid awake for a little bit thinking about everything. I eventually woke up in the morning and decided not to wake them up after our long ass night to avoid general awkwardness. I ended up leaving and heading home and that was that. 

it left me really confused and lonely for some reason though. there was something really sad about the way we all held each other so intimately and how lonely we really were. I felt really weird about how this will change my relationship with my guy friend, especially when he heads off to college again. I'm really not sure what the hell to do or what to make of any of it, but I know that I love these people more than anything and I want both of them in my life so much. I kind of wished I had just kissed him too (which we talked about while fucked up) and really just come to terms with who I am, but I don't know how ready I am or if I ever will be. trauma can really fuck you up in that regard. anyways I guess my general question is what the fuck do I say when we hang out again? was this just our combined loneliness and shared love manifesting in each other, or is it more for us? I'm really not sure what to do. any advice or suggestions or help or anything would be really helpful because I am really indecisive about this.

55,"TW for the mention of eating disorders.

Let me start this off be saying i do have a doctor's appointment scheduled for the issue that I'll be talking about.

I'm already a very tall, slender person so I look a lot skinnier than I already am. I currently have a problem with my stomach that makes it horrible for me to eat nearly anything in normal portions, so i either rarely eat full meals, or I don't eat at all.

Of course this is unhealthy, but I still eat enough to have energy to get through the day (a very small breakfast, a full lunch, and small to no dinner).

Now to where i need the advice.

As I'm such a slim person already, everybody is starting to worry about me when they see me taking small portions or skipping a meal. Specifically the people I work with. I work in the evenings, so they almost never see me eat.

They aren't the only people who are worried. I've had several people ask me if I'm on a diet or if I'm not eating to lose weight. No matter how many times I explain my situation, nobody seems to believe me. How do i keep people from being afraid that I'm starving myself?

56,"I currently work retail, I have always worked retail and never had any problems before. The problem right now is I'm constantly getting annoyed by my manager, let me explain. My manager gets mad when we don't make enough sells. I'm a sales associate and my job is to help make sells, clean and help costumers. My manager gets upset if a costumer doesn't make a purchase and usually gets mad that I didn't convince them. 

When I see a costumer and I offer them help and explain to them all the deals we have and they tell me that they don't need help right now that they are just browsing, I would leave them alone. But my manager wants me to be VERY pushy with the costumers, which becomes annoying, and I can tell the costumers get annoyed too when I keep telling them about this and that and makes me uncomfortable too. If they need help, great, but if they don't sometimes people want to be left alone and look around.

For example, there was this costumer that wanted something specific, but we didn't have what he wanted and I gave him some options we had in our store, but he said no, when my manager asked me why he didn't buy anything I explained he was looking for something we didn't have and got annoyed because I didn't convince him to buy something from the store. 

Like I said, I never had a job in any of my previous retail jobs but he is just extremely pushy and wants me to be pushy. If I'm as costumer and this employee offered help and I say no and he is constantly offering me deals and stuff, I would get annoyed.

We’ve been fighting over the smallest things because lately I’ve been so angry and upset I just want to snap at everything but I don’t know what’s wrong with me. 

I’m stressed out because my dad is really really sick and needs help and money but I can’t really do much for him because I have my own bills I need to pay and as much as I want to help I have a feeling it would become an expectation. Lately I also feel I have no say in which university I want to go to once I get my associate out of the way —cheaper to do it at a community college— because my dad doesn’t seem to want me to go anywhere else but to a university in Texas where he lives. 

I’m also stressed because on top of being a full-time student I basically work full-time as well and I feel like everyone is expecting more from me and I’m just so drained but when I try to cut back on hours my bosses can’t do it because our department is short staffed, or people call out so I get called in, and my boyfriend or the one friend I have will want to do things when I really don’t have the time or energy but I don’t want to say no because I don’t want to seem rude. 

I also keep having these memories from when I was groomed by an older man online when I was a kid that keeps popping up in my head, and they won’t go away. I just always feel dirty. I feel disgusted and I hate myself. If I’m not thinking about being groomed I’m thinking about the sexual assault and rape and I wish I could cut off my skin and not wear it anymore because I hate myself for what happened. The last time my boyfriend and I had sex —and I didn’t tell him this because I didn’t want him to feel awful because it wasn’t his fault— all I could think about was my ex and how he hurt me and raped me and part of me couldn’t get that thought or those memories out of my head and the feeling of being raped and used and just being disgusted in myself was so strong and I was just numb and when we finished I went in the bathroom and had to shower because all I felt was my ex all over me and I couldn’t stop crying but I didn’t want to tell anyone because I know it wasn’t anyone else’s fault but my own. 

I feel my life is not my own. I feel like I’m just all messed up and I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m scared of being alive but I’m scared of dying and I just want it all to stop somehow. I want it all to stop.

I’m sorry if I’m rambling or if this doesn’t make sense I just don’t know what’s going on with me anymore or how to explain anything to anyone. I just know I’m scared. ",18Mar2019,2

60,"I’ve been in a relationship for about 3 years now and it’s been quite a trip. I met this girl in college right before my family life went to shit. We were together when I bought my moms plane ticket to leave my dad, when the garage I lived in burned down and I was in the hospital, and through our big move to a different state. She’s the perfect girl, has always supported me and my passions and there is nothing I can complain about. Somewhere along the way I feel like I’ve lost myself, ever since the fire and almost dying idk how I’m supposed to feel. I feel very numb most times and since our move to a different state I’ve been even more lonely. I used to at least see my friends once a week but making friends in a new state hasn’t worked for me yet. I work with kids so there aren’t many opportunities to meet coworkers and I live with my girl and our 2 female roommates , who are cool but 6 months in and I don’t see us connecting in a major way. So I’ve been trying to figure out what’s wrong with me, I don’t feel like I’m okay although I can’t pinpoint what will make me feel better. I also smoke a fuck ton of weed, which I think has drastically affected my mood. If I’m not at work, I’m high. Before this current relationship I was in a relationship for 4 years and sometimes she’ll randomly pop into my head. I feel like I’ve spent a lot of time relying on the women in my life, both these girls were there when I was going through some very difficult times and I am thankful for their help but as I’ve grown I feel like I don’t know who I am outside of my relationships. I feel like my thought process isn’t healthy, I speak to my mom about 4 times a week and that’s all the contact I have with my family. All my belongings from my past were either lost in the fire or when my family split, I haven’t talked to my dad in years. Sometimes I feel super disconnected to my past, I think of myself as a kid and it’s almost like I’m thinking of another person, I have no pictures, no videos, no connection to that version of me. There are times where I consider leaving my relationship and everything behind and trying to start over. Try to heal my mind and focus on myself for a while but I don’t know how to communicate all of this to my girl. She knows somethings wrong but I don’t think she understands how serious this feels to me and I feel weird drawing so much attention to these feelings when I can’t really even understand what’s wrong with me. I’m just looking for any advise that might help. Have any of you had similar feelings? What has helped you and your relationship with yourself? ",18Mar2019,1

63,"I went to university for a couple of years, then I stopped because I realized what I was studying was something I didn't have an interest in. I didn't know what else I wanted to study so I thought it would be best for me to take a hiatus from pursing my Bachelor's, and just wrap up an Associate's and join the workforce for a minute until I get a better idea what I would like to have as a career.

I transferred all of my credits from my university to my local community college. My community college requires you to take at least 15 credits at the institution to earn an Associate's from there.

I just needed to take two more classes for the degree I'm pursuing from there. I took those two classes in the Fall; they were 7 credits in total. I have 8 credits left I need to take to earn my degree. I want to take these last two courses over the Summer. I didn't take any classes in the Winter, so I can use my unused aid for the Winter during the Summer.

I have no other classes I can take within my program, so I have no choice but to take electives. The problem is that the community college will not provide financial aid for classes outside of my program.

I talked to my advisor about this, and he told me since I was at university and I transferred my credits, they can grant me an exception. He would just have to hear a dispute from financial aid, and then he would try to grant me an exception.

I spoke to financial aid, and they said they can't do this.

I need to take two more classes and I'll be done. I want financial aid to cover them. I think the policy is bogus.

68,"I need some serious help because I’m lost on what to do. 

Ever since the 2016 election, my mom has gone head first into the deep end of right-wing conspiracy theories. 

It started off as mostly Pro-Trump rhetoric she’d mimic in everyday discussions or on her Facebook. Nothing we couldn’t discuss our way through, or ignore. 

Then came the whole QAnon thing. 

Everything is a conspiracy with her now. She openly talks about Democrats controlling child sex rings, Hillary Clinton sacrificing people, and mass shootings as false flags. 

Her Facebook feed is chock full of this stuff. You’d think she was a bot. This has led to friends and family members having a skewed view of her now. It’s driven a wedge between her and my dad and brother. 

No reasoning gets through to her. She ignores hard facts. She doesn’t want therapy. 

It came to a head this weekend after she started talking about the New Zealand shooting as a false flag. My dad flipped. He let her know that everyone thinks she’s crazy and how it’s affecting our relationship with her. She packed her bags and went to stay with my grandma after that. 

She views this “global threat” as a direct threat to her family and is blind to the direct effects its causing. She thinks that is telling her that she needs to stop with this QAnon stuff is us trying to stifle her political views. She thinks it’s us trying to control her beliefs.

70,"Note: This is a repost from a post I made on r/asktransgender just because I'm looking to get as much advice as possible for this.

 

Alright, I'm on a throwaway account so here's hoping nothing bad will come of this!

This  is going to just be my mostly unfiltered thoughts and concerns in  writing, so if you don't want to read something like that it's  completely fine! To those of you who do however.... here we go.

So  hi there! I'm a 15 year old biological male, I may suffer from anxiety  and slight eating disorders among other things, however am honestly too  afraid to ask my parents to get me diagnosed, and frankly am scared of  being diagnosed, but that's besides the point.

For  about the past year, I have been having slight realizations and  thoughts that I might not be heterosexual, just due to a lot of my  mannerisms, such as if I'm in a desperate,""UH I NEED A PARTNER SO BAD""  mood, I tend to look at girls and guys, and subconsciously have crushed  on a few males in the past, but often suppress those urges. I've never  been in a relationship at all, I'm very nervous and tend to postpone  asking someone out, and after months of dancing around the question and  trying to figure out if asking the person out is a good idea, they often  end up finding someone else. I honestly don't care if someone I'm  attracted to is a male or female, I care more about their personality  and when I imagine my dream person, they're mostly just characteristics,  not really male or female if that makes any sense. All these thoughts  and talking to some of my close friends has led me to believe that I  think I'm bisexual, but like a little more leaning to the ""liking guys""  part of the spectrum.

Now, onto a more relevant subject.

Being  a male disturbs, disgusts, and stresses me out a lot, I feel like I'd  be more comfortable with who I am and a lot of my characteristics if I  was a female, but I also don't feel like I am a female mentally, if that  makes any sense at all. To elaborate, I like to sit cross legged and  feel much more comfortable when I do so, I absolutely detest sitting  with my legs open, ever. I've been told off and teased for this in the  past, but it's just what works for me. I want to complement people, call  them cute, call them pretty, say I love them with it seeming friendly,  and not sexual or creepy. As a guy, if I say someone looks pretty or  cute, others automatically think of it in a sexual way almost always  and, because I'm not exactly a sexy chad, often get uncomfortable and  sometimes angry because of it, whether they be male or female. I don't  say these thoughts often anymore because of past experiences, and  because of that I come off as very unsympathetic and uncaring, even  though deep inside I want to tell people that their clothes are really  cute or their makeup is really pretty but just in a platonic way! I feel  like this trait would be so much more accepted if I was anything but  male, as then it's just a complement that I don't have to feel creepy or  disgusting on saying or even thinking, as I see females doing such all  the time. I realized recently that I'll sometimes subconsciously start  talking in a higher voice, despite being an aspiring voice actor, my  voice fluctuates a lot at the moment and really makes me uncomfortable  when it's range is slightly deeper than medium. I guess what I'm trying  to say in that is I really dislike my voice so I change it, but I'm  often not entirely aware that I'm doing this. It's not that I hate deep  voices or anything, I actually very much like deep voices, just I hate  them on myself, I guess I just feel like it doesn't fit me? I could go  on like this for quite a bit, but I should move on, because I still have  a lot I feel like I should say.

This  paragraph is about to get sexual and will regard male genitalia, so if  you don't want to read about that at all, I thank you very much for  reading thus far, but you may want to click away or skip this paragraph.

So  sexually, I'm a very submissive person, an absolute ""bottom"" if you  will. I won't get into it too much, but let's just say I have a lot of  submissive trigger words and kinks. I've found that while I enjoy the  phrase,""Good boy"", if I think about it too much it will cause stress and  thoughts like those above, but I really enjoy the phrase,""Good girl""  and the only stresses I feel from that are those I will address later.  That's a little off topic for sure but it's just a thought I have a lot  that makes me go,""hmmmmmmm am I trans?"". Additionally, I hate the fact  that I have male genitalia, I phrase it like that because I don't even  like saying or hearing any of it's actual names when referring to  myself. The thing is, I don't hate the male genitalia in general, as I  implied earlier, I want someone else to... y'know, *use*  theirs on me if you catch my drift. I just, I guess feel incredibly  uncomfortable with myself possessing one; I don't like how it feels, I  don't like how it looks (in fact I literally do everything I can to hide  that I even have one, from concealing underwear, to baggy pants, to  wearing hoodies around my waste, etc.), and I feel terribly disgusting  as a person anytime it gets *excited*  (yet another word that I use to replace one I really don't like to say)  whether the situation be when I'm literally studying and no sexual  thoughts or anything even in my mind, or when I am alone watching  pornographic material. I could go on, but to sum it up, I just dislike  anything relating to me and having male genitalia, it makes me  uncomfortable and stresses me out, and not for like *size reasons* or anything.

So with all this said, here are my fears.

Firstly,  I'm terrified that I could just be going through a phase, could be  completely lying to myself, could be trying to make myself look special  and seek attention. I'm afraid that other people will think this, and  although I really don't think I am conforming or seeking attention or  trying to be special, because those aren't things I think I care about,  the fact that that's a possibility is a huge concern. Is transitioning  something that I actually want, or am I just trying to make myself seem  like something unique that I'm not? The thought alone cripples me,  scares me a lot. Secondly, I've come out to a sibling as bisexual  recently, and it went really well, but I haven't come out to anyone  else, because I'm not sure if they would accept that, and I'm almost  certain they'd think that it's just a phase. I imagine that coming out  as transgender, telling my parents that their son of 15 years doesn't  want to be a son anymore... it wouldn't go over well, but I'm underage  and can't do anything to transition without their permission, at least I  don't think I can. I know the news would also change some of my  friendships and there are quite a few transphobic people in my grade,  one of which has openly expressed how he does not believe transgender  people deserve basic human rights in front of a teacher and 50 other  people. Thirdly, what if I regret transitioning? What if I realize my  problems weren't with being male, but just being myself? What if the  transition just adds to my problems, or doesn't make me happier and now I  have to deal with knowing that there are people out there who will  never see me as a male, female, or even person. If this decision ended  up being the wrong thing to do, I think I'd genuinely be too scared to  ever decide anything ever again. I'm just really scared that this could  be the wrong thing to do and simply change my life for the worse.  Lastly, this relates to the ""good girl"" thing, what if the emotional  ground is all fake and over exaggerated by my mind, and I just want to  do this for sexual reasons? I can't deny that I want to be railed, and I  can't get past the thought that maybe these thoughts have clouded my  mind to the point where I subconsciously come up with emotional reasons  just to give myself an excuse to transition. I'm certain this is not the  case, but like, it's a thought that plagues me and I can't get rid of  it. Despite being terrified of surgeries going wrong, pain, and side  effects, I can barely even think about that with all these other  problems, but I suppose that's a bit of a fear too.

So  those are all my thoughts, summed up in an absolute unproofread  clusterfuck of a post. I don't know what I hope to achieve from posting  this, I guess just feedback and discussion? Does this make sense, or is  it complete nonsense? Is my reasoning valid, or am I a complete fucking  idiot? Should I start thinking more seriously about transitioning, or  should I not do anything about it? Please, don't hold back or sugarcoat  anything, I really just need absolutely anyone's full genuine opinion  about this entire situation, because right now, it's causing me to be  confused, stressed, and concerned for myself. I'm super open to  discussion about anything, so even if you have a question that seems  invasive, I'm probably willing to answer and discuss it, and if I'm not  I'll say so.

Thank you to anyone who  reads this, I'm sorry if there were any thoughts that didn't make sense,  moments of poor word choice, or general spelling or grammar errors, but  I really appreciate you taking time out of your day to read this, it  means the world to me.

So it was about 3 months ago when Jessica started dating one of my close friends called Charlie. This was her attempt to get close with me. It worked, sort of. We were friends, she messaged me almost everyday. Nothing too unusual. Then, all of a sudden, she sends me a nude. She said she meant to send it to Charlie, but no one believed her. They eventually broke up and she started sending more and more, despite my request to stop. Eventually I blocked her on everything I could, which prompted her to make physical advancements on me. I stayed away from her and all was good, until I was called down to the office and they confiscated my phone and gave it to the police.

I can't make a decision for myself. I don't have interests or hobbies. I can't even really identify what I like to try and develop some. I spend way too much time reading reddit posts trying to diagnose what went wrong in my life. I keep coming back to my parents in my mind but always take it with a grain of salt as I think I'm looking for anything to blame for my current perceived sense of failure. I get hung up on the fact that no one who knows my family will believe my childhood was possibly bad, including my siblings. I feel like I'm the first one to realize we all have Stockholm syndrome. When I think of smaller, sharable details, they usually pretty easy to mock, both for thinking they're a problem and for my role in them.. e.g. my mom decorated my bedroom until I moved out at 18. It was always uncomfortable as the room would always be designed several years too young looking. It's humiliating in hindsight that I couldn't stand up for myself on that one. I think she wanted to keep us kids as long as possible, which is an impulse I can understand...but that could just be the Stockholm syndrome telling me to understand and that her feelings were paramount. 

I've always been dogged by feelings of paralyzing uncertainty to the point that I usually try and find a confidant to outsource my decisions to/need unreasonable amounts of reassurance. Which was definitely stressful and unfair for romantic partners. Fuck, even romantic relationships that ended I was always more concerned with the other persons feelings than my own. I just dont feel like I really exist I guess. Reminders of my existence (pictures, people saying my name, etc.) are inexplicably jarring for me. I hate being recognized. Maybe because I dont recognize myself. 

Of course any time I start down this road I chastise myself for navel gazing, but I just feel so wrong all the time, and like I can't trust myself, my thoughts, or my experience. And so, for years, I've been standing still. Waiting for something to happen. And it very rarely does. I'm 27 and feel emotionally adolescent. I look back at people I know who are 24 going to law school, having careers, taking chances, and not being so cripplingly terrified of responsibility that they can actually become adults. Meanwhile, I've never even gotten a promotion. Probably wouldn't want one anyone, because, responsibility. (it's mostly being responsible for other people that seems impossible to me, but clearly I'm letting myself down too).

My family has had huge issues with the husband in the past but we have supported my sister cause she’s family. But he constantly borrows money from family members to fund his weed habits,  and has never bothered to get a full time job, and is more focused on gaming than anything even though he’s in his 40’s.

Recently he attacked her pretty badly, causing him to run away before he’d could get arrested and have to deal with his problems like an adult.
So my dad stepped in helped my sister by paying for a house for her and giving her his side business so she could get back on her feet and try and live a better life . 

But, recently I  found out that the husband has been staying with my sister in this house that my dad is paying for and living off the money my dad gives her, essentially, to get away from him. Even though there is a restraining order against him.

My problem is that I don’t know wether to tell my dad that he’s supporting my sister and her husband even though he thinks that she isn’t with him and he’s helping move on. 

I feel horrible that my dad thinks he’s helping my sister and she’s pretty much spitting in his face by staying with the man who beat her. My dad isn’t the best dad but he’s really trying and I feel like my sister is just abusing his trust.

tl:dr sister hit rock bottom after her husband beat her and my dad is helping financially but she is still with the husband, don’t know wether to tell my dad.

83,"First of all, I'm drunk so sorry if there are any typos. I don't even know where to start. Her and I have known each other for years. We went to high school together and we were friends in HS but we didn't really start hanging out until summer of 2017. That was a couple months after she broke up with her high school boyfriend. She hit me up and asked if I wanted to hang out and I said sure. So we hung out, things went great. She was a lot of fun to talk to and everything and so we hung out more over the summer. I'm not gonna lie I fell for her hard. Until she started talking to her ex again. On the 4th of july she went to watch fireworks with him and she made sure to send me a snapchat of her with him. That was the first hint that told me ""maybe she doesn't have my best interests in mind"" because it fucked me up. At the time, I didn't really have much in my life except for her. I attempted suicide. Not only because of her but because of a culmination of things. I didn't end up going through with it obviously.

Fast forward to like August. She's dating her ex again but we still talk sometimes. In my drunkeness I ask her if she wants to come see my dog one last time and she surprisingly agrees. This kicks off 8 months of cheating with me and lying to her boyfriend that only stopped when he proposed. Yup you read that right. 8 months. Complete with her confessing her love to me in about November and saying she would break up with her boyfriend for me. She never did. He proposed in April and she said yes. Things were fine for awhile. We didn't talk over summer 2018 at all because she was living with her bf. It was tough but I made it through that summer surprisingly. We started texting again when we both went back to college in august 2018. Just friend stuff. It was clear that the cheating was all behind us. I was never proud of what I did and so I never pushed her to cheat again and she obviously regretted it. So we had a good thing going until January of this year.

Her fiance dumped her. She was pretty devastated and I was the first person she went to for comfort. As soon as it happened she called me and I drove 45 minutes to her to help her through it. No sex or anything. And the past couple of months have been weird. We have been texting every day and talking on the phone for 1 hour+ multiple nights a week. We hang out occasionally and we started having sex again. I caught feelings again. Like a dumbass. But from various comments I can tell that she doesn't want anything more than a FWB. And as if this wasn't already clear, she started talking to another guy that we went to highschool with. And she's taking every opportunity to dangle that fact over my head. She's fucking with me. Just like she did in July 2017 when she got back with her ex and contributed to my attempted suicide.

So here's my dilemma. Day to day, I really do enjoy having her as a friend. The occasional sex is also a bonus. But I feel like she almost enjoys fucking with my emotions. We're both on break right now. She was here on Fri night and we had a lot of fun together. She said she would come back over tonight. But earlier today she texted me ""Hey I forgot I told (other guy) I would hang out with him tonight sorry"". Is this just proof that she's fucking with me? Proof that her entire motive in life is to get two guys to fight over her? She's a self admitted attention whore. She even told me about a week ago ""You give me attention and I give you sex. That's the deal.""

I just texted her an hour ago and asked if we could hang out tomorrow. She said yeah. I'm not gonna turn that down because I really do like her as a person. But after she leaves, do I block her on snapchat, twitter, facebook, etc? And tell her to stop texting me? I honestly don't know. On one hand, the fact that she toys with me is a big source of anguish in my life. On the other hand, talking to her is one of the only sources of happiness in my life right now. I just need a third opinion I guess.

I left a lot of shit out. It's a long and complicated relationship. Any questions, just ask. I'm gonna go take more shots.

84,"The reason why I’m saying this is due to the fact that I get worse when my green iguana died, recently, then when my grandmother died. Some context is that I never saw my grandmother in person, just talked over the phone for a couple minutes, and I get up side by side with my iguana. I got him when I was 3, and now at 14 I came home to see him dead. For about 3+ hours I didn’t react because I though he maybe blacked out so I set out food and water plus turning down his personal heater. I left and when I got back home he never moved so we checked and it was official that he died. At first, once again I didn’t react and went into my room. Then I locked he for and started crying more than I ever had. I wasn’t loud or anything, just loads of tears. ",18Mar2019,1

88,"This Thursday an internet guy friend of mine told me he was coming to my town to take an exam at one of the universities. He attends a school an hour and 30 minutes away from me. He asked if we could finally meet eachother. I said sure why not since he'll be in town anyway. For the past 3 years he's wanted to come visit me, but I was afraid of what my parents would say since I was starting high school and he was entering college. It wouldn't of been pretty. Now I'm a freshman in college and he's a junior and I felt it would be more appropriate to ask my parents about it. They were suprisingly okay with it. Anywho him and I were planning to finally see eachother in person after 3-4  years of facetiming and stuff. Unfortunately  on Friday and Saturday he was really distant and left my messages on read. I wanted us to decide what we're gonna do and when and etc but nothing. He has a history of going back on his word and ignoring me, so I started feeling disappointed. This morning he texts me telling me he's in my town and headed over to the university to take his exam. He said he was really nervous about today, so I assumed we were on. I asked the questions about meeting up he never answered from yesterday again and wished him luck. He responded ""Thank you"" I assume after his exam. That's it. He didn't say anything else for 1 hour. So I told him to let me know what he wants to do. Nothing. Another hour passes and another passes. It really stung a lot, so  I got rid of all of our ways of contact. It was his idea to meet up and it would of been fine if he had just said ""hey I don't want to do this today"". He literally left me hanging by my phone for hours, as he drove home. 

Why I escalated so quickly:
For the past several months he's been going back and forth between his on/off girlfriend and I  Initially I was going to transfer to the university he attends. I've been looking at this school since my junior year and have been on like 3 tours, so I promise it wasn't for him. Everytime him and his girlfriend would break up he'd tell me that he can't wait for me to transfer, so we could be together and blehblopblah. Since I do have virtual feelings for him I feed into it for a while, he breaks communication with me, I ask what's wrong, he tells me they got back together. It's been a painful cycle for too long and I don't want to be ""that whore who's texting her boyfriend"". I had to tell him lots of times not to send flirtatious or passionate messages to me while he's with her. I really didn't like it, but he'd say things like ""We aren't going to be together much longer, you're the one I really want, I can't wait for you to get here"". I just have so much built up resentment towards him, he's really hurt me a lot and I don't even physically know him. He used to be a fun guy I'd facetime after school or when I'm having an issue with a boyfriend (anonymous male perspective advice). I really can't keep living this way, but I really don't want to hurt his feelings. He's super sensitive and tends to ""hate himself"" alot.",18Mar2019,1

92,"So my 12 year old daughters school counselor calls me in a panic.
Apparently a friend of hers had taken a note my daughter wrote to the front and from the looks of it it's a suicide note.

My happy go lucky, carefree little girl wants to die.

Of course I took this very seriously and contacted everyone she recommended to find out what my next steps should be, we spent all day in the ER with them evaluating her state of mind and making sure she was ok to go home with us.

They decided that she'd be ok but we had to go first thing the next day to a psychiatric hospital for further evaluation (it was really late by now) so we left and went home.

All night I stayed up worrying and checking out this place that they wanted me to take her, I read so many horror stories that I was terrified so I took it upon myself to search for another place to take her.

Thankfully after all was said and done she's able to stay home with me and we're going to start therapy and just go from there.

This is terrifying.

I never thought in a million years that my child would ever feel this way and honestly it breaks my heart, I don't know how to feel sometimes I'm scared and other times she's so cheerful that it doesn't seem real then some days she's a nightmare and is beyond rude to me I want to just scream!

93,"The first few months felt so unreal. I’ve never connected to anyone the same way I connected to him and the feeling was mutual. We were exactly the same yet completely different. He felt closer to me than my own family. Though I always feared letting myself be vulnerable to someone, my world began to revolve around him and I was so happy to let it. Our love was just as intense as our hurt. Things would be so, so good and then suddenly turn to complete shit. It’s not easy to date a depressed schizophrenic with borderline personality disorder, but I held onto my hope that just *maybe* if I put enough effort into helping him, he’d feel more determined to help himself. I was wrong. I’ve given him almost 9 months to change himself for the better. He has repeatedly lied to me, done things behind my back (not sexual), and disregarded my feelings/wants for what feels like the entirety of the relationship. Our relationship turned into therapy for him – only him. 

Him and I both know that I deserve better, but I want him to be the “better” that I deserve. I invested so much time, effort, and money into this relationship and it hurts to think that all of that was just for us to end. He doesn’t want to break up, but I know his current self is not someone I can vision myself marrying. If I know that I deserve someone more matured and respectful, why is it so hard for me to go through with breaking up with him? Why can’t I feel happy about it? I’ve been waiting for something to force me to leave, there’s been so many signs, but I’d rather stay with him until I eventually end up hating him enough to break things off without hurting. I’m not one to tolerate so much bullshit but for him it somehow always feels worth it. I have hope that he’ll change from either time passing or starting medication, but how long will that take when he’s been jobless and living in his car? 

I’ve been debating about whether I should stay or not. We’ve been dating for 8 months, should I give him more time or is that more than enough? He has untreated schizophrenia, depression, and borderline personality disorder, should I be more sympathetic and willing to tolerate these things or have I dealt with all that I could possibly handle? His family has practically abandoned him and he is unemployed, living in his car, should I be prioritizing him over myself? He loves me deeply and wants more than anything to keep me as I’m the only person that cares about him, but he’s been ruining our relationship and is too delusional to understand how or why he does it. I want to and don’t want to break up with him. 
What should I do? 

TL;DR: Boyfriend of 8 months has fucked up several times with no regard for my happiness, but has several mental health issues contributing to his shitty thought process. I don’t want to deal with it anymore but he has also managed to make me feel more understood/happier than anyone ever has and I can’t seem to let go of that. I don’t know if I should be sacrificing myself for something that might possibly be worth it if I wait long enough or if it might just have an even worse outcome that’s harder to escape from.

94,"I took up a Chemistry Class this year and my classmates and I are having major issues trying to keep up with this class. I'm a fairly good student and I could easily understand things but this guy just makes things so difficult. The way he teaches is just very ineffective for everyone in class. He can explain concepts nicely and very well if you ask him after the lecture, but a specific amount of our work forces us to look away from our notes and rely on Google instead. I don't mind using Google but I've noticed I've been relying on it heavily because the teacher doesn't teach us the concepts we are being asked about in worksheets. It even appears on tests and a majority of our class don't see it coming because they expected him to teach it. Not to mention that the internet can give very different answers and there's no telling on which answer is right or what explanation would please the teacher.

My parents and my younger brother (11) &amp; I live with my grandma (mom's mom). Gma is verbally abusive and a mild hoarder. Parents know but don't do anything to stop her. I have my own bedroom, but my brother's ""room"" is basically the living room. His computer is in the dining room, and that half of the house is where my gma spends all her time. My computer used to be out there, and all she does all day is walk by and call my brother stupid, fat, ugly, etc etc.. His computer is his route of escapism, just like mine was. Last year, we managed to clear some of the hoarded stuff out of my bedroom and move my pc in. My gma rarely leaves the kitchen/dining room side of the house, so I was actually able to start going a few hours without seeing or hearing her. My mental health has gotten so much better. I feel like a normal person, I gained a will to live, I finally came out of my dissociative fog. I don't even get on my computer much anymore because I'm not dissociating and escaping from reality all day. 

I just want the best for my brother. Last year, he told the counselor at his elementary school he wants to kill himself. My parents took him to a therapist for a while, and he claims to be better, but I've been in his shoes.

A bit about me. Since graduating HS, I've always had commitment problems. I actually got an associates in auto tech but was too scared to use it because I have anxiety issues and talked myself out of pursuing it for some dumb reason. Worked at UPS for a long time but decided to go into construction. In construction now but don't like it.   


So I already know the obvious question because I've asked it for years. ""What do you enjoy?"" or ""What are you passionate about?"".. Well.... Not much. haha. I don't expect to find a job I'll love. But I just want to find something that's good enough to be happy for the forseeable future. I've always done labor type stuff but honestly no idea if I would or wouldn't enjoy an office type environment. I know I'm tired of working on dirty dusty job sites every day.   


Things I've considered.   
\- The air force. I know, I'm 30.. who joins the military at 30? But I just want to do SOMETHING with my life. And at least then maybe I could travel.. and get some experience as.. something?   
\- Spectrum Cable. My bro in law works there. I assume there's decent money and benefits and such and work seems decent

\- Go back to school for IT stuff. I've always liked computers but... then again, may just repeat the auto tech situation and decide it's not for me...

103,"I wanted to get some perspective. I know I’ve made a mistake, and I was hoping to get feedback on whether this mistake is a dealbreaker or something I can fix.

I owe thousands in taxes. $12,000, actually - and I also have student loans and credit card debt that I accrued during a less responsible time in my life. 

I have an ex/close friend who is an attorney. She makes about $100,000 a year. I’ve done her a lot favors over the past couple of years, and she has reciprocated. For instance, she paid $2500 of my taxes last year and bought me a used car when my car finally broke down.

I called her last week to see if she would give me the money to pay my taxes. She was reluctant, so I offered to pay her back, possibly even with interest. She said she needed time to think about it, and I got slightly angry (I was drunk when I called). I told her “I see how it is.” She didn’t reply, so then I hung up on her. I had told her how freaked out this thing had me, and that I felt like I’m being forced to choose between suicide or prison. I just couldn’t understand why she didn’t want to help me, especially since she has so much money. 

I recognize that I made mistakes here, so I’ve been trying to get ahold of her to see where we stand. She’s not returning my calls or texts, which she has never done before. She has always wanted to help me when I’m in trouble, just like I’ve helped her. I don’t get it.

105,"  

Ok so I had a…. weird experience a few days ago and I’m not sure how a bunch of strangers on the internet can help me with this but I need to talk to someone about it and I’m not sure how to approach it with anyone I’m actually close with. Throwaway account for reasons that will become pretty obvious.

So I went to a friends apartment a few days ago to watch a game and have a few beers. This friend, I’ll call him C, is a coworker of about 8 months, but in that time we’ve become pretty close—we have similar interests and personalities, and he’s a lot of fun to hang out with. We talk a lot at work, and about once a week we usually go out to eat or to the bar with a few other work friends, and I’ve been to his apartment a couple of times before. He lives with his girlfriend, and neither of them are from the area. Their relationship seems a little rocky, which is made tougher by the fact that they live together but I never thought anything more of it than that it seemed a little awkward. I like and get along with both of them. So we drink some beer, watch some sports. I wasn’t planning to get super drunk, cuz I’m not really into that anymore, but I had gotten a ride over and was planning to Uber back, or crash there so I wasn’t really holding back either. C was drinking quite a bit—he recently graduated from college, but I just chalked it up to the fact that he recently graduated from college and is still used to that binge drinking culture. His girlfriend works second shift, so she got home fairly late, around 11:30 I think. Another game had come on and I was feeling pretty good so I thought I’d maybe have another beer or two before heading home. Somebody mentions weed, and it so happens that she has some. Now, I used to smoke quite frequently like in high school and college, but I mostly quit during college and have only smoked occasionally/rarely for the last several years. I tend to get quite paranoid when I smoke, which is one of the reasons I quit. But I was pretty tipsy and open to suggestion at this point so I figure I’ll take a few hits.

So we smoke a joint. I know I’m getting close to my limit so I only take a couple hits but I’m definitely very impaired at this point, and it’s strong weed. C is very drunk, and getting to a point where it’s a little uncomfortable: he keeps trying to get me to drink more, but I know we’ve both definitely had enough. I tell him no, cuz I don’t do peer pressure and I know I’m pretty messed up already, especially with the weed kicking in. I say that I’m about ready for bed, and his GF blows up an air mattress for me. I’m in the room with the air mattress getting ready to call it a night when him and his GF start arguing in the kitchen.

Unfortunately, my actual memory of what happened next is really hazy. I don’t remember anything about the actual conversation they were having or what was going on, but I do remember that I thought he was being abusive. I got extremely uncomfortable about it, and I tried to make myself conspicuously present, like walking past the kitchen very obviously, hoping that that would cause him to stop but it doesn’t stop. Somebody definitely got slapped, but I wasn’t looking when it happened so I don’t really know who hit who. I want to do something but I don’t think it will do any good to confront him then and there, I imagine us getting into a fight which I know won’t help anything. After a while they come out of the kitchen and sit down in the living room but now I’m just super freaked out and uncomfortable.

Now, remember how I said I tend to get paranoid when I smoke? At this point I’m extremely uncomfortable, and it gets really out of control. I start to think that… maybe they’re going to kill me. Like maybe they’re crazy serial killers and I’m going to be the next victim. I know that’s probably irrational, but overall I’m just so uncomfortable and freaked out by the whole thing that I decide I absolutely am not staying there and I need to go home. I try to get an Uber, but it’s like 2AM in a sleepy residential area and the driver I keep matching with just doesn’t seem to be actually coming. I figure it might be easier for him to find me if I walk out to the main road, and I just can’t stand to be there anymore so I tell them I’m going and I walk out. I walk out of their complex to the main road, still trying to get an Uber. I keep matching with the same driver but he never seems to actually be heading my way. My paranoid weed brain says, “maybe he’s in on it too, he keeps accepting your ride so you can’t get another Uber and escape” etc. I’m definitely not going back though, so I start walking toward home. I try a couple more times to get an Uber, but they just can’t seem to find me—probably because I’m on the side of the road in a residential area at 2AM, like a crazy person but whatever. I decide I’ll just have to walk home, and I do. Almost 4 miles, at 2AM, sure that I’m going to get picked up by the police at any moment because I’m not really in an area that should have any pedestrians at that time of night but I made it home, and the walk cleared my head enough that I wasn’t having any more crazy paranoid thoughts by the time I got home and I was able to go to bed. I’ve exchanged a couple of texts with C since then about random things, acting normal cuz I don’t know what else to do.

So anyway, the point is this: I think I may have witnessed my friend being abusive, but I was so fucked up that I don’t remember what actually happened and I don’t know what was just a paranoid weed delusion and what was real. I don’t want to be that person who stands by and does nothing despite knowing, and I’m not going to cover up for someone who’s abusive because they’re a friend. But I don’t honestly remember what actually happened, so I’m not sure if I can or should do anything.

TL;DR: I think I may have witnessed my friend being abusive to his GF, but I was really drunk and high so I don’t remember what actually happened and it might have just been a paranoid delusion.

Not sure what kind of advice anyone can give me for this, but it was just such a weird situation that’s been hanging over my head since it happened and I needed to get it off my chest somehow.",18Mar2019,0

They used to play games with me (board games, io games, Mobile games, etc.) and sometimes she would even wanna be in a YouTube video. Now I don’t have a huge problem with her not wanting to be in a YouTube video. Now flash forward to now, it’s once in a blue moon she plays with me. Side story: She always forces me to go to the animal shelter on weekends. We literally go twice per day. So 4 times per weekend. And we have a dog. To give you an image of what that is like. Imagine having 2 friends. That you can hang out with simultaneously and have known for the past how many years of your life. Now, imagine having 100 friends, that you can’t see simultaneously, and have met 5 minutes ago, and this is the last time you’ll ever see them. Back to the main topic.

108,"Sorry if this is a long one. Stick with me and hope that i make this clear and actually understandable. 

I work as a sales associate. Recently, I had the chance to get into an entry level management position. After the interview with the district manager a week goes by and I’m offered the job. On the phone I ask what the pay increase will be and am told it doesnt come with a raise. I then am given 24 hours to decide if I want the job without the raise. After some thinking, and advise, I call my district manager and decline the job offer in hopes that he will try to get me a raise and call me back within a day or two. (They really needed ME for this job). Two weeks go by and I hear nothing. 

At this point I’m upset and don’t understand why this promotion wouldnt come with a pay increase, so I call someone from corporate and ask the policy on raises. They tell me they dont typically offer an increase for that position, but it has happened in the past. This gets back to my district manager and he calls me to reiterate that it doesnt come with a raise. At this point I’m feeling like this is going to be a dead end job if I dont get the ball rolling at some point, so I tell him if the position is still open and he’s still interested in me, I’ll take it. He’s ecstatic (like i said, they really wanted me). 

Now comes the part where I’m really upset. I was just told by a coworker, that my district manager told her that once i declined the job offer with no pay, he went and sought approval to get me a raise. I was approved. So why wasn’t I given the raise? My DM wanted to see if I would take it without the raise, so he waited me out even though it’s not money coming out of his pocket. 

Here’s where i need advice. Should I now ask for a raise since it’s been about a month since I took the job? I’ve been doing a good job and my DM is really impressed, so should i ask? Should I keep my head low and try to get a bigger raise the next time i move up in management? What game is my DM playing? I dont understand.",18Mar2019,3

112,"I have, for most of my life, thought of myself as weird, different, and abnormal, but my parents never thought anything of it. I always thought I had some sort of condition as to why I act this way. Recently, I may have found out what I have and I need help telling my parents to look into me potentially having Asperger's Syndrome.

&amp;#x200B;

(I'm posting this here because I'm more looking for a way to tell my parents rather than medical advice. I hope this makes sense. This is my first post)

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, I would need evidence that proves and disproves this reasoning. (I like to keep an unbiased opinion)

Proofs:

\-I check most of the boxed for the symptoms and signs of Asperger's

\-I am a 17 year old male and the average diagnosis age that I could find was between 14 and 18

\-I took an AQ Test (A medical test that tells you whether you should look into getting a diagnosis. Scoring 32/50 and below means your are fairly safe from this) and I scored a 49/50

Disproofs:

\-I am able to somewhat understand what people's emotion are

\-I don't notice me being sensitive to sounds or tastes (Bells and low frequencies do though)

&amp;#x200B;

Though there is no confirmation whether I actually have Asperger's Syndrome, there is a lot of evidence pointing towards me looking into a diagnosis. If you could help me to find a good or even the best way to tell my parents that I need to look into this. My father does not take things like this well and usually brushed it off since he doesn't like change. My mother is more understanding and I do have about 2 hours to talk to her before my father gets home.

&amp;#x200B;

**If the formatting is too confusing, read this...**

In what way can I tell/talk to my parents to convince them to take me for a diagnosis?

&amp;#x200B;

I do feel very scared trying to talk to them and I always think it's going to end with my father yelling at me, so any suggestion will help. Even if it's just a confidence booster.

They are beautiful but I never mentioned anything to allude that I ever wanted crystals. Odder still, the givers are not people I'm close too.

In one instance, I spent a day with a peer I had maybe had a conversation or two with before. We have mutual friends, but her asking to spend the day with me was already out of the ordinary. I had a lot of fun, but at the end of our day she handed me a smooth, purple stone. She said she wanted me to have it but gave no explanation.

The most recent addition to my collection was from a very little girl. She may have been 8 at the oldest. There are a lot of kids where I work so when her mom came in with her one day I made conversation with her as well: learning her name and favorite colors and such. She didn't speak very much though. Not two hours after leaving the girl and her mom came back. She handed me a small white crystal and all her mother told me was ""she wanted to give it to you"".

I could look people in the eyes and have full conversations, talking to everyone and anyone who seemed interesting or in need of someone. My time their gained me more than that, I met my Fiancée, we sparked then hit it off flawlessly, my boss seen potential in my and offered me a Supervisor position, my increase in salary led to escaping my volatile home life with my fiancée into an extremely tiny apartment.

Over time I got promoted to a different family entertainment place which was fine, I started building community in a new city, a new start rather. My s/o and I saved money to get a new apartment in the new city to escape my family and past problems involving their debts. One day while working an opportunity arose that turned into a career, a company we shall call StopGame had an employee party with us. When StopGame arrived I spoke with their District Manager about opportunities leading me to get a Manager position over time in the Southeast part of Michigan. At StopGame my career took off,in the two years I’ve been there I topped Sales turned a few stores around, won some awards, got praised constantly for the changes made. Developed an ace team of great people that I’m lucky enough to call friends. The works, or so you’d think.

November 2018, my father passed the day after my birthday, because of my car being in the shop and my fiancée being at work my father passed surrounded by strangers. In the process of gathering my family for a funeral they got into a blowout over possessions leading me to take the fall for holding a mess of a funeral because I did not have the funds to hold a real wake and all of the things need to get him cremated, tombstone etc. As of writing this, I feel an emptiness, my current Store is at an all time low, I’m a few steps from finishing my Associates Degree but I build my self up too much and panic when it comes time to execute finishing. My boss berated me in front of my team over performance comparing me to a nuclear explosion, which sent my confidence and overall enthusiasm spiraling. I have worked for this company for two years, brought nothing but positive performance, but being publicly shamed is the final push. I take full responsibility for my short comings, the misses in my store and academic life are my fault, but I think it’s because I lost my spark for it. I feel finished when it comes to this career, I hit every check mark when it comes StopGame and there is no more room for expansion. I’ve become a recluse, I want a fresh start.

I have done event planning, I ran a mildly successful Pop Culture event when I was 21 and used to do event planning for the family entertainment center. I have management skills, I am 150% dedicated to any project I dedicate myself to, I just need an ideal of what’s next.

I’m working on finishing school, I am only a few credits shy. I would like to move forward in my career, hopefully proving myself to be better than the mud my lineage has dragged our name through, not for myself but the people who have believed in me thus far. I owe it to them, even though we didn’t get along I owe it to my dad.

This may be a jumbled mess but I’m asking for advice, I have applied to 300 different jobs all to crickets. I just want to work hard, I just want to excel. Working around the clock is never an issue but it has to be towards something I want to do, something I believe in. I love working with the community, I love making a difference.

141,"Hi everyone I will try not to make this post too long and Im sorry if it seems kind of rambly and un-nessesary but here we go!

I'm a 22 yr old from Arizona. I'm married and have a great job in IT that pays the bills and I really enjoy it! However, my true passion is film and cinematography. I spent some time while in highschool as a video editor for YouTubers and my school. I started making my own YouTube videos, and just creating projects in Photoshop and Premiere for fun. I also worked as a wedding photographer out of High school and just searching for any freelance ""photographer"" jobs I could fine. However in all of these instances I was paid very little or nothing. So it was never something I could make a career out of, I started working in retail and eventually IT. 

To keep this post from getting too boring, a few months back my Wife's brother passed away.  Through out the whole process there was one thing that struck me as odd. At his funeral the was no ""Tribute Video"" every funeral I had been to before featured one and had always just assumed it was common place, like a service that the funeral home provided. Well I spoke with my wife and her parents and it turned out that they did want to make a video but didn't even know where to start! ( and yes I voiced my concerns with why the hell they didn't just ask me 😂) This led me down a path of figuring out what usually happens at funerals, as I have only been to 3 in my life. Turns out a very consistent theme seems to be that you either
 1.) Have a family member that is into film and have them make it.
or 
2.) Contact a funeral home that will usually refer you to some form of online service where you send in your photos and they pump out a fairly basic slideshow.

Another thing I've come to notice is because of the day an age we are in alot of people still have memories stored on physical media. ( DVDs, Film, VHS, etc.) And the time that most people are actually searching through and considering digitizing that media is after someone passes, so this is my idea.

I would like to offer a service locally ( I live in Phoenix so basically as far north as Surprise and as far south as Gilbert) were I meet with the primary member of the family, the one paying for the service, and discuss the family member that passed with them. I want this to be something more personal then contacting a website and shipping in all your stuff. I want to some degree to get to know the person who passed and see what the person paying for the service wants. It also gives me the opportunity to find out how they currently have their ""memories"" stored if they are physical media or stored online. Whatever the case may be I then have them reach out to the other members of their family and have them gather any pictures and video they would like as well as music and any other special request. Because of the nature of a funeral turn around time would likely be within a week of the initial contact with the customer. This limits the ability to digitize and use alot of the physical media they may have but it does leave more then enough time for me to compose the video. Realistically I can crank out any of these videos same day without sacrificing quality because the story is basically given to me and with the added knowledge of the person the process kind of takes care of itself.

So to recap the 1st part of the business would be the creation of a tribute video to played at the Funeral.

Once the video is made I would try hard to make it a scenario where I personally attend the Funeral( still trying to figure out if this is weird or not. 😂) not necessarily as part of the funeral more of to the side and I just play the video and make sure everything runs smoothly. This plays 2 purposes. The first is that I don't have to stress about just giving someone the video and something going wrong. The second purpose is that it allows me a larger chance of leaving an impression on those that attend the funeral and it allows me to answer any questions and interact with people who may need my service in the future.

The final aspect would be after the funeral. So the funeral is over and people begin to revert back to their normal lives, but now they have stacks of physical media from this relative that passed that they've gone through and dug up. I would like to be able to take any and all physical media and digitize it for them. It's a process that I'm familiar with and it's not super complicated but it does take time. I feel like this is a service everyone wants but it's something you just keep pushing off until a moment like this.

So if you are still here that's my idea, It let's me pursue something I love and also (hopefully) help people get through the hardest aspect of life.

My questions boil down to this

Is this already an openly available service and I'm way off base about the supply/demand for this service?

Is it morbid or wrong to basically profit off of someone's death?

Is the digitizing aspect something people probably won't want to do especially after the fact?

My wife worries that if I try to promote myself on social media or to people it can be perceived as ""sleazy"", I understand her concern as this isn't the same as a wedding and somethings that would be considered ok in that environment wouldn't be ok when you are talking about a funeral. Any suggestions?

How in the world would I even begin to advertise a service like this? (So far I've considered trying to contact hospice and work out something with them but even that I'm not too sure about)

I could probably go on and on with questions but thank you guys in advance for all your help. I know there is a lot I cut out and somethings that haven't even crossed my mind. The only thing I do know is that I'm serious about this, I do alot of things in my life half-assed or talk myself out of things but I'm really passionate about this.

Any advice is welcome or if you have more questions feel free to ask them.

Please be brutally honest as well, this may be a new account but I'm not new to Reddit or the internet so I can take it 😂

I NEED social interactions and to hang out with my friends like I need water like I feel an empty hole in my heart and feel like I'm watching everything from the outside and I feel we are growing more distant as time goes on. The only thing that makes me remotely happy is taking care of my plants and when I can occasionally go out to cali, but those times are getting less and less frequent and I feel like I have to fight to see my friends. I just feel so empty and like I'm living in my own personal hell, I absolutely hate Arizona and everything about it idk how to even cope with living there, I'm about 4 hours from everything I know and love and I feel like with every passing day I die a little more inside. I mean I cant even go to the doctors because my doctor is in California. I feel like I'm not even present in my own life and like I'm just there, all I do is sleep and occasionally eat and I cant even do anything to change this situation, I've applied to jobs but havent heard back, I literally just feel like giving up on everything like I dont even feel like I'm here anymore anyway so why am I even trying to be?",18Mar2019,2
144,"Back story: So I babysit (on weekdays) a 5 year old kid in the early morning until 5-6 pm (sometimes longer if the mom takes forever to get back home). 

So I do the normal babysitting stuff, I drive to their house, I wake him up and feed him, take him to school. After dropping him off, I go back home to catch up on sleep until around 12pm (sometimes 2pm if I didn’t have a good nights rest) then pick him up around 3pm and I help him with homework, then he gets to play. Doesn’t sound bad when I type it out. Sometimes when I want to do something I kind of can’t because I’m either catching up on sleep or I wake up a little to late and by the time I’ve eaten and gotten dressed, I’d need to pick up the kid. 

Because of my depression, I’ve contemplated on quitting and because I’d have more in the day to do something and not worry if I need to wake up early tomorrow or pick him up later that day. I’m obviously looking for a regular retail job because at least with that job, I’ll know the days I can do things without worrying about anything. And I can’t do much on the weekends since the places I need to go to are closed during the weekends. 

So should I quit babysitting? ",18Mar2019,7

148,"Hey guys, here it is. I'm in Oregon, btw.

I graduated from college last June with an English degree (journalism minor). After bout 6 months of living at home by the good grace of my parents, I found a job. It was as a reporter out in a small town of about 10,000 an hour from Portland. That's where I currently work and live, and have been for 3 months.

This job is in a field I thought I'd want to pursue, though now I'm not so sure. I'm not sure what it is I want to do with the rest of my life, and not knowing makes me scared. It offers me the opportunity to practice video editing/producing (something I'm beginning to love). My parents like it because it's stable. It doesn't pay much but the people are nice.

But I'm not happy. It feels like each day I'm sinking lower into some sort of depressed state. I get anxious when I think about whether this is the right path for me. It feels like I'm already planning the next 30 years, instead of experiencing my life now. My parents sort of had that mindset instilled in us growing up; get a job and a career that you can stay in for decades! They were in those types of fields (nursing and business).

I guess what I'm asking is: is it worth staying in a job that's promising even if you aren't happy? My parents tell me that I just need to gain some experience, and then I can leave for another job, maybe closer to the city. Part of me wants to just pack up, quit, move out and find a job in Portland, or drive all the way to LA and crash with my brother until I find something there. I feel trapped and I want to break out, and now I'm rambling. Sorry.

What should I do? Any advice is welcome, I'm grasping at this point. Sorry if this went off the rails.",18Mar2019,2

150,"Sometimes (extremely rarely; it's only happened twice in my life), I'll encounter a person who, without any apparent cause, just makes me feel utterly sick to my stomach. Like, I physically cannot stand being near them, to the point where I'll go far out of my way to avoid them even seeing me. It's an anxiety so intense and primal, it induces actual nausea. All for, like I said, no apparent reason. It usually takes a few weeks/months of knowing someone for the feeling to start setting in. And it's nothing even remotely resembling attraction. 

&amp;#x200B;

The first time I felt this was towards a female school faculty member in 3rd grade, but I'm currently experiencing it now. It's not affecting my life \*too\* much, but enough to cause trouble. There's a man who lives in my apartment building who gives me this feeling. Recently, I was stuck with him alone in the elevator for just a few seconds. The whole time, I genuinely anticipated him accosting/assaulting me from behind (he'd never done anything like that); THAT'S how edgy he makes me. Now this is a problem because he's a smoker, and my building's trash compactor is in the smoking area. I'm so afraid of encountering him when I go to take out my trash, I currently have 5 bags piled up in my studio apartment. I can't stand bad smells or a filthy living space, but it's preferable to the mere risk of encountering him. Or at least, it was. I'm getting fed up with constantly having to avoid him.

So, what is this feeling? Why am I experiencing it? How can I cope with it so I can live my life normally again?

152,"I got into my dream college with an essay about realizing I am lesbian, but now I no longer am confident this is true. I am not 100% sure it is not true, but I am thinking lately that it is more likely false, and I am afraid of what would happen if they found out and thought I was lying or something. It isn’t a lie, I know for sure I like girls(the only thing I am unsure of is if I like boys), and it felt very true at the time. I even felt a little bit like a burden was being lifted off my shoulders at admitting this to myself. However, I think I have made a serious mistake labelling myself this way while I am so young and with limited experiences. 

I feel like I should reach out to them somehow, but I have no idea what that would be like. I am not even out as bisexual to my family. The very idea of admitting this to anyone out loud except a close friend just gives me the heebie-jeebies. The college is very small, so it is very possible that everyone knows everyone and this could come back to haunt me if I don’t tell them in advance. 

I think I have some sort of internalized homophobia that makes me feel so ashamed to speak about my feelings, and I have no idea why because my family is super open. We even went to the lesbian wedding of a family friend when I was a little kid. Also, the essay is NOT a lie, I think I would say the ratio of girls I’ve been into to boys is around 80/20, but I am not really sure of anything.

It isn’t a very selective college necessarily, the acceptance rate hovers around 65%, but they gave me a $12,000 merit scholarship PER YEAR as well as a ton of financial aid. (And I really love the school.) I actually cried tears of joy when I was sent my aid package. I am terrified that this could be taken away. 

Is this an irrational fear? Or should I try to explain this somehow? 

I feel that I should try to tell them, but I have no idea how I would even bring that up or to whom. The very idea of it terrifies me.  I am visiting in about two weeks. I would probably have an opportunity then if that is what I need to do. 


TLDR: College accepted me and gave me merit scholarship, but I am afraid that the conclusion I made about myself in my essay is not completely true. It’s a small college and I am afraid that this could come back to haunt me somehow. Not sure what to do.

153,"I've been getting car sick since I was in elementary school. All I had to do was get in a car and I was instantly sick. (Being the person I am however I kept this fact hidden from everyone) it got better. I still got super car sick but it was EVERY time I got in the car. 

It starts as like a headache at the front of my head and it makes me feel nauseous and sick to my stomach. It takes quite a while to get rid of. Sometimes it's so bad I can barely walk up the stairs to my house, and falling asleep is my only relief. 

It's getting bad again. Every time I sit as a passenger in a car (which is often as my bf insists on always being the driver) 1-2 minutes down the road I can feel it starting. 

I also get it really bad from video games. Mostly shooters. The constant spinning and rotation of the camera makes me so sick. My bf is a big gamer and lives for shooting games, especially zombie ones. And I feel so bad... i want to play with him but I just can't. After 10-15 minutes It's too much and I can't keep playing.

159,"So this past week I [F24] just went on vacation with my boyfriend [M25] of 2 years to visit his 67 year old mother. When I first met her, she seemed perhaps a bit overbearing, but nothing too crazy. Every time since that I’ve seen her she’s gotten increasingly worse and I frankly don’t know what to do anymore. This past week was far worse than anything I’ve seen from her. Any advice is appreciated. 

So MIL lives 5 hours away and we left after my boyfriend got off work on Saturday, which landed us there at midnight. We get there and the ENITRE place is trashed like an episode of hoarders. Crap everywhere, bins everywhere, and the floor covered in god knows how many years of neglect from not vacuuming. She proceeds to make bf and I clean up her apartment with her because there was literally no room to walk. She claims she was expecting us the next day and she was going to do the cleaning then, but we told her for months that we’d be there that day. So I call BS. And if she were just a dirty person, that’d be one thing, but when she’s at our house she always cleans non stop? Especially when we both go to school/work for the day. So she knows how to clean ( more than likely an excuse just to pry and snoop, but regardless). We didn’t end up getting to even try to go to sleep until 3:30 because MIL decided she needed to clean her fridge and deep clean her bathroom at 1 am. She only stopped when she did because bf told her to go to bed like 1000 times and she finally listened. 

MIL is single and she is starting to want her “male attention fix” If you will from bf and it’s getting extremely uncomfortable. Like he had mentioned to a family member who asked that his dad looked good for his age. The next day out of nowhere she hit bf’s arm and said that she looks good for her age too and that since everyone else is in a relationship and has a significant other besides her, that she needs compliments and wouldn’t mind getting them from her son. Later that night she laid down next to him on the air mattress that we had to suffer through and PUT HER LEG OVER HIS LIKE SHE WAS TRYING TO CUDDLE/SPOON HIM. Bf immediately yelled at her to get off and she acted like nothing happened. 

I don’t know if she’s jealous that we’re in a loving relationship and she is not, or if she is jealous that bf likes me better/pays more attention to me? But it’s getting out of hand. 

She also never offered to pay for a single thing while we were there but expected us to treat her to everything? Which I get that she’s his mom, but still very ridiculous. We didn’t sign up to take her on vacation as well. And even still she was trying to get us to go to the fanciest places and she would order very expensive items off the menu. She also ordered a Bloody Mary simply so she could lick the salt off the rim and not drink it AT ALL. She then grabbed bf’s knife, scraped off the salt, and waved it in both of our faces INSISTING that we try it. We both had to yell at her to stop.  It’s like scolding a child. She did this other times at restaurants as well, like trying to pour her dressing on our salads without asking us because she thought it was so good. — just bizarre. 

While we were at bf’s aunt’s house, the aunt had to run out and told us to make ourselves at home, and the entire time MIL was going through the house opening doors and going through dressers/closets and pulling out random things to show us. We told her that aunt wouldn’t appreciate it and she just brushed it off and said we didn’t understand her relationship with her sister. We do quite well and know that the aunt wouldn’t like that. This just shows further confirmation that when she is alone at our place that she is going through everything. 

She also “forgot to mention” that she had a cold when we went down there and now we’re both sick. Just the icing on the cake, really. 

I am sure there is more but I can’t think of anything right now. I am seriously out of my depth here and I don’t know how to handle her. Bf is firm with her and is frankly more annoyed with her than I am, but rides a fine line with her as she lives out of state and she doesn’t get to see him often. ",18Mar2019,1
160,"I attended a robotics competition a few weeks ago, and by the end of the last day, my ears were ringing badly. I will be at another one in a few weeks, but I won't just be attending - I will be volunteering, so I won't be able to step out for a break from the noise whenever I feel like it. I think ear protection would be smart (especially since they emphasize safety, and I should be a good role model as an adult). I don't think ear plugs will work well as I will have to communicate with others frequently, and it's not really practical to be constantly taking them out/putting them back in. So I was thinking headphones might be a good solution.

Here's what I'm looking for:
-Noise reduction, NOT complete elimination of ambient noise
-Lightweight/reasonably compact style since I may need to put them around my neck (or whatever) when communicating with others
-Reasonable price. I can't afford to spend a ton of money on them, especially since I won't use them frequently.
-Durable/decent quality. I understand that you get what you pay for, so I'm certainly not expecting top-of-the-line for a bargain price, but I don't want to buy a shoddy quality item that will break after a few uses.
-Open to hearing-protection only types, but it would be nice if they were also audio headphones so my kids could use them as such (and we'll get more use/value from them)

If anyone has recommendations, I'd appreciate it!",18Mar2019,1
162,"My sister was recently diagnosed with a serious illness and has made her decision on who she wants to have medical information and who can visit her during treatment. She listed my mom and me as the only people allowed to make medical decisions. My 90 year old grandmother is trying to get herself the medical surrogate. 

&amp;#x200B;

My grandmother has always pinned my mom as this horrible person, which she's not she's was the first child to give up her career to take care of her father with dementia. My grandmother even said to my on occasion that she should live longer than my mom. My grandmother has always in a way been jealous of her relationship with my grandfather even though my grandparents had a great marriage. My grandmother, also didn't follow my uncles death bed wishes telling her to give my mom a new car and to fix up her house. My uncle had planned on switching my mom to beneficiary after she turned down a huge promotion out of state to continue to take care of her father. Since his death my grandmother has come into a lot of money and the other children have been showing up and bad mouthing my mom falsely accusing her of stealing. (I'm on all of my mom's account and know for a fact that's not true) She's been only given a small amount of money from her parents and it was just enough to cover her health insurance while she was on leave from work. One of my aunts has gotten more money in 2 months that my mom got in 2 years of taking care of him. My mom's been kinda devastated between my sister being sick, her brother dying,  and her dad's death.  

&amp;#x200B;

My sister and I were raised as children to my grandparents. I was close to my grandfather and my sister was close to my grandmother. After my grandfather's death my sister stepped out of my grandmother's life due my mom's other siblings attacking her and accusing her of faking being sick. My sister is getting phone calls from my grandmother insulting my mom and telling her that my mom is manipulating her. She's angry at what hospital my sister choose to get her treatment at (one of the top hospitals in the world.) One of my aunt's keeps accusing my sister of lying about her illness and called the hospital saying that someone requested her records (the only people at the hospital that can obtain the records are my mom and me.) I was with my sister when she got a phone call from the hospital saying someone requested her medical information and my mom was at work. One of my aunt's insulted my mom and sister while grandfather was on his deathbed.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm getting really annoyed with my grandmother insulting my mom to my sister (she's tried to do it to me as well). My grandmother tries to claim that she loves my sister more than my mom does. Telling my sister, my mom is manipulating her when I know every conversation between my mom and sister and know that's a complete lie. My mom and I work down the road from each other so we usually carpool and will talk on the way to and from work. Usually the conversations are about current events, plans for the night, or my mom checking on her to see how she's doing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not really sure what to do. I'm getting sick of the lies and the bullying toward my mom. I know it makes her feel like a horrible person when she not. I always joke that my grandfather with dementia was the best judgement of character. He would always tell me how great of a person my mom was and would ask how she was doing when I walked in the room. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm afraid my mom sibling and grandmother are going to try to do something to my mom and cause a mental breakdown. My mom see's a psychologist due to ptsd (abuse) and pretty much has been told she's a doormat. She mostly goes to build up confidence. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've suggested to my sister to see an attorney so they have documented her wants.

163,"So. I'm 18F and I need a job. My last three were at McDonald's, Main Event, and Sam's Club, as a cashier, busser, and café worker, respectively, and each for 6-12 months. And I hated all three. Not because they sucked. I mean, they did, and I've cried myself to sleep more times than I can count because of them, but that's not why I quit. I'm just not good at customer service.

Don't get me wrong. I like people. I like helping people out and feeling accomplished when I've worked hard towards something. But I have a lot of health issues. A bad back, slight arthritis, weak knees, bipolar disorder, extreme anxiety, sleep apnea, and PVC (a heart problem) to name a few. I just physically can't manage jobs where I'm constantly having to run around or endure high stress.

Sam's is the most recent one I quit. In fact, I haven't even turned in my notice, I've only written it up. With my health problems comes a need for many doctors (I have seven 💀) which requires a good amount of money to pay for the bills and the pills so I don't suddenly die when one too many people complain that we're out of pretzels or I'm by the ovens for a minute too long.

Anyways, because of this, I really hate quitting jobs, especially without another one lined up, but I also know my limits and I passed them yesterday. If I stay, I'm going to end up either having a heart attack or taking a long walk off a short pier. But I don't have any passions. How could I? I've done nothing but work and study since I was thirteen (babysitter) so I feel like I've never had time to just sit back and learn about myself.

I have to pay rent to my parents (they started taking money on my 18th birthday, which makes it a lot harder to save up to move out 🙄) and I drive my dad's car so I can't exactly quit my job and go cross country exploring myself and the lands. I definitely can't afford college and honestly don't want to waste the money if I end up hating whatever degree I choose. If I do go, I want to make sure I choose the right degree, but how can I do that when I know practically nothing about the world around me?

So. Tldr; 18F with too many life problems needs to find a job they'll actually enjoy that won't kill them and will help them save up to do anything with their life.

Any advice welcome. Except stripping. My fat ass would not look good on a pole. I'd probably break the pole. Plus my dad's a pastor. I'd go to hell lol.",18Mar2019,3

I am moving back to my childhood home since graduating from college. I was more or less away for 5 years. It is due to the close proximity of jobs in the big city and I do not have to pay much rent. My parents live an hour away and I visit there often. If I got to the grocery store, hardware store, etc in my childhood home area, I am being followed around or being sneaked up on my employees. It creeps me out as it is accusing me of stealing.

I mystery shop for side income and the hardware store was so bad with one employee in question (I was doing a shop for the company) I had to put it in the report as I was could not browse a shelf without this employee in my face or questioning my every move.

Yes, I’ll come down for the holidays, but my family is also relatively large (I’m very close to my family too) and might not let me see my boyfriend for as long as I want. He swears loyalty, but I can’t help but feel that he’ll have wandering eyes for some lucky girl he might meet. ((I have terrible trust issues, and I get jealous sometimes))

I know that college will have a wide variety of people, and even some of my family and friends are telling me that my boyfriend and I won’t last because I’ll meet someone. But I don’t want anyone else, I just want him. We even want to get married...

Am I just too lovesick?? How can I make sure that our relationship will last? I understand that it takes two to make a relationship work, and I’m going to do everything in my power to make sure that we stay together. I just need y’all to tell me something I need to know.

He messages me back saying he's still going to let me move in he just needs to get the other roomnate to move out first. So I get told I'll be able to move in sometime mid February.

So we’ve hung out a few times but we haven't been on a date. But we started talking a lot over the past week and it seemed like she was showing a lot of interest.

184,"Ok, so I'm almost certain this friend of mine is flirting with me. We are both women. I am openly gay. She is straight (as far as I or anyone else knows). She got dumped by her boyfriend about five or so months ago and is not over it. She also hasn't had sex for that amount of time. 

So recently, I've noticed that she's treating me differently. She was polite but indifferent before. Let me give some examples of her now: 

She asked me to accompany her to a group date (a mutual friend of ours invited a few guys to come to dinner with them, the woman in question in my post wasn't keen but couldn't say no). She ended up asking me to come along, I suppose as a social buffer. She spent the whole evening flirting with me. Sharing her food with me ('this is really good, have a bite'), eating my food, asking questions about me and my life (like a lot of them), seeming really interested in my answers, teasing, being protective of my share of meatballs, lots of eye contact, talking me and my talents up at the table, that kind of thing. 

She came up to me and a group of our friends (myself and some straight men) and looked me right in the eye and said 'this skirt is so tight right? Could it be tighter? What about my shirt? So tight right?' She pinched her shirt in a way that purposefully drew my eyes to her chest. 

She is hugging me now (we never did before) and for slightly too long. 

We are in a university class together. She arrived late and sat at the end of a group of us. She then noticed she could have sat next to me and seemed sad. I caught her staring at me. Then she moved in the break to sit with me (the dude next to her that she moved away from said 'what, do I smell?. She replied 'she smells better). 

In another class she kept whispering observations in my ear. Then when I said she had an eyelash on her lip she asked me to get it and I cupped her chin in my hand and got it for her with my finger. 

She speaks a second language and I obviously found it sexy when she did so around me, and she kept repeating phrases sexily. She also kept pointing out things we have in common. I saw her and a best friend of hers walk to have their coffee near myself and some friends at lunch, and apparently they both stared at me, the friend did a look back walking past etc.

So, I think she's flirting. But I don't understand why. She's straight as far as I know. I can't tell if this is a 'I just need validation because of my failed relationship' thing or a 'I actually want to maybe sleep with you' thing or even a tiny crush thing.

188,"[f22] Hi everyone, need some health advice. I cannot abstain myself from picking/scratching at the skin on my hands. This habit has become so frequent that it’s preformed subconsciously whenever there’s an onset of anxiety. I can’t really describe the reaction it brings other than pleasure/catharsis...which sounds totally contradictory since I’m literally digging into my own skin. I think the reasoning behind it stems from a desire to distract myself from negative and anxiety-inducing thoughts so I can focus on something more concrete and less abstract/ irrational. I live in a heavily traffic-congested area and will commonly pick when driving. The only advice I have received is to simply “muster” up the willpower to stop. This has been going on for years now and was once put on meds for it when it began. I’m a little apprehensive to jump towards psychotherapy; I’ve never been a fan of meds and would really love to avoid them if possible, but am desperate to end this habit. I am ruining my hands and becoming self-conscious of it.  Attached is a picture of the current of my hands (might be offensive to some).

I guess I'll just start from the beginning. In High School, I was a really great student; I got straight As, was very involved with campus life, did super well on my SATs, and had an amazing circle of friends. When the time came to apply to college, things went really well and I got accepted into one of the top universities in the country. It was a no brainer for me to go. I came here and got into an abusive (on both sides) relationship like a month into my freshman year. All of a sudden, grades didn't matter anymore and all I care about was my SO. I allowed it to ruin my GPA and I ended up failing a class (big oof). Things only got worse my second semester as I took an intensive Russian class I simply wasn't prepared to deal with. I was constantly teetering on the edge of failing with the class, plus the stress of the relationship, I ended basically cheating on my SO with another girl. Although my SO and I were on a break when it happened, it certainly felt like cheating at the time and I knew what I was doing was wrong. I admitted what happened and it went as well as you'd imagine it would. However, we ended up sticking together because I'm a complete idiot. The semester finishes up and I just manage to get a C- in my Russian class, killing my GPA even more. Summer rolls around and I'm still with my SO. We split in late July and I meet up with a friend from college about a week later and find out she's dating someone new already. I'm completely heartbroken. I get back to school and my ex refused to give me any space, constantly showing up with her new BF places, blaming the entire fault of the relationship on me. It was so bad I developed an anxiety disorder and could barely leave my room out of fear of seeing her. Also, did I mention she and I were in the same friend group??? Well, we were but they stopped inviting me out once my ex started dating this new guy. It was easier to deal with someone who didn't care than someone who was super depressed and needed friends more than ever. I spend the next few months in a state of terrible depression. One of the worst experiences of my life. I don't think I had ever felt so lonely. And it wasn't like I didn't try to make new friends, I literally got rejected from every club I applied to on campus and every job I applied to as well. I was heart broken, had literally no friends, and had nothing to do. I ended up making a tinder to pass the time. About two weeks in, I match with this girl and invite her over. She surprisingly agrees, comes over, and we sleep together within about 5 minutes of meeting each other. Laying there, she begins to ask me questions about myself and I just couldn't hold back the pain anymore. I just opened up about how heartbroken I was and about how hurt I was that my friends could just drop me like I was nothing to them. To my surprise, she gave me something I needed more than anything: empathy. She told me about how she had been sleeping with tons of guys since her and her long term boyfriend split right before entering college (she's the grade below me). I don't necessarily remember how our relationship progressed but we began to spend a ton of time together. She introduced me to her friend group and they were all super sweet and treated me super well. For the first time in months, I hadn't felt like I hated everything anymore. Things were good for a few months there but then I soon felt like she was beginning to pull away. She seemed spooked at the idea of a committed relationship after her last one, and began to be more distant towards me. We stopped hooking up and slowly and more slowly, we went from hanging out all the time to maybe once a week. It went on like this for a while until last night when I invited her to hang out. She said she had a ton of meetings today and so she needed to get sleep. It seemed valid enough until I got breakfast with her and her friend. Her friend made a comment about how she spent the night at a guys house. She cut him off before he could say anymore but I had already heard it. I texted her saying that I was kinda pissed that she felt the need to lie to me about not being able to come over and it ended up spiraling into an argument and we agreed we both needed space. And like that, I'm back to square one. I'm at this top university that everyone has told me would make me wildly happy and incredibly successful and I'm more miserable than I've ever been. I have literally no friends, my GPA is too low to transfer anywhere else, and I just feel trapped here. I don't know what to do or where else to post this, I just needed to get it off of my chest and hopefully just talk to someone about it all. What should I do about any of this?",18Mar2019,0

I was recently given a lovely little red male betta from my girlfriend’s college sale, but they are known for poor fish care and the fish has some fungus on him.  To make matter’s worse, I currently have him in a one gallon tank and have been made aware that anything less than 2.5 is inadvisable.  My girlfriend takes care of much more complicated fish and warned me that the little guy would need extra TLC to keep him going.

I have bacteria, ammonia, distilled water, and a heater ready to go for another tank (10 gallons!) but after reading up on prep it seems like I’ll be running a nitrogen cycle in it for at least a month.  I have a testing kit and water conditioner on the way via amazon as well as anti fungal medication for fish that I’m hoping will help clear his disease.

What I need advice on is how to keep the fish as healthy as possible during that month that he’ll have to spend in an unheated, unfiltered 1 gallon tank while the big, proper tank is still being cycled.

196,"I'll try to be brief. 

I'm a 19 years old guy that it's in the middle of his first law school grade. It's a 4 year grade if you pass everything at the first try and I'm not that kind of student, my guess is that it's going to take at least 6 years. I started liking this grade first months but I rapidly lost interest in the second quarter and now I'm not going to class at all. 

This last week's I've been thinking about dropping off and going for a 2 year grade of a different kind that I don't know if I'd like. The thing is that I'm not 100% sure about dropping off and now I'm afraid that this last 2 weeks of not going to class are gonna set me too far behind to catch up. My best friend who was in my same class dropped off (that's one of the reasons I'm going to class).

Another reason why I'm not completely sure about dropping off are my parents. They are really strict and I've been told that if I didn't pass everything I would have to pay for it with my own money and I don't really have the means for that. I didn't tell them yet that I'm thinking about dropping off and I intended to tell them when get 100% sure of what I'm going to do next year. And the worst part is that I don't know if they would pay for this 2 year grade if I decided to drop off and change.

That being said, I really think that law school has more jobs in the market but I don't know if anything that has to do with law is going to make me happy and since I'm probably going to be stuck with what I study forever I really want to make the best decision possible.

If you are thinking about asking me what do I like, the thing is that I don't really like anything at all and I don't think I have a talent on something specific that could mean a job later on. 

I hope it's understandable and wanted to apologise in advance if something wasn't clear (I'm not native English speaker).

 I understand the assumptions or Prejudice that might come from someone looking at a resume and seeing that I've worked at a weed store for so long. But I am a hard worker and I know it and I have had a lot of random jobs since I was 16 years old.

My goal when starting to work at a dispensary was to get into a new emerging market and learn how it works from the inside out. It is very interesting to see the legality and the different obstacles that a state legal but not federally legal product has to overcome. I have learned a lot and gained a lot of useful knowledge that I feel can be applied to other industries and work enviroments. I used to consume pretty heavily but haven't used any kind of THC product for months for both professional and personal reasons.

But I have heard rumors of companies throwing away resumes and aren't considering people for knowing that they have worked at a dispensary and that worries me. Does anyone have any advice on how I can approach future potential jobs or Market myself two other employers? 

I work as a shift lead so aside from General customer service and maintenance of the shop there are a lot of things such as team leadership, training, money handling, State compliance and laws, Inventory management and general opening and closing procedures and according to state law.

Thanks for any advice or info reddit!

After some spazzing out, I order a ride on my phone since my bus card and cash were in the wallet. I don't recall what the charge was supposed to be, but it was acceptable enough that I didn't think twice apparently.

Anyway, I get home, cancel my cards, try to calm down, etc. I get an email in the morning from the rideshare company saying the charge failed. The $100+ charge for maybe a 25 minute ride. Whatever card was attached to my account had been closed before the charge could go through. It said I can't use the service again until I update my payment info. 

I check the details of the email further, and the driver had not reported me dropped off once I got to my home and he kept going for a while longer while driving a fair amount around town before finally ending ""my ride"".

I am not sure what to do here. If I call the company, what is likely to happen? Will they try to make an adjustment, comp the ride completely, or what?

211,"Alright y’all sorting by new, buckle in because the only way to fully convey what’s going on takes a lot of typing (and reading) but if you can’t sleep like me, this should give you something to do. 

I’m (18F) in a relationship with a boy (18M). We’ve been dating for almost three months. (Before anyone reads the rest and judges me for caring so much about a short little relationship, just know, it’s hard to let go of someone you genuinely love, even if it’s only been a few months). Our relationship started pretty good, very cute and fun and lovey. 

My boyfriend has severe depression and severe anxiety. This was something I was handling well at the beginning of our relationship and now it is spiraling out of control and I’m losing my boyfriend. He basically has the LOWEST opinion of himself, it debilitates him from even speaking to anyone when he has really bad moments of depression and self-loathing. I thought I could “love him enough” to make him see he’s worthwhile. Yeah, no. In these past couple of weeks, I have cried like almost every single day. Why? Because he has recently told me he doesn’t know if he’s ready for a relationship, because he can’t even like himself.

This started when I tried to ask him to appreciate me a bit more. I told him I felt unappreciated and that sometimes all I wanted was a “you look nice today” and I would feel much better. This sent him into hours of depression and silence and concluded with him telling me “I can’t make you happy, all you do is tell me everything I do wrong.” To save time, this is basically just not true. I try to remind him every day that I love him, and why I do, but he will not hear it. 

When he has good days, he is REALLY good. We can laugh and cuddle and be in love and everything is awesome. But if I ask him to do something for me, or if I ask him about me staying with him for spring break, he gets defensive and locks up and tells me that no one should like him, that everyone leaves him, and that he’s the worst. Naturally this makes me want to love him harder and bring him out of it, this forgetting the thing I was originally asking of him. 

As I type this out, I realize this sounds like emotional manipulation. I get it. But I love this guy. I love him so much it hurts. And I’m losing my relationship. After him saying he wasn’t sure if he was ready for a relationship, I talked him out of it for the night because it was really late and it was through text so I told him to sleep on it. That was last week, and after talking in person tonight, I asked if he was going to break up with me. He said “I’m not saying I am, but I also don’t want to lie.” So, I’m completely stuck. 

I’m at the point where it is going to hurt so bad if we break up, but I’m ready for it at any second. I want him to just do it and get it over with if he doesn’t want to be with me, but I also don’t want to initiate it because I love him. Am I actually insane for staying with him, and letting him play with my feelings? Or am I just in love and can’t see what’s going on? Please, anyone, just tell me what to do. ",18Mar2019,1

I have always been a bit stubborn with the thought that a degree, no matter the subject, would be the key in landing a good job ....but after seeing others around me do well with no degree it makes me wonder if I am wasting my time and money.

They are very traditional in their culture in that all the family members (grandparents/parents/aunts/uncles/siblings/cousins/in-laws) live together in a small 3 bedroom house, where the men work, and the women stay at home and take care of the home &amp; family. They also have as many children as possible. Right now there are 3 toddlers and 1 infant and one woman is pregnant. 

Next door is a MAD house. For whatever reason, they are completely quiet in the daylight hours, and all the commotion begins at night around 11 PM. Every. Single. Night.

The toddlers are constantly screaming, shrieking, laughing, yelling, crying, running and stomping throughout the whole house, banging doors, throwing things all while the infant is crying. This goes on until it finally calms down until 4-5 AM and then it’s complete silence until the next evening.

Even the toddlers sometimes go outside around midnight and start running, yelling, and crying. They have no concept of bedtime at all.

215,"Throwaway account: My wife and I are back in college together, married 9 years this year. My wife is a kind person and befriended an obviously obnoxious, but seemingly harmless girl who is going through our program. The girl has a 9 year old son, and the first thing I hear about this kid is: ""my kid is annoying but I have to take care of him."" The girl begins to buy my wife her favorite drink every day I am not in class with her. My wife invites, let's call her Karen and her son let's call him Henry, over to play with our 7 year old son. Now I've had to cut a sociopath or two out of my son's life before so I'm always weary of bigger kids and I didn't leave them alone. Playdate was weird the kid obviously has issues but we didnt pass judgement.

 We quickly start hearing the stories about Henry (from Karen and some mutual friends). Henry had been booted out of two schools now and is being home schooled. We heard stories of him hurting dogs and rodents from someone who had know Karen for a couple years. ""Henry is a violent kid I'd watch out for your kids"" our friend candidedly told me. The mother had called the police on him before because he had such a severe temper tantrum. 

Recently Karen insisted on accompanying my wife to the ER when she had a kidney stone at school when I was home with the kids. My wife told me Karen was erratic and started talking about the meth addiction she kicked, how she didn't want to get a job because it would mess with her ssdi and how she wants to prostitute herself on tinder to make money. The hospital staff all seemed to know Karen, so she admitted that she has been marked as a drug seeker at that particular  ER which explained why my wife was treated so horribly after having such a great experience 6 months ago. 

Then Karen dropped some bombs. She claimed that she suspects Henry's dad of majorly abusing Henry and having an incestuous relationship with his mother Henry's grandmother. They live together in a trailer with no water or bathrooms and Henry has to use the public bathroom at the park down the road or go in a bucket. Then she admitted to leaving Henry alone by himself for a few hours at a time while she goes to school with us. The weird thing is she can't afford classes and lost her financial aid. CPS is minorly involved and wants to send him to a boarding school for troubled kids.

She started showing up at our house recently too. She apparently is friends with our neighbor and has been driving by our house 4 times a week to help our neighbor ""deliver meds to her grandma"". 

Today was the first and last time Henry  showed me his violent side. There was a group playdate that Henry was a pest the whole time. Towards the end, My son was eating a sugar cone and Henry said ""eat the bottom first,"" when my son  went to eat the cone he slammed it into my son's mouth and he started bleeding. I feel for the kid I really do. Adults are failing him and he is reacting. That being said, I want to go straight to cps and tell her to her face but my wife is worried because Karen is bipolar and getting really intense. She's worried about our safety. I'm worried about the system I'd be throwing him too and what the ethical way to proceed with all of this. Any ideas?

Tldr; Just another case of a Karen being a fucking Karen and needs to have her kid taken away. ",18Mar2019,2
216,"This isn’t really “advice”, but I want opinions. I’m just curious. I hate to be a damsel in distress, and I’m all for being a self sufficient woman who can take care of herself, and that’s why I feel so conflicted. 

When I watch a movie, read a book, or even see a male become fiercely protective of his female counterpart in person, it really makes me covet that. I don’t mean “protective” in a controlling way, but just a protective way where he cares for her well being. This can be in a romantic setting or a parent/child relationship. It just appeals to me for some reason. 

My husband is simply wonderful and I know he will always take care of me and keep me safe, so I don’t necessarily think I am lacking there. Growing up, my dad was (and is) a nice man, but a very laid back parent. He basically just let me do what I wanted in terms of friends, boyfriends, etc. Sometimes I did (and do still) feel that he didn’t really care what I did. 

Anyway, I know that the protectiveness quality is stereotypical and of course amplified in movies and television to make characters seem more endearing. However, I genuinely want to know the psychological aspect of why this is such an endearing trait to me and others? Why is this something we look for in a male/female relationship as a society? Is it simply primal? Are we conditioned to think this is how relationships should be?

For me, I think it’s wanting to know that someone values me enough to be willing to fight for me or put themselves in the “line of fire” for me. That’s sad that I feel like I need that to feel valuable as a person. I am comfortable with myself as an individual, but I think I lack some self confidence about my physical appearance.  So to think that someone would feel passionate enough about my livelihood and happiness to fight for it is almost flattering. I am self aware enough to recognize  that it is an unhealthy mentality and that it’s also just an unrealistic expectation for relationships, but I wanted to come here for perspective on this without seeming like a loony person.

I’m a sophomore in college and just came back to my college town from spring break.

When I got in and turned on the lights I found that all of the black cabinets had white marks on them kind of looking like water stains and that the lower shower faucet was and still is leaking profusely.

i’m 19F and have never been in a proper relationship, i’m also still a virgin - my friends don’t know this because i’m too embarrassed to mention it. 

i’m not into casual hookups, and have been interested in being in a relationship since high school, but i’ve never found anyone who likes me enough. 

i’m not shy, and my friends all enjoy my company and tell me i’m funny and nice to be around. i’m not overweight, in fact i used to be a little chubby but i’ve lost a little over 20 pounds the past few months and consider myself quite fit. i wouldn’t say i’m particularly pretty, i think i’m average however my friends say i’m pretty, but i think that’s just them being nice to me.

i’m just getting a bit tired of being lonely.

i have approached a few guys from my classes that i thought were interested in me, one completely ghosted me after getting a girlfriend. and another still talks to me in class but completely ignored my text asking to hangout.

i like to think i dress nicely, my hygiene is good, i don’t know what the problem is.

my self esteem isn’t the highest, i’ve been working on it, but in person i come off as confident. i just don’t seem to understand why no one seems interested in me.

one of my friends is currently dating a guy that hooked up with me once, i never mentioned it, and i don’t think he has either.

has anyone else been in this situation? i’m in a couple clubs, i talk to people after class, and i have no problem making friends. i just can’t seem to get past the ‘friend’ phase.

i’m pretty much the “girl next door” to every guy i meet. it seems like there’s always a girl who’s prettier and funnier than i am. 

sorry this was a bit of a rant, but i was also hoping someone could give me some tips on meeting guys? i have tinder but don’t really use it because i’m not interested in hookups, i go to bars and clubs with my friends, but everyone is just too drunk to talk to haha

tldr: all my friends are in relationships. i think i’m pretty funny and nice, i’m outgoing, but i can’t seem to find any guy interested in me. tips?

There are about 10 of us there, and it is dead quite all period. No one talks and I find the time passing extra slowly.


The teacher never teaches, he’s a young 30-year old EMT and is only giving us daily bookwork. He spends the rest of the time chatting with this girl who graduated, but comes back daily for some reason. 


The class is an elective in my SLC: Medical and Sciences Academy, but the head teacher of this SLC is a huge douchebag. She said “No” multiple times when I requested to go into culinary arts and is just a bully in general (but that is another story).


I am not interested in becoming anything remotely in the medicinal field and I am uncomfortable doing work regarding injuries, sicknesses, and helping people when they are bleeding out/dying. What should I do?

230,"So this amazing girl is someone I’ve known for 5 years through church and I think I love her. We talk every day and think about our future. This is going to sound stupid, but we are very young. I’m a sophomore in high school and she is in middle school, (she’s only one year younger than me though). I don’t know what to do because I want to date her but I’m worried about how other people will respond. I’m well respected in my church, but I’m afraid that will diminish if I carry on pursuing her. I’ve met no other girl like her and we have supported each other through thick and thin.
On the other hand, I’m always showered with guilt because I’m afraid I’m holding her back from enjoying middle school. I want her to focus on what she wants and worry about me.

231,"There's this girl I've been friends with ever since we were 12/13 (we are 18 now) and lately she is pissing me off. I shall list down the different things that made me mad so you guys can see if I'm being rationally ticked off or not.

&amp;#x200B;

1. There was this girl she fought with for like 2 years and hated on and ranted to me (&amp; other friends about) but lately she is suddenly all over that girl again, they're suddenly best friends again. &amp; I was just wondering.....what? how did she slide from one extreme to another
2. She claims to have had a crush on this other girl 2 years ago (&amp; apparently a one-sided one) &amp; made such a big deal about it then, especially about the fact that she was 'bisexual' or 'pansexual' (can't remember). Just 3 years before she made sure she told everyone she was 'asexual'. Nowadays all she shows interest in are guys.
3. She is so caught up about being rich. Her father does earn a lot, but because they have 4 kids in the family it gets evened out and her household income per capita becomes like the average person. Anyhow, she makes sure she rubs elbows with rich people (although she looks so dumb &amp; also idolises the wrong type of rich people) (AKA white people and the noveau riche) as well as tries her best to make herself look rich.

3a. She buys herself stuff from expensive brands, but they're either tacky or from the cheaper section. 

3b. Boasted to everyone about how she was going to move into a 5 storey house but ended up moving to a tiny  

apartment. 

3c. Anything that is expensive, she likes. Even if it's ugly. She's just so materialistic

3d. For someone who wants to be seen as rich &amp; seen hanging out with rich people, she sure does hang around many unclassy people who she claims to hate (but still hangs out with???? very similar to point 1).

3e. For someone who wants to be seen as rich &amp; classy, she speaks very poorly in the 'not-rich' accent, sorry to say.

4. Once kept telling everyone that she has bipolar disorder even though she never went to a doctor or professional to test or prove this. She probably did internet tests or something

5. She hates white people. (By the way, she is Asian &amp; I am half-Asian, half-white. We both live in Asia). She'll criticise/make fun of white people on her social media platforms. Yeah, I've experienced 'satire' or people ironically making fun of white people (for example, hillbillys or white moms or dumb social media stars). But sometimes it sounds like she actually hates them. Idk if I'm allowed to get angry at this because reverse racism doesn't exist, and white people are the 'oppressor'. But it's like she's biting the hand that feeds her: both her parents were educated in the white country that I come from + she born there too! (How has she, in particular, been oppressed, especially in a country where Asians are the majority anyway?)(AND she is boasting about going on holiday there in June at the same time). Convenient hatred on her part?



At the end of all this, we're friends because we're all part of a friend group. I've known her and her family for very long too, her mother and sisters adores me and I like them back too. She's also a responsive friend and a good listener. But...yeah

So-- given all this, what should I do? I'm quite conflicted. Currently I've just been doing my best to look past all these reasons that I've talked about above.

235,"I work at a small local company where aside from the manager, there are a total of 3 fully trained employees, one additional employee who is scheduled one shift a week, and two untrained newbies. So, often we are working alone in the store. 


I got sick during my shift and had to leave, I texted my manager asking her to call someone in, as the only available employees a) I was unsure she was comfortable with them working or b) would refuse to come in because she’s always said no in the past. 

The next day I come in and there’s a note on the board saying “if you cannot work your shift, it is your job (not mine) to find a replacement”

Couple things to note here: I had a family emergency/death a few months ago and had to leave out of town for a few days. I got someone in to cover my shift, and even found a cover for their shift later that night. Additionally found covers for my next two shifts before even telling my manager I was leaving town. I have also never asked for her to find me a cover my entire time there, and she knew I wasn’t feeling well from when I came in for my shift. 

I almost quit right there and closed the store since it’s apparently not her job to make sure someone’s working :-) I’ve been thinking about quitting for a while now, as my manager is stressing me out by messing up simplistic things, forgetting to inform us on important information such as specials, and emailing the schedule half way through the work week. She is also failing to answer her phone (such as last week when my terminal went down and all the cards were being processed offline and the passwords to get it back up weren’t working).

I decided my second year I would start an applied science course which I loved but about half way through my anxiety resulted in me not leaving the house at all, this ment I was able to complete the course on a lower grade but I was unable to apply for the second year, this also ment i was unable to apply for university. For about 2 years after college I was at the point where I was unable to leave the house at all, however I met my significant other in college and she has supported me greatly.

Now with her help I have been able to get out a lot more and recently I got a job at a local pizza hut as a delivery driver. I love this job but due to my age I'm only on £6 an hour which is barely enough to cover rent on my current hours and im having to borrow money when my car inevitably breaks down from the constant driving and just can't afford to work here anymore.

I'm at the point where I dont know what to do with life at all. I want to find a career that I will enjoy and that has prospects of promotions however they all require experience (which you can't get without a job that gives experience) and I'm in no way financially able to do university at this point in my life.

244,"I'm 21 year old female and I am going to finishing my Bachelors degree very soon. I'm scared. Scared for the future with living back at home and job prospects.

Home is very turbulent for me. My dad died almost 4 years ago now. It's not the same with him gone when I go back weekends to visit. Mom and I disagree and argue a lot. 

When I was in my mid teens, after years of emotional abuse and psychological abuse, I realised with both relief that I could name it and absolute dread that its a common thing, that my mom is a narcissistic person. She gaslights me, uses emotional information I tell her to use against me in arguments, twists the words and meanings, constantly questions my love for her, is quick to anger and incredibly sensitive about her ""intelligence and mind"" - even when I am clearly not questioning either -, exaggerates what I've done or said to other people... Lies about what I've done or said and even does this about other people, completely changes past events to suit her narrative, does not let me finish my sentences, does not listen to me, disrespects my opinions.... I could honestly go on and on. 

She is quite horrible. However I still love her. And there are moments where I value her advice and insight or what she has done for me growing up. Of course these things a very much overshadowed by her actions and words throughout my life. I understand also, that she was not born this person she is. She went through some nasty narcissistic parenting herself and this is the result.

Anyway, the reason I'm scared is that I don't think I can cope with her any longer. Being away in college and living a life that doesn't involve her everyday has been eyeopening, comforting and rewarding. However, it has left me complacent and I forget sometimes what its like to live with her until I visit etc. I don't think how much I can express how scared I am. Very very much so. 

When I was 13, I tried suicide. Mainly because of my mom and how she treated me. Luckily I didn't die. Being away from home, has helped me heal and reexamine myself in ways that have enlightened who I am and how she affected me. I'm afraid that being home, and experiencing her torture will harm my mental health again.

On top of this, I have decided to take a year out of continuing to do my masters. Mostly because I feel I can be too distracted and a masters degree deserves and needs a lot of dedication and motivation. Secondly, I wanted to explore other avenues of interest and see if there is anything else I would like as a career. Lastly, I want to understand and take note of the job environment; teamwork, consistency, commitment etc. Just to basically grow in knowledge and understanding.

However, because I'm doing a humanities degree... Jobs aren't as easy to enter or find. This has led to being crying a lot and I feel this pressure to do well in my essays and dissertation and exams. I haven't been the best student (relationship issues/breakup) and I honestly feel a little bit hopeless about my future.

If anyone can help, I will appreciate it so so much. Everything is going to change so much for me soon and I feel like I won't be able to cope.

247,"I'm taking a pick up college class in ecology as I wanted to for my own benefit. But, it's turned more into a nightmare.

FYI: I'm not receiving a grade for this class. It's part of a life long learning program put on by my school for students who have graduated. It cost me lab fees.

I'm part of this 4 person lab group, and we are behind. I tried getting people to go and get samples back before the weather got bad, but no dice.

So last week, I decided to take the reigns and get the project rolling. I emailed everyone on Wednesday letting them know to email me when they could and couldn't go to get samples on Saturday.

No one replied, so I got the first around of samples alone Saturday morning. That night, I ended up fielding emails from my lab partners about how they were busy and asking when I could pick them up for next week. I don't really care, just communicate what is going on is my big deal.

So, against my own judgement, I scheduled another sample gathering the next weekend. I figured I'd give them another chance.

It was the same crap shoot as before, except more about me not being able go gather samples even though I've been getting the samples alone.

Essentially, no mature communication between us. I gave everyone 4 to 7 days to email me their availability and if they needed a ride, both sessions. I even waited for emails till Midnight the day before to see if anyone needed a ride for the next day.

These kids ( I'm in my 30s btw, they are all under 23) aren't really there, like they don't care. I'm at a point I just want to walk away from class, but that's the easy way out. 

 I'd like a letter of recommendation for graduate school from the professor, but I don't know if I can bring myself to deal with this for another 2 months. They are my partners for the rest of the semester, so changing isn't an option.

I know my soft skills are rusty, and I'm part of the problem. But, is this shit even worth it?

TLDR: I'm and older student with young lab partners that don't care. I ended up doing most of the lab planning and sample gathering. I'm not getting a grade for the class as I'm taking the class for fun. Wondering if I should stay to see the nightmare through for a chance at a recommendation?

248,"I met this girl on Freshman year of college. We talked occasionally, like normal friends do. Gradually, I became more attached to her and finally declared my love for her on Valentine's day (risky, but I think it paid off). She said that she never had a boyfriend, and that she thinks the guys she had a chance with gave up on her because of her fault. However, she thought I was a nice guy and that I'm ""not like those guys that are in it just for fun"" and would give me a chance.

We started talking a bit more frequently, and I would flirt with her with memes via text message every day. At first, she would love these messages, but now she doesn't say much about it (like not replying at all). 

A few weeks passed, I wanted to take the relationship to the next level, so one day after class I told her with my heart everything I thought about her. She said she ""appreciated it"" and that I ""was a great guy"" and all that, but didn't give me any indication that she felt the same way about me. I also mentioned her about past experiences I've had with girls, and that she was special to me and I didn't want to ruin the chance I have with her. She proceeded to give me good advice about relationships in general, like that we have to value the people we connect with but also be ""independent"". I thanked her for the advice, and we hugged and I went back to my apartment. 

It's been a week after I told her all that and I've texted her a couple times, but we haven't talked anything serious ever since. I'm not sure what to do at this moment. Maybe she isn't ready for a commitment just yet, but how do I let her know that she can believe in me? I'm an open-minded guy and I can understand if this isn't the right time for her. Maybe she just doesn't fell the same towards me or she's afraid that something may happen that screws up our relationship. To be honest I've never been in a serious relationship either, so I'm a bit scared as well. So r/Advice, what should I do?

TL;DR: Met this girl in freshman college. Fell in love with her, she gives me a chance and we start talking. Few weeks later I wanted to take the relationship to the next level, but she didn't seem to feel the same way. Now I'm not sure what to do to make her believe in me.",18Mar2019,1

I don’t know if it’s just because of the culture (Japan is quite reserved), or me not understanding so much of the language, or just because my work doesn’t allow me to have much people to interact with (it’s a small cram school, I have a shifting schedule, I don’t have weekend offs) But if I’d have weekend offs, I do join some hikes here and there, go to tourist spots, go to bars and clubs, I think I’ve done almost everything around here that there’s no reason for me to stay any longer? I have planned to move to somewhere else but I don’t feel like I’d feel any better. People living away from home, not wanting to go home yet, any advice? I’ve been looking for jobs somewhere else, but nothing has yet sparked an interest. Maybe I could get some here. ",18Mar2019,2
250,"I (19m) told one of my friends’ (19f)a pretty big secret Saturday night and I stressed to her that she couldn’t tell one specific person who happens to be my roommate. The next morning I just woke up but they didn’t know I was awake. They were talking normally but then started to whisper so I got real suspicious. Eventually I “woke up” and decided to take a shower. But before I left I turned on my voice memos to record what they were saying (I know that’s bad) and what do you know, they were talking about it. I’m pissed and asked her if she told him and she insists that she would never do that to me and blah blah blah. I want to tell her that I literally have evidence of her doing this but at the same time, that’s not that great of me that I did that but I had to know. Please help I don’t know what to do because this hurts me that she would lie to my face when I questioned her about it for hours.

251,"I apologize for the length this post will require, there is a lot of background that is required for you to understand my dilemma. I also am fairly new to posting to reddit, so if the format is wrong, I also apologize for that as well.

&amp;#x200B;

My father was immensely physically and mentally abusive. I spend my entire childhood and some of my early adulthood terribly afraid of him. He would go from one of the most charismatic, amazing to be around people you could meet, to a psychopathic killer with a drop of a hat. There were several times that I missed WEEKS of school due to the bruises and cuts I would have on me. He was also this abusive to my mother as well. My mom refused to leave him because she was a devout Pentecostal Christian and felt it was her ""Godly duty to be a good wife."" My father also had us move about ever 6 months due to running from cops, or running from people he pissed off (A couple being fairly serious drug dealers) and one time we even ran from the mafia (Its another long fucking story). We never stayed in one place for anyone to notice the patterns or abuse, and I had no one I could really reach out too. Finally once I got old enough and got over his brain washing that I couldn't sustain myself, I left. This happened a lot later than it should have admittedly.

Cut to a couple years later, I found an amazing woman, fell in love with her and her family, and got married. They all treated me better than I could of ever asked. I also found that the further I got away from church and religion as a whole, I found that I truly didn't believe in any of it. I has always been forced to jump through all the hoops that pentecost requires, and once I was able to get some distance and realize how stupid most of it was, I wanted nothing to do with it. There had also been something things I had seen on the inside that were truly disgusting. Youth pastors sleeping with young girls, ministers steeling money and equipment for their own personal use, etc. Anyways, for once in my life I felt actually at home somewhere. We had our own Apartment, and jobs that weren't the best, but we were fucking living our own lives.

 Eventually, my mom contacted me and let me know that she was leaving my dad and moving away to some of her church friends. I congratulated her and since she was doing so, I felt comfortable slowly starting to open up communication with her again. We never had the conversation about my beliefs, and she never really asked.

Jump forward a few years and I get a call from her. She tells me that she had just gotten approved for her Disability and received her back pay (around $20,000), but after she paid her friend some rent she had owed her (around $2,000) the friend told her to get out. She told me she didn't have anyone who could help her get started, and asked if I could come help her get set up. The wife and I talked it over and decided that she was my mother and she deserved a chance. So we dropped everything, put in notice at our jobs and apartment, sold what wasn't vital, and took off to help her. (And before anyone says the reason I was going to her for the money as well, I never saw a penny of that money. Outside a couple nights motel getting there looking for a place to rent, and part of the deposits for said place, My wife and I never got anything, and didn't want anything. It was hers and hers alone.)

When we get there, walking in the door, who else is sitting in her motel room other than my father. She had decided to take him back (after he heard that she got her money of course) because she just wanted her family together. At this point, I was stuck. We had some money with us, but it wouldn't of been enough to turn around and start over alone in TN (although I wish now we would of tried). So we went to work and trying to put our family together. 

Long story short, nothing had changed, several fights occurred, my dad ended up taking off with most of moms money leaving her high and dry. Me being a survivor with the love and support of an amazing wife, made it work. We have lived her for going on two years now. My wife and I both have decent paying jobs (actually better paying than the once I left) and we are doing quite good. Mom after several back and forth's with dad, has finally completely divorced him, and we haven't seen him for about a year and a half. The thing that finally cause her to cut ties was him, was that she found out that he was Bisexual, and that he has slept with several men during their relationship. This bothered her so badly that she finally cut ties... You know, it wasn't that he beat the shit out of her only son on multiple occasions, it was that he was Bi...that is some pretty fucked up shit that lets you see your moms actual priorities. 

 Anyways, here we are. We are doing pretty good for ourselves here, but we are ready to go back home, but mom refuses to leave her ""church family"". You know, the ones that couldn't even help her when she was being kicked out in the first place? I have so much anger in my heart for her, but at the end of my day I try to keep her happy, because she is my mom. That might be stupid, but you only ever get one mom, and I KNOW there is no hope of me having a good relationship with one of my parents, I feel that I owe it to try with the other. My in-laws have an apartment sitting ready for us to come back at any moment. We both have jobs that are begging us to come back. I also have some deer close friends that miss me.

Am I wrong for wanting to tell my mother that she has 6 months to find somewhere to live, because I'm going home? If that isn't wrong, why do I feel so fucking guilty about wanting to do that?

The only reason I would go here next year is because my girlfriend of 15 months goes here. The last thing I want is to break up with her or do a long distance relationship.

I remember when I was younger what I was like, I was creative and had lots of passions. Right now? I don’t give a shit. 

Music doesn’t give me the emotional high it once did. Hanging out with my friends feels like a formality. A year or so ago I was going through a tough time and I was sorta depressed, felt like crap. But this numbness I hate almost worse then that. I don’t think I’m depressed, I’m just sick of not feeling any emotions anymore.

254,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for about a year and a half. We’re both 22, and he’s working and planning in going back to school this fall. He’s been friends with a bunch if his friends for years, but for some reason they’ve all been losing contact recently. One of the friends he’s losing contact with has been his friends since elementary school. He went on family trips with the family and they were like brothers. I’ve met they guy and he’s pretty chill. No matter how many times he tried to text or call him, the only way my bf can get ahold of him is to call his mother so she can tell him to call back. 

From my point of view, it seems that his friend is ready to move on and is ignoring him. It pains me to say that but it appears to be the case. It kills me because it’s breaking my man’s heart to see his best friend walking away from their friendship like that. I would offer to share my friends but most of them are women and the only guys I’m friends with live too far away to hang out regularly. Because his social circle is dissolving, I’ve had to pick up a lot of social and emotional slack and it’s been very difficult for me (I’m kind of an introvert and too much social interaction wears me out. He’s an extrovert and NEEDS social interaction or he goes crazy)

256,"First of all, I'm drunk so sorry if there are any typos. I don't even know where to start. Her and I have known each other for years. We went to high school together and we were friends in HS but we didn't really start hanging out until summer of 2017. That was a couple months after she broke up with her high school boyfriend. She hit me up and asked if I wanted to hang out and I said sure. So we hung out, things went great. She was a lot of fun to talk to and everything and so we hung out more over the summer. I'm not gonna lie I fell for her hard. Until she started talking to her ex again. On the 4th of july she went to watch fireworks with him and she made sure to send me a snapchat of her with him. That was the first hint that told me ""maybe she doesn't have my best interests in mind"" because it fucked me up. At the time, I didn't really have much in my life except for her. I attempted suicide. Not only because of her but because of a culmination of things. I didn't end up going through with it obviously.

Fast forward to like August. She's dating her ex again but we still talk sometimes. In my drunkeness I ask her if she wants to come see my dog one last time and she surprisingly agrees. This kicks off 8 months of cheating with me and lying to her boyfriend that only stopped when he proposed. Yup you read that right. 8 months. Complete with her confessing her love to me in about November and saying she would break up with her boyfriend for me. She never did. He proposed in April and she said yes. Things were fine for awhile. We didn't talk over summer 2018 at all because she was living with her bf. It was tough but I made it through that summer surprisingly. We started texting again when we both went back to college in august 2018. Just friend stuff. It was clear that the cheating was all behind us. I was never proud of what I did and so I never pushed her to cheat again and she obviously regretted it. So we had a good thing going until January of this year.

Her fiance dumped her. She was pretty devastated and I was the first person she went to for comfort. As soon as it happened she called me and I drove 45 minutes to her to help her through it. No sex or anything. And the past couple of months have been weird. We have been texting every day and talking on the phone for 1 hour+ multiple nights a week. We hang out occasionally and we started having sex again. I caught feelings again. Like a dumbass. But from various comments I can tell that she doesn't want anything more than a FWB. And as if this wasn't already clear, she started talking to another guy that we went to highschool with. And she's taking every opportunity to dangle that fact over my head. She's fucking with me. Just like she did in July 2017 when she got back with her ex and contributed to my attempted suicide.

So here's my dilemma. Day to day, I really do enjoy having her as a friend. The occasional sex is also a bonus. But I feel like she almost enjoys fucking with my emotions. We're both on spring break right now. She was here on Fri night and we had a lot of fun together. She said she would come back over tonight. But earlier today she texted me ""Hey I forgot I told (other guy) I would hang out with him tonight sorry"". Is this just proof that she's fucking with me? Proof that her entire motive in life is to get two guys to fight over her? She's a self admitted attention whore. She even told me about a week ago ""You give me attention and I give you sex. That's the deal.""

I just texted her an hour ago and asked if we could hang out tomorrow. She said yeah. I'm not gonna turn that down because I really do like her as a person. But after she leaves, do I block her on snapchat, twitter, facebook, etc? And tell her to stop texting me? I honestly don't know. On one hand, the fact that she toys with me is a big source of anguish in my life. On the other hand, talking to her is one of the only sources of happiness in my life right now. I just need a third opinion I guess.

I left a lot of shit out. It's a long and complicated relationship. Any questions, just ask. I'm gonna go take more shots.

Ok heres some of my family history: my mom and dad split up when I was born, (wow so ""tragic"" I know) She wasnt in the best place when she was pregnant with me (drugs and alcohol) but once she knew about me she realized she had to change. She worked her ass of to support me and spoil me because I was her first baby. She got us an apartment, got a new boyfriend(we'll call him dad A it will make sence later) and a new baby on the way (sister 1) (not from dad A) by the time I was two. Life was good from what I can remember dad A loved me and my sister like his own and eventually had a baby with my mom (sister 2). Life was normal for about 8 years and im about 10 and my mom breaks up with dad A. It was crazy dad A was very upset and we had to put a restraining order on him for a while. They wernt married but it was still like a divorce. That all past and and my mom got an other boyfriend (dad B). It was typical new step dad protcal being dificult and unaccepting then him growing on us. I was already blooming into a beautiful young teen at that point so he had to deal with all my akward teen things and deal with my angsty teen attitude. He was a very strict man and for that he gained my respect. He had two kids with her (brother and sister 3) He worked his ass of in the oil fields to suport us and to be honest I should have appreciated him more. 

Ok heres a little character list so no ones confused
Og dad- my real dad
Dad A- my first step dad
Dad B- my second step dad
Mom- my mom
Sister 1- my first sister (second oldest)
Sister 2- my second sister (third oldest)
Brother- my only brother (fourth oldest)
Sister 3- baby sister (youngest)
Me-...me


As I grow up I realize my moms an alcoholic and a pothead but its not too big of a deal as most of my family are alcoholics and most people smoke weed im my small mid-class town. My mom did sometimes leave to drink and smoke and not come home till the next day without telling us but no big deal it didnt happen too often and she was always back the next day plus I was there to look after the kids and the older sister. I always wanted to get mad at my mom for stuff like this but she would always tell me that when I was a teen (which I was at that point) that I was going to hate her and regret it later so I didnt about 4 or 5 years later current time she moved to new mexico for a few months before moving back to texas (yee haw am I right) during that time I moved in with my grandma instead of moving with them because of the program I was In at my school. When my mom moved back I didnt move in back with her. My grandma although a little crazy was much more caring and I felt much more happier with her. I had been dealing with bad anxiety then, I went to a counselor for a few weeks before my mom stopex taking me for some reason. I stayed with my grandma because it felt right. My mo. Made trips to new mexico every once in a while because she got in a wreck while she was there and was charged with a DUI so she had to di court things. One day we hear that a close cousin of my moms was shot dead and she is devistated. The days before the funeral she was drinking nonstop and as much as a hated when she drank I could only feel sad and I understood. But after that things went down hill. My mom was angry and sad and she never let it go (things start geting blurry here because things gor hectic) one day when my mom had to leave to court in new mexico she said she was going to stay a week to clear her head because her kids were driving her insane and i cant blame her. Sister 1 has a huge attitude and is very rebellious and bratty and the two little ones are like 2 and 3 at this time so also very bratty. She leaves and my grandma dosent have a car so we get rides from other family members and friends. The week is over and we are missing our mom and....shes not coming home. Some things happen and shes held up. Ok thats fine I get it I can wait a few days, she dosent comd home for an othe week and a half were a lityle mad but its not like its going to happen again right? Wrong she leaves an other time during this time dad B breaks up with my mom and guess how everyone finds out. Through petty facebook mesages...any way heres whers things blurr in to a mess in my head, my mom is gons most of the time my grandma now is looking over five kids herself and im just trying not to break down because theres this huge void and as the oldest its my job to fill it. I step up and I try to take on a motherly role as a anxiety filleed 15 year-old I take the role as discipliner. As much as these kids get on my nerves I still love them and i want them to grow up into....not pieces of shits so I roll up my sleves and give a little tough love. Things are a bit stable and my moms back shes giving us rides to school and keeping me at her house after.one day I was having a good day until I got picked up from school and my moms kinda in a bad mood and smoking from her weed vape thing? (Dap pen or something?) Sister 1 is throwing her usual tantrum about being hungry and being her bratty self. My mom and sister 1 get in a fight because sister one dosent want to clean what not. My mom snaps as this kind of stuff has been hapening for years she starts screamimg about how shes had it with her and how we are all spoiled brats and how she cant take it anymore and how she was going to kill herself most of the stuff ive heard before it hurt but im use to it but when she starte talking about how shed rather KILL HERSELF than deal with us it got to me i still tried to keep it in im tbe oldest if im freaking out the others will too. Sister 2 starts sobbing and I can actualy feel my heart break Im angry at this point because my mom just keeps going and victimizing herself even though shes the one who has us like this m
Sister 1 runs off and I follow her because I dont want her to get stolen, I had some money on me and I took her out to eat so we can calm down. Im currently balling my eyes out and when we're at McDonald's the tears just wont stop I talk with my sister and then we go back to my grandmas house. She dosent apologise till the next day and by that time its already burned into me but I have no choice but to move on.life lives on then my mom leaves again she was again supposed to be gone for a few days but its been longer she said monday, then today but no. It is curently the last day of spring break and sister 2 has been with her dad and sister 1 has been going to ""friends"" houses shes worse than ever and has started going out without permission with quesionable people. Everyone is on edge today and sister 1 is back so I deside to have a chat with her but shes having none of it she wouldn't even look at me I have my most serious face and tone I can muster to try to get her to listen to me.  I just wanted to talk to her to let her know that im here for here but she wouldn't listen and thats when I broke its only been a few months but I couldn't take it I was overwhelmed with school and my siblings and my mom I relized I have no idea what im doing im just as lost as my sisters and I start to cry and I yell and beg just to talk I just want to be there but it didnt work then I was mad. Mad at myself, at my mom for putting these kids in this situation, for putting me in this situation and I told myself I need to get out. I didnt mention but I started to get in touch with OG dad recently he live in new mexico and i visited him for the summer. Well in that moment of uslessness I rememberd that my dad recently got a two bedroom apartment and said I was welcome to live with him, I texted him about the time my mom snaped so he knew about that so I texted him about everything just know and said I wanted to live with him and he said I could. Now im thinking, is it the right thig to do, im so misrable but can I just leave my siblings here without me. My OG dad said somthing about my mental heath being important but I still worry for my siblings. Should I stay and be a mom or go and be a kid?

265,"I'm married with one child. This is a really long read, so thanks in advance for reading!

My mother: I don't know how to put this as I don't want to insult her, but she believes she's above certain things and people. She's somewhat shallow and irresponsible in my opinion. She's always spending money that she doesn't have and doesn't take care of herself. Growing up I've never really felt any love from her, and she never spent any quality time with me or my siblings. In her defense, she had to work a lot to be able to take care of her kids, as my dad wasn't around much. She siphoned loads of money from him every money due to child support and alimony, but she somehow always had money problems despite also working two full time jobs at one point. 

Since she's a grandmother now, she fully abuses that position. My wife and I have a pretty great routine for our daughter, and feed her healthy food. Our daughter is very well behaved for us, and she is really just a fantastic kid and I feel very lucky that my first child is awesome. She (my daughter) is hilarious, intelligent and a social butterfly. Literally ANY chance that she gets, she gives our daughter anything she wants. Gives her any kind of sweets and gifts. This isn't a once a month thing, this is an EVERY DAY thing. And everytime our daughter comes back to us, she's mean, angry, treats us like shit and doesn't listen. We've expressed this literally dozens of times and she refuses to comply. We now therefore don't spend any more time with mawmaw. And honestly, our kid has been fantastic ever since. I haven't talked to my mother in about 6 months now, and I feel terrible about it. I feel as if one day she's going to die and I'm going to feel like shit. As if I'm missing out on being in my mother's life. It's hard you know? I don't know what to do. Everytime my daughter is around mawmaw it's a stressful event because she won't listen to us and will cry when she doesn't get PRECISELY what she demands.

My father: Wasn't around much growing up. I never felt any love from him either. He paid his child support and alimony and I spent weekends with him growing up, but only because it was court mandated. My dad has always treated his kids like shit, as well as my mother. Last year he say some rude shit to my wife and I which caused us to leave his house since he wouldn't apologize when I politely asked him too. He hasn't cared to contact me since. He is actually decent around my daughter, but rude to us. I have also since ceased contact with him, and feel the same guilt. He taught me some things in life, but feel as if his job as a father would get a D- rating. If anything, he taught me how NOT to be a father.

So thanks for reading all of this, I'm glad to get this off my chest. I really don't know what to do.

Me[21/f] and F[21/f] had been best friends since middle school. We had an incredibly close, sister-like bond. I never had such a connection with my own sister as I did with her. She had always been very high-energy and extroverted, which balanced out my introverted and creative personality. We loved each other. She always joked about how she'd choose me over her partner. 
She moved cross-state midway through high school but we stayed connected. She met the man she'd eventually marry, H[22/m]. 
Once we graduated high school, she and I saw each other more consistently, often making the 4 hour trip to visit once every month or so. She got engaged sometime in 2016. In early 2017, she expressed interest in moving back to her hometown (where I still currently live).
In March of 2017, F and H got an apartment near the university they'd be transferring to, about 20 mins away from where I live. They both got serving jobs and had trouble making ends meet. I referred them to my place of employment because it paid well and was reliable. 
Prior to joining me at my workplace, we all took a week-long vacation. We took the vacation prior to their employment to avoid overlapping time off requests. The purpose of this trip was for them to get married. 
Me, F, H, and the guy[25/m] I was dating at the time flew to Vegas, picked up a rental car and drove to Phoenix. We had a fun night on the Vegas strip, went hiking on the Red Rock Canyon, stopped at the Hoover Dam, then ended up at the Grand Canyon where I preformed the marriage ceremony right on the edge at a beautiful and secluded point. 
Overall, It was a wonderful trip. I got sick at one point and we had a few hiccups, but I wrote an incredibly heart-felt sermon for them. They had some really beautiful and breath-taking wedding photos.

We returned home and settled into the routine of things. The newlyweds bought their first home in August. My boyfriend and I spent nearly every weekend at their house, often making a big ordeal out of it (drinking, smoking, ordering food, gaming, etc.) As I reflect in hindsight, I think I began to struggle to keep up with everyone. The friendship dynamic changed from long-distance/seeing each other once a month to seeing each other nearly everyday at work as well as spending nearly all of our free time together. At some point, I became overstimulated and withdrawn. There were a few times that she snapped on me for breaking plans. I never meant to be a bad friend to her, but often we'd agree on having a ""girl's night in"", but she would then invite other people and turn it into something bigger. 

This part gets a bit difficult to explain but I am happy to answer questions and clarify. 

In December 2017, I broke up with the guy I had been dating (the guy who went to Vegas for the wedding). In February of 2019, I start dating my current boyfriend C[28/m]. He and I seem to be a perfect match. He gets along with F and H. We maintain the consistency in hanging out, for the most part.

By springtime, 2018, my depression peaks. I'm incredibly withdrawn. Sometimes F and H would hangout with my boyfriend without me. When I would hangout with everyone, I found myself drinking and smoking to excess, often passing out before everyone else. I probably wasn't fun to be around.

Now, F's 21st birthday (July) approaches and it is excessive. She invites her friends from across the state to stay at her house. She has a dress code for her party: she wears a pink dress while the other girls wear black. She had SO much stuff organized. We go out drinking until about 2am. I wake up incredibly hungover. She has even more planned for us the next day, including tailgating and attending a baseball game. I flake out for the baseball game because it's just too much for me - but I apologize and pay her back for the ticket cost.
During the week that follows, she expresses interest in stripping. She asked me to check out strip clubs with her after work, which I suggest we do during the weekend because we already worked late that day. She gets my sister to go with her instead. From what I understand, she expressed interest in applying to one of the dancers at the club. The dancer tells the owner, and they have her get on stage and dance. F gets $20 in tips from being on stage for just five minutes and gets hired on the spot.

Again, as I reflect, I think me and F had some serious problems leading up to this point. I believe she didn't want me as her friend anymore. She has an image (think ""insta model"") and I'm not someone who puts much into what I wear and how I look. I work full-time and go to school full-time and can't keep up with being so extra. I used to believe that this is what brought us together in the first place - she'd be the one to encourage me to get out more and I'd be the one to help bring her back down to Earth. But, I think I didn't have a place in her life anymore.

Anyways.. at this point all of my eggs are in one basket. My work circle, my friends, my relationship.. it's all intertwined. I reach out to an ex behind C's back. I don't really tell anyone about it. I mostly just wanted someone to talk to without the influence of everyone else.
I return back to my house after seeing this ex (we went out for a drink - I didn't cheat) and I find F and my sister hanging out. They ask where I was. I am dismissive and I go to bed.

Now, F does not like the ex I saw. He works for the same company but not the same area. It was a short and secret relationship.

F decides to tell C that I hung out with my ex. She tells him I cheated. This stings because she actually knew nothing about what happened. This causes me and C to have relationship issues. 

Me and F stop talking at this point. F encourages C to hangout with her and H (without me, of course). She even befriends my sister. I am isolated.

Me and C reconcile and that pisses off F. She ""outs"" me at work, telling everyone about how me and a coworker once secretly dated. So, I tell everyone that she's a stripper.

The way I look at it.. she ""outed"" me twice. Once to try to ruin my relationship (which I think she was jealous of because he is such a great guy) and again to try to ruin my reputation at work. I ""outed"" her once.. however she says that this crossed a line because it ""threatened her safety"" (ie. she felt ""unsafe"" knowing that everyone knew about her side job).

Anyways.. I leave the workplace two months later to study abroad. She left about one month before I did to strip full-time.
She is still friends with my sister, which has caused tension between me and my sister. Me and C stay together.

Whilst abroad, I hear that F and H split. They have a horrific falling out which consisted of F abandoning H in their old town across the state. She returns back home to start seeing one of the guys she met at the club.
Part of me wonders if I contributed to this. Our lives were once SO intertwined - maybe she didn't like having a marriage that was officiated by someone she no longer likes? 
Also, whilst abroad, F messaged me saying that she ""missed the good times we had"". I left her on read.
I returned home from my studies abroad in December. I've still not reached out to her. Me and C have visited H and support him during this divorce. 

I feel like I have found peace. F tried to slander me and say that I cheated, but then lost all credibility when she did exactly that but worse. 
I'm considerably lonely without her. It's been difficult to not have her presence in my life. Me and my sister don't talk. I sometimes feel like the only person I have in my life is C.
I've contemplated reaching out to her. I feel somewhat responsible for making sure that this friend I had for nearly 10 years of my life is okay. I worry that it is my fault that her life has gone to shit. From what I hear, she had to sell furniture for money and got knocked up (not by the guy she left H for - someone NEW). She's no longer stripping and is unemployed.",18Mar2019,2
267,"Yeah the title sounds stupid, I cringed just typing it, however I'd say it's the truth.  I'm in my early 20s and still work retail part-time right now, however I applied to a job that I don't really know what I'll be doing (no training yet) but it seems as though I'll be chosen.

The job is full-time and has some benefits, plus the pay raise would be at least 25% more than my current pay.  The only thing is, I've grown accustom to retail enough to where I tolerate it, and almost look forward to it.  I feel like I'd miss my co-workers a TON, they make up for most of the reasons why I look forward to working while on &lt;6 hours of sleep.  I like all the little dramas as well as laughs with people who've grown to be more than just acquaintances.  

My parents have been pushing me to look for full time (I'm still reliant on them) and currently this retail job has no full time openings, and it's looking like it wont for some time.  I'm just scared of having to be the new person at a new job again, only this time I'll be in more of a factory environment.  I've never known anything other than retail, and I'm afraid of feeling confined or getting in to some sort of rut while just working at a machine for 40 hours a week.

269,"So I lived with my mother my whole life. My dad lived a couple provinces over so I would see him and his side of the family maybe once a year. I always wanted to move with my dad. I guess to try and better myself out there and maybe build a relationship with him.

270,"Hey guys so I am 18 and ever since I was young I’ve had horrible teeth. When I was 4 my mother took me to the dentist but we left because the dentist said really mean things about my teeth to my mom. Ever since that day I’ve never been to the dentist, also because it is very expensive and my family is poor. I’ve been bullied because I have a bad smile, i have an over jet or protruding  from canine to canine I would say about 1cm from my bottom teeth. Also a bottom tooth is pushed back and there’s a noticeable gap. 

I’ve been self conscious about them since the 5th grade. I think it’s gone to my head and I think it’s a problem because some nights I feel very sad and take pictures of my smile and teeth from various angles and then I look at them (I’ve done this severely times) to point out the flaws. I also become obsess with them and criticize myself and tell myself all the mean things the other kids used to tell me. I also obsessively brush my teeth.

273," 

Two days ago I adopted a sweet baby who I named louie

he was 8 weeks old at the time (I guess he still is) and was very social. he isn't afraid to cuddle anyone who holds him and was very vocal

I made him a little play set cage (Doors always open when hes awake and closed when sleeping and it's very spacious)

i tried to keep him in one place so that he gets used to us first (Cause that's what the shelter told me to do) but he would scream and meow for me to let him out so my brothers conviced me to let him out because ""Hes social and isn't scared"" and even though i didnt believe it i let them anyway

tonight I was doing the dishes, assuming he was still in his cage where I left him. I went upstairs to my room, and the cage was on the way but when i checked it- it was empty. The Cage itself is in the gaming room, and the gaming room has a little fence that stretches through out the hallway and if you were to look over it you could see the top of the living room. and the cage was set up against that fence so i could keep an eye on him from the living room (Idk if that made sense)

Point is, the cage was empty. I asked my brothers if theyd seen him and one of them said louie jumped off his lap and ran a bit and hasnt seen him since. Hes a very tiny kitten and had just had neuter-surgery so he cant be around water. I'm very afraid cause i looked everywhere and i havnt seen or found him. I set up his food next to his cage and made sure the litter box was ready for him.

I have school tomorrow and need to find him before then so i can leave him in the bathroom before going out so he doesnt get hurt (our bathroom is big so he wont be cramped)

Im afraid he'd get hurt or fall off into the living room or something please help. he's also very dumb. so dumb. took him five minutes to figure out how to sit down and that's not a joke. I wouldn't be suprised if he had to be reminded of how to breathe. please help",18Mar2019,1
274,"To start, my parents are divorced. They’ve been divorced since I was young. However things have mellowed out and I see both of my parents on the regular. 

But that doesn’t mean my life is by any means normal. I don’t know if any of you have divorced parents, but it is far from normal. And my parents, they aren’t perfect. My dad in particular has a few issues. Namely power issues, anger issues... etc.

I frequently find myself saying “If I have a family, I want it to be normal.” And things like that. It’s both a conscious and subconcious thing. But I feel deprived of a normal life and don’t want to bring that to anyone else. 

A week ago I had an argument with my dad while at his house over some homework or something. It’s kind of irrelevant. When we had dinner, I went to go eat in my room. But my dad yelled and told me to eat in the dining room. I protested a bit and eventually he yelled “We are going to eat like a normal family at the table!”

That’s when it struck me. You see, my dad also had a tough life growing up. His parents also divorced, his dad was shitty, he wasn’t well financially, and ended up dropping out of Hs. 

But that’s when I realized: my dad probably had the same thoughts that I’m having now, to have a normal family. 

It makes sense when I think about it too. He rushed into a second marriage and divorced again 5 years later. He looks to Christianity and old traditional beliefs for answers... his subconscious is filling in the gap his younger years left him.

I do not want to be the way he is. I want to have a regular family that is supportable, and support them both financially and personally (that is, if I choose to have a family.)

277,"(TL;DR: I don’t know how to talk to my psychologist, main questions are at the bottom of this post) 

So here’s the situation: I’m Australian, 26, estranged from my biological family after growing up in a wildly abusive home and then a traumatic adolescence spent in foster care. 

I’m at a point where the gaps in my knowledge and memory of what happened to me are more hinderence  than help. So I am filling out a Freedom of Information application which, once processed, will give me access to all my records, from social services to health care providers and legal aid.. as my case was taken to family court and I spent many years in and out of care there’s a lot of records to find, but I hope that means many more gaps will be filled in. 

In the meantime, in aid of learning to actually talk about what I went through, (for the first time, ever... I’ve never said this stuff out loud to anyone:/ ) I’ve put myself in therapy. I’ve had two sessions and it’s going alright, even though I just feel wildly uncomfortable - I have been made to try therapy before and it’s always had this same feeling. I am really introverted and struggle to talk about myself at all let alone on such a personal level and about extremely traumatic events. 

So I am struggling with the thought of just quitting therapy and trying to deal with the outcomes and findings of my Freedom of Information Application on my own. 
On one level I believe that I could manage okay but without n another I accept that the only way to move on is to speak the truth out loud and have someone witness it.. I am married and would love to be able to talk to my husband about it all but have tried and can’t really manage it.. I do think therapy could help me open up to him more and break down the barrier that keeps me from telling him a lot of stuff. 

So I guess my questions are: 

•when you go back through old traumas in therapy, what is the difference between healing them over and re-opening them? How can I achieve one and not the other? Or do I have to do both? 

•if you’ve had therapy before, what made it helpful? What made it work out, what made the difference to you? 

•is it weird to ask my psychologist if she is okay? Sometimes I feel like the things I tell her (truthful accounts of childhood events/trauma) make her quite uncomfortable... how do I ask if it’s okay if I speak about them?

•can I ask my psychologist if she thinks she’s the right person to help me? I am giving it time to see if it feels like she’s the right psych for me, but am I allowed to ask her if she feels like it is a good fit? 

•along similar lines, is it weird/rude to tell her that I considered cancelling all appointments because the sessions are already feeling quite hard? She’s going to ask me how I went after the last session and that is the honest truth, though I think it may be too blunt. 

•in general, how can I address the situation of feeling like her and I are not on the same page? 
I don’t really want to change to a new psychologist as it was a huge deal for me to go and see this one - I’d hate to start over. 

•is it pointless to ask her if she thinks the whole freedom of info application is a waste of time/reopening old wounds? Will she give me an honest opinion? Any time I’ve asked her for a true opinion she has deflected the question back to be about what I think... it’s frustrating as I genuinely want/need advice.

Thanks in advance. ",18Mar2019,2
278,"Hi!

I attended a big tournament on the weekend where we played 6 games in one day. Lunch break was between game 2 and 3, however game 2 for me went to overtime  . This meant not only was I late to get to the lunch break but I also jumped at the end of the queue to order my food. I ran back with my food and quickly tried to eat. 2 minutes prior to my match start my opponent was making a scene saying I need to get over there right now or forfeit - I tried to explain I only just got my food. As I got to the table 5 to 6 minutes later I apologised to my opponent and tried to introduce myself but he wasnt having a bar of it. Through out the match he continued to make comments about stuff I was doing in a really stuck up way / negative body language way. At one point he did something that would be considered cheating but I didn't want to make a scene and call a ref as I already felt awkward.

I felt really rushed, I totally understand being late is on me. Next time I'm just going to ignore eating in those circumstances. I lost in a really bad way, Just kept making bad moves. And I tried to apologise again afterwoods.

Even when people were late to my matches I didn't make a scene, in fact I just tell them to take their time and no need to rush. Nothing worse trying to play a strategy game when you're in a knot.

Anyway I keep thinking about the way the guy talked to me with his body language and attitude. Every time I saw him it was off putting and gave me a knot. I couldn't stop thinking about it. I hate that i got off on the wrong foot with someone and it's really my doing (Even though in reverse circumstances I would have not gone the way he did about it). It appears he's well liked and one of the best players in the community so it wont a common issue with others.

There's a tournament in two weeks and I'm even anxious about going to that now since I'm going to see him.

How do I shake this off so to speak? How do I stop this from getting to me?? How do I enjoy this doesn't take away from one of my favourite hobbies?",18Mar2019,2

282,"Been having a really hard past few years, I’ve always struggled with depression and anxiety and Medication/therapy doesn’t seem to help a lot. I’ve been having problems with debt for a while after I bought my first house my wife got ill and couldn’t work and we ended up over our heads quickly.

Instead of ask anyone for advice/help I told her everything was fine and piled everything on credit cards/loans even buying a new car on credit to keep the illusion things were good. Quickly this spiralled and I ended up £10,000s in debt and finding myself having panic attack’s daily and unable to work, stupidly I turned to gambling and of course things just got worse.

About 1 year later I finally came out to wife and my parents about all the problems I’d been having after spending weeks feeling like I wanted to kill myself. Everyone was really supportive and my parents (reasonably wealthy) paid off about 40% of my debts which I was incredibly grateful for.

Unfortunately even with that my repayments were less than what I earned so I ended up struggling and the same thing happened again, minus the gambling GA and therapy helped me kick that. I ended up projecting all my problems elsewhere and blaming everything on job stress and becoming emotionally distant.

I ended up accepting a job in Switzerland thinking a change of scenery and what felt like a huge pay rise would solve all my problems. Well I guess when everyone says you can’t run from your problems it’s true.

The company didn’t offer a relocation package and I had to take the first house I could find which ended up in rural Switzerland about 2 hours from work and it was mega expensive, I then got I’ll with a mystery throat problem which cost me 2500 of my insurance deductible to diagnose, then I rented a car to move some stuff and a cyclist ran in to me made a huge stink about it being my fault and I had to pay him 2000 to make him go away.

My wife ended up coming over and we took our cats, we planned to sell the house but the market sucked and it’s in negative equity, same with the car it would cost me like 10,000 to break even to sell. So again my costs doubled, my wife has been getting much better and feeling ready to work again, but being in a country where the language is so hard to learn set her back loads. About 5 months later we decided to move everything back and give up the lease on that place and I would try and find somewhere else cheaper till I could get a job back home.

So here I am now, no money can barely afford to eat to scared to tell anyone but my wife the depths of the issues. I told my parents I had sold the car to make things seem better but it’s still at home too expensive to sell.

I want to go home, I don’t want to worry anymore, I don’t want debts, I want to be in my house, I want to be with the woman I love and my pets. But I’m stuck in a country I don’t like because I can’t find another job back home, my skills are very niche. I’ve taken another apartment in an area that’s slightly cheaper but it’s a year lease and the stress is eating me away and I’m scared.

I don’t know what to do anymore, I can’t even concentrate at work. I want to but I’m in a constant state of panic which added on top of the fact they seem to fire you for nothing here is killing me.

So about a week ago, the father of my child (very toxic, emotionally abusive, manipulative person) totaled my car. The insurance company has decided that they’re not going to pay for the damages because his license had expired, which I was unaware of. I have stayed at home with our toddler since she was born, but I was in the process of getting a job when all this happened. Neither of us can afford to buy me a car. I told him he needs to get a $5,000 loan, and he is supposed to be going to his bank to apply for it tomorrow, but he keeps saying he doesn’t think they will approve it because of his bad credit from medical bills. I have NO credit, so I couldn’t get one. He keeps bringing up financing a car and making payments, but I don’t trust him to pay the note and I don’t want him to have anything to hold over my head or threaten to take away from me. I seriously don’t know what to do. I’m going back to school for my bachelor’s degree in August and I’ll have no way of getting there without a car. I can’t work now either, or get our child to doctors appointments or anywhere really. I never thought I would be one to do it, but I’ve been considering starting a go fund me page. I have pictures of my totaled car along with pictures of my injuries, to prove to people it’s not a scam. I’m sooo afraid of people judging me though. I’m having so much anxiety about the whole situation. It’s been causing me to stay up all night worrying since the wreck. Any advice is welcome. If you need more information, let me know.

I'm currently studying animation at my community college (Thank God every day I didn't even bother applying to university after high school esp. cuz I was undecided on my major) since I love working with computers but also love art. I thought I would combine the two passions so I chose animation and comp. design.

School has been the most stress free and least miserable ever since I started studying what I love to do but at the same time I'm getting future anxiety. Student debt is a huge fear that may turn into reality soon or so I've heard for art related majors. The enrollment fees alone are INSANE and ridiculous. Should I pick up a double major?

I am going to give you the background first so you can help better

I have hard trouble with this friend of mine:

She has what you can call ""serious daddy issues"", when she was a child her father left her and her mother and they didn't talk until one day when my friend was already about 18, he started dating her mother again for some time.

They talked again but it stopped once he and her mother broke up again.

Recently she tried contacting him but found out that he blocked her. That devastated her.

This friend of mine was extremely religious until she was 18 and lost her virginity in the age of 20.

She can't form relationships with men that last more than 4 months, she has some sexual experience now but it is almost all from hookups and friends-with-benefits types of relationships.

I met her half a year ago but we only really connected about a month ago, she had a boyfriend for a month and a half but they broke up last week.

Ever Since the breakup we have been making out and spending a lot of time together but I don't want to sleep with her because she is sure that all she good for is being used for sex, and she is more important to me than that. Mind you, I don't think I want to get into a relationship at all right now, but I think that if I sleep with her it will only hurt her.

I want her to understand that she is an awesome human being and that she is worth a lot more than she thinks.

When I tell her that, she says : ""Wait 'till you fuck me, than you will stop caring about me like all the rest of them"".

301,"So, this requires quite the back story. I hope it's not too much to read.

When I was young, I was an only child...like the only child on my Dads entire side of the family. My great uncle(T) and his partner(M) were my absolute favorite. I particularly adored M who treated me as his own family (This was pre- gay marriage) and I was their only niece so I got to spend a lot of one on one time with them. T&amp;M were well off, much more so than anyone else in my family. They were long term and stable. They would pay for me to visit them several states over, we were close as a family. M taught me how to Scuba dive, which was something that I would have never had the opportunity to do otherwise. Again, I adored him. Eventually, they moved from Florida to Hawaii, they paid for me to come and visit them and I had the time of my life. M and I were closer than ever.

Well after the trip, bad things ensue. The story ends with them splitting. My family told me (at the time 12 or 13yrs old) that M cheated on my uncle T, drained their bank account, and left him for another man. My uncle relapses (alcohol), moves back to Florida, and drowns in his vomit on the kitchen floor. My family blames M for Ts death. 

Post funeral: M tries to contact me via myspace I think (or maybe email) saying he is sorry. I now think it was a condolences thing, not an admission of guilt. But I am young and my family has told me that he is this evil man who basically killed my uncle in cold blood, and they are now enraged at him making contact with me. So, I tell him not to contact me...in more words than that.

Fast forward: I am nearly 30 now and this situation has always haunted me, but for some reason tonight it has kept me awake well past my bed time. I have really struggled recently with the thought of how much I loved him as a child (I had known him since birth; in my mind he had always been family). I wondered if he could really be this evil monster that my family was making him out to be. So naturally, I did what any good millennial would do: I googled him.

313,"I am the second eldest in a family of 7. I have 5 younger brothers, ranging from ages 12-24, and one older sister.  I love my family incredibly and I remember my upbringing fondly. Within this past year a rift has formed within my family. My family has of course had fights and siblings not getting along with each other, etc. what I thought to be relatively normal large family issues, but this rift has spiraled into something I didn't think that would ever happen with my family and frankly I don't know what to do.

Let me provide a little background about my family before I delve into the core issue.

My mom and dad's relationship is no where near perfect and I fully acknowledge that there have been several occasions that are not considered functional and healthy. Their relationship did not start out well, my dad used to be an alcoholic and my mom swears by moments throughout the start of their relationship that have damaged her as a woman for the rest of her life. My dad is terrible at planning things, birthdays, Christmas, etc. and he wasn't necessarily super close to his eldest three children. This resulted in my mom being the one to buy all of the presents and plan parties, outings as a family, time spent as a family, budget money-essentially being the main parent  to raise us. I wouldn't go as far to say that my dad was nonexistent because he was always there, he just didn't put as much effort into raising us as my mom did.  I always chucked it out to be that deep down they love each other and us kids enough that they would always work it out. This saddens me greatly, but to this day they manage to work things out between each other no matter what happened between them and I still care about them and love them very much. 

About a year ago, my mom and dad hit rock bottom in their relationship to the point where my dad threatened to leave my mom. Apparently this has happened before, but this time he was very serious about it. Yet, like always they managed to patch it up, and work it out enough to function with each other around my family. This left a scar on me, but it definitely impacted some of my siblings enough to warrant them wanting a family intervention where we would tell my parents about how, not only, this instance has impacted them, but throughout their upbringing as well. (They also wanted to address a matter involving my mom tracking my siblings internet presence because she caught my youngest siblings watching porn. This is something I did not agree with and did want to voice my opinion on that. I do, however, understand why she did this and believe parents can make mistakes. She was juggling several younger children watching porn and trying to teach them healthy ways of expressing sexual urges with the best of her knowledge without the help of my father. )

I will admit I am a very positive person, now and when I was a kid, and even if I was bothered by events growing up, they did not impact me enough to affect my life in a negative way and have any reason for me to speak at this intervention. I did agree to listening in on the meeting because I wanted to make sure I was at least aware of everything that was said. I am the only one out of my siblings that lives out of state, and unfortunately I have to make more of an effort to keep in contact with my siblings. Information is usually heard one sided or not at all and I am left out of things, so for this supposed important family meeting I wanted to hear things directly, and attempt to be a mediator/retain a neutral stance on everything.

It did not go as it should have gone. At all. Not in any constructive way that an intervention I thought was supposed to be. Instead of my siblings speaking to BOTH of my parents about how their issues within their relationship has affected them, it instead turned it into a meeting about how my mom failed raising my siblings growing up and how she is now failing my younger brothers. My eldest sister is better with words and she communicated effectively how she was feeling. The eldest of my brothers states how he is feeling in a very brutal and non-constructive manner, on the constant attack.

 My eldest sister is a passionate woman who I have always looked up to as a leader, and still do. Growing up she struggled with overeating and being overweight. The eldest of my brothers, who was my video game companion and the brother I butted heads with the most, was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis at a young age, and depression when he was older. As far as I was and am concerned, my mom did the very best she possibly could to raise us all and did so lovingly in equal capacity to us all. This meeting did not shatter my belief in that, but shattered my family, especially my mother. My mom is a very passionate woman as well and if I had to pick two of my siblings that she could be compared to the most, it was my sister, and the eldest of my brothers. Unfortunately this does not bode well when being confronted. My mom could not take the information my siblings were hitting her with and I could not believe the information that was being said by my siblings. Eventually my brother-in-law took me into another room with my other brothers, and him and I talked about everything going on and being spoken about as the shouting and crying got louder in the other room. I did not get to hear the rest of the meeting and frankly I couldn't handle it emotionally. 

This would not be the end of it, and it still has not ended. Every time I spoke to my mom in the months following the meeting, I could not (and hardly cannot) get through a conversation without her crying her heart out. This still haunts and hurts me to this day. I also set up separate times to speak to my siblings individually to hear their say. I am very partial to my mother, and as much as I didn't agree with what my siblings were saying about her, I didn't want to disregard their feelings and experiences because frankly, I am not them. I have an easier time talking with my sister, and while I did not agree with all of her reasons, I made a strong effort to understand them without it impacting my thoughts towards my mom. She believes that my mom always treats her as a child, not a woman. She believes that my mom undermines her opinions because she is viewed as my mother's child, and not as a women with a masters degree in psychology and children's studies, and therefore not taken seriously. She believes that my mom disregards her opinions because she is not a parent, and makes her feel guilty for not yet having children. She also believes that growing up my mom was always aware of her weight, making her feel guilty of it, and instilling dieting habits even though she was a child.  My brother I have a harder time speaking to. Since he is always on the attack and harsh with his words, anytime in the past I have spoken my opinions, they are usually shot down and disregarded and I am left feeling empty and at a loss for words. He believes my mom is the cause behind why his health conditions got to the degree that he did. He believes that she disregarded  the pain he had as a child. He believes that she put a label on his behavior, him being negative and unappreciative, and thus caused his siblings to view him as such, and not as a role model. He believes that she favored everyone but him and disregarded his wishes, especially when it came to gift-giving. He truly believes my mom is a terrible mother. At the time, I asked them both what it would take to have this end. They both said they want my mom to see a counselor for both herself and my father and for my mom to take full responsibility for everything they told me. 

This was months ago. Since then, my family has only broken more. Any time my family makes a decision, ANY decision, if they find some aspect they disagree with, they blame my mom. (My FAMILY bought a puppy a few months back even though they couldn't necessarily afford it, and they immediately threw hateful, disagreeable words at my mom, even though I was told my DAD wanted to get him.) And unfortunately it has caused my mom to feel betrayed if we have conversations with our siblings, in fear that we are talking bad about her, and has made her want to read everyone's text messages including my fathers. Thankfully this fear has calmed down. But only slightly.

My mom has attempted several times to speak to them and resolve the matter (and even going to start marriage counseling with my dad) though her approach does not settle well with them, and thus they retaliate. She is firm on her belief that she has raised them and done everything for them in the best way she could physically, emotionally, and mentally, she should not be blamed for these accusations and thinks that it is disrespectful for her children to treat her in this manner. My siblings are now constantly on the attack and are resolute in what they said and will not see my mom's reasoning and attempts at resolving the issue. Over time, my mom has softened and has simply just tried to get together with them. No matter how she words her sentences, or how she carefully words what she says, they find something they dislike about it, shut her down, and disregard that my mom even tried. They are not willing to forgive, and are unwilling to compromise. My mom as well. They now hardly talk and see each other.

Now in more recent months, something even more distasteful has formed. My eldest and elder sibling use my younger siblings to stay connected with the family and completely have removed my parents from the equation. I understand they do not want to ostracize themselves from my other siblings and I think on a deeper level, they do not want to be ostracized from my parents. They convince my siblings to come over without telling my parents to give them a safe space to vent and talk about how things are going at home, however I do not agree with this approach. I get a bad taste in my mouth. I appreciate my siblings have an alternative place to talk to my other siblings, but it sometimes forces them to talk about my mom and dad when they don't necessarily want to be involved. What angers me the most is that I have spoken to my other four siblings and they have fully expressed to me that either don't want to be involved or feel pressured to, or get pulled into it, or are angry by it. And then other times I am told by my oldest and eldest sibling that they are the ones that initiate and they will keep them out of it if they want to.

The most recent event happened today, and it has only proven how diluted and petty the issue has become. For reasons I don't know, my mom saw a text to my youngest sibling who is 12. My older and eldest sibling, as well as their significant others, were sending my brothers pictures of the lower half of the female anatomy, and were speaking to them about the parts of the vagina. (I do not know the original context, nor was I included in this conversation even though I am the their second eldest sister.) My mom calls me in tears after having being ripped apart by my older sister and the eldest of my brothers. According to my mom, all she did was tell them that when it comes to female parts and sex, she would prefer my youngest brother to not be included in the texts because she would rather him talk to her about it, and for her to explain the intricacies of that topic. I do not know completely the full text conversation (they do not speak) I just know that they told her that my sister has a master's degree in this type of communication, that they blame and question her for not having taught them these kind of intricacies, and that they are taking it upon themselves to explain it to my brothers, and that they refuse to stop doing so. 

I understand where my mother is coming from. At this point, they want her to either apologize for everything, or not have any say in how my siblings are raised. And this breaks my heart because I do not think that is right. My mother stays true to herself and true her heart, and this has made her question everything and every decision she has made, to the point where she wonders that if her and my dad were to die in the near future, if they would be devastated by the loss. She doesn't want to celebrate mother's day, birthdays. This has hurt her beyond words.  

My mother has begged me not to mention anything I tell them in fear of causing a rift between them and I. I can't speak my mother fully in fear of accidentally hurting her further. I can't speak to my younger siblings about because I don't want to involve them, yet I also feel betrayed I was not included in discussions between my siblings. My mom constantly apologizes to me about everything she says that could be even slightly interpreted as negative in connotation. She always wants me to apologize to my boyfriend because she knows he's the only one I can discuss it with and it sometimes causes arguments between him and I, and she can't bear the idea of him not speaking to her too.

I do not know what to do. It is getting to a point where I can be true to myself and my emotions towards my family. Is my thought process biased or wrong?

What should I do?

318,"Background knowledge: My grandfather recently passed away due to cancer he was battling for two years. Because of this, my family and I felt obligated to move in with my grandma because she is old and felt lonely. My siblings and I really didn’t know my grandparents growing up. My mother was estranged from them since I was a toddler (I’m 19 years old), so I have no recollection of them. She stopped talking to them because my older sister said that my grandfather had molested her while she was living with them, and she referred to my sister as a b****. They didn’t start talking again until I was around 15/16. 

Anyways, I’ll get back on topic. We finally moved in last week because we had to save up money to move states to live with her. The past three days, my grandmother has told me to turn around, so she can take pictures of my butt because “she loves her granddaughter’s butt.” She’ll also start talking about the pants that I’m wearing saying I look great in them or that I have her flat butt (I have never been told I have a flat butt until then... I believe it’s normal sized, but that’s still a weird thing to say?), that I’m so beautiful, and she even grabbed my butt. She’ll like shower me with compliments before and while she wants to take pictures of my butt. The first day, I thought maybe she was doing it as a harmless joke, but she made me pose in two different ways. The second time, I got really weirded out. The third time, I didn’t wanna do it, and it was in front of my entire family, even my dad. The fourth time was in public at a park, once again in front of my family. She made me stop as we were leaving to take pictures of my butt. In each photo, I WAS fully clothed, however. She made me turn around to take pictures of my butt twice yesterday, and that morning, I was pretending to sleep because I heard her on the phone with some man. I found this odd because my grandpa died only ONE MONTH AGO. I could tell she was trying to whisper, and she kept repeating, “hi baby, hey babyyyyy, hi babyyyyyy.” I instantly wondered if she had been flirting with a man from online because she doesn’t really ever get out of the house. 

After we got home from the park yesterday, I told my younger brother I had felt uncomfortable about grandma taking pictures of my butt. He said I looked weirded out while it was happening then told me he looked at grandma’s Facebook and that it said she’s engaged to this man from Afghanistan... I immediately felt my heart drop, and after examining her Facebook profile (which none of us are friends with her on), I saw that she would type up in her bio what she’s looking for in a man, and it said who she was engaged to. I started putting two and two together, and I think my grandmother may be using those inappropriate photos of me to send to her “fiancé”, acting like she is me. 

Another thing I noticed is that she’ll only want pictures of my face alone. She never asks my little brothers to come there so she can take pictures of them. They’ll only be included of family photos that she takes. My aunt once told me that Grandma used to make her daughters (including my mother) model their new bras and panties for her and my grandpa and that one of my aunts was molested by my grandfather. My grandmother apparently knew about it too. 

I know this story sounds insane (because it is) and probably funny to some people out there, but please do not write any mean comments. I feel violated by my grandmother’s actions. 

My question here is: Do I have a right to feel this way, or am I overreacting to this situation? What should I do? Thank you to anyone who replies. ",18Mar2019,1
319,"I’m graduating high school soon so these past few months have been a mess of tests and college applications. Most importantly, I’ll have to decide on a university and a major soon.

A few years back, before I had to finalize my college plans, my dream was to work in international relations or something related to human rights whether it be education, poverty etc. I know that’s a very vague description but I guess what I wanted to do was just to be able to make a change and make life better for other people in a field that I’m genuinely passionate about.

My parents disagree. They aren’t big fans of those fields because its not really that lucrative. I know, and I fully accept that. What they want me to do instead is business. The future they plan for me either has me being a business exec like my mom or running my own business like my dad.

When college application time came around I followed what they wanted. Maybe its the asian kid in me, raised to put family on a pedestal or maybe its me being too easily swayed. Either way, I agreed.

The applications have been sent and I’ve even been accepted to a few. But now I’m starting to have second thoughts. 

I followed my parents wishes when I started high school, majoring in science instead of social studies even though I knew I had 0 interest in the subjects. I hated it. I regret it almost every day. Now it’s almost over and I don’t want it to happen again.

The thing is, I know my parents won’t disown me or stop supporting me if I choose to change majors. It’s just that it’ll very much disappoint them and I’d hate to do that. I love them and I’m super thankful for all that they’ve done for me. But at the same time I want to be my own person.

This is possibly the last chance I have to change my fate, I can still take tests for uni’s in my home country though I’ve missed on a few. Should I make the jump and face my parents disappointment or should I go through with their plan and lead a life that I know for me will be mediocre at best? I know this is something a lot of people go through so please share your personal experiences too if you can.

I don’t know who else to talk to so any advice will be greatly appreciated. Also sorry that this is really long :(",18Mar2019,1
320,"I don't think I have anything in common with my best friends anymore, who I happen to live with also.

&amp;#x200B;

They are gamers, I am not. And I am getting frustrated with them (silently) because they would rather stay home and play games with each other than go out and do and see things. They like kpop and kdramas, I do not. They read manga and watch anime, I do not. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I don't have much in common with best friends anymore and feel excluded when they talk about certain things.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I have tried to see what they like about all of these things, and yes I do play games, but not to the extent they do. Recently, they've been playing a game where they are on a team with each other and they use headsets to talk to each other through the walls while playing the game. They've been doing this for weeks now, day in, day out. And here I am in my room trying to think of something I can do but nothing springs to mind. I can get utterly bored very easily. I read and write, but I also like to go outside and see and do things. They just don't. They are happy to sit there and play games. I've tried to find what they like in kpop and dramas and all of that, but I don't see myself liking it as much as they do. I appreciate the effort they have put in to make me like this stuff, but I just don't. Everyone likes different things. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've known they like these things for a while and it never really got on my nerves until recently. They always have conversations about the things they like while I am with them and I always feel left out. Just now, we were eating dinner and they kept talking about these things and I just sat there wishing I had an opinion on the matter or that they would talk about something that we all enjoy. And even while I am tying this, they are talking and playing that game with each other right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm finding myself detaching from them more and more each day as I learn that they would rather sit at their computers all day and not do anything outside. Occasionally, we'll go see a movie, or do an escape room, or go shopping, but that's as far as it goes. We all like different movies, so we can never agree on one. We're limited to what we can do each week because some our wages fluctuate. I feel like they only time we ever do any bonding is if we're shopping or focused on the same thing, like going to the arcade or an escape room. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I know what you're thinking, ""stop complaining and just do what you want to do"", I know. I do. If I want to go somewhere and do something I do, but I will always ask my friends if they want to come with me. Sometimes they come, sometimes not and that is ok. But I am getting upset at the fact that they would rather be at home all day playing this game with each other and I am not really included. I do feel excluded most of the time and I have not brought it up with them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do have other friends, unlike one of my best friends, and yes I do hang out with them, but I feel like my friends get jealous of that, as if they are the only friends I am allowed. Bestfriend1 was really rude to a friend of mine (who I am going on a holiday with soon) a couple of months ago and I apologised for her behaviour to said friend. Bestfriend2 is a happy person generally and doesn't mind that she's at home all day doing nothing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Separately, I have many things in common with them. Bestfriend1 and I are both into a lot of the same movies and tv shows, but then different on other genres, we both like fashion, sometimes the same music. Bestfriend2, we like to read and write, are Harry Potter fanatics, but differ on a lot of genres in terms of movies and tv shows, but like the same music most of the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

And we all generally have a good time when we are together, but I just feel like what they have in common with each other overpowers the friendship we all share. I just don't know where I stand in this friendship. I know they care about me and me them, but I am finding it harder and harder to talk to them about things when all they really care about is things THEY have in common.  I am feeling lonely and excluded. And I don't know how to bring it up with them.

He kept trying to kiss me and i kept saying no. At one point, i pushed his hand away. He held my cheek and starting leaning in towards me. I sucked my lips in to avoid his from touching mine. He forced my chin up and kissed me. I pulled away and told him to take me home. He started driving towards my house, but then he was asking things like “can we please fuck one last time” “cmon please” “I’ll take you home straight afterwards I promise” and all the while I kept saying no. When I realized he wasn’t going to take no for an answer, I gave up and agreed. He took me to a secluded spot and parked. I sat in the passenger seat, just thinking. He instantly moved to the back seat. He told me to come on and took my hand and led me to the backseat. I tried to sit as far away from him as possible, but he took my hand again and started to take off my pants. He lifted me up and sat me on top of him. You know what happens next. I wanted it to stop but I didn’t do anything because what I did wouldn’t matter. I tried calling my current boyfriend in the car but he wouldn’t let me. I was afraid of what would’ve happened. I feel so guilty, like it’s my fault. I agree it is my fault for venting to him again but I truly believed he wouldn’t do anything like that because this is the second time it’s happened.

329,"Hello, I am in need of advice for gas money and friend relationships from my friends.

Let me start off that I have known my friend for almost 6 years now. Let's call him Fred. 
Fred has always been poor and also never had a car and so he couldn't drive at all. He always says he will pay for me someday and also will drive me around when he gets a car, which he says he will this summer. We have this group or squad where it's our friends and we go to places to hang out. The thing is, I am the only driver for 4 other people. One is Fred, another is my younger brother and then the other two are friends I made in university that we all attend.

My younger brother has always helped me pay for gas. Anyways, going on my friend Fred, I've drove for him for almost 5 years of when he needed and also when he wanted to hang out with me and our group. Of course he pays me gas money sometimes, but now ever since we've been in the university. He barely pays anymore. He also just got his financial aid because something with he needed a signature from his parents but he didnt ask til a month ago. He got $5,000 free money, not loan and is now spending  it on e cig and the juices. Clothes which is understandable, and both of stuff he doesnt need. He has this air bed like the size of a kings bed. Since he got the money, he spent like 150 on the bed frame, and 2 new mattresses. They are like..regular mattresses? Not twin beds but like not big also.

Moving on, he has spent so much money. He always does this when he has money. The thing is, I look at it as he needs it because his family is poor. But he has asked me to drive him around so much and also to pick him up to be with our friends. He lives like 15 min away before we went to college and so it cost quite a lot. I am pretty dumb, but I wanted to hang out.

Also, I have these 2 other friends I made in my university for almost 3 semesters now. They have not paid a single dollar, except for the international friend when he needs me to go to the airport and stuff. But besides that, he doesnt help pay for the gas.

In the end, ever since college those 3 friends have not paid or even ask to help with the gas. The problem with me is that I ask the group to go for grocery or to eat out because I want to hang out with them on my own. But I think they have been taking advantage of me to where those 3 not my brother have hung out together only because they ecig, smoke, party with girls. The reason we even bonded a lot was cause of games and cause we are asian. Me and my brother on the other hand are just gamers and anime since kids to now. I try to bond with them to drive them around places to hang out with them and also e cig and drink with them sometimes, but it doesnt satify me at all. This whole semester with a little of last semester felt like there is this distance because me and my brother dont hang out with them.

 I have asked Fred many times for gas money,  but it seems that everytime I ask, he thinks I'm greedy and selfish. In which I am, but I'm thinking he doesn't know the struggle of gas money since he has always asked people to drive for him but not as much as me. I think the simple answer is ask them for money or else stop driving them around. Which is very true, but it's been hard for me to do that.

TL;DR
3 friends haven't helped with gas or dont appreciate me being the only driver. we are friends because we are gamers. But they been smoking and partying alot that there is this distance where I find it hard to bond with them. I help them a lot with errands aka grocery and food because I am on my way there also. But it comes to a certain limit where it is like, ok you should probably help me with gas.

Help me with this, also I am typing this very late on my phone when I have class 9am and it is near 5am. I can help with questions later. 

Also, I know I should ask them for money, but I sound like a dick because I always ask them.",18Mar2019,1

339,"We met online, we spoke for over a week almost all day everyday before we met, I had my first glimpse of what's become now, because, bare in mind we'd not met at this point, I logged into Twitter so see a bunch of tweets about me and basically degrading men in general, along the lines of being unfaithful. All of this, because I simply, and accidently re-opened the app that we had used to originally start speaking. Bare in mind also, that this entire time I was confident in my position that I was only looking for friends as I was new to the area. 

I tried to be really understanding of the situation because I knew she hadn't had much interaction with guys in the previous few years, so we moved on from that time, we met and things were actually quite good, for the most part. 

What eventually happened was that I moved in with her family at her home, I didn't actually go to the home for the first few months of our relationship, and then all of a sudden I was pretty much just there all the time, and this is when things started getting funny.

Every now and then I'd want to go home, just for an evening or a weekend tops, so I can see my mum and also have my own space. This is when I'd get bombarded with messages from both the partner and a family member of her too. She was convinced each time I went home, it was because I was leaving her. And the parent would get so sick of the situation she'd message and call me too, telling me to come back, and they'd convince me every time that I looked awful every time I'd been back home. Yes I did, because I haven't had a moments peace with what they'd been doing, was the truth of it.

Fast forwarding to more recently, about 6-8 weeks ago, I started feeling depressed, I don't know if it's because of the situation I've just mentioned or anything else, but I told my partner, and she explained she'd alerted the family too. At this time I said that i needed to go home and be by myself for the evening, so I called myself a taxi and when, I said goodbye to her and walked downstairs, said goodbye to the parent and went through the door. 
A moment later the parent re-opens the door, and starts telling me that they can't deal with this again, I calmly said that I just needed to go home for the night because I'm feeling low. I didn't get any support, I was told that if I went that night then I'm never allowed back, so I should stay. The partner comes outside shouting ""just leave him, he clearly doesn't care"" the entire time I just kept repeating, calmly, ""I just need to go home, have time to myself and see my mum, because I'm feeling down"" and they eventually shouted enough and realised I'd stopped responding and they left me alone, the taxi arrived and I left.

Since then I've refused to go back, for obvious reasons, it's been toxic. And the relationship has obviously suffered because of it, my ex did make the effort to come to my home a few times since then, but it hasn't been great. We haven't argued about anything personal or even about that night, she said herself it was out of line and I was trying to convince her it wasn't all her fault, in fact the parent initiated it. We've had a few okay times since but it's left a massive cloud over the relationship. We started seeing eachother a little less and spoke a little less about normal relationshipy things, it was always about how we're going to resolve this. 

The last time I saw her, she broke down, started crying, simply because the situation got the best of her, and at that point it was obvious this needed to end, for both of us, we spoke for a few hours about if it can work, she eventually just came out to say that she can't promise she'll continue to care about me after this and so I said it's best that we just move on then, she agreed, she called her parent to collect her, we sat in silence and she left, and that was that. 

However a few of my belongings are at hers, and a few of hers are at mine, so we need to communicate until it's resolved. I kept her on social media for this reason. She was either never replying or not responding with enough information, I could ask what exactly she needs and when, she might just say a date, no time, no items. So it was annoying me, like the process was intentionally being dragged out. Then I started to notice she was writing petty and hurtful things online about me.

I confronted her about this over messages, asking why she felt this was necessary since we broke up in actually quite a tame way. She then just flipped, it was so unprovoked. She started accusing me of being abusive, physically or mentally I'm not sure, because she wouldn't tell me what I had ever done to her. I said, give me one example and I'll admit to it. Just one. Her example was that I will ask her this until she answers, which is a form of abuse. That was what she was going with. That I will ask how I've been abusive to defend my name, so much, that I'm abusive. 

Reddit is anonymous obviously and I'd have no problem owning up to any issues I could've created, but I can whole heartedly admit that I have never raised my voice to this woman, not even once. I have never personally insulted her, the only exception is maybe ""seriously, fuck you"" in an argument, which, when you have to deal with everything I've mentioned, I find isn't unjust. I obviously have never touched her physically in an abusive manner, that's just grotesque. 

Since this time she's updating her bios, profiles, just everything with the intention for me to see or everyone else, that I'm abusive, I've objectified her etc. It's making me feel sick that I was good to someone, and they can publically make a false accusation like that, I don't see it any different to lying about rape. It can ruin my reputation completely and it's not justified. 

I'd also like to point out that I was always told that her ex boyfriend was abusive. I never questioned it until now, and I don't have many details about it because I tried to avoid bringing it up. But I just feel like I'm going to become victim to this lie she's obviously fabricated about people before.

I don't know how to diffuse this situation, and even if I'm capable of legally defending myself, because this could potentially cause me a world of problems

341,"I went on a night out at the weekend with my friend and we met his new girlfriend who I haven't seen before. As she was due to meet us later on my friend and I went down to the pub early and started drinking whist watching the football which led to me being already quite drunk when them time came to meet up with her.

Normally I am ridiculously nervous when meeting new people (have anxiety which I'm currently on medication and in therapy for) but it seemed to be 10x normal then as I wanted to make a good impression. Initially it was going well as we were having a good laugh and she and I seemed to have a lot in common.

The three of us ended up going to a club and carried on the drinking and it was a pretty good night at this point. Then in my drunken state proceeded to tell my friend that I fancied his new girlfriend to his face.

The rest of the night then was obviously pretty awkward as he was obviously worried I was going to do something. I didn't let on to her or make any moves in that direction at all but it soured the rest of the night.

Waking up the next morning I felt absolutely horrified that I would do something like that and straight away rang him up to apologies and explain that I don't actually feel like that and was just too drunk which he seemed to accept.

I was just posting to ask for advice on how to move forward with this? I've never done anything like this before and feel so ashamed and angry that I would say that to someone as I really don't feel that way at all. I've apologised to him and he's even asked me how I'm feeling but I can't bring myself to reply as he's obviously going to be pretty pissed off.

347,"Okay, so for starters, I had zero clue how to get an answer, until I remembered how many genuinely smart people are on reddit and how helpful your insights can be. 

So basically, I’ve been at my job for almost a year. I work in a restaurant that’s not table service, but instead, counter service. However, we still prepare desserts, make Starbucks drinks, and serve customer’s meals. My specific position is waitress/cashier. Anyways, we’ve always made tips, which I know is a privilege, not a right. But we’ve recently gone under some new changes in our restaurant, and the owner believes our hosts, cashiers, servers and bussers do NOT deserve tips, and only bartenders do. He demanded we remove our tip jar and only allow the bartenders to have one, and they will only split tips amongst themselves. 

However, a regular customer that we have, gave me a $5 tip after I spent some time accommodating his family, and told me to keep it. My manager saw and told me I’m not able to receive tips in my position and she now has a big target put on my back; she is threatening to literally end my employment over accepting this tip instead of putting it in the bartenders jar. 

Is this legal :

1, not allowing specific employees to receive or accept tips?? 
2, threatening termination because of it??

Please people of reddit, give me some insights.",18Mar2019,2

It happened again so I looked over and saw that it was my elderly neighbor shining his flashlight into the car from his window.

The light went away after a couple of minutes but I could see his shadow in the room through the window.

Eventually I had to get out of the car in order to enter my home. Our usual drop off spot is a quick 15 second walk from my house but as soon as I started to walk I was blinded by this goddamn light.

352,"Hi Reddit, 

I've asked for advice and answers on a few things in the past and it's helped me out before. Time to see if it can happen again!

As the title says I have a friend that is genuinely floating his way through life with no determination to really make anything of himself.

He has spent the last 10+ years quite literally doing nothing apart from playing games and sleeping, the sleep schedule changes every day as he just nods off when he is tired and wakes up whenever. His parents were pretty well off so he was never really at a want for anything and anytime they tried to get him to do anything and threatened to kick him out, they would never follow through. He moved out of there into his big brother's house last year (His brother is my best friend) and has continued his same behavior. 

It's at this point that I should say that he is has in fact turned 28 years old today and is still a virgin that has never even had a relationship with a girl. (He's still waiting for his perfect teenage virgin girlfriend... which really makes us all laugh and cringe at the same time.) He's also made himself get overweight and by the true definition of the word, a neckbeard of the highest order in the time he's been vegetating. 

He has accrued savings over a job he held for a while until he left saying ""it was beneath him"" and that his workmates were all ""idiots compared to him"". Because of these savings, he is paying rent to his brother but not going to the job centre or anything to go on benefits because he doesn't want to be pressured into looking for a job or having to be up at a specific time. We've tried telling him his savings will only go so far and they will all be spent by the end of the year, just on rent/internet.

The reason he was committing his time to gaming was because he wanted to become in his own words ""a professional streamer"" on Twitch. This was a year or more ago, his channel has nothing on it apart from some poorly executed Dark Souls videos and he has only accrued something like 12 followers in this time. 

So I decided to start streaming myself last week and got my channel looking at least a semblance of professional. I've only been streaming for a week and it's just a pastime, something to fill the gap and I already managed to gain almost 3x his total follower count in that time. It was half done for myself, but I was also trying to use it as a means to make him get serious about actually following through with ANYTHING. 

Instead he went to his own tech-savvy friend that he stays up through all the hours of the day/night playing games with and asked him to make his stream up for him, and even ""stream for him"". So even his goal of being a pro streamer is something he'd rather have someone do the hard work for so he doesn't have to do anything.

I don't know what I'm supposed to do, there is probably nothing I can do myself to try and get any semblance of motivation out of him. But in all honesty, it's what can HE do, what wake up call could there possibly be that would make him at least take his first step to getting his life in order!? What will stop him thinking he is still a 14 year old with no independence.

I've touted the idea that he should get his own place so he has something to take pride in and work towards improving but that would mean he would NEED to go on benefits as he'd be evicted within 3 - 4 months when his savings ran out through paying rent, bills...you know all the stuff a responsible adult his age is expected to pay, so I'm doubting he would actually do it.

Help me out here Reddit, give me some ideas that will actually save my friend as it almost feels like he's committing suicide in the long term!",18Mar2019,1

354,"Hi all,

Just as a brief background, I'm an American (29 M) who moved to France about 2 years ago and is working at a French company.  When I moved here I was quite open to meeting new people (and still remain that way) - not surprising since I knew nobody here and needed to make friends.  

So at work there was this one guy who started talking to me sometimes who seemed a bit weird but generally harmless.  He asked if I wanted to hang out on the weekend and I agreed, so we went to the gym together and got brunch afterward.  It was ok but I quickly started noticing that he was obsessed with all things ""international"".  Like when he spoke 80% of what he said revolved around all the girls from X or Y nationality he has sex with, or all the events he went to at the embassy of X and Y country, or that he was hanging out with like 15 people from A, B, and C country.  He also did weird stuff like pronounce the name of various countries and cities in their native language... like instead of saying ""Singapore"" he would say ""seeengapoah"" with a really strong accent and just go about the rest of his sentence like that wasn't weird at all.  And I just generally got a very creepy vibe from him and got the sense he was trying to collect me as his ""American"" friend, so I decided not to pursue a friendship with this individual.

Basically he just has not gotten the message that I am not interested in a friendship with him.  Over the past year he has kept proposing plans/lunches/etc. like every few days in the beginning and now every week or two, and I just refuse nearly every time.  I've refused every plan, like 90% of his lunch proposals (I accept only the work lunches very seldom), and I only accept because he literally tries to corner me on like the exact dates in the upcoming weeks when I will be free.  I ignored his messages, his friend requests on FB and Instagram, etc. but he keeps trying to contact me that way.  I've gone so far as to say I can't do lunch all week and then immediately ask another friend for lunch that week right in front of him.  But he doesn't understand the very heavy hints, and has even gone so far as to come around to my office to see if I'm there on multiple occasions (we are in different parts of the building, so he has to make a trek to see me).

Normally I would just go to lunch with the guy but its fucking unbearable.  To try to impress me, the conversations are literally him chronicling his supposed exploits with women of various nationalities - like that is 90% of the conversation.  It is such an awful experience and I just dread it for the whole week.   The guy seriously gives me the creeps.

\*

Is there anything I can do short of just being like, look please stop this, I am actively trying to avoid you, I don't want to hang out with you.  It would be short and brutal, but at least there would be no room for ambiguity.  And if I go down that route, whats the best way to phrase it?  

THANK YOU!!!!

357,"My dad and I have always had a strained relationship. I remember barely seeing him as a child and when I did see him, he felt like a stranger. It felt weird to hug him or talk to him. 

He’s a touch violent (punches animals if they don’t behave), likes to drink and do drugs. He’s also incredibly racist. I’m the complete opposite of all those things so I have trouble talking to him. I’m now 30 odd years old. 

I haven’t seen him in years. Last time I saw him, I went to his place and he pretty much ignored me the whole time. 

Now he constantly pesters me by phone or text to talk to me and I just don’t want to? I feel a sense of dread when I see his name come up. When we last spoke he was mad at me for not talking to him enough but I just don’t want him in my life anymore.

But then I start to feel guilty and will force myself to talk to him. The last time we spoke he kept making fun of Muslims and aboriginals. I just don’t like that type of energy in my life. If he wasn’t related to me I’d never be friends with him or even give him a second glance.

So why do I feel such guilt every time I think about cutting him out? And just to let you know, he and my mum don’t talk. He abused her so she obviously ran away and stopped talking to him. 

I think my worry is two fold. One is guilt because he’s my dad. Two I’m kind scared about what he would do if I did stop talking to him. Again, he’s a violent individual. ",18Mar2019,0
358,"I have this guy who’s been a “friend” of mine since elementary.
Up to this year it’s been fine, we weren’t really friends and we never met each other after school but we were palsy. Now, about a month or two ago he just started hating me and doing the most annoying things just to get me mad. For example: in history class our teacher doesn’t like writing on the board so we copy from the projector. I sit behind the computer and every lesson he’s the one in control of the computer, and the teacher teaches. Whenever I try to copy from the monitor rather from the projector he’d turn it off and if I keep writing he starts pissing me off talking to me while I’m trying to concentrate.
I didn’t really give a fuck about all this and just went on with my life until he decided he’s gonna take one of my friends (girl oc) and say we were a couple. He’s spreading it around and it’s really getting on my nerves, Nevermind the fact that I don’t find her attractive or like her that way at all, I kind of have a thing going on with another girl which is real and I don’t want her to think shes just like a second girl I go to.
I’ve tried confronting him but he just won’t stop and I’m at a loss. 

I don’t want him to ruin my relationship with this girl and I don’t want my friend (girl one) to think I told people we were a couple to feel good about myself.

It started as some cliche movie scene, we meet in school, hit it off, and boom, we’re together. At first she seemed cool, as in she wrestled and was a fan of memes, and she was a softy. It was only in a week into it when she started to do unusual things, she bit me, ran into walls, either to be funny or just looking for attention. She would scream and yell vastly inappropriate things in public. She would beg for attention and even scream at me for the tiniest bit of affection or if I did something as small as correcting something she said. I am what people would call a grammar nazi, and she would always scream at me if I did the littlest thing of correction. I was going to end the relationship, because it obviously wasn’t working out, but then she talked about how she’s suicidal, and she had the audacity to show her scars in public and scream about being the victim of this relationship. This was bad, I told some friends of mine and they did the worst fucking thing ever, I don’t know who, but they told her, they fucking ratted me out. A few days ago she was crying to me and making me make promises that I still loved her (which I don’t) and I have a feeling she’s going to kill herself soon, if I don’t take action and keep ignoring her about her screaming at me about not loving me, or if I break up with her, I have a feeling she’s going to die.

361,"A really quick back story; I have an introverted personality and throughout my life, in a lot of situations, I have always found myself being a nervous laugher. There is no disrespect or humour intended, it's just how I react sometimes. I am not completely laughing but more of a smile/ trying not to laugh.

368,"Hi there, so I will make this as short as possible.

I'm currently employed in a small company (5 employees) and I worked really close with my boss in order to understand the business sufficiently well, I only work here for 7 months, and I'm 23 yo (not that it matters, just FYI).

Long story short, we sell items on Amazon and other EU Marketplaces.

The thing is, we disagree in one particular thing that really bothers me, he only wants to sell items that give him &gt;10% margin. So, as you can imagine, there is a very big market of items that could give us a 5-10% margin that we are not selling.

It's not like there is a big work to be done or anything, we just ship the items to Amazon, and they sell them, we only have the work of putting in the box and ship it.

What I'm debating is: Should I sell the items that he doesn't want to sell by myself?

My issue is that, once I start to see the money coming in, I don't know if I will be able to stop doing this ""side business"", and I will always feel like I'm ""stealing"" from him.

369,"I'm a 22 year old American guy, and I've been trying to choose a new name for going on six years now. I'd rather not get into why I'm changing it, suffice to say it's not up for debate whether I will, just what it will be to. In these six years, the only name I've ever really loved is the Irish name **Tadhg**, pronounced like the first syllable of tiger.

I love Tadhg, I do. I got some friends to call me by it for a while in high school and it just lit up my day every time I heard it. It felt so right. I've already resolved that Tadhg is going to be in my name *somewhere*, because I just can't let go of it entirely, I'm just not sure if it should be my first name/the name I *go by*. In six years, it's my only constant: Tadhg will be in my name somewhere because I love it and I need it to be.

But the issue. It's not the spelling/pronunciation, which I don't mind. It's that I'm American. I am. My family is Scots-Irish if you go back a few generations, but I am American, and we were never Irish Catholic. And Tadhg has a long history of use as a derogatory term for Irish Catholics (like, Thomas Jefferson even used it), and a form of it, as I understand, still is used as such in Northern Ireland. I worry it's inappropriate/wrong for me to use this name.

One of my high school friends, her parents were British. And one time she called me Tadhg in front of her dad. And instead of feeling the joy and love I normally did from the name, I felt guilt and shame. I worried he knew the history of the name, the implications it sometimes has. I asked her not to call me Tadhg around her parents, and ultimately stopped trying to use Tadhg at all.

But really, how often am I going to be around British or Irish people? And I don't think it would bother me if they didn't know I was changing/had changed it to Tadhg. If Tadhg were just my name, I don't think it'd bother me. So how often am I going to be around British or Irish people who know I changed my name? Probably not often. Potentially never again. 

My first question: is is my fear founded? Am I wrong to want to use this name? Would it be inappropriate for me to use this name?

If the answer to that is no, then my second question is: should I let the history of the name--and the negative feelings I have because of it in specific situations--outweigh the love I feel for it most of the time and stop me from using the only name I have consistently felt attached to in six years of name hunting?",18Mar2019,2
371,"I’m a 18F who’s born and raised in New Zealand, my parents immigrated here from China so culturally I’m Chinese. A couple weeks ago I went clubbing with a group of friends and it was going great. While we were walking along the street to get to the next bar a group of white males probably in their early 20s walked past us. They were all laughing and clearly quite drunk. While we crossed paths, one of them pointed at me, looked me right in the eye and exclaimed “YOU’RE a chink”. Him and his group of friends starting laughing extra hard and they just kept on walking away. WOW I was SO angry. So much was going through my head that I didn’t really react, and by the time I wanted to do something they had already walked away.

373,"Im a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it so idk. Also when I only got a pub job myself without asking for her help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it most appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way but she’s started off really snotty with me that day it also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly but I took it as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

393,"When my friend and I hang out in person, it's pretty fun! We share a lot of things in common, and babble about it a lot in person. Often times, we compliment each other too much for our own good. Sometimes we get a little bit too touchy, and do things like cuddle, and let each other lay our heads on each others lap, share food and drinks and whatnot. I appreciate those moments, because we don't spend too much time together, because she'll decline our invites to come over every other time that she does come over. She has no other reason other than she's busy, but doesn't have an explanation why she is. That's understandable, however. That's her business, and I respect that. She's friend with my sister, but doesn't get as touchy as she does with me, and doesn't compliment her as nearly as often. Now, onto my main issue, is that she will always leave my texts on read or completely ignore them, and doesn't even respond to them afterwards, even if she is online. She'll rarely respond with little dodgy bits of conversation, but nothing to pick off on. It wasn't until my sister told me that she said ""Hello"" to her, and got a reply in seconds. They had a good bit of conversation, too. What is going on?

395,"All,

I’ve had issues with my boss for the last several years. A little background-

I work as an independent vendor, it’s myself and one other person. The other person I work with is salary, I am hourly. The hours go in waves, sometimes you work 12 hours, sometimes you are done after 6.

The salaried employee typically leaves as soon as all of our work for the day is done, I’ll usually stay a little bit longer then I’ll use vacation time if I leave early. Now this isn’t the most ideal way to use my vacation, but our coverage personnel isn’t exactly overflowing so  I’ve learned to adapt.

Recently we were told that the company that we do our vending for was not renewing their contract with us. As this news broke my boss began calling me and sending me emails stating he believed I should be at work as much as possible, when I asked him why he responded “so we can begin packing our equipment”, when I asked him “when is our final day?” He responded “nobody knows, but I’m sure by May we will be gone”

Now I have to let everyone know that all of the equipment in the office are things that are used on a daily basis, so packing things up now is not something that can be done. I told my boss this and he did not respond.

I do not have another job with my current company after this, so it is a very stressful time. So any time I have away from work is being used to try and secure my future. But the customer we service has never had any issues with the hours that we are there, as long as all of the work is done. We did not lose this business because of this, it was something comes unrelated to us.

Now getting to the point, this past weekend he sent me an email saying he “didn’t feel comfortable with the time off I had been taking) mind you, I am taking an average of 4-5 hours a week, so maybe one hour a day. 

I responded to him, I think we need to discuss this with HR. He is setting up a meeting this week to do so.

I looked through my employee handbook and the only thing it says about this is that they prefer that employees take a week off at a time, but they understand this isn’t always possible for offsite employees and they may have to use time off as available.

And it says that a supervisor can freeze or make other decisions on time off based on “business demands”. Here’s the thing with that though, there is literally nothing else I can do on those days I use an hour of vacation. 

Any advice?",18Mar2019,1

Hi [],

I applied for a [] job with the [] Party recently but haven't heard anything back. I tried to tailor my resume to the position and also added [Senator's business] to my resume.

I think a referral from [Senator] would help me get my foot in the door and make me stand out from the other numerous candidates. This position would mean a lot to me, because with 2020 elections coming up, I would enjoy the challenge that this position would provide.  

Do you think my candidacy is something that [Senator] could help out with? I thought it would be good to ask you because you’ve directly seen the work that I’ve done, and would be better to talk to rather than me reaching out to [Senator] directly, who I've never gotten the chance to meet personally.

399,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for some advice on how to approach an issue with the family that lives above me in my apartment block.

I own my apartment and have lived here for 6 years and only recently, probably in the past 6-7 months, am I starting to have issues with the family above me - I think they're only new living there but I don't know if they rent or own that apartment - I'm constantly hearing thumping and banging, to a point where my lights are flickering sometimes, or the lights are shaking.

&amp;#x200B;

I've went up twice so far:

1st time: Introduced myself and was nice about how I raised the noise concern to him. I told him that I'm hearing a lot of thumping and banging, which goes on nearly every day from first thing in the morning to last thing at night. He actually pissed me off because he point blank denied that it was him or his family but I kept my cool and said that I'm not up to make trouble or cause any issues and that I was just making sure he was aware of the noise and if he and his family could be more considerate regarding the noise - I also asked if we were loud as I wasn't aware at how much noise travelled through his floor/ my ceiling - He said he doesn't hear us.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to leave it a few weeks over Christmas and New Year to see if it settled down.

Over Christmas and all of January... not a peep. Eerie.

\*\*I'd like to point out that his hallway has tiled flooring, so I doubt he has an insulating layer of foam or whatever under it to absorb any impacts, etc..\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Feb comes and it's starting to get worse gradually, but only in the evenings around 4pm-9pm when I'm home, but the missus says she hears it when she works from home - I leave it a bit in case she is eggaterating as she sometimes does.

&amp;#x200B;

2nd time: 2 weeks ago, I go up again because I actually thought someone was going to come through the ceiling, was like someone was bouncing heavily on the floor. He and his wife answered the door and both denied again that it's them. He asked for evidence of the noise. **Literally seconds after he denied it his child (prob about 10yo) comes bouncing out into the hallway on a space hopper!** I told him that that's most likely the cause but  that definitely not limited to this. *I said that it was fine over christmas and January, his wife laughed and said it was because they* *""****weren't in the country""!*** I think he realied and then he and his wife said they weren't aware of the noise and would try and keep tabs on it.

&amp;#x200B;

5 minutes later when I'm back in my apartment I hear the same banging again for a good 10-15 minutes. I'm absolutely infuriated but I leave it to see how it pans out and see if it stops. It got a bit quieter that evening.

A few days later my girlfriend is working from home and she hears the banging again while she's on a call with one of her directors and he asks her what the banging is (I don't know how much truth is in this as I've tried recording the thumping on my phone but it doesn't pick it up??).

&amp;#x200B;

Today... The banging is again ridiculous. I need to go up again, but I've been nice the first 2 times and I'm about to go up and tell this guy to fuck off or kick his door in. I want to resolve this professionally but I'm really going to struggle to keep my cool. I'm tempted to bang on his door like a police man and in some sort of anger tell him that  ""the noise needs to stop. I'm not coming up again!"" and walk away.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice, please? My blood is boiling as I type this. If my GF goes up she will be so cheeky that it'll probably cause more problems .

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Noisy neighbour constantly banging, denies the noise even though I've been up twice. I'm at my wits end!

Thanks!

406,"I’m not sure were to ask but I’m in dire need for advice. This is about a close friend whom I will call rick. Lately he’s been very suicidal and almost succeeded.

Backstory:

The story starts about five years ago when starting high school. Choosing high school is a big choice where I come from (Sweden) since you’re locked in for at least one year in your studies. A couple of weeks into high school Rick snapped and yelled about how he hates his classes, classmates and even his life. Throughout high school we often met with a close group of friend and often played games together. Further into high school we became more distant to each other when I got into more professional gaming. Since gaming was our main hobby together we didn’t talk so much adding that during this time rick slowly faded away from our group of friends not coming to our activities.
 Rick finish through high school with the same class and fell into a deeper depression. 

Jumping to half a year ago, because of ricks h
choice of high school and the fact that he took easier classes means he can’t get into the good universities and hates all the one he’s tried ( dropped out of 3 colleges already). During this time he stopped coming to our group event we tried convincing him but he never came, we tried to knock and he just ignored, we even tried to break into his house several times. 

Nowadays he won’t even join discord and is almost always offline. Until three days ago me and two of his closest friend(our mutual friends) were sent a snap from Rick were he was in a mental hospital in a bed with the message “ mission failed lads”. I instantly drove to the mental hospital got him checked out and after this I had a deep talk with him. Rick promised me he would start coming back joining activities again or at least respond to our messages. But since I dropped him off at his home he hasn’t responded or read a single message and is ignoring every attempt of contact

In writing moment I’ve got no clue what to do and i can’t work because this drives me nuts how I’m unable to contact him. 

Is anyone else In the same boat as me? What do I even say to him if he responds?

407,"Im a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it so idk. Also when I only got a pub job myself without asking for her help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it most appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way but she’s started off really snotty with me that day it also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly but I took it as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence and I worried she hated me for it ",18Mar2019,1
408,"I’ll add a tl;dr at the bottom of this post because it’s probably going to get long.

I’m in my third and final year studying at university. I love university and my experience here for the most part has been wonderful but this year has been, how do you say, a complete disaster.

It started at the end of second year with housing issues. I had a housemate who wasn’t sure if she was going to be returning after that year but didn’t want the rest of our house to start looking for a place until she decided. In the end, she took too long making a decision and the only place I could find by that time was a student flat that is VERY expensive to live in. On top of rent, which is £25 a week more than my last house, I have to spend roughly £35 a month on laundry. This year has been horrible financially, I’ve had more books to buy and more expenses to pay for so my savings have been drained and for the first time in my academic career I’m in my overdraft, which is a horrible feeling considering how careful I am with money.

Another issue has been my health. I suffer from BPD which I’ve been seeking treatment for since I was diagnosed about 3 years ago. It was badly triggered whilst I was in a relationship with a guy that I now see was kind of problematic and was likely cheating on me. As well as that, I’ve recently been referred to a sleep clinic as my GP believes I may be suffering from ME. I physically cannot stay awake during the day, no matter how much I sleep, and this has really effected my class attendance and ability to pay attention and get work done on time.

I’ve also had a lot of issues with my flatmate who also happens to be my best friend. We are working on things now but it’s been a rough year for our friendship, she’s done a lot of problematic things that again triggered my BPD and my PTSD after she took an overdose in front of me. Again, we are working on things now but all of this has had a massive effect on me and have made it very difficult for me to get anything done when all my energy is going into keeping myself afloat.

As far as school goes, this semester has been very taxing on my time and energy. I do a literature related degree but I’ve never had as much work to do as I have this semester. I only take two modules, but on average I’m having to read two novels a week as well as working on ongoing assignments, prepare for presentations, and try and work on a dissertation that I haven’t properly worked on in months because I just don’t have the time or the energy.

My grades aren’t terrible but they’re very average, this shouldn’t be the case as I know I’m clever and talented but with everything else that’s been going on most of my work is left until the last second. I’m currently working on an essay that I have a five day extension on, tomorrow is the last day of the extension and I still haven’t finished it.

I don’t know what to do. I hadn’t considered retaking the year until I started looking at masters degrees recently. I found a course that sounds amazing, it’s in a new city that I’ve never been to but is very close to a lot of my extended family that I’d like to see more of. I desperately want to do this masters but I don’t know if I’d get onto it with my grades. I could repeat the year and try and get better grades but I desperately want a change. Plus, there’s always the worry that I’ll do worse next year. I already started university late due to how bad my mental health was in high school, I don’t want to spend the whole of my 20’s being average at a degree I’m paying a lot of money to do. Considering how much debt I’m in now, dropping out is absolutely not an option for me.

Can anyone offer some advice?

TL;DR My third year of university has been a disaster because I’m overworked, my health is poor, and I’ve been struggling with a mentally i’ll friend who I live with. I’m stuck between redoing the year, possibly improving my average grades, and doing a masters in a new city.",18Mar2019,1
409,"I’m generally not a very angry person. I don’t really lose my temper and I’m pretty laid back.
However, recently there has been a person near me that has been getting under my skin. They just seem to know how to push all my buttons and I end up flying off the handle. I know that I shouldn’t rise to provocations and I should just keep my cool, but before I know it, I’m yelling and having a go at them. 

I think they’re just doing it for kicks because they get a reaction out of me but I don’t know how to stop it. I feel like I go 0-60 in less than a second and I’m filled with this white hot rage that I can’t control. I’m scared that one day I’m just going to snap and end up becoming violent. I don’t think they realise how violent I’m feeling. I’ve tried to say something, but nothing has changed. Nobody seems to have an issue with it, like it’s funny or they get a kick out of it. But it’s really bothering me and stressing me out. I don’t like feeling that way.

410,"I met this girl a year ago, she's really nice person. But lately she's been acting wierd (wierder than usual) and really asking myself if she really want my friendship. This post will be very long (i'll try to not get too much into details) Also English is not my native language.
When I met her she was somewhat depressed, she was finishing university and had didn't knew what to do with her life, lost a friend and her bf had cheated on her the previous year and broken up. 
We immediately conected, we both have very similar tastes. We both like to read and write, art, similar music, films, to travel, etc.
Just after a month of knowing each other we started to date and at the beggining everything went smoothly. Until she got accepted to take a semester at a college in the other side of the city (1 to 2 hr drive from where i live) and she decided to break the realtionship, even though she visited her mother (lives like 15 min from my house) almost every weekend.
I accepted this, Im a realist and really know when someone doesn't want to date you. I KNOW I WAS FRIENDZONED. I accepted it and tried to move on with just being friends (truly just being friends) and for a while it seemed like it worked. 
We could hang around to talk, watch movies and other stuff. She even presented me her family and they instantly took a lot of liking of me. Specially her sister and mother (sometimes because of the things they say I swear they want her and me to return dating) and around this time I started dating other women with different degrees of success (of course I don't tell her or her family that I'm doing that)
Well out of nowhere she cuts communications and swears shes always sooo busy and has no time for anything but finishing her course (she's very obsessive about study/work) at college. While uploading pictures of going out with new friends from time to time :/
The months pass with both of us sending pretty average messages like how are you, what are you doing and the stuff from time to time. She even messaged me to wish me a happy birthday (but obviously couldn't go to the party I organized) this went for months. I really thought that when she finished her course we could resume a normal friendship.
After three months of not seeing each other I invited her for a coffee to talk and she actually said yes and then invited me to eat the next day at her house.
I thought like I was right, she was really busy while taking the course and now she was trying to have a normal friendship with me.
We start seeing each other from time to time, even at the time her dog died and she was super depressed.
Then, she was accepted at a work at the other side of town (you may see where this is going) we started to see each other a little less, but nothing of disappearing acts for the time being 
Then, I got accepted to a specialisation course at the same college she went just a few months back.
Out of nowhere she started to ignore my messages, saying she was too busy, that she didn't had any time to answer and the like. The same shit all over again.
But now the drop that spilled the cup for me was that just the other it was her birthday. I even sent her a pretty average happy bd text and to my surprise she replied (like 24 hours later but she replied) and says nothing more.
Yesterday I discovered she made a party with her family (and I guess friends) and didn't even invited me. I was very hurt.
Why do that? She knows I don't want to date her anymore (right now I'm seeing another person that srems like a good match), I just want to keep her friendship and she just keeps pushing me back.
I really don't know what to do.
Should I ignore her? Confront her? Talk to her sister about what's happening? (which we considered each other also as friends and talk from time to time)
I really want to keep her as a friend but I really don't know if its worth it anymore.
What's your opinion. Really appreciate people being honest (don't hold back. Just say what you think)
I know this was very long. If you read all the way to this point. Thank you very much.",18Mar2019,1
413,"So I just got accepted to college and I’m extremely excited, but already dreading the day I have to leave my family and my dogs. We have three, but two of them are my sister’s and I know they will be okay. 

My dog, Shadow, is literally my shadow (and he was not named that on purpose) he and I go everywhere together, I don’t bother with a leash unless it’s a super public place because he’s always by my side. We have like our own language, I can understand exactly what he wants and he can do the same with me. 

Just thinking about leaving him can bring me to the brink of tears because of how much I love him, I’ll miss my other two doggos but I know they’ll be okay. He doesn’t have that bond with anyone else in the family and I worry he will get really sad or even worse forget about me. 

I’ve never been away from him for more than two weeks (which was torture.) he’s my other half.. 

My mother has already agreed to bring him whenever she visits and I’ll see all my doggos during holidays, but I’d really like some advice on what to do. ",18Mar2019,1
414,"A few years ago, I had a summer fling with a boy. It didn't ***feel*** like a fling at the time, but in the grand scheme, it was. He totally broke my heart, and I didn't know how to handle it. So, naturally, I forced us into friendship. I wasn't ready to lose that connection. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to now, he is truly my best friend. He understands me always, he knows what moves I'm going to make before I make them. We are very different people, but we vibe so well. It's hard sometimes to separate that best friend love from genuine feelings. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was dating a boy for 3 years, and he was always jealous of my best friend. He thought we still had feelings for each other. And while I still don't think I did, the constant paranoia made me wonder sometimes if our summer romance was just bad timing.

&amp;#x200B;

After my ex and I broke up, best friend and I hooked up. It didn't mean anything, really... we were drunk, and it felt like closing a chapter. But our friendship has always been a weird one; I think it's like that with people you used to date sometimes. We always sleep in the same bed, always play with each other's hair, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**This past weekend, he met one of my other best friends...and has feelings for her.** She has feelings for him, too. Or at least they ""connected."" Meanwhile, he and I literally hooked up the night before. I love them both so, so much. And after all this time, I have no claim to him. Especially because he doesn't want to be with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

If two people I love feel chemistry, stupid jealousy shouldn't stand in the way. Like a masochist, I sort of went out of my way to help them. Now, I have to be there for them both as they navigate each other. It sucks. It hurts. But it shouldn't!!! I still want what's best for them.

&amp;#x200B;

**Basically, I just need help getting over him.** I know we don't work in the big picture. We just connect forever as human beings, but romantically, we're too different. My brain is just mean to me sometimes and can't let go of him.

415,"When I started my current job, (working in mattress sales, a pretty heavily performance based industry) it was supposed to be a part time 20 hour a week gig where I mostly sat around and functioned as backup, only taking “overflow” as they call it, aka only selling when all the full timers were busy. I was never supposed to work a store alone. 

Well now I’m scheduled to work alone more often than not and I’m working 29.5 hours a week so I don’t get benefits. I work as hard as any full timer, do my job and do it pretty well. Full disclosure I went home early Friday because I was vomiting and couldn’t function so I am not doing as well as I usually am metrics wise but I am overall a high performer. Higher than plenty of people in more senior positions. However the big boss man said that there’s no way he’d promote someone in my position to get a raise and a title change would come after six or so months of doing the work without the title. I don’t plan to be in this job for six more months because when I graduate college I’ll be getting something better. 

At this point in my career I care more about the title change than the raise. I make most my money off commission anyway. It would cost him and the company nothing and greatly aid my job search to be able to list a promotion on my resume. (Could it be that they don’t want me to leave?) How do I tell my boss that I am either going to stop going above and beyond for my current title or start doing exactly what is expected of me for a new title?

Am I lying to her by not telling her all of these details or is it okay just not to bring it up and leave things where they are, since technically it is the truth. She has told me that she doesn't think she could be with someone who has had sex in the past.

426,"My current partner of 1 year used to be in a 2 year relationship with a polyamorous woman who was in an open marriage with his best friend. This couple had been his close friends for years and are part of his wider friendship circle and social scene.

When he ended things with her so he could start a monogamous relationship with him, she went crazy. For a few months my partner and I were discouraged from going to any events (mainly music gigs) that she might attend because his friends were worried she’d cause a scene if she saw us and maybe even punch me. We spent the first six months of our relationship feeling like outsiders from his social group and he was depressed because she was constantly complaining about him to mutual friends.

Now she’s calmed down and, along with her husband, wants to be friends with him again. I suspect she still romantically likes my partner judging from how strongly she’s reacted to what she views as rejection on his part.  If my partner opens up the lines of communication with her, it’s likely to complicate things given her past behaviour.

My partner’s open to the idea of rebuilding their friendship in baby steps (especially with her husband, who hasn’t done anything wrong) but I’m uncomfortable with it. I don’t want open myself up to a woman who has been nothing but negative, unstable and volatile. It’s likely to put a strain on our relationship. But I don’t want to stop him from doing what’s important for him because he may end up resenting me.

I decided to avoid going to events they’ll be at because it’s too stressful for me, but encouraged him to still go. When I told him this he got really upset because he wanted me to go with him so we could “face it together”. This makes me feel pressure to go along with something I’m not ready for simply to appease him. I’m also confused as to why he’s so keen on letting these toxic and negative people into our lives when they’ve recently caused a lot of heartache. He should be protecting me from friends/ex-friends of his who are likely to cause harm. Yes they have a history and he probably wants to maintain that connection, but in my eyes the risk outweighs the reward and it’s safer to avoid them as much as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

So, years ago, when I was about 6ish, my oldest brother (10 at the time) started molesting me while camping with my grandmother and my two other siblings. It happened every night, for the couple weeks we would go. This lasted for about 3 or 4 years till I finally came out and told my parents about what was going on and why I started to hate going camping.

I didn't tell them face to face because i was embarrassed and ashamed of what was going on, so instead I wrote a note and gave it to my dad while he was cooking dinner, and ran back to my room.

A couple minutes pass by and my parents came into my room and told my sister to leave (we've shared a room for the passed 17 years). When they did they told me to ""point at the barbie doll where he touched you"". So, I did.  After that, My dad, step mother, and y oldest brother sat in the laundry room together (the most secluded room in the house) and we sat in silence for the most part of it. I kept asking for him not to go to jail because A.) He's my brother B.) I didn't want him to leave jail and hurt me for calling him out.

This is where it started going down hill. My dad asked him, ""were you just having a wet dream?"" to which my brother automatically nodded his head yes. However, I remember that every single time he would touch me while I was ""asleep"", I would shift which would make him JUMP BACK ON HIS BED AND FUCKING SNIFFLE. I didn't know people jumped and sniffled when they were dreaming, but okay...

Then, my dad started calling me a liar for saying he did that. To this day, I still live in the same house as him, and still get called a liar for this. They yell at me for not hugging him, talking to him, or wanting to be int he same room as him. Am I in the wrong? Should I just put this past me?

Next thing I need advice on is this. Same concept, but it's also very different.

Last year at my family's Christmas party, my uncle (technically not my uncle b/c he's my grandmothers brother but we still call him Uncle Jim) who I rarely see was there. (Yeah, you can already tell what I'm going to start talking about considering it's a fucking meme. But I can assure you, this is 100% the truth.) I've always had an awkward relationship with him because he's never around and well, because of hat I'm about to tell you. 

He's a very touchy grabby type of person. Whenever he sees me, he grabs me into his arms and squeezes me tightly and tickles the absolute shit out of me - he does the same with my sister. That's something a normal uncle would do, right? Right. However, when we (my sister, him, and I) were sitting at the table away from the party, we were talking about why I'm home schooled, what bad decisions I made in HS that led to me being home schooled, and then he popped out the question ""you got a bf yet?"" and ""how many bfs have you had so far?"" those types of questions. When I answered them honestly, and shit, we went on to talk about my home schooling and how it work. Then, I got up to get another piece of pie peach cobbler I had made with my grandmother and sister. The pan was right in front of him, so I had to stand directly next to him to get another piece. When I stood next to him, he grabbed my waist, held e there, then his hand kind of traveled to my thigh where he began squeezing it. 

This topic's a little hard to talk about considering this happened approx. 4 months ago on Christmas eve. but I still really need advice regarding this.

This isn't the first weird encounter I had with him. I remember on my sisters birthday last year or the year before, when he saw me he said that, ""I'm getting all growed up and am developing nicely."" Yeah. After that, he picked me up, hugged me TIGHTLY and I ofc said, ""ow"" because A.) i'm getting fucking squished to death and B.) because my developing chest is being squished too and I had to explain that to him and when I did, he told me that he didn't mind. Like, okay? Not what i was trying to say but, alright.

Now, I want to tell my grandmother about this so she can kind of prevent this from happening I guess, but I don't know how to bring this up. How do I talk to her about this and how do i explain how uncomfortable it makes me?

&amp;#x200B;

TD;LR

1.) My brother molested me when I was younger, i told my parents about it - they called me a liar and yell at me for not paying any attention to him (hugs, ""hi's"", etc.) Do I ignore the fact he molested me for 4 years and start to pay him attention?

2.) My uncle is a little touchy grabby with me and makes me uncomfortable. How do I tell my grandmother about this and how do I prevent this from happening?

434,"F 29. I met Bailey and Lilly in kindergarten, 1995. 
 This is a really long story so I'll just try to stick to the main points. I basically kind of grew up with these girls we live completely different lives. Their parents were divorced and they were living with their mom. Their dad had some psychological issues so legally he wasn't able to care for the girls. As we grew older, it was apparent that their mom was an alcoholic, as the girls kind of went crazy during their teen years. They were experimenting with drugs, a lot of drinking and so on and so forth.  Honestly, has a teenager I thought that the drinking and partying was just kind of a normal thing for teenagers to do. I didn't partake any of the drug use besides pot. Around 2009 was when Bailey and I had a pretty bad falling out. Bailey was a pretty manipulative person and always used her mothers alcoholism and fathers mental illness as kind of a scapegoat for her shitty behavior. She was incapable of taking responsibility for any of her actions and always blamed someone else. She didn't like hearing the word ""no"" and would spiral into a toddler like tantrum upon hearing it. Lilly was kind of the mediator sometimes but she would ""stay out of it"" when her sister threw the tantrums. I stopped talking to them in the 2010 after Bailey assaulted me and put me in the hospital. I was constantly harassed by them to not press charges because at that point Bailey was the main breadwinner in the family. The mom was laid off for reasons due to her alcoholism and if bailey was gone, Lilly couldnt support the family by herself. Honestly, I didnt press charges because I honestly did not want to see them ever again. 
Sometimes I'd hear from mutual friends how they were doing and honestly they were in the same spot they have been in for the past decade. Bailey has been married twice and divorced twice due to domestic violence, drug use etc.  Bailey had tried to reach out multiple times telling me she had changed but I ignored her and blocked her. 
Last week, I got a message on facebook from Lilly. Her mother was diagnosed with Copd back in 2015 and passed away. She explained everything that happened within the past 9-10 years and ended it with [verbatim]:

""I'm proud of you and you will always have love from me. I am messaging you because my mother's funeral expenses are going to cost up $3,000. They would have been a lot more, but due to lack of funds, we can only cremate her and have a small ceremony. I've heard from mutual friends that you have been doing more than well, and its embarrassing to ask, but is there anyway you can contribute at least $2000 towards the Services? Please let me know by March 25th.""

I responded with my condolences and offered $250. Honestly, I am doing okay with life right now. I'm at the point where I can pay rent and all my Bill's and probably have enough to go out to eat maybe once a while. However, I don't have enough to even put in a savings. I basically said this and was left on read. A few hours later, Bailey messaged me from a new account (as I had her blocked on fb) asking me to donate at least $900. I didnt respond and blocked her immediately. I changed the settings on my fb in case she tried to create a new account. I again offered my condolences to Lilly and after she read it, I blocked her as well. I feel that I was too harsh however, other friends have told me that if I had donated the money, it more than likely wouldnt go towards the funeral, as there's a cremation service for $600 tops. I feel like a bad person for not contributing but I also feel like if I were to contribute then it would open the doors for Bailey to try to get back in my life. Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing. ",18Mar2019,1

He also said he’s confused about what he wants to do with his life and where he wants to go and that he is satisfied for now in his life but he can see himself getting very bored with it later on.

437,"Hello! throwaway account here. 

I work at a self-publishing company and will be completing my MFA degree in May. Currently I work as a Project Coordinator and manage our Ghostwriting program. The Ghostwriting is actually enjoyable, but the PC position is 95% of my job. And I’m miserable. I’ve been doing this for almost 4 years and I’m getting to a point where I feel no value in what I’m doing. 

I also don’t have a way to move up as my boss’s position would be the next step. I feel stagnant. I have been looking for other jobs, but my husband is also finishing his graduate degree in June and it’s possible we may move out of the city. I don’t necessarily want to get a new job and find I have to leave it in a few months. My boss is aware this may happen and said, if it came to it, they’d fight to keep me on doing a new job remotely that they’d just kinda make up. We’re understaffed so there’s definitely work that could be done outside of talking to clients. (I could not do my PC job remotely). 

My PC job is not impossible to find a replacement, but it would be messy for a while if someone else took over my clients. It would be easier to a new person if I was still in the building for a while before I’d go completely remote to help them if they need it. (They would. Our clients are... difficult. Especially if someone new takes over.) 

My husband has been having more feedback from companies out of our current city, so the chances of us moving out are looking a bit more likely although there’s still a chance we’ll end up staying.  

Should I tell my boss I am unhappy and would like to move into a job that I could do remotely now in an effort to get it done early if we do move? Should I explain I’m very unhappy and would like to move into something I could use my degree for and that I feel like I currently can’t move up from where I am? My thoughts are an on staff Writing Coach/editor. Or working with our promotional team. (I also founded a small non profit with my friends and I run our social media. I’d like to gain more skills in marketing as a result.)  Thanks for any advice in advance! 

TLDR: Unhappy with current job, may be moving out of town, should I talk to my boss now about changing positions to something I could do remote?

438,"My boyfriend (28m) and I (23f) have started talking about buying a house together once I finish grad school and get a job. He's settled in his career and I'm likely to get a good job when I finish school since there's a shortage of people in my field. I have a £40k inheritance from my grandmother and he has a similar amount invested in his apartment which he owns (and we both live in) which we plan to use to buy our house. We are planning to spend the rest of our lives together, so we're not scared about making this commitment. The thing is, we're not married or engaged and we're not the most religious or conventional people out there so we weren't really planning on it and a wedding seems like an expensive, stressful faff which we could probably do without. Since, obviously we know that even amazing relationships can end badly, and not everyone who plans to spend the rest of their life with someone actually manages it, we want to make sure we both are legally entitled to half of the house if we end up having to sell it. Does anyone have experience of something similar? What are our options here?

439,"I’m going to try and explain this shortly. We just had a baby, been together for 3 years and live together. Lately she’s been very rude, drinking heavily, and causing fights for no reason. She always talks about leaving and going back to PA where she’s originally from and taking the baby. I love my family. Idk what I’d do with out my son every day. She left her phone open when she was drunk and passed out and she was talking to one of her scum bag friends. The conversation was about me and how she feels bad cause she made me cry and I’m not a the type to cry. And how I was begging for my my family and my son.

443,"My current partner of 1 year used to be in a 2 year relationship with a polyamorous woman who was in an open marriage with his best friend. This couple had been his close friends for years and are part of his wider friendship circle and social scene.

When he ended things with her so he could start a monogamous relationship with him, she went crazy. For a few months my partner and I were discouraged from going to any events (mainly music gigs) that she might attend because his friends were worried she’d cause a scene if she saw us and maybe even punch me. We spent the first six months of our relationship feeling like outsiders from his social group and he was depressed because she was constantly complaining about him to mutual friends.

Now she’s calmed down and, along with her husband, wants to be friends with him again. I suspect she still romantically likes my partner judging from how strongly she’s reacted to what she views as rejection on his part.  If my partner opens up the lines of communication with her, it’s likely to complicate things given her past behaviour.

My partner’s open to the idea of rebuilding their friendship in baby steps (especially with her husband, who hasn’t done anything wrong) but I’m uncomfortable with it. I don’t want open myself up to a woman who has been nothing but negative, unstable and volatile. It’s likely to put a strain on our relationship. But I don’t want to stop him from doing what’s important for him because he may end up resenting me.

I decided to avoid going to events they’ll be at because it’s too stressful for me, but encouraged him to still go. When I told him this he got really upset because he wanted me to go with him so we could “face it together”. This makes me feel pressure to go along with something I’m not ready for simply to appease him. I’m also confused as to why he’s so keen on letting these toxic and negative people into our lives when they’ve recently caused a lot of heartache. He should be protecting me from friends/ex-friends of his who are likely to cause harm. Yes they have a history and he probably wants to maintain that connection, but in my eyes the risk outweighs the reward and it’s safer to avoid them as much as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

The restaurant I work at has 2 owners- they are brothers. I work directly with one of them. He is my boss while the other is only *kind of* my boss. He owns the restaurant but he is not involved with it. He owns a multitude of properties and is, in a way, the restaurant's landlord. 

&amp;#x200B;

He is much older than me. It is rumored that he may have kids. Some have said he's married, his brother said he has a girlfriend, his friend said they broke up a month ago. I don't know guys. I don't know **anything** about the dude except for the beer he likes and that he's Italian. 

&amp;#x200B;

I mentioned to my boss (landlord's brother) that his brother was hella attractive. He just laughed it off. My boss is very professional but is also down-to-earth and sometimes thinks I'm funny. Landlord was sat in my section and was very very friendly. Not quite flirty- but just kept stopping me to talk. Every time I looked up from my work he would catch my eye and smile. My heart would flutter. He is a fox. 

&amp;#x200B;

He came in again the next night, I've now seen him more in a week than I have the entire time I've worked here. He's in my section again. He keeps talking to me, I keep bringing him beers. He's probably the friendliest, sweetest person I've ever met, but I don't think much of it because **everyone** says that. I don't think I'm getting special attention; I just assume he is being his normal, sweet self. Genuine smile, eye contact, laughs without holding back. He is simply a lovely man to be around. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway- near the end of my shift he asks me for a piece of paper. He then hands me a note as I'm passing with his number asking me to get coffee. Coffee is much more relaxed and low key than drinks, so I text him the next day accepting the date. Cue us texting throughout the day, him telling me I should come over for a bonfire, telling me he's thinking about me during the day etc. His intentions are clear. He is interested and I can't figure out why and I can't figure out if this is appropriate. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm worried that my boss will be pissed that I've gone out with his older brother. I'm concerned because this man is rich and successful and gorgeous and I'm a very poor, young waitress. He's poised and professional and says things like ""cheers"" and I'm still sort of pumped on listening to punk music and having a PBR in a dive bar. I'm messy and disorganized and confused and broke. We are going to have nothing in common. I also worry that if it goes badly, it'll be weird even though he's never really around...

Out of desperation now I am considering quitting for a while to qualify for Medicaid for my son and I.  I don't pay rent, my car is almost paid off and with the child support I think I would manage for a while and I could get some medical things taken care of for me that I need. Is there any other options? Has anyone been in this situation? My son needs insurance badly, he's been diagnosed with autism and has been going to therapy which has helped and I don't want him to lose that.

462,"First off I love my girlfriend. I think I’m having such a hard time with this, because I can’t see my life without her. She’s 31 and I’m 29. Our life is by no means perfect, but I try to be her rock and support her. She has made it clear she wants to have kids. I’m not sure if I want kids. I could see us being married, but I still just don’t like the idea of being responsible for a human life in this world. 

Honestly it terrifies me to think about it. I have said I’d rather adopt. Give a loving home to someone who doesn’t have one rather than bring a new person into this world. Every time I bring this up its starts a debate. 

I’m starting to think the only way she’ll be happy is without me in her life, because she wants kids so bad and I’m just not sure I can do that. How do I deal with this? Is it common among other people my age? 

Thanks anyone who gives me some advice. ",18Mar2019,1

466,"Sorry for the long post. TL;DR at the bottom.

About a year ago, I got my first job working at a charity. I was only on a 6 month contract. I loved every single second that I was there and I was so sad to leave once my contract was up. The people there were all so friendly and I was always so happy to be working there.

I haven't worked since then. Not because I don't want to. I just haven't had any offers from anywhere.

Last week, I went for my first interview in months. The thing is, it wasn't even really an interview. I sat in a room with this woman who didn't even ask me real questions. The job is a temporary printer operative in a warehouse. I have no experience but the job ad said that no experience was necessary as training would be provided. So in the interview, all the last asked was ""do you have experience"" and then she gave me a booklet to fill out all of my contact details and things to sign. That was it. I felt a bit awkward. 

I figured I'd never get the job because that's just the kind of feeling I got once the interview was over. Well, a few days ago, I sent a message to my old boss asking if I would be able to volunteer if I didn't get the job and she said yes. I just figured I wouldn't get the job so I got so excited at the idea of being able to go back to that place again. 

About an hour ago, I got a text from the place I interviewed for and they gave me a phone number to call if I was still interested in the job. 

So here's the problem: do I accept this job that, despite it being only temporary, will obviously pay me for my time OR do I decline it and be a volunteer at a place I know I will be extremely happy in?

I am an extremely shy and awkward person so starting work in a warehouse with people I've never met is nerve racking to me. Of course, nerves come to everyone when you start a new job but at least I know for a fact I will be happy volunteering in the charity.

TL;DR: Would it be a bad idea to decline a temporary job offer in a warehouse (in which, I have no experience) so that I can volunteer in a place that makes me happy?",18Mar2019,1

471,"Hey there, I am currently just seeking advice on what I should with the current situation on hand: 

&amp;#x200B;

This past year, I have been in my 'forced' gap year, as I had tore my ACL a week before my departure to my university ( the acceptance has been deferred) . Although this was unfortunate, I still kept my hopes up an decided to do several things including: getting into an internship, learning a language, attend activities/gain more interests, attend a course in a local university/college and most importantly, and apply to more colleges  (the university that I got accepted to is my safety school, so I want to try to get into other schools that match my academics) During this gap year. So far, I have achieved nearly ALL my goals. These are the things that I have currently achieved so far:

&amp;#x200B;

• Intermediate in Mandarin and Cantonese (Still trying to develop my skills) 

• Got into THREE internships (Which I still go to) 

• Attended an accounting course in my community college  

• Got into Philately and Numismatics

• Got into building car models 

• Made some new friends online and offline 

• Currently learning Photoshop and Premiere Pro (Self taught) 

• Trying to learn web development by scratch (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)  (Self taught) 

&amp;#x200B;

Although I have not lost my weight yet as I am limited with what I can do due to my ACL tear. The problem comes with the Universities that I am applying to and the accounting course that I am enrolled in. After hearing back from the University that I applied to, they all required me to submit a transcript of the accounting course that I am currently in.  Although this was not a big issue for me, I later realised that I was not able to give them a mid-term transcript due to the fact that the final grade is the grade I get on the final exam (which is coming up in two months) and most of the universities require me to send the reports in a month. Even after contacting them, they need to get all documents before the deadline. A few hours ago I received an email from one of the universities saying that I have been rejected to one of my courses due to my issue with the documents. I feel that this issue is also going to occur with the other universities that I have applied to as well. I don't want to stay in my community college at all, as I feel that the environment will not let me grow and only let me focus on my academics and not build my social circle and skills due to the fact that there are only a small group of people in my course and no extra curricular activities/clubs in my college (Literally, I go to class sit for four hours and come back home). I also do not want to go to the university in which I have deferred my acceptance I truly feel that I can get into a better university ( As I have earned a 3.5 GPA and got accepted into 6 AP courses  in high school) and would feel that all the effort that I put during high school would go to waste. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel that I am hitting a brick wall while trying my 100% on what I do. Although this might sound negative/unconstructive, but reality is that ALL my friends have got into a decent university or are enjoying what they do. Even the ones that got worse grades than me in high school look like they are enjoying themselves where ever they go and are in a decent university. Even though I have done so many of these activities during my year I feel that I am not satisfied with what I am doing and am slowly loosing interest in what I do. I also have been starting to loose contact with my high school friends rapidly and am slowly starting to be left out. I am not sure on what I am doing wrong or whether there is something that I am missing out. I would also like to ask what would you guys do if you were in my position?

475,"I've had a lot of issues over the last 2 years. I am 22 yrs old and live with both parents, an older brother, and my grandparents. My mom was sick for a year (almost dying twice). I stopped attending college and cut my hours at work to stay at home and take her to doctor appointments. Since she's been getting better, everything's gone downhill. She turned to alcohol and drove away half of my family, who no longer communicate with us, she would go into rages of paranoia that almost caused her and my dad to split, she holds on to the past and is refusing to let go (which is what started all this) and she is trying to cut out my other grandparents from our lives. After one night of major confrontation, she checked herself into a mental institution and was there for over a week. When she got out, everything was great, but I just found out last night she is starting to relapse. She refuses to go back to therapy, refuses to acknowledge that she's a alcoholic, and is constantly lying to us about anything and everything (to which she has always been a chronic liar my entire life). Even when she got out, I tried to encourage her to go places with me or start a hobby just so she wouldn't get in a rut, but she is refusing that now too. I'm at the point I don't even have empathy for her anymore and see her as a roommate I'm stuck with rather than a mother.

On top of this, I am struggling with passing grades for college, and feel like I'll never finish it, staying stuck at home. I work at an animal shelter, I use to love it but now I absolutely hate it because my new managers don't care about employees, play favorites, and do not listen to any issues employees bring up. I can't leave because it is the only place I've found that pays the most that is extremely flexible for school. The only thing that makes me happy is when I'm completely isolated, not at home, doing hobbies I love (which I'm often ridiculed for because I either ""do nothing else or spend to all of my money on"", which is false), and  working to socialize with scared animals at work. I had to cut my hours at work to only cleaning because I got to the point I was having chest pains working full days. It's helped some, but it doesn't seem enough.

I only have 2 close friends I talk to on a regular basis, to which when I try to tell one about what's going through my head, I get an ""oh"" or ""that sucks"", so I no longer speak to her about my issues. My other friend is always willing to listen, but I feel like I'm a burden because she has worse issues she has to deal with everyday.

I just feel stuck and that my life is destined to be me alone and taking care of myself. I feel like my feelings aren't as urgent as my mother issues, or my brothers severe depression that's gotten worse will all this family stuff. I can't afford to move, I'm afraid to leave my brother and mother with their depression, and I don't want to dump these issues on my grandma, who doesn't fully understand everything going on. My dad works constantly and is never home. I found out he is enabling my mom with alcohol now, and don't even feel like I can go to him now. Just don't know what to do.

477,"tldr at the bottom

Rapid Fire Background Info. She \[27F\] is a teacher (California). I \[27M\] work in the tech field. Been dating for 6.5 years. Both up to our ears in student loan debt. I am likely to start a new job soon which would relocate us. I just want her to be happy.

So, as most of my American reddit counterparts will know, the life of a teacher here is not always the best scenario, and its the reason that I want to bring this subject up with her. Before I start, please understand that this is not motivated by money. It is a small part, but honestly I make enough in my profession to ensure food is kept on the table, and our debts get paid. What irks me about her job is the work life balance. Absolutely. Abysmal. 

Many teachers here will know just how grueling it can be. 10 hours in the classroom with a bunch of kids (she teaches elementary). That's not enough. You're expected to do lesson planning at home. Need supplies? Yeah, that's on you. Parent's think their kid is special? They're not, but they have your email address and continue to spam your inbox to do better for their ""special ray of sunshine"". Want to go on a vacation for the weekend? LOL. can't. Report cards due this week. Well, they get summer vacation right? Yes, but teaching summer school helps bring in some extra money (that they should be paying anyway).  

One of the worst parts about all this is that She is AMAZING at her job. Like she freakin kills it. She is continually ahead of the game in terms of her career from other teachers in her school (who btw get paid well more than her because they have been there longer, not because they actually know how to teach well). I think this is what makes it so hard for me to bring up. Also, because I know that in spite of all these failings in our school system, she still loves this job, and she loves all those little kids (even with their psycho helicopter parents).

In light of this relocation, a wedding coming up, and basically starting a new life together, I had begun to wonder if maybe this was the time to bring up a potential change? Or to see if she is even open to the idea? The problem is that she is a very emotional person, and I know that if I bring this up, I may introduce doubt into her mind about her career choices, which is not something I want to do. Crying is inevitable if I bring it up, and a big problem for me is that I just am not an empathetic person at all on the surface. I certainly sympathize and understand the emotions people have, but I am horrible at showing it. 

So, reddit, I am turning to you for some advice. How would you suggest approaching this situation? Is it even a conversation worth having? Would anyone care to share their experiences that can shed some light on my own? 

TLDR; Fiance is a teacher and could have a better work-life balance. I don't know how to bring up the subject of potentially switching jobs.

480,"So I work in retail and my manager seems to have a problem with everyone. I don't think I've ever seen her smile or say something positive without it sounding sarcastic. She has embarrassed me and my coworkers in front of customers multiple times. She talks shit about me and my coworkers to each of us. I've literally had customers come up to me and complain that the manager was rude to them, that's happen at least 3 times now. I really like my job, and I think it's fair to say that I'm a hard worker and that I'm good at what I do. But this woman makes me not want to come into work. I dread being around her because I know she's going to talk down to me and treat me like I'm an idiot. The other day she pissed off another customer so I fixed the issue for him and then she came over and started being rude to him again and acting passive aggressive. He said he's never coming back to our store after he'd been shopping there for almost 10 years. It's gotten to be ridiculous and I don't know how to deal with it anymore.

Everyday, it gets a little bit harder for me to stop myself from calling her a bitch or slapping her when she treats me like dog shit. Sometimes she even acts like the victim. She came up to one of my coworkers and said, ""So, what have the employees said about me today?"" She treats everyone badly and then acts surprised when we don't like working with her.  I know that part of being an adult is spending time with people you don't respect or who don't respect you. But It's really been getting to me lately.

Each residence has a very small (approx. 5' x 6') balcony that is made of wooden slats that have about a half inch of space between each one, which means air flows freely through. Now, we've had the same upstairs neighbors (a mom and teen son) the entire time, and this is not our first issue that involves *some* sort of negligence, but now we're dealing with a living creature and I think things should be rightly escalated. Animals are explicitly not allowed in our condo complex, but people do break that rule sometimes even without trying to hide it, so that's not my problem with this. It's that the cat is frequently left outside, and as I am not outside 100% of the time, I have no way of knowing for how long. Today is the final straw though, because I watched my neighbor and her son get in the car and drive away, all the while above my head the cat's scratching the hell out of the CRATE it was left in OUTSIDE in 46° weather.

So, in Virginia, USA, who should I call?",18Mar2019,1

498,"Hello, so let me give you all a bit of context to this situation. One of my best friends (I’ve known her for almost 8 years now) met this guy almost two years ago when she started having swimming lessons with him ( it’s not really lessons, I just don’t know the name of the sport in English, but that isn’t relevant to the story) and she immediately developed a crush on him.

At first it was cute and she really seemed like she had fallen for this guy. However, she never talked to him. The only time they ever talked was to say “good morning” or “good afternoon” and if their teacher ever asked them to team up for a game.

Then, it started getting a bit weird and she became attached, not in person because she doesn’t have/ never had the guts to properly talk to him, but when it came to talking to us about him, she sounded obsessed. Constantly trying to look at minor things he did like laugh or look at her or sit next to her to say “ I think he likes me” despite the fact that he never even spoke to her, not even once, properly.

So, one of my friends decided to ask one of his friends to ask him what he thought about my friend. In conclusion, he basically hates her, which is weird because they never talked.

This was all almost a year ago, and from the moment when she met him to today she never ever ever stops talking about him and is constantly sad because he doesn’t like her back. We (her best friends) try to CONSTANTLY TELL HER “move on”, “he’s trash”, “you can find someone better”, “he doesn’t like you”, “you’re worth more than a random guy’s opinion”, but she WILL NOT give up on him....

Everyone is so tired of this and whenever we try and open her eyes, she gets mad and all she says is “You should support me because I’m sad if you don’t have anything good to say just shut up”.

Please help, I hate to see my friend hurting because of some stranger and she will not budge no matter how much we insist... it’s been such a long time, it’s so stupid to still be chasing a random stranger that she doesn’t even know... we’re not kids anymore ffs",18Mar2019,1

It's been a week now. I've messaged her maybe 3 times and she's responded each time, but then after a couple of messages back and forth she just ignores my messages.

500,Me and this girl have been together for almost a year. When we first started I wasn’t faithful and she left she later cams back and I saw it as my chance to be better because I really wanted this girl. Throughout the relationship we had issues like all the others and things got bad from time to time but we worked through it and kept going. About two weeks ago we broke up and I didn’t take it almost immediately I heard that she said we weren’t ever getting back together. She later told me that she wanted us to stay close friends talk every day and hangout all the time and I just said okay. Later that week we were talking and something happened and caused her to start talking about how I already wanted her friend how she wouldn’t let me hurt her and how she wasted her time.  I was upset but got over it and we continued to talk later on I posted a few things about her friend and she hit her friend up for every thing I posted of her on my story and made it clear that she was upset but when asked she said she didn’t care. We talked a few night ago and she made it clear she had feelings for me she loved me and wanted me to be happy but she didn’t think we would work out. I asked why and she said because I liked her friend and we broke up before so why try if it wouldn’t last forever I told her I didn’t like her friend and that I only wanted her and we could put this all behind us try again and work on the relationship yet she doesn’t want to. We later talked about hanging out and me coming when nobody was home so we could be alone kiss cuddle and potentially have sex but a day later she said she didn’t know if we could anymore. I’m saying all of this to ask what I should do. I don’t want to lose her and I feel like if I tried we could get back together however I don’t want to stay stuck for someone that doesn’t want me but I don’t know how to do either or what any of this means ,18Mar2019,1

Were the same age and I met him when I was homeschooled.I now go to public school and he's still homeschooled I only see B about once a month but we text alot, in fact over text is where this all happened. 

I had gone to the play at the homeschool group I used to go to as B's brother was staring and It was a good excuse to hang out with B and my other besties. During the play he held my hand for a really long time and it was really nice, really good. A few days later I had my monthly improv class with him and the same friends. Last night while we were texting, I brought up the hand holding thing and he asked me if he liked me and I said yes, because I do like him. I was really happy, we told our inner circle friends this morning. Later today we were talking about what our parents say about dating. He said he's not very close with his parents and doesn't talk about his thoughts or feelings with them very much, which was something he had said to me a few weeks ago when he texted me really late at night and I asked him what was wrong and that was the reason why he wouldn't tell me. I said; About your feelings, I understand that you don't like talking about them, and you dont have to tell me everything, but if something is really bothering you, I always want you to be able to be honest with me."" And then he said that he loved me. I started feeling slightly dizzy and anxious even though I should be happy, I told him I loved him too because I do and I had just asked him for honesty. I took a nap after cause anxiety makes me tired. I had a dream about him that I don't remember. I felt better after, but now I'm starting to feel like I'm going to have a panic attack about this because even though I told him after he said he loved me to go slower, I really want to talk about it in person.

Most of my views arent even that different from most college students, but when people find out that I support figures like Biden, Castro, and Beto they get like weird-ish.

512,"***Notes on me:*** *I am an avid comic reader, I also studied comic making, made a few, albeit self published, approx 400 pages worth.  I also am a regular in the convention scene in the artist alley.*

&amp;#x200B;

***Notes on him:*** *This is his first ever comic book, he has been rewriting this series for a decade.  He is only the writer, and paid an artist/inker/colorist to turn his book into a thing.  It cost him a pretty penny.  He then started a kickstarter where everyone he knew put money towards it and he admitted he would've anonymously added in the extra to not lose out on getting it funded.  He has visited cons as a spectator but never as an vendor.*

&amp;#x200B;

*TLDR at bottom of box*

    So I also kick started the book because hes my friend.  And 15$ not including shipping for a 24 page comic is a lot but, ya know, friends.  Now before I even did this, he was showing me bits and bobs of the comic and I would critique it like one artist to another. This works, but this part is confusing, the colors are off here, so on.  He would make excuses for everything, usually ""you'll understand later""  So that was that.  I helped him promote his book, posted it here, and an interview on my youtube channel.  He would tell people ""if you like mythology, you will like my book!""
    
    Needless to say, I got the book, and besides using names from mythology, there was no real connection.  Some characters had similar powers, but again, that's about it.  Characters that were parent are child in mythos now had no relation, characters with no relation are now twins, and so on.  He began posting online asking for people to critique it on their blogs and channels, but the whole book was a dumpster fire.  There was so many things wrong, that is was glaringly bad.  I felt I may just be bias, I did study comic book creating, so weird layouts, lack of sound effects, use of negative space were things I looked for.  Before writing something up that could hurt sales on my channel I thought I should ask around. So I asked my husband, without giving him my thoughts his opinion.  Hes a casual reader.  I recorded it, and it was 45 minutes of everything that confused him, and questions on choices of things.  So I asked two more people. One a comicbook writer and reviewer, and a fine artist that has read a comic book or two in her day.  Various ages, and genders.  Almost all of it was negative.  But all of it was very valid points.  So I put together a page by page critique pointing out the examples everyone had. ""Who was this character that just turned to bones?"" ""Why is this character here when in the panel before they were there?"" ""What is this pacing? Werent they suppose to be here?"" so on.
    
    So I handed this to my friend, and explained why I didn't feel comfortable reviewing it, and it was a critique, both good and bad. and there was good.  He reads it and goes off on how ""Obviously we didnt read it because it says right there..."" Yeah it did, which is why it confused us when your artist drew him again on the next page. "" ""He says he forgives them because they tried to kill his brother!"" ""But it doesnt show that"" ""Yes it does here!"" ""That panel is so small, and you cant see what is going on, is that what happened?"" ""You and your friends are like the only ones who didn't get that! lol"" 
    And stuff like this ended up in a mild argument to where ""I didn't write this book for your friends! I wrote it for me and those that want to read it"" Well we are your age, we like scifi, we love mythos, if its not meant for people like us...

***TLDR his comic was bad, wouldn't take critique***

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

We left it at that, I told him I didnt really want to talk to him about it anymore.  Although, apparently a lot of people didnt like it, and left bad reviews and eventually, as I suggested, he found himself an editor.  Which I doubt anything will come from it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Jump to now.  So now he is starting to enter the convention scene.  So hes talking to me about it because I've been doing that for 5 years or so.  I'm willing to help if can, but I'm also going to be honest.  And truth is, unless you have a large fanbase, originals dont sell as well as fanarts.  I transitioned to mostly fanart because of it, but I still have originals that dont sell here and there.  Thats fine.  For those that dont know, an average artist table now a days is 300$, and for new artists it can be very very hard to pay back your table.  I make between 2-4k a con selling fanworks in my style, smaller cons I can make as little as 600$.  And original artist (based on my friend who does this selling originals for years) can make between 100 and 1k per show.  Granted the longer you do it, the bigger the fanbase the more that can go up.  And this is print artists not craft artists.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My friend is going on about how he'll be making 1.5k selling his book.  I tried to explain, that probably wont happen at first.  You need to grow your fanbase.  (Not to mention the book is shit but I didnt say that)  He will sell better at smaller cons because there is less competition.  If a person walking sees something they like and a character they recognize they are more likely to spend their budget on that.  If that isn't an option, they may wander to original creators.  He so far has done one tiny library con and made 300$ which is extremely good, but to be expected from a library con.  His next convention is coming up and its HUGE, its one of the largest in the USA, and I can foresee a downfall there.  I dont want him to get his hopes up because he will start complaining and comparing himself to other people that don't equate.  Like he may compare how much I make verses him, even though we sell completely different things and I've been at it longer.  

He also complained about the table cost and is expecting to become an invited guest at these cons because he is ""A creator"".  You and everyone there, but unless you will bring in the people...doubt it.  In which he got upset at me.

&amp;#x200B;

He is went on to basically shit talk some of his artists.  ""Hes only producing 2 pages a week, if I'm to be picked up by a publication, thats not good enough!"" I tried to explain that isn't a bad pace, especially when you have other jobs going on to, you know, survive! He told me how much hes paid and how much more that is than say a DC artist.  I told him how much colorist go, and how many work on one book to get it out there.  Sometimes it is one, bigger places have multiples. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So he is my oldest friend, but since his comic book became the number 1 focus in his life he has changed a bit.  He wont take critiques, he believes now that he's a ""creator"" he is entitled to free things, such as tables. That his comic will be picked up by a publication, and make 1.5k a show. And of course I dont know what I'm talking about. 

&amp;#x200B;

I dont know what to do.  I ask him not to talk about his book with me, because as an artist I want to help him and point out the glaring flaws (like a character may be wearing different clothes from the previous panel, or their tattoos are missing, or things that can be fixed but he wont fix them!) that he wont take a step back to see. To help him succeed.  I'm not a yesman type of person.  I hate those type of people.  He knows I'm not like that. (Yet he still shows me pages and covers and asks my thoughts and then disregards them completely because one yesman gave him a thumbs up on it) And he knows I will say it as I see it.   It always ends in an argument. Lately when he talks to me about things I dont want to help.  When he asks about cons, I dont want to help because I dont want him to treat me like I dont know what I'm talking about.  I've been into comics and making them since before I knew him, he got into them a few years ago.  It's rude, but I can see hes excited for his comic and it wants it to succeed since hes going into debt making it. Hes trying to fast track things, putting the cart a mile before the horse.  He's blinded by excitement.  I get it. I do. But he doesnt realize the strain it puts on people around him.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I can see mistakes he's making, and I can help him fix it.  So he doesnt fail. But I feel like he needs to fail to learn from, but then he comes to me and complains about how he failed and doesnt understand how others didn't but wont listen to advice and then ""inform me"" that I dont know what I'm talking about.  Which will end in an argument, mostly outta frustration.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I want things to go back before his stupid comic.  Or his comic to just be over with so we can be normal friends again.  I just dont know if our relationship can survive if every talk about his comic ends up in a fight.  ",18Mar2019,1

515,"I currently attend the United States Air Force Academy. I am confused on my future, more specifically, whether I want to live my life and leave a mark through the civilian world or through the military world. I recently went through a emotional journey during a three day event called recognition here at the academy. As a part of this, my squadron was told a story about General Ralph Pennell. What I'm about to detail probably has no connection but is my thought process going through all of that.

​

General Ralph Pennell, who replied to a letter written by a U.S. Congressman, Clinton P. Anderson, questioned the assignment of a certain individual to an infantry squadron instead of a position where his “fine education” could be better used. General Pennell stated that "" [he] know of no place red-blooded men of intelligence and initiative are more needed than in the rifle or weapons squad."" and that ""Every commander is anxious to get hold of men with imagination, intelligence, initiative, and drive."" The primary focus of this letter was to show that no man is too great for dirty work. No officer is too high of rank to clean a toilet, no enlisted airman is too high of rank to prepare meals for a squadron. Every family supports the military until their own family is in the military, then they love the military. What I got from this is best summarized as ""Service Before Self"". The sacrifice of one's own success and personal desires to benefit the mission. It passed through my mind as each serviceman that died during Operation Red Wings held that belief strongly. Each and every one of them had the opportunity to choose a life much more delightful, and with the integrity and perseverance that they contained, they almost had guaranteed success if they so chose. But, they didn't. They chose to be apart of a mission that few want to volunteer for and lost their families and lives because of it. That is why I cried. Because men as beautiful and as hardworking as they are were lost. They died and their families would feel the grief for years to follow.

What did I gain from this?

Well, I cried for just about an hour straight and a conversation I had dove into the anger I felt towards some for not giving it their all. I was angry that when I said I wanted to do something harder, I was yelled at by my classmates and told to shut up. To just ""get by and survive"". To most, recognition was a countdown. A timer until life is easy. For me, it was a time to show I deserved to be there even though over the last 7 months I continually complained and contemplated my presence there. For me, this meant that I now had a reason to be there. I did not trust some individuals next to me with my lives and saw the complete disrespect they caused themselves by giving up, by quitting, and not giving it their all. If I was in a situation that occurred in Operation Red Wings, I questioned whether or not I could trust them with my life. Personally, I don't believe everyone should get by recognition, and luckily enough, some didn't. I know that I would want to be by the side of some of these individuals during a time of war and I was explicitly asked this question during recognition of who I trusted most to go into battle with. It makes me extremely sad that I am not able to say that I trust every person in my squadron. But it makes me extremely joyous to know the fact that people like my character officer, squadron commander, and the individuals that have died in operations like operation red wings exist.

However,

I know that I want my job to benefit others. I know that I want to see the effects of my work and the impact it has on others. I know that I don't want anyone by my side to die unless absolutely necessary. With that being said, the most important thing that I just said comes from ""I know that I don't want anyone by my side to die"" and for me, the only way to stop that is to by preventing future conflict with other nations. Over the course of these next few months, I have been contemplating whether or not I can do this best from within the military or outside the military. I will forever maintain respect for the vision of the academy if I ever leave and If I leave it will only be because I think I can save more lives by pursuing community service and policy as a civilian or being apart of the fight. I have no doubt that if I joined the academy right after 9/11 I would be here until my death, but right now it is questionable on how I could best benefit this beautiful nation and honor those that have given their lives in the name of freedom and protecting our loved ones. I don't want anyone to have to lose their lives unless absolutely necessary.

I don't know what path I want to take (civilian or military) but I am eager to head in a path to best do that. Any support or guidance towards this would be greatly appreciated.",18Mar2019,1

521,"I’m at something of a crossroads at the minute. In 6 months, I go back to university as a full time student to do my Masters. 

I was working up until 2 months ago when I was made redundant due to the company going under. 
I’ve been looking for a new job for months anyway because the last one wasn’t great. 

However, searching for a job has a couple of extra challenges for me, as I’m a wheelchair user, so I’ve really only been looking for office work that I know I can do in my chair. Things have been very slow and despite applying for lots of jobs, I’m not getting many interviews. My CV is fine, it’s one page and contains only the most relevant info that an employer needs. 

My issue is this - I’m not feeling very motivated to look for work anymore because I’ll only be in a job for a maximum of 6 months. I have been looking at temp work, but again, I’m not getting interviews and it’s mostly through agencies who never get back to you. 

I won’t tell my parents that I’m not spending as much time looking because they’ll be so angry and disappointed. I just don’t see the point in chasing some job that I’ll only do for 5 minutes only to leave again. 

The job search has been stressing me out a lot because I still live at home and I need to earn some proper money to afford to live. I do get one disability benefit, but it’s only a little bit of money that barely covers my monthly outgoings. 

So, do I keep going with the job search, or do I give up? I have no idea what to do anymore...

522,"My mother and I don't get along very well at all. Growing up, I was always told hy others it was because I was young and I would realize I was wrong when I was older. Now as a grown adult, 22, I am certain it isn't the case. Our personalities clash, and she has her own personal and mental problems she needs to work out. Anytime I've been away from my mother for extended periods of time (usually house sitting for others) not only have I been happier, but we've gotten along much better whenever we'd meet up. 

That being said, my mother is a very toxic individual nonetheless. It's for this reason I'm moving out. Preparations have been made, everything has been accounted for, I'm confident in this decision and it's a better situation for all parties involved, including my mother (my income won't count towards her anymore and she will receive government assistance again). 

I know that the talk won't go well though. Despite her not willing to admit it, I think deep down she knows my girlfriend and I (currently residing with her) do a lot more for her and the house than she realizes. I know my mother will not be happy knowing I'm moving out. She will swear I'm going to regret it, get angry, yell, etc. 

I'm petrified of that conversation to be honest. Her treatment towards me has led to very deep depression, anxiety, and self-adequacy issues that I'm currently working out with a counseler. Despite me knowing full well that this is a good decision, I always let her get to me. I love her to death, and she isn't a bad person, but I know she will get to me again. 

How should I have this talk with her? How can I help prepare myself for how that conversation is likely to go? What should I avoid saying/doing, or what should I say/do?

However, if I find a friend if often attempt to spend as much of time as I can with the person. In the beginning of the school year (a couple/ a month in), a new kid (male) joins the school and we immediately click because of our common interests: Football, Food, and FIFA. We kinda got pretty close and we spend most of our free time in shool together (lunch, snacks, afterschool, spare time in the corridor) together. 

However, today things changed. Every year our school takes us to a thing ""camp"", a place where we spend 5 days doing pretty much nothing and have fun (effectivley camping). The thing is the the school can only take so many people at once, so our grade is divided into 2 groups: 1 and 2 (each giving at a different part of the month). We were intially in the same group and we very excited and planned everything out. However, a new mail was sent today talking about the updated group (people can send mails asking for a change in group) and I see his name in the other group, which startled me a little, as he never brought up changing group and it I can no longer request for a switch.

So I’m in need of some advice (obviously). I teach 8th grade Special Education and this is going to be my last year. On the last day of school every year the 8th grade puts on a talent show (talent is used loosely because we encourage students to do something regardless of “talent”. It’s a good thing I promise). 

Since it’s my last year and all I was thinking of doing something for the talent show as well (yes, teachers are also encouraged to participate). There is a female student who is an EPIC rapper and I was thinking of approaching her about rapping a song while I’m her back up dancer I guess. 

Here is where I would like some advice on a couple levels actually.

1 - an appropriate rap song to perform in front of the entire 8th grade.

2 - a somewhat easy dance routine for said rap song. I catch on pretty quick so I think 2 months of practice should be sufficient to learn and perfect it.

537,"I have been trying to decide on the best course of action, but have been stuck for several days and am now required to make a decision almost immediately.

My rent is $1050, and my other bills bring my monthly expenses (at a bare minimum) to about $2000.

I have the opportunity to work a temporary job for an indefinite amount of time in my county's HR department making about $2200/month before taxes. This job has no promise of being permanent, but the person I was originally filling in for recently updated the county they would be out indefinitely.

The other opportunity is as a District Manager, in a seasonal position, for approximately one month. This is specifically for a one month period, but pays $3600 before taxes. This position is mostly work from home, with occasional travel. The company would undoubtedly have me work during other holiday seasons (Christmas, etc) if I did well enough over Easter.

Both jobs seem great, and I originally had hoped to juggle both jobs, but am required to travel a couple days this week for some training with the DM position, but after that will be primarily working from home on my own set hours.

I have to, by end of today, decide which one I will be letting down and which one I will be choosing. My girlfriend suggested I ask for two days off from the temporary assignment this week, but as a temp I am expecting that to reflect very poorly on me and have a small chance of working. I am confident in asking for this, but am just nervous about receiving a ""no"" and then have to choose on the spot all over again, in addition to making myself look bad.

The county, if it became long term, would be an amazing position, but I dont know if its enough to pay my bills at the current hourly wage. The District Manager role pays enough to cover all my bills this month, but will leave me searching for work at the end of April. On a side note, they have already rented me a car for the entire month - as my transmission just went out on my own vehicle.

538,"Hello! I am a midwestern American that's been living in a coastal city in Spain for the past 5 years. The gastronomy here is hugely fish and shellfish based. They eat loads of meat as well (which I love) but they think their shellfish is just the best.

Every single time I eat at a restaurant with friends, inlaws, etc, I'm pressured and guilted about not wanting to try the exotic seafood/shellfish (normal for them of course, exotic for me)

Let me give you a few examples of normal things they love to eat here:


1. [a whole big ol' crab-thing](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/39/ee/44/39ee44bc029bac5fe339982f0fb0b795.jpg) right on the plate with no seasonings, butter, or anything. Literally just the crab

3. These long [slimy clam things](https://www.pescaderiascorunesas.es/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2017-10/navaja-vapor.jpg?itok=M1fhd3C-) that i've seen squirming around too many times 

4. ...etc. [shrimps with their heads and legs still attached](https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/S9uN6ZdfjuBH2ypITKDkuQ/o.jpg) so you have to pick them off and rip off the head before eating them, mussels, clams, oysters, etc



So, for me, a city girl from the midwest, this stuff all grosses me out a lot. I'm sure it might taste great, but eating any of it would make me feel like I'm on survivor. 

I'm always super polite when I eat out, telling everyone to order whatever appetizers they want and I'll just eat whatever. There's always something on the menu for me, so it's really not a problem at all. 

The problem is that they seem to get personally offended that I don't want to at least try these things.

My boss is not the easiest person to get on with, but I have noticed over the past few weeks she has been singling me out more than others. In the last two weeks I have been yelled at for:
- a honest miscommunication about my holiday allowance, which I took responsibility for and made the time up that same day.
- being 15 minutes late one morning because of a back injury, which I informed my manager about that morning. This is an ongoing injury which my work has been made aware of.
- an offhand question I made to my team leader about if we can split up our break time differently, (my team leader then sent an email to our manager just to double check, and this was forwarded straight to our boss. I was unaware that my team leader had even sent an email, and didn't intend the question to be that serious. My boss then accused me of wasting her time.

She also sent me a formal letter about the meetings we have had, which mentions things that were never brought up in the meetings. And has now threatened me with disaplinary action if I don't ""get my act together.""

547,"I (26m) have a very hard time enjoying socializing with other adults. When I was younger I found shared interests/activities made socializing enjoyable. As an adult I find that most people I meet, including myself, have given up, or drastically reduced the amount of time spent on hobbies simply due to there not being enough time in the day. For instance people who play sports might still do those things once a week but it just isn’t the same as someone who dedicated a lot of their life to playing a sport and being part of an active community within that sport. Like Being a soccer player as a major part of ones identity vs being someone who works a 9 to 5 and occasionally plays pick up soccer. My problem is as an adult I simply don’t care about what other people do for a living and shared interests are cool but if neither myself nor the person I am talking to is really an active member of said interest talking about that isn’t very engaging either. Seems like most people only have enough time for forms of entertainment that are consumed watching sports, performances, tv, etc. which is fine but you can only get so much mileage talking about the latest show.

So our neighbors watch our house whenever we go out if town, feed the animals, etc. I've become friends with the wife, she is great. I've always been wary of the husband as he can be a bit creepy and also he is on the sex offender registry. He's obviously not allowed around my kid because of this. But we watch their house and take care of their animals and they do the same for us. 

The last few times we have been out of town, like over the course of 2years some things have come up missing when we return. I've had my vibrator come up missing, this will be the 4th time it has happened. Also all my lace underwear as well. 

My husband told me last summer when I got confused and weirded out that I just must be misplacing them and I know that not true because they go in the same drawer every time. I let it go. 

This last vacation we took and get home and I notice $300 missing...my husband said maybe you took it out for the vacation. Maybe but I don't remember doing that I don't think so. Then I notice that a new pair of lace underwear is missing and when I went to use my vibrator it was also missing....cue to me freaking out. This is not a coincidence anymore. I checked my whole house. Another stash of money is missing as well, only like $30-$40 in smaller bills. I checked my kid's room but idk if anything is missing. I downloaded an app on my phone to check for hidden cameras because if someone is sick enough to steal my underwear and my vibrators they could be sick enough to put in a camera, found nothing thankfully.

My husband finally agrees that our neighbor must be taking my things. I feel so violated! I haven't confronted them yet because we decided to get some security cameras of our own to try and catch him taking things when we go out of town next. Then we have evidence to take to the police. And I have to act like everything is normal so they don't get scared off or catch on. 

I'm freaking out! I think we have to move now, I can't live next too creeps like that. And we've just remodeled and put so much work into our place and I love the work we've done and don't want to leave. 

My husband doesn't think he'll get in much trouble from the stealing because we gave them a key to our house? But it's still theft, and very personal items. Plus he's a sex offender. I don't know what to do and I'm just so freaked out and so violated. Please help me...

-Some people in legal advice suggest just letting it go and changing my locks. I really want to change my locks because it's kinda scary so I get that. 
But my husband wants concrete evidence to make sure he is watched more and can't do it to anyone else which I also get. He is a sex offender, he should be punished for this creepy behavior.

551," I'm in my second semester of college. I chose Computer Science because I found it interesting and I'm always around computers so I thought it'd be the best fit for me; however, I hate everything that I'm doing. It's not necessarily Computer Science that's the issue, but school in general. I'm just not motivated to do anything. I'm not failing or anything, but I could definitely be doing better than I am. Going into college, my original plan was to get my degree while learning computer animation on my own time (which is what I really want to do). I thought this was manageable. It satisfies my desire to learn computer animation while also satisfying my parents' desire for me to get a degree. Turns out this is not possible. I realize that being in college, especially in the engineering program that I'm enrolled in, requires a lot more time and dedication than I thought. My first semester wasn't bad, but that's only because I took 12 credits and I really only had 1 class to study for. Now, with 16 credits, I'm really annoyed with what all the work and study. I have no desire to do any of the work I'm given because once I've completed one assignment, I get handed another. This wouldn't be an issue if I actually felt that the work I'm doing is meaningful, but it most certainly isn't. At least not for me. I've realized that I fell victim to the ""everyone needs a degree"" type of thinking. Honestly, I don't know what to do. I've talked with my parents and they seem hell bent on me going to school and getting a degree. They recommend that I transfer to a school with a program in computer animation but I just don't know how to feel about that either. I know that a degree for computer animation doesn't mean a lot in that field. It's all about your reel, which is completely understandable. It's a field where you can directly show what you know and what you've accomplished in comparison to other fields where a degree may be more representative. My parents don't understand this at all. Now I'm not saying going to college for computer animation is a bad thing. It comes with the knowledge and the relationships with other students and mentors in the industry and that's very beneficial. It's just that I don't want to transfer and spend more of my parents money/take loans when it's not essential. I'm also afraid of the same thing that I'm currently experiencing happening again even if I do transfer. I've considered switching majors where I'm at currently to something not engineering to maybe lessen the workload and time I have to spend on school, but in the end I don't even want the degree. I'd just use the degree to land a job while I spend my time trying to find a different job for computer animation. Should I test the waters first by switching majors and seeing how it goes or should I transfer to a different school for computer animation? Should I not go to school at all? If I don't come back, I'd probably work part time and work on animation while taking a couple online courses from iAnimate or Animation Mentor here and there.

I was just that girl with brown hair who walked through the hallways with her head down. 

At least at 34 I was someone.  Even marred by failed relationships and single motherhood, I had made a name for myself.  Men noticed me. People respected my work.  My kids thought I was their hero.  No, I can’t go back Mom and Dad.  Im sorry.  Please don’t cry for me.  It wasn’t your fault.

I never liked to have a 100 friends, in my opinion having 2 or 3 loyal and honest friends is the most important but since they kinda left me I don't know what to do, especially since I've been best friends with one of them for about 13 years. I'm lost in my professional life too, as I kid I liked computers and exploring things but as time passed because of math I ran from science in high cool and chose to study a human profile (in our educational system it basically remove math, physics and chemistry from the sophomore year)   . I'm studying Marketing right now, and as much as I like the subject we didn't to anything related to what I like about it in faculty. I have a lot of free time and I just feel like life just passes me. I would like to just quit this year and enroll to something different but I don't even know what I know. I tried to learn programming but I just can't. I don't know what do to, I don't want this year to be for nothing especially that my parents paid for my education.

556,"forgive the bad spelling and everything that goes along with it I'm trying my best and I've spent about 2 hrs on this so far.  
I don't really know how to start this but I guess we should get a few things out of the way  
This is all in the U.S btw

I'm 25 years old  
When I was a kid in the 2nd grade my dad packed us up and moved to minnesota at the end of the school year from kansas city MO (I was also redoing that year cuz my dad pulled me out of school the year before due to some issues he had with the school that I'm still not sure about) so I was a bit older at this point  


When we moved to minnesota we lived with my aunt who my mom did not get along with and ended up getting into a big fight so My mom and I ended up moving to kansas to live with her family so my dad could keep working. where I started school again but in the 3rd grade (i'm not sure why I was not ready I could not read or write, I failed every test and spelling Bee they gave me so they put me in a special ed class where they would have us do things like count down from 10 etc (they would not believe me that I understood and could count down from 100 but oh well)   


I'm not really sure how long we were there for everything seemed to happen so fast, my mom and her sis ended up getting into a fight as well and we were kicked out, with no where to go my dad came and got us and moved us back up to minnesota where my aunt there made them put me back into school and oh boy was I lost they put me in a normal class room that was working on cursive and times tables and all types of things I had no clue about what so ever  


we didn't last there long as around thanksgiving time my aunt would not let us eat the day before thanksgiving cuz ""we're going to eat so much food tmw"" without all the back story she was very rude about food and not letting us eat even tho My dad was buying all the food and paying the bills since he had a good job and we were living there, I guess that was the breaking point for my dad and he made a few calls and had  a job lined up in STL missouri we moved out the day after thanksgiving  


When we got to stl we had no family to stay with so we lived in a extended stay for some times and they just never put me back in school  


I wish I knew the years I think it was around 01-03 I'm not really sure, we lived in STL for around 3 years before where he was working at shut down and... we ended up right back in kansas city MO  


I really only know how to read and spell thanks to runescape and other video games   


My mom and dad were also older when they had me, My mom was 40 years old and my dad was 43 years old so I guess they didn't really think school was a big deal? I'm not sure  


I don't hate them or anything I've become very good at faking for as long as I can, I don't really know math crap there's all kinds of stuff I don't know I try to learn but I just end up stressed out badly   


As I get older everything seems to get worse my anxiety has only got worse and I'm just not able to talk to people irl anymore.. its even gotten to the point where I can't talk to people online, like I might post this I might not but there is a chance I won't check back out of fear? idk how to explain it   


Somehow my stupid ass started my own family... I know I should not have had kids or anything but things just happened I love my wife and my kids and I will make damn sure they stay in school, my 4 year old is in pre-school and seems to be very smart thankfully   


My wife is the only person I've ever told this too, I didn't lie to her or fool her into being with me, we were also together for about 3 years before we had our first kid. I fear I'm going to lose her someday my anxiety has only gotten worse as time goes on,   


They are the only reason I stick away, the world is not really a place for someone like me (not in the states) my old plans were to join the army and hopefully just die but turns out you need a ged to do that odd.  


  


Really the crazy stress and anxiety/depression didn't start until I had my first ""real job"" as machine operator making gaskets HR saw my ""handwriting"" and belittled me for it he also re did a lot of my paper work that day and called me back in to sign off of on :/ I should have left then and there but nope I stayed for 2 years until I couldn't take it anymore, I was a good worker fast and always on time but damn paper work got me a few times a week, I'm left handed so I always used that as a reason, I've spent many countless hours trying to better my handwriting but ugh it never changes, there isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about my time there and just hate myself I wish I could go back and stop myself from taking that job, I was very happy at the job before that but they shut down a year after I left so I guess I was lucky in a way  


I really don't know what to do with myself anymore, I'd get a job at mcd but I just can't bring myself to talk to people anymore When my wife has people over I just hide away not like they would like me anyways I've got 1 friend left he does not know any of this as I'm 110% he'd give me shit also. I don't know where to start where I won't be shamed even more I want to better myself but I'm lost my wife also does not know where to start and when we start talking about this my fear of people gets to me and I freak out :/ ",18Mar2019,2
557,"Context: I am a student who will be starting 11th grade this year. I get decent marks in most subjects but I have a lot of love for science and maths and study it because of how much interesting they are (to me).

My problem: I know some of you might say that I'm not so old yet and still have time to decide what I want to do or what I want to study. Thing is, I can't figure out what I wanna become at all. Scientist? I would love to research but I've read about how boring it gets for them because they have to basically write letters asking for funds and present their work and there's politics in that as well. Engineer? I have zero clue about what kind. Same goes for becoming a scientist. I love all the topics. No partiality to anything in particular. I love computers and coding as well. Biology too (but I already chose a non-medical stream so oh well) I even love reading about history. I just have zero clue what I wanna become. Other people tell me what they will do and it sounds like they have everything figured out. Hence I have a request, can someone with experience tell me what I should do?

558,"The flair is technology because my passion is programming and I hope that one day will be able to work in a company like Huawei or Xiaomi or even work in or create my own startup.

For context: I am still 16 from Eastern Europe and a pretty good programmer with a good CV and I hope that I will be able to work abroad.

I know pretty good English and German but sadly I have no aspiration towards any english or german speaking country, I think that Asia is the future and especially China and I think only China has real and working startup economy in cities like Shenzhen and Shanghai which is greatly helped by the almost complete lack of copyright laws which force companies and developers to share info.

Because of that I have been really passionate about learning Chinese in the last 4 months but I quickly found out that China has a surplus of developers and sometimes working in McDonalds can make you more money + many young people, especially in the social circles in which I am interested in, are forced by their parents to learn english and it's more than possible that they will speak better English than me. These things discouraged me quite a lot and I haven't been making much progress in my Chinese studies.

I am also kind of in love with the mindfulness and politeness of the people in Japan and the beautiful scenery in the country but I know that their and the Korean work ethic is pretty fucked up (working long hours and doing pretty much nothing, working your whole life in a single company waiting for a raise and even committing suicide when getting fired), this makes me really not wanting to work in a Japanese or maybe even Korean company.

What I like about Korean is the non-stop push for innovation because without it the Korean chaebol will simply go bankrupt because they are forced to offer many services of which many are operating at a loss.

I know that no country is perfect but I want to make the best choice for my future self.

559,"I met this girl about a month ago at university, I work at a uni hospital and so does she, and the minute I saw her and the way she was being so nice to one of the patients I just absolutely fell for her. I know it might sound cheesy, but I really did. There was just something about her that I couldn't help but adore.. So I decided to act on my feelings and I talked to her, casually asked if she'd like to get a cup of coffee sometime and that i'd love to get to know her as she seems like a genuinely nice person.. She told me she couldn't go out with a guy on her own as it's not something she's accustomed to (cultural issue in our country), but that we could perhaps catch up at uni sometimes. I took it as a no and thought nothing more of it, but two days later she started texting me on facebook. We carried on talking for a good week or two, almost on a daily basis, most of the time her initiating the conversations. I got really emotionally frustrated at one point and decided to ask her where she thought this was headed, and that if I were to catch feelings for her would I be doing the right thing, to which she replied that it was a bit early to be asking about catching feelings and that she didn't mean to lead me on or anything, she even offered to back off and leave me be if that's what I wanted, but I ended up telling her I didn't mind us just being friends (something I would later come to regret). Since that time, we've carried on talking to each other, we text pretty much every day over facebook, sometimes having conversations that last all day (morning-night), and we've gotten to know each other quite well, we seem to have a LOT in common and our chemistry is quite interesting, but throughout all of this i've been trying as hard as I can not to think anything of it and not to get my hopes up in case she's just being a friend and no feelings are actually involved. Over the past few weeks she's been subtly hinting about things, like her once mentioning that if she asked her mum and dad if she could go out with a guy she thinks they might be okay with it (which I thought was unusual to mention), and she's starting to tease me a lot when we have convos, she seems to find it fun and keeps mentioning how she 'loves teasing me' and that 'its the joy of my life', lol. So we recently started a course where we go on bus rides together, and she'd told me how she wanted me to sit next to her on the bus to 'entertain her' as the rides can be quite boring.. yesterday i couldn't sit next to her and when we texted on the night time she seemed a bit annoyed that I didnt, so today I decided to sit next to her and we talked all throughout the 1 hour journey, when I told her I wouldn't be coming tomorrow she seemed annoyed again... I can't stop thinking about this girl lately cuz i'm really starting to fall for her and I really don't have the slightest clue as to whether she likes me back! I don't want to ask her again because i've already put myself in that awkward situation twice and got rejected both times, but I don't know what to do anymore :( 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone here got any advice on how I can move past this and stop thinking about her nonstop all day long?

561,"A little background on me, I'm an 18 year old female going into my last quarter year of high school.  I have gotten into colleges but have not yet decided on one.  I've spent my entire high school career sitting around.  I make lists about what I could do better: how I could be prettier, be a better person, and become more well rounded in my hobbies.  I basically create a ideal fantasy version of myself.  I then tell myself that tomorrow I will become this ultimate version of myself.

I don't ever change.  I live by fantasizing about tomorrow.  But the thing is, I can't live in the moment at all.  I have become cowardly, unwilling to go outside of my comfort bubble because I'm scared I'll mess up and won't be this ""perfect version of myself"".

I do have rather severe perfectionism OCD which I try to manage with medication and therapy and this definitely plays a role in it.  However I believe that this specific ""waiting for the future"" syndrome affects a lot of people, more than just me, or other people with issues like mine.

I desperately want to take a gap year, travel the world and study other cultures.  But I feel like, unless I shake my habit of waiting for tomorrow, I'll never be brave enough to take that leap into the unknown.

562,"Hello so I got to college and thankfully there isn’t a harsh punishment for not being in class. Since you paid them already so they could care less. I am a youtuber. I have about 33k subs and I post gaming content. I’m specific it’s news content. If a game I cover has a huge new update I cover it and let the community know. I believe I have been very successful with this. 

But that’s where the problem is, see sometimes the information for these events or season etc will release during a class. For example a couple months ago one update came out 12:30pm and I have class at that time, and since I enjoy youtube more than school I skipped that class went home and made the video. But it’s gotten into a habit where I keep doing it when ever something big comes out. The main reason this happens is because if you don’t post the video about that content soon others will beat you to it and take your views which means less growth. 

I’m just stuck cause I don’t wanna fail and currently my grades are pretty good but when you miss class you miss notes and that in person talk with the teacher, then you aren’t prepared for a test quiz etc.

564,"  

Hello, I’ve been sitting here thinking about this for months and at this point I’m open to any advice that anyone is willing to offer. I’m in a small group \~10 people at school and were going to be in college together for the next three years. A large amount of this group came from the same area and all knew each other I liked this girl in the small group and told two of my best friends at the time, lets call them B and C. I’ve never had any luck with girls, and have been rejected quite a bit, and vented my frustrations to my two best friends. Both knew that I was depressed and had anxiety so I thought that they were helping me push forward. They pushed me to ask her out for a month, and were very adamant about me doing so I begged them not to tell her, even though the both wanted to as I knew that it would end bad and awkward for me. I was very nervous and could never bring myself to do it as I did not want to make it awkward in the group as it was very small, and I did not want to lose any of the friends that I had in the group by pushing myself away if she said no as I was awkward. The two friends kept pushing me and pushing me to ask her out. About a week after they found out, I asked my friend B if he had a thing or was going to with the girl, as they were spending a large amount of time together, and he said no. I was a little bit skeptical and I believed him at the time. I asked a few more times and he said no every time, even though I insisted. A few weeks later, B starts to say that he has something to tell me, but wont come out with it. Eventually I pester B enough to tell me and B brings me into a separate room and tells me that he had a thing with the girl the entire time that I liked her, and he didn’t want to hurt my feelings by telling me. He also told me that he almost broke it off with her, but instead told her that I liked her and kept going with her, which I was the most afraid of. This was the biggest blow that I have ever been dealt and I felt like such an idiot for everything that happened in this situation. I cut off ties with B, but because we are in the same group he keeps wanting to “clear up the tension” with me and I cannot bring myself to do that. Some people in the group are understanding, and some people in the group are surprised that I haven’t forgiven him yet and forgot about the whole thing. I have been brooding on this since September, and I do not know what to do. He reached out to me a few days ago and said that he wants to clear up the tension. I am not in a good place right now however, and feel like any talking that I do with him will end up hurting me more. What should I do?",18Mar2019,1

567,"So I've been living with a good mate for a few months now, it's my first time moving out of the folks' home. We share rent and bills equally. 
I work 30+ hours a week and they are unemployed. 
It's enjoyable, as we're both good friends but it is also incredibly frustrating for reasons I will explain below. I'll refer to Roommate as R for ease of typing. 
First off, I don't really ""party"" but R does, regularly. They will have people over and drink, drug and be generally loud and messy which I don't have a problem with, but it often keeps me up when I have work the next morning (Just the other night I was up until 5am despite me asking them to keep it down multiple times) and R does not clean up after their guests. 
This is an ongoing issue, as R doesn't really clean up after themselves a lot. They don't do dishes, they don't clean up, they don't even bother to change the toilet paper if they use the last of the roll. 
R also doesn't contribute to the house in other ways. They use all of my stuff, like toiletries, treats I have saved for myself, and laundry stuff. R and their guests have even helped themselves to my alcohol before. I'd probably let them if they asked beforehand, but they don't 

I'm just wondering - am I just being pedantic? Or are they acting in an inappropriate way. 
I have yet to confront R about this. I'm afraid of confrontation and I don't want to risk damaging our friendship, but that doesn't seem like something that R is concerned about 
I'd also like advice  on how to go about talking to them.  ",18Mar2019,1

Yesterday I got in a fight with my best friend, she said I was getting so far away from my friends because of selfish/workaholic behavior.

I've been talking to this girl online for a while now and we've hit it off pretty good. Her and I are both 14 and share a lot in common. Now here is the problem: A while back she asked me to send her a picture of what I looked like. This is a trap for me because I am very self conscious of my face and can't stand to look at it. My face has lots of acne, and it doesn't ever seem to go away with treatment. I also have a big nose, squinty eyes and bushy eyebrows. My skin is also super dry and it's not smooth or glamorous at all. I absolutely hate hate my appearance. The only things that are even remotely good about my appearance is I have a diamond shaped face like Korean girls and guys have, I'm tall for my age, my hair is a nice color (jet black but it gets greasy super easily) and I'm a little muscular even though I play no sports and don't work out.

So what should I do? I have no clue, I'm young, and this is my first time I've been this close to a girl. Should I just use my friend's selfie? He is a chick magnet and an absolute alpha.

571,"I'm not sure where to start here. 

My friend, we'll call her Alex, and I are 20. Throughout high school, she was slightly overweight but I always thought she had a nice body. Her mom, while an amazing and extremely kind woman, has always criticized her weight. Alex values her mom's opinion more than anything and respects her so much. 

Over the past year or so, Alex decided to start working out and eating better in order to lose some weight. She kicked it off with an intense cross fit and diet regimen. It worked really well for her and she kept up those good habits after the program was done. She lost about 30 pounds and now she looks slim and great!

But it's not enough for her. Her mom now thinks she is too thin, but she still wants to lose 10 more pounds, which would put her at 120. We're the same height, 5'2"", and I weigh 120. The difference is we have very different bone structures. She has larger bones and they are probably more dense than mine. IMO she is at her ideal weight right now, and losing more weight would be unhealthy for her body type. I keep telling her that the number doesn't matter, and she looks great how she is now.

I don't know if she is comparing herself to me, but her motivation doesn't seem to be based on her mom's criticisms anymore. She has been hospitalized for depression in the past. We see each other a lot less now that I live an hour away, but when I do she sometimes has cuts on her arms (although I see them a lot less since the weight loss). She has been in therapy too but she never seems to be satisfied with her body. I am very worried about her but I don't know what I can do to help her.",18Mar2019,0

574,"I have been trying to decide on the best course of action, but have been stuck for several days and am now required to make a decision almost immediately.

My rent is $1050, and my other bills bring my monthly expenses (at a bare minimum) to about $2000.

I have the opportunity to work a temporary job for an indefinite amount of time in my county's HR department making about $2200/month before taxes. This job has no promise of being permanent, but the person I was originally filling in for recently updated the county they would be out indefinitely.

The other opportunity is as a District Manager, in a seasonal position, for approximately one month. This is specifically for a one month period, but pays $3600 before taxes. This position is mostly work from home, with occasional travel. The company would undoubtedly have me work during other holiday seasons (Christmas, etc) if I did well enough over Easter.

Both jobs seem great, and I originally had hoped to juggle both jobs, but am required to travel a couple days this week for some training with the DM position, but after that will be primarily working from home on my own set hours.

I have to, by end of today, decide which one I will be letting down and which one I will be choosing. My girlfriend suggested I ask for two days off from the temporary assignment this week, but as a temp I am expecting that to reflect very poorly on me and have a small chance of working. I am confident in asking for this, but am just nervous about receiving a ""no"" and then have to choose on the spot all over again, in addition to making myself look bad.

The county, if it became long term, would be an amazing position, but I dont know if its enough to pay my bills at the current hourly wage. The District Manager role pays enough to cover all my bills this month, but will leave me searching for work at the end of April. On a side note, they have already rented me a car for the entire month - as my transmission just went out on my own vehicle.

575,"Okay, lemme just start off by saying that by ""k-drama"" I mean this dude is like the guys in Korean dramas. He's romantic, cutesy, dramatic, and not actually someone you'd want irl. I met him on a dating app and I thought the conversation was kind stagnant. His responses were bland and whenever our opinions were different he'd change his so it line up with mine. One day I decided I was interested anymore and I removed him from Snapchat after it was quiet for a day.

It happens a lot on dating apps and it had only been like a day. Then suddenly he's sending me friend requests from other accounts trying to talk to me. I ignor it. THEN HE FINDS ME ON INSTAGRAM. My user doesn't have anything to do with my actual name and we don't have any mutual friends. He started by messaging me from an account that didn't have his name or face so I responded to his dm that said ""hey, I don't know if you remember me.... But I remember you."" 

Since the account was just some Pepe the from memes I thought it was a joke or possibly a childhood friend. Then he says who he is and I block him. After that he comes to me from his actual account sending me this crazy stuff about how he doesn't want conflict and he just wants to talk. I finally sent him a long string of messages explaining the situation and that I was feeling at this a little creeped out. I apologized for ghosting him but I also told him that it wasn't really appropriate for him to message me so many times everywhere when I clearly wasn't interested.

He said something heartfelt and he warmed up a lot. I started talking to him again last night (which I deeply regret now). He's this kinda goofy, dramatic, romantic guy but I'm starting to get weird vibes. He liked all 150 posts on my Instagram and some of those of over 4 years old. On top of that hell bring up stuff that was even like a conversation I had with a friend in the comments of a photo I posted years ago. He's very clingy and also almost seems like he doesn't do anything. He's always online, he answers in 3 seconds, and he expects me to answer just as fast. I really want to leave him and block him but now I know he's got the caliber to make accounts and profiles just to stalk me and I'm very uncomfortable. How can I delicately tell him that I'm not interested in continuing the conversation?

Sorry for the long post. I know this whole thing sounds very millennial but I'm just looking for advice, thanks.",18Mar2019,1

578,"I'm a high school student interested in doing pure math in undergrad, and eventually plan on going to grad school for the same.

I have recently found out that my parents are not willing to pay more than $30,000/year unless I go into one of the more ""employable"" fields. I have offers from two universities, one is McMaster and the other is Princeton. Though Princeton meets full financial need, I would probably not be able to go without taking massive loans as my family's expected contribution came out to be equal to the cost of attendance($65000) i.e. no financial aid. McMaster is much cheaper though, $32000. I'm sure I can convince them to shell out an extra $2000.

Do grad schools place a lot of emphasis on which school someone did their undergrad from?

580,"Since leaving high school (where I had various close friendships and was in good terms with all of my class) I have found it very difficult to interact with people and to create bonds. 

I'm an introvert, and I'm not at all good at small talk: I manage to have good conversations and open up only with people I'm close to. But it's difficult to make friends and ""get close"" when you don't have the initial social skills. I usually make friends with people who for some reason like me and decide to always talk to me, eventually making me confident enough to open up.

Now, being at my 5th and last year of uni, it is even more difficult to interact because the people around me aren't ""new"" anymore. Everyone kind of recognises each other, but only says hello/talks with people they already consider friends. (Also, it is a competitive environment, where people tend to be shitty and two-faced)

So I feel stuck.

I have a few close friends in uni, but we have different courses and rarely meet. (Btw, my degree is quite hard and time consuming, so we don't have a lot of free time).

I have a boyfriend which is the best person I could ever want beside me. He also isn't very social, so he doesn't really have an established friend group. But the difference between us is that he *has* all of the social skills and *chooses* to not be very social, while I would like and feel the need for friendship but I feel very socially awkward.

How can I make new *good* friendships, when I don't have much free time, while preparing my thesis and in this weird uni environment?",18Mar2019,1
581,"I've started feeling lately that the masses do not care or have empathy for other people, and this is regardless of politics too, left right etc, it feels like a high majority of people don't give a shit when something awful happens, when fights break out in schools, people don't jump in to try and stop, they hurdle around and watch, same thing when a shooting happens, it feels people don't care for the individuals that got shot really, they feel for their country, which I get, but if those same individuals got shot on seperate different days in different circumstances would anyone other than their family care? I feel only a small minority of people actually understand how other people can feel, I can empathize with other people about things that don't effect me, I wished the masses would start doing the same.

Am I wrong in this idea? Sometimes you see hate come from people who claim to be the least hateful, just so many different groups and factions that see each other so seperate from one another, that they enjoy seeing another person in pain, simply because they don't know, don't show, or don't care.

583,"I live in a three bedroom apartment with 2 people I met through a roommate finder company. I’ve done this for every apartment I’ve lived in and never had a problem.  I’ve lived with this group of roommates for about 4 months now, I was in the same apartment for a year before these two took over for my roommates that moved cross country. 

Yesterday I heard from one roommate (RA) that our other roommate (RB) had just told her (not asked her) that her cousin will be staying for a month starting tomorrow, but she’ll split the utilities with us (basically amounting to $20 a month).  RA and I decided that this was not acceptable. Neither of us have a full copy of the lease with terms and conditions on it (which is obviously another problem). But we both agree that a guest shouldn’t be staying longer than a week.

We tried to set up a time with RB to talk about this, but she says she’ll be gone until 3am everyday this week because “she has midterms.”  It was also at this point that she said her cousin would actually be here for 3-4 months. So RA and I basically just said we aren’t okay with this at all, RB said “thank you for expressing your concerns” and hasn’t said anything since.

Im working on getting a copy of the lease to see what it says about this type of guest situation. But essentially I’m looking for advice about how to approach this with my roommate. None of us are close, it’s more of a “hi, how are you, bye” type relationship. The cousin not paying isn’t the issue for me personally (it is for RA), I just straight out don’t want a fourth person in our apartment that long (we’re already sharing one bathroom between 3 people and I like just a chill place to crash when I get off work). 

Would love to get some advice on what I should do next, whether it be what I should say to the roommate or if i should get the landlord involved or if you think there’s nothing I can do and you got advice for how I can cope haha.

Growing up wasn't that great, especially my teenage years. They made a lot of mistakes during that time, e.g. they did not care that I had no friends and that I spend most of the day alone in my room, they never asked if I was alright, they are both very active people but they never encouraged me to pursue a hobby myself, it was the opposite, I wasn't allowed to do the things (Martial Arts, working out, Music Festivals, Motorcycle riding and the list goes on and on)  I wanted to do, they repeatedly asked me in front of other family members if I was gay because I never had a girlfriend. I guess that's the reason why I put a emotional wall around me, I was hiding every emotion and every feeling I had. I started to hate myself, I hated the way I looked, the way I talked, the way I spend my time.  When I had feelings I couldn't hide, I abused alcohol to the point where I was blackout drunk. I woke up in a hospital with alcohol poisoning 3 times and passed out numerous times from drinking.   
When I was finally 18, I started to workout. I finally had a hobby where I could use all my anger. But socially I was still really awkward, I never learned how to deal with people. It took me months to talk with somebody at the gym, but I actually made some friends.  

About 2 years ago I met a beautiful girl. She was very interested in me and wanted to be in a relationship with me, but I was nowhere near the point where I was able to be in a relationship with someone. Over the next year, we became very close friends. She helped me a lot, and she is the first person I met that I really trust. She found a way around my emotional wall, at one point I just started to cry in front of her. It was the first time I cried in years. I learned to be vulnerable, that it is ok to show emotions and that I should express my feelings. She encouraged me to talk about all my issues, a lot of repressed memories came up.

I think my sister feels guilty about the past, because additional to just being incredibly nice and giving, she always loves to pay for my food and buy me gifts. I try to pay her back, but she won't accept it. The only way I'm able to pay her back is by surprising her.

I want to go to a college, but its an hour long drive away from the city I live in, so I need a car. My sis and I have always been bitter about cars and driving, because our mom never taught us, but this summer we were going to each save up to get our respective cars and learn how to drive. 

This morning, my mom tells me that she's going to buy me a car (used, but whatever, ITS A CAR!!), and although I'm very excited, I asked if she could split whatever she was going to spend on mine, and put half towards a car for my sis too. She got a little annoyed and simply said my sisters time is 'coming'. But, I can't stop feeling guilty about it. My mom already paid for my braces, but didn't pay for my sisters (which is strange because she is closer to my mom, than I am).

Any advice? Please? I know I should probably talk to my sis about it, but we're super close (she's my only true best friend) and I am terrified of anything that would damage our relationship.

609,"Hi r/Advice

I'm currently in training in my workplace, which has lasted over a year - normal for my area. In a final push to complete my training I was given additional tasks to complete within a period of time. Some of these tasks involve interacting with one of my mentors and I'm starting to feel the brunt of the feedback I'm receiving.

I'm always happy to have constructive criticism and throughout this training process have never had issues like this. I handed in all of my work for this mentor in January. In the last couple of weeks I've had direct feedback that varies wildly on each interaction. One of the first few times it was quite formal having sat down and had a discussion. This has since devolved into random ""pop ups"" where they will bring me my work and question me - ""why did you do this?"", ""why do you think that?"", ""do you think this is right?"", and generally being blunt and felt more like I was being put on the spot to justify what I put rather than receive feedback - please note this is more than a month since I looked at/wrote this work so it wasn't fresh in my mind. To me it feels very personal and less constructive. I've seen how this person interacts with others and I feel like they're being much more critical of me - so much to the point that having completed a 12 hour night shift today I was preparing to leave (albeit 4 minutes early) and I was immediately interrogated by them despite everyone else from the night shift having already left after handover period. I generally feel unhappy in my treatment and this is compounded by the additional work I was given in my ""final push"" - but I feel more like I'm breaking. The last 2 weeks I've been having a couple of hours sleep a night and have been tossing and turning with anxiety through the night. I've been to a GP to ask for something to help get me through this period, but they refused.

I feel trapped. I'm stuck in a bad situation and unsure what I can do, if anything. When I previously raised that the feedback from this person wasn't ideal one of my managers immediately threw this back to me stating that it could be my problem, e.g. not taking notes or not asking enough questions about my tasks being set, which is fair enough, but I've never had these issues until now. This situation isn't healthy for me and the stress and worry makes me feel sick daily. I'm always fatigued and no one seems to listen (including my GP stating that feeling tired after work is normal, but I don't think he appreciated how crippling this anxiety feels to me). I was thinking about raising this with my direct line manager, but I'm afraid because I'm still in training and feel like a grunt that's disposable.

615,"So basically, yesterday was a huge day for our store... it was insanely busy, and a perfect time to hit some quotas for us. However, we were struggling a lot to hit the quota of our memberships.

To break it down, my store has two different types of memberships; a lower price, and a higher price (the higher price allows for additional savings, free shipping, money to be earned back by the member, and so forth). If our quota for selling the more expensive memberships isn't hit, we get talked to about our tactics, and we have to sell EVEN MORE. Plus, we don't get a bonus or anything like that at the end of the year. 

So yesterday, we were doing awful for these types of memberships. So my manager, in the last hour of the store being open, tells a couple of the cashiers, and a supervisor, to offer it to the members for FREE. That's right... free. These memberships cost upwards of $100 a year. And he is giving it to them for free.

So I questioned him on it. I asked him ""why are you giving them away? And how are you going to make up for the money lost for them?"" 

And he responded with:

""Well we need to hit our quota, and I'll just write them through the system. I'll do a CFT so they won't show up in the money system for the store."" 

So basically, he is hiding that he is giving these away to members from the boss. These $100 memberships that he is just GIVING AWAY. Besides that, he has been known to pull other shady things (treating customers like shit, reselling used product so that they can add additional warranties and promotions onto the product, giving promotions to his friends and coding them for other areas of the store so that they get more money/hours, stuff like that). 

I just feel like he is being super shady and greedy, because he knows that if the quota isn't hit... he gets a talking to.

tl;dr: Manger is hiding the fact that he is giving away a bunch of memberships for free just so he can hit his quota, and so he won't get talked to by his boss. He has done other weird stuff as well, but this one really got to me. ",18Mar2019,3
616,"About me: 33y/o Male, steady job, house, wife, and a beautiful little girl. I’ve always been and considered myself a happy person, and I haven’t had trouble taking time to enjoy doing things for myself in the past. I could always find joy in my hobbies like woodworking, gardening, or being generally creative. 

Recently, my wife has felt like she needs to take some time apart for herself,  and needs to figure out if she wants to still be married or be on her own. not due to any big issue with our relationship, but something she feels that she needs to do for herself to be happy. I hear her feelings, and while I don’t like that route, I want to do whatever is necessary for her to be happy. 

I won’t get into a ton of detail about that since that is not what I’m asking for advice about. 

My issue is that, while I want to support her bad for her to be happy, the uncertainty is causing a huge amount of anxiety and some depression that I’m not sure how to deal with. I know that some of the best ways to cope is to do things for yourself to distract and to ‘remember’ happiness. My trouble is that, whenever I try to do anything that I would have looked forward/jumped at the chance to do, I can’t seem to do it. I will forced myself to start one of those activities, and end up drifting to a halt, just standing there staring around at the things/activities that once gave me so much joy. 

I need to figure out how to find happiness doing things for myself again. Partially because it could help my marriage succeed (wallowing/being down all the time isn’t a very attractive thing), but more importantly, I need to do it for me so that I’m ok in general. If my marriage doesn’t work out, I need to be able to be ok. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Did you find a strategy to find enjoyment in the things you did before all the chaos/negative emotions invaded?

a few hours ago my uncle’s friend spotted my nonna walking in her neighbourhood (A), he asked her if she wanted a lift and he took her to the station in A so she could get the train to my neighbourhood (B)

since then we haven’t heard from her, she’s not at home and doesn’t have a mobile phone. i’m worried because it’s already dark and getting colder. she has dementia and could be confused

my mum has checked her old church, house, and the train station in B. she’s going to ask the station if they can check the CCTV footage

places she’s likely to go into like charity shops are closed so i can’t call and check if she was there 

this has happened once before and she ended up walking for three hours until she found a train station

am i overreacting? is there anything i can do?",18Mar2019,3
618,"Over the past few weeks I have been seeing a young woman who was raised Muslim, and I am a non-religious male who was raised Catholic. We are both in our early 20s and she is a first-generation immigrant to the United States, so her family is pretty conservative when it comes to religion.

We get along really well, and it has been a blast getting to know her. However, she told me her parents can't know about me, and any sort of pre-marital dating, especially interfaith, is frowned upon. She said it is not permissible for a Muslim woman to marry a non-Muslim man. She said Muslim men can marry non-Muslim women, because the children are assumed to take the faith of the father. This was all news to me.

I really like her, and it seems like she really likes me. I want to continue seeing her, but I am worried we won't have a future because her family won't accept me. There's no way I could ask her to go against her family. If it ends up being a short-term thing, I will ultimately be grateful for the experience, but I will be sad for it ending due to reasons out of our control.

I really want to help my mom become healthier and it means a lot to me. I'll take any advice y'all can give.☺️

The next four paragraphs are background info so you can get a good idea of what I'm asking for: 

My mom is 50 years old and has been smoking for at least 10 years as far as I know. I haven't asked (mostly because I'm afraid of the answer), but I assume she's been smoking for much longer than that.

Her lungs are pretty bad. She doesn't have cancer or anything, but she is diabetic and out of shape. She often goes into coughing fits. Some days she doesn't have them, but on average she has about 2-3 of these coughing fits a day.

I myself used to do cigarettes. I did them for about a year before I switched to a juul. I've been doing that for about a year now. 

My mother and I have tried to quit before, but my family is prone to addiction and neither of us succeeded. We're not ready to quit in full, so instead we're just trying to cut back and be more healthy about our nicotine intake.

Now here's what I was hoping y'all could give me advice on:

I've tried getting my mother to switch to a juul instead of doing cigarettes, but whenever she does the juul she has a coughing fit. Her lungs can't take a juuls vapor. Do you guys have any ideas for alternatives she can switch to? Patches and gum are too expensive and she can never keep track of them. 

Are there any other alternatives or specific vapes or something that would be easy to switch to for someone with bad lungs? 

Thanks for reading this all 🙂

622,"Ok I really don’t even know how to explain this. And this is a throwaway because my husband knows my regular reddit. But I’m going to try. 

How my husband and I met: I moved across the country from Indiana to Washington a little over 10 years ago. I was 18 at the time and grew up in a bad home so wanted to get as far away as possible. I needed a job, a small local mom and pop deli/restaurant hired me on the spot so I took it, making minimum wage. This guy (my now husband) would come in a few times a week. It was obvious we both really liked each other and we would often eat lunch together but remained friends. It turned out he was 10 years older than me though so when he asked me out I declined and said I was to young, told him I was 18 and he agreed we would just remain friends. A few years go by. I had another relationship, we broke up, go back to the same deli I used to work at and who do I run into? He asks me out, I said yes. And the rest is history. 

Why we have some weird soulmate connection: Him and i always said that we both felt familiar with each other even though we had never met. We’ve always had some strange connection like we have known each other before. My husbands mom passed away in 2006 from cancer. The night before I ran into him again I had a dream about a woman who walked up to me in the middle of my dream and asked me why I wasn’t with her son.  I said I don’t even know who you are or who your son is. She then pointed to a man across the room (my now husband). I woke up thinking it was really strange how vivid it was and how I hadn’t seen him in a long time. Then that day, sure enough I run into him and he asks me out. Since then we have been through so much hardship and deaths/loses etc etc. we are VERY CLOSE and have great communication. 

Why I’m questioning our marriage: We now are married and have a son. My husbands family is full of many alcoholics, dysfunction and laziness. When we first met, he was living with his alcoholic brother and had been for years. My husband was working and his brother would take jobs here and there but mostly just sat and home and drank. Life happened, my husband and I moved out on our own into our place. He was constantly worried about his brother dying at his home from something alcohol/pill related but my opinion was that if his brother wouldn’t accept help, then there was nothing he can do to prevent that. Anyways, over the years we have had LOTS of issues with his family. Him and his dad have a business together that his older brother also is apart of. But they have zero ambition to do better and just do the bare minimum. His dad has screwed him over in more than one way but he continues to work with him. 

So after all of these years, him and i are ready to do bigger and better things. We want to buy a house, move out of state, have more kids etc etc. but in order to do that there are A LOT of steps we have to take. For example, my husband HAS to stop working with his dad and brother and start his own company doing the same thing/get a new job somewhere else. At this point, he doesn’t have consistent income because of how did dad runs his business. He will drink (beer) with them after work because his dad and brother both rely on alcohol so he gives in. 

I’ve talked to him so many times about how he needs to separate work from his family. They hold him back. If he had his own business, which is VERY possible and doable, we wouldn’t be stuck in the position we are. He so wants his dad and brother to want to do bigger and better things the same way he does but they don’t want too. However, my husband can’t get over that no one in his family is ever going to have a bright future. They all just do the bare minimum and have his whole life. So even though my husband wants to do better it’s like he’s stuck and doesn’t know how. He works with lazy asses all day everyday. They drink on the job (my husband does no). They leave early, get to work late. My husband says if he separates from his family then it’s going to ruin his relationship with them and he doesn’t want that to happen. For years, he’s been trying to convince his dad to do this for the business or that for the business. 

So here we are. 7 years together, 3 married. We live in a shitty rental with our son. My husband and I have a really great relationship. We communicate well, we get along, we have fun, we really do love each other. We have talked about this a lot but it’s like he just won’t take the step to separate work life from his family so we can move the hell on with our own life. He is not an alcoholic but definitely drinks more than the average person because of how his family treats alcohol. I feel like if something doesn’t change soon we are going to be stuck where we are at for a long time 

So What do I do? I’ve talked to him so many times about this. Nagged, argued. But we are still in the same position. He says yes this will change or that will change. We will do this on this day or that day. And then that day comes and he says well in a few weeks etc etc. it’s driving me crazy. My husband is so sweet, kind, humble, and a great dad.  But I feel like my whole life is going to always be doing the bear minimum and that’s not ok with me. His families motto is basically just live day by day and that’s good enough. However, I’m not like that at all and don’t think that’s right. Is that wrong of me? I want better for our son. I don’t want to leave though but what if nothing changes in 10 years. ",18Mar2019,7

  This is going to require background, obviously. I’m a high school Sophomore girl, and I have a problem. Firstly, it’s not actually MY problem anymore, but since everyone knows I have beef with the guy, I get almost all of the complaints about him.
  He keeps going on and on about how “respectful” he is and how joining ROTC (basically high school military) Turned  his ass around for the better. And sure, I haven’t gotten complaints of him touching anyone like he did to 17 girls (me included) at my middle school when I was in 8th grade after being expelled from his first middle school for touching around 12.
Why the schools didn’t and continue to not do shit disgusts me. Not as much as he does. 
  This kid is a narcissist, a total brag, and an utter pervert. He tried to insist that I call him “Fiery Dragon” but since that nickname fucking sucks ass, he settled with “soldier.” Disgusting cunt. He brags all day and night, he has no chill. He just wants to talk about himself, himself himself. Walks around all swaggerly when he’s in uniform to make his medals and things jingle ass much as possible. Half of them he doesn’t need to fuckin wear. Need I mention that this handsy mother fucker is supposedly Catholic?

636,"Hi all,

Would appreciate some advice. I'm in a Phd program in the humanities in a very competitive field, getting my masters this May. Between my undergrad and grad school I took a year off and worked as a paralegal. 

I originally applied to law school because I definitely wanted to leave grad school and because I enjoyed working as a paralegal but I'm less certain now. I've actually really started enjoying my Phd program and my research.

I've already been accepted to a nearby law school (no funding as far as I can tell). But I can't decide whether I should continue in my grad school or go to law school. I definitely will have more career possibilities if I go to law school since the humanities never has good job prospects, but I don't want to exclusively go to law school for the money and job prospects.

I can see myself being either an attorney of some sort or as working as a professor with my job in the humanities. 

One influencing factor is that my partner is also in the same program in the humanities getting a Phd, so if I'm looking for a job in the humanities with my partner it would be difficult (or we'd have to do long distance).

I'm just feeling really uncertain about what I actually want and what I should actually do, so any advice would be appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry this post might be messy since I have school tomorrow and that I want to get it out in time since I'm honestly sick of this and am seeking help out here on Reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a small, 4""11 girl who's 13- to be 14 in April - (I'm over the legal age to be on Reddit no worries). While on the other hand, both these boys are 5"" - about 5""3 (they're also 12-13, sorry idk when their birthday is.) We hang around in a group of about 8-10 at break-times, and hang out with whoever is in our lesson in the friendship group. I have also told one of my other friends who's around 5"" too, and he did stick up for me, but they still do it- usually when this guy is not around.

&amp;#x200B;

I am really low in self-esteem, while I also have anxiety and don't deal well in these type of situations, which makes me nervous that they won't be my friends after this.

&amp;#x200B;

I really enjoy their company, they're really fun and I enjoy talking about memes with them- since they're like meme-lords at our school. They're of my closest friends and are even in my form, I even sit next to them.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the boys - the 5"" one, is in mostly all my classes, apart from just maths and p.e, and I sit around him in most lessons. And the other one is in none of my lessons, but hangs around with us at break-time.

&amp;#x200B;

I have told my parents about this situation, and they have informed the school. They were spoken too, yet even after this they continue to hit me, but just a little less-  which is no difference.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel as if this is my fault, I don't know what I've done, when I did it or why they're doing this?

&amp;#x200B;

I really, really want to namedrop this college, they don't deserve the courtesy of not doing so. Doing so may fall under breaking rules, though.

&amp;#x200B;

I know, my bad for not reading the reviews of the college and being super gullible, but I found out that they have shady recruitment and business practices as well as casual plagiarism, not to mention randomly dropping students from the program for no discernible reason. This scared me, rightfully so. I sent an email to the FPA and my SSA about wanting to drop out and they keep saying they'll get me in touch with people so I can complete the process and how to give my tablet back they loaned me for the program, but uh.

  
Long story short they've been just saying words and not following through. I keep getting sent emails as if I am still participating in school, I got called by their financial department about starting to pay back the tuition that the loans and pell grant couldn't cover, I told them my plans were to drop out but nobody has given me any information on how to do so without risk of being charged. They said they'd forward the information and tell my financial adviser to get into contact with me. Not even a phone call or email, text, any kind of thing. I have severe phone anxiety so while I could try to call them myself (I don't have the info, I lost it) it would cause me to panic.

&amp;#x200B;

I now have an overdue balance for something I do not want to pay, considering that I am STILL trying to drop out. At this point I'm this close to saying fuck it and cutting all ties and asking for help at the college I want to attend instead about what I can do. All I really wanted to know was the state of my loans, if I had to pay back a percentage of the tuition, does the FAFSA carry over or do I have to reapply, and how to give the tablet back+shipping label for it.

  
I had to sign contract after contract with these guys and being encouraged to not read deeper into it by both the admissions guy and my financial adviser, and I'm worried that if I don't give the tablet back or get the right goddamn info from these guys that they might try to s/ue me.

646,"So I’m 17 and a senior in high school. Because I moved from another school, for a while I didn’t have a lot of friends and I was really bored all the time and I played a lot of video games. By senior year, however, I started going out to parties, hanging out with friends, and having girls over. On the weekends me and my friends would always play video games too and have a fun time. I even got a job at a local restaurant. However, recently that’s begun to change. Because I came home drunk one night im no longer allowed to go out. I have to bring my cell phone at 10:00 and she will constantly spam my phone at 10 if I don’t. She will take away my Xbox completely randomly (today she took it and said I’m only allowed to have it on weekends). And when I have a girl over she’ll listen to everything and won’t leave us alone. She also monitors my bank transactions and my location through an app and will spam my phone if I’m not at the place she expected (calling and screaming at me when I went over a friends house after school to have pizza). I’ve left that kids house in the middle of us hanging out three times because of my mom calling me screaming at me to come home for different stupid reasons and obviously he didn’t like that. I consider myself no longer part of that friend group and they have a fun time without me. She has also caught me smoking marijuana and of course she blames my sudden lack of friends on that. She will also take away my video games saying im addicted and it’s keeping me inside, meanwhile I only play on weekends with my friends. When I try to take with her, she is very emotionally charged (which I am not good with) and she also derives her own conclusions and she will not change her mind. When I was younger she would always say that I’m “negative” and I never knew what that meant, but for years I thought something was wrong with me.

I was feeling so happy when they would text me back and i felt like like „yeah, they dont actually hate me, how cool”. I even had really good and cute chat with one girl, who had similar interests to mine, 
But, after i became so brave situation changed and the people who were nice to me turned out to be complete assholes. I felt ignored by them, ridiculed.

650,"So, let me explain myself.

Im having a houseparty in the upcoming week and have invited most of my party friends and close friends in general to come.
But i have not invited My best friend, as she is very different in the party scenery. She doesnt get very crazy, and is very quick to judge and make others uncomfortable, even me. To put it out real, I really don’t want her to be there -which is Why i have decided not to invite her. 
Only the thing is, she is going to be extremely upset (ofcourse) when she finds out as she doesnt really know that she is the way she is during these occasions. And also that I am one of the only friends she has and really trusts. 
Since We live in a very small town, and everyone knows eachother- the let down is going to be even bigger for her as she  basically knows everyone who is invited. 

I have decided to not tell her about My party, even though i know she probably is going to find out i had one and that she wasnt invited anyways. Because I don’t know how to tell her I don’t want her to come.
How the hell do i make the best of the situation and let her down in a nice way when she eventually does find out?? I don’t want to tell her “sorry you weren’t  fit to be there” or anything like that. Please help, I don’t want to get my head cut off or break our friendship.",18Mar2019,1

Always shows up for his shifts, does his job and always offers a hand but this crosses the line. Our job involves looking out for people’s safety (we’re rink guards at an ice rink) and I don’t think someone with little regard to other people’s safety should hold that position when he’s bragging about acting recklessly.   

Another reason I have is a bit selfish. The arena we work at has 3 rinks, 2 of them are being shut down for 6 months for renovations. That means our hours are gonna be cut. If people get fired or quit, that could increase everyone else’s hours for the spring and summer.

My building has a shitty ass drop off system for packages. So my package gets dropped off by usps at 8:40 when the office opens at 9. The drop off zone is literally in front of the office with no protection or anything but there are cameras. So he claims my package was stolen and he cant check the cameras cause there is no IT in the building and he cant do it.

Sounding fucking bullshit to me.

So the whole building is connected to the same internet so im guessing the cameras as well. How could I access the camera and see what the hell happaned to my package. This is the second one stolen btw!!

Im suspecting the office just steals packages and claims they cant do anything because they immediately become extremely defensive everytime i bring up the stolen package.

I also cannot do anything about it since the vendor did use the right shipping label and the tracking number says delivered.

More money, less stress, and her and I worked very well together, it was a no brainer. One week ago (last monday), I submitted my 2 week notice and everything was fine. However I get a call from my former manager saying that HR at my current (her former) company reached out to her to notify her that she had breached a non-compete agreement. Neither her nor I were aware we had even signed these. Long story short, the offer was revoked and I took back my 2 weeks notice. 

However, now my current property manager and my regional have cold shoulderd the fuck out or me and I now have a surprise inspection coming up at my properties, even though I just had one last week. This is the exact thing they have done just before 2 other supervisors got fired so I am somewhat anticipating the same will happen to me. The question is, should I got on and put in my notice now so that I will be able to be laid for my accrued PTO or should I just wait with crossed fingers?

Initially I was really taken aback, I think I was with a friend but I ended up going back and talking to the people in the chat room. It was filled with pedos. I liked that it didn't matter what you said they always talked to you and I was a bit of a loser at school. So I did that pretty often and it got more and more often as I approached my teen years. We used to go in our preteen years online to make fun of them but then once my friends had left I would go back and talk to them. I had one who I talked to a lot and he used to say he wanted me to come visit him all the time and he would live stream himself masturbating to me and talk to me and ask me questions about my life. At this point I had no friends at school or anything, once it got to that point. So I kept doing that and eventually I started sharing pictures and live streams of myself. I stopped when I was 17.

I hardly see my mom and stepdad, but I keep in touch for my siblings.  My stepdad has never necessarily done anything inappropriate.  He cared for me and often tried to deal with my mom instead of letting her take out her frustrations on me (she was super strict and at times abusive).

I had a very difficult time growing up, and I still suffer from depression and sexual disorders from it.  As I have become older, I have realized more of the things I went through that I didn’t think that much about were likely other instances of abuse.

By dance, I mean grind, twerk, do it all on the dance floor. And I’m positive she means make-out for the kiss. She said the twerking thing herself. 

We are single and not dating so it’s not my place to tell her what and what not to do (even if we were dating, I still wouldn’t do that). However, I find it odd that since she’s claiming I’m who she wants to marry some day and have kids with and do everything in life with, she still tells me that she’s going to do these things with him because she’s a “people pleaser”.

I realize that a lot people make decisions that they regret during spring break afterwards, but I feel like I crossed the line and I don’t know what to do or how to feel. I went abroad with a friend to his country; it’s very different than the US. I wanted to do as the Romans do as in Rome, or however that saying going, and try everything that the locals try. Obviously, this includes food, drinks, etc, but in my friends country prostitution is legal, regulated, and somewhat normal. Against my better judgement, I went with  prostitutes twice. She was nice, and we still talk, but I feel horrible in so many ways. First, I feel like it was exploitative because I asked why she did it and she said out of necessity when we talked. Second, it went against my morals, and even though I was drunk I know it was a bad decision. Third, I feel absolutely pathetic that I paid for sex. Before, i thought that I was progressive and fought for equality for women. I have participated in sex assault/harassment awareness and tried to correct some of my friends sexist comments. However, now I’m really unsure if I’m that progressive because of my actions. Finally, I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to have a real relationship and be able to divulge this to a future partner.

I am 21, and we have moved to a country where we have just obtained residency status. The town I live in is small- 10,000 people- but it is the biggest one in the area for about a 4 hours drive. My boyfriend lives an hour and a half away, in a smaller town by about half. He said there is a job opening where he works but that would mean I have to move. Fuel is very expensive where I live and I couldn't commute there and back every day. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, my mother knows what kind of predicament I am in. I have no job, I have training in the dentistry field (nursing) but there are no chances of job opening here, I've asked and checked. She also doesn't like my boyfriend. And she is under the impression that I will stay with her for years to come. The obvious thing to anybody on the outside is if there are no jobs here, you have to move. She keeps telling me how horrible I am for leaving her 'every weekend' to go see my boyfriend, how I don't appreciate that she 'lets' me 'do whatever I want'- I have money saved up, I pay for my own trips to see him. Besides, I have had about 10 grand saved up from my last job, but I have paid for the whole expense of us moving here, while I also found out she had the money for it- she works in the medical field.

I have just seen my boyfriend, and his family is so welcoming. It boggles my mind how 'normal' it is. The banter. The love. No neglect. No competition on 'who has it worse'. My mother threatened to kill herself multiple times if I were to leave. At the moment, I am feeling so overwhelmed with everything. She has also moved me School to school and in the end it got so much for me, I failed most of my exams. Can't go to uni as this country is expensive and I have no money for it- she offered to pay, but I don't want her to then make me feel guilty for it as she has done so many times. I have no qualifications and no money for any courses either. My only way out is to find a job but... a) I'm worried about working where my boyfriend is working. We have been with each other for over a year, most of which was and is LDR b) he did offer to move in with me if I were to move to his town, I just don't want him to feel like he has to I guess, if he isn't ready. or if we're both not really ready. c) I am worried she will off herself. The fear and psychological damage is so engraved in me, and I have no one to turn to here or nowhere to go. d) I am just scared. tired and overwhelmed and absolutely petrified.

675,"I’ll just give you guys the whole story, sorry for the long post in advance:

I met a girl in college in my first year and fell in love with her, got closer and closer to her, sharing personal things on a daily basis under the cover of being her “best friend”. One time we’re sitting down with her and a friend of mine working on an assignment, we deviate from the project and start chatting. The question of my crush arises, and I give her a false answer. I ask her the same question and she looks me in the eyes and says no one. This is the same girl that would reply to my texts immediately, and would engage in some of the most boring convos I start with her, and would later tell me that I’m her favourite person, she doesn’t feel as happy when she’s talking with anybody else.
I got hints that she loved me back but I didn’t say anything.

On the finals we sit together, chat a bit then leave, she texts me that she needs to tell me something. She calls and tells me that she had been engaged to some guy long before we met, and that she feels like she’s cheating if she sees me or talks to me, but at the same time I’m the only guy she is truly happy to see or talk with. I get bummed. I see her after a while and have a long talk with her about “why didn’t you tell me earlier” among other things. We leave on bad terms, and we stop chatting a while after that.

I messaged her yesterday and wished her a happy birthday, I was contemplating whether I should do it or not this past couple of months. She replies and we start a long conversation, I ask her about her fianće and she tells me that they’re getting married next whenever-the-fuck, she also told me that she’s going to another college and is thinking about never coming back, hits me right in the feels. I try to joke around the possibility of her coming back, she says its 0%. She asks me the question again, this time implying that I had a crush on her, this time I said “fuck it, she’s already not coming back” and I laid it on her, from the beginning to the end. I told her that I loved her since the first time I saw her, she tells me that she saw us (me and my friends) and thought it would be cool to hang around with us, and that I stood out in them and seemed like a genuine guy, and that she knew from the beginning but tried to let me down easy by hinting at her being engaged, and that she wasn’t actually in love with me. She wasn’t trying to prank me or anything, she was just not in love with me. For the next 3-4 hours we completely ignored the elephant in the room, we talked about everything else, and it also became easier to talk about my love towards her, I jokingly told her that I’d fight him over her, and that if she wasn’t engaged I’d move with her to her college, hell we even talked about what would we name our children.. 

After a really long chat, I decided to tell her. I told her that I would skip all of my lectures on that day if it meant that I can chat with her, and I that I’m sure as hell that she’d do the same, but this must come to an end. We must stop chatting and move on with our lives, she told me that I’d eventually find someone that loves me back and I agreed with her. I stayed positive until the very last bit, I truly hoped that she would enjoy her life with her husband, she told me that she’d have to tell her fianće that she talked to me, and that he might tell her to block me, and I agreed with it, I thought that this was the right thing to do, and that I must never contact her again if it will bring her harm. We left on the best of terms.

Today I was messing around and found out that she blocked me. I knew it was coming and even embraced it, but damn, I felt -for the first time in forever- that I wanted to cry. I went to her profile and double checked to see if it was a bug or something, but its true. Now, Im not asking for advice on how to get her back, I know that she isn’t meant to be with me, that’s just the way it is, but how can I cope with this shit.
Since the day I stopped talking to her until now I bottled up my feelings and thought “Nah its good man” but when I saw her profile it all blew up and I just gave up on trying to be happy or cheerful anymore. Since that time my life feels like its going into a downward spiral, I’m not achieving anything of significanse to me, nothing works in my favour, I get bummed over small things, and on top of all of that, I just don’t feel amused by anything anymore.
I know that the fuck-up was from my end, that I started this bs by talking to her even after knowing the consequences, but I can’t shake the feeling of being let down. This weird mixture of being in pain and hurt at the same time.

4-share this with your friends over fuckface

682,"I've had my braces off for 6 years but didn't where my retainer so a space formed in my two front teeth. A year ago I was wearing my retainer again to close the gap. For some reason my orthodontist decided to put a permanent retainer on my two front teeth with a small gap still between them. It's very annoying and I am constantly getting food stuck in it. 

Also the teeth around it have shifted as well. I've lost my retainer a few times and didn't have the money to buy a new one so that's why they shifted. The most recent retainer I got had parts that fit in between those spaces so it wouldn't close and my orthodontist didn't care I had to call back after a week to let them know and he said he'd shave those down so the space could close. The thing is he didn't shave them enough so there's no way the space will close still. He had very good reviews so that's why I feel he is not helping me the way he should and it's frustrating.

Had very few friends so I always had a hard time getting new ones. My mom passed away when I was 17. We had a good relationship but she was sick( alcoholic) ..

ok enough of that. Anyways. Not sure if posting herE is the correct place. But I don't know where to go. And this is the first place I'm going before I eventually decide to get help. Not sure.

But yea never had many friends right now, I have one, sorta my best friend but yea. I havr others just like acquaintances I know... Anyways. I've never had a romantic relationship. I can freely and openly say I'm comfortable with my sexuality and I am not gay so that's not the problem.... I was always sad that I couldn't find a girlfriend so I just accepted it and forgot about it...

but recently my best friend got a girlfriend and it brought back that depression hardd. Now I know getting a girlfriend to compete with a friend isn't good. But I've always wanted one and sorta stopped trying. And yea. It's hard to see my friends moving on and I'm still here.... am I so far gone that I won't get a girl friend? I'm not even over weight or an ass hole.... 

Again if this isn't tje place. Please point me in the proper direction.

I dont believe I need professional helpbut if that's the only option to correct this... 

Thanks.

686,"I know people get angry and that feeling angry is ok, but I also feel like I get angry really easily, and when I do, it's hard for me to rationalize. It makes me really argumentative, and I run the risk of saying something really hurtful, when in reality, I'm just trying to say what makes me frustrated. 

Recently, I've been getting angry a lot, and while I always apologize for it, I would really like to prevent the arguments altogether. I don't want to keep apologizing for my bad behavior when I continue to act the way that I do. I've had some of my close relationships become messed up because of my anger and my inability to control how toxic I can get. 

I really don't like being angry at all, and I especially don't like being angry. It's almost like when I'm angry, I'm separated from myself, and watching myself say things without thinking them through first. Some people have told me that I could have bipolar disorder, dissociative identity disorder, or any other neurological disorder that causes some sort of outbreak of anger.

So, I'm wondering if theres anything I can do to improve. I'm definitely better than I was before, but I still feel that problem of being way too argumentative- and I don't want to ruin any of my current relationships because I end up hurting a person too much. I want to try therapy, but I have before, and my experience with it was terrible. 

Is there anything I can do to lessen the severity of my anger outbreaks, or even prevent it altogether?

690,"Seriously, I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I have such major issues making SMALL decisions and it gives me such anxiety. 

For example, I recently ordered a pair of leggings from fabletics. They were only $12 but I can’t decide whether or not I should try and exchange them. They seem a tad too small, but do I want to go through the hassle of returning them and then waiting to get the Size S? Or should I just keep XS and deal with the slight tightness? 
What if I get the S and then they’re slightly too big!?! But if I don’t exchange them what if I never wear them? 
I’ve gained a little weight, so what if I gain more and can’t get into these?? What if I lose weight again and the new size is too big!?!? 
I’ve been debating this back and forth in my mind for 30 minutes .

How do you deal with your indecisiveness? How to you confidently make choices without driving people crazy!? I’m driving myself crazy.

692,"Hi all. So I want to get back together with a previous date mate that I cut it off with. Considering everything, should I go for it or should I just let it go?

So for context. Her and I dated about for a few months about a year ago now, and I had the time of my life with her. I think she is a fantastic person, super funny, extremely fun to be around, and I am so proud of her for everything she has done. I regret not proposing to be truly boyfriend and girlfriend for the simple fact that I was going off to college soon. Before I went off to college, she thought it would be better to stop going on dates and go back on to just being friends, which was disappointing but I did it to myself, so I was mostly chill with it. 

Fast forward a few months, and I thought I had gotten over her completely. I was wrong. Coming back to town for a small break from college, I realized that I wasn't over her as much as I thought I was, and I wanted to give it another shot. She was cool with hanging out, but didn't want them to be dates exactly. That's all good, I'll get over it again.

Coming back again for spring break, shocker, I was still not over it all. We have been talking a lot more and hanging out, and it is really just making me really want to try to make it work again. A few things stand in the way, however. The fact that I am going back up to college in northern New York, she is going to Boston for college, the fact that she didn't want to date before, and the fact that I don't know how she currently feels.

I know it sounds completely messed up, but I just need some sort of advice on the situation, or the right thing to do. Do I try to make something work, or get over it? If I should get over it, what is the best way to do this? I would appreciate any sort of input. Thank you.

694,"I'm not sure when I started to become so lazy. When I was young, I would go outside to my front yard and do outdoor activities or go to the recreation center; ride bikes, go to the playground, play tennis, go rollerblading, swimming etc. It all stopped when school demanded more of me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Highschool was a breeze. I noticed I still had days when I went out biking with friends or just being out and about somewhere with people. 

&amp;#x200B;

Soon after graduating from high school, post-secondary came and hit me in the face. I think the difficulty level increased by a landslide. Was it because I was at an easy high school, or because I spent so much time outdoors and doing non-school related activities that led me astray from being a study-active student?

&amp;#x200B;

Is it because I wasn't well trained in my childhood that led me to being lazy and having lack of motivation to pursue a career? 

&amp;#x200B;

I dropped out of school, worked at a restaurant, everything seemed fine but I wanted to go back to school. And so I did and graduted from a diploma in computer science. But now, after almost a whole year of being jobless, I can't seem to get back in the groove. It's really on and off. There are times when I would code all day from the moment I wake up to the moment I pass out, but those days are rare. Am I broken?

&amp;#x200B;

I can't decide if laziness and lack of motivation is due to my lack of interest in the subjects I'm pursuing, or because of something else? Maybe because I am not good at what I want to be; therefore it becomes difficult, resulting in built-up stress which then causes me to divert my attention to other things that are easier, or more amusing? But if it is something I want to become, shouldn't my brain go against being lazy and instead, head in the direction of my dreams? 

&amp;#x200B;

Does stress have anything to do with laziness?

695,"When we made things official in November he apparently immediately started talking to some other girl via Snapchat. In December he needed to get his Appendix taken out and I went to go be with him and his dad was coming up for the surgery so I had his phone so I could contact his dad. He got some snaps and I found the messages between him and this other girl. And I stupidly decided to then try to make things work for the next few months even after he cheated and lied about a bunch of things. He claimed he loved me and wanted things to work out but I was so anxious and paranoid all the time and I still was catching him in lies and shit. And he recently lied about downloading tinder again and talking to a few girls. He hung out with one the other day and he said they just got drinks but then it turned out he invited her to his apartment which was around the corner from the bar and he didn’t tell me about it. He claims nothing happened but obviously I don’t believe that. And I ended things. After months and months of him lying to me and making me feel like shit because I couldn’t understand why someone would cheat and lie to me even after constantly begging him not to lie to me and that I rather he hurt me with the truth than a lie, he still lies to my face. 

And I feel good about finally ending things because it was getting so bad I wasn’t eating and it was really mentally draining. 

And obviously no relationship is perfect and I had my issues and flaws too in the relationship and I fully admit that. But I never cheated or lied to him. I was always extremely up front about everything. And I just asked for the same in return and he never did it. 

But I can’t help but keep thinking about what he’s doing now and who he is talking to and that it is probably so easy for him to move on because he always had another option planned. 
I keep thinking about how he really didn’t give a shit about me. That I wasted 8 months with someone so horrible. 

So my question is, after a toxic breakup like this, what do you do to stop yourself from being anxious or thinking about them and obsessing over all the little shit and reliving the conversations? What do you do when you find that you are asking yourself “why did they do this to me?” “What’s wrong with me?”

696,"I'm 22 and I am about to graduate college. I have been living with my mom to avoid paying the extremely overpriced dorm rooms. My mother and I used to live with my grandma, who passed away in May. There are still some things preventing me from moving out (like savings, fixing my car, etc) but I have a soft-deadline to move out by early 2020. However I am worried about my mom and I don't think she can care take care of herself, let alone the house, without another person.  


My mom has almost always lived with her mom and only moved out twice, with both attempts at independence ending up terrible. She wound up with no money and had to move back with her mom, worse for wear. Now that my grandma (her mom) is no longer around, I worry about what will happen.  


She inherited a house with no debt but needs substantial work (around 15-20k) relative to the house value (90k) to make it fully livable. I have been paying rent and spending money on the house when possible, such as fixing the pipes and repairing the the aging water heater while in college. My mom will worry about the house and money, but will doesn't seem to want to do any action.  


My mom is on the house and I am not, so there are things limiting what I can do. For example, my mom has yet to update the bills in her own name despite my grandma being dead for almost a year. My mom will often get bills and lay them down and never look at them. The bills will clutter up the house and will exist along with ads and spam letters. My mom will forget to pay bills for entire months. Our utilities charge monthly fees and it's not uncommon for a billing statement to include late fees anywhere from 8 to 40 dollars per bill. If I do something and my mom promises to pay me back or to do something for me, she will not do so.   


I've sat down with her and shown her how I budget my own money and I've tried to show her ways to cut her costs. She doesn't make a lot of money (enough for living expenses but not a lot of wiggle room) and spends a lot on wasteful things. She sometimes eats fast food 2-3 times a day and always at least gets breakfast. I've suggested cutting fast food and I've cut back myself. My mom tells me that is a good idea but she won't follow through. She will throw her food and drinks (sometimes with liquids still in them) in the backseat of the car and leave it there for months. That is how I know how often she eats out and when.  


My mom does not do her laundry except at the last minute and freaks out about not having anything to wear to work. She won't do any dishes and ends up just buying plastic when the dishes pile up. She carries a purse and she leaves receipts and other junk in it. She will ""lose"" her keys or credit card at least once a day, often because her purse is so messy. This often causes her to have a panic attack that is usually minor but can escalate at times. With her permission, I've cleaned out her car (no small feat), her purse, and her room. I hoped that having a clean space that makes things easy for her to find things will de-stress her and encourage her to clean up for herself. It doesn't work, a week of me not monitoring things is enough for things to seem like they never get cleaned.  


I do the dishes and the laundry now (something i'm not opposed to), but when my mom was living by herself when I was a teenager (I did not live with my mom for a year), she would never do those things. It was so bad all of the dishes had mold from not being washed and her clothes stunk so bad we threw them away. My mom just will not clean up any kind of mess she makes. If she has a wrapper, it'll stay there. If she got a can of soda and finished it, it will stay there.  


I've encouraged her to see a therapist and she was diagnosed as having generalized anxiety disorder and was given medicine to take. When she is on her medicine, she has panic attacks much less often and generally becomes more productive. However, she tends to avoid therapy and she often doesn't take her medicine.  


My mom does not understand credit. She attempted to finish college but dropped out when she was about 21. She later went back 2 other times and racked up over $20,000 in debt. She has episodes where she will start paying on it, usually over letters that threaten garnishment or court, but she will eventually stop paying and the cycle continues. As a result, she has the worst credit score of anyone I have ever met. When my grandma died, my mom needed to buy the car from my grandma's bank. My mom's credit score was so low, she couldn't get any kind of loan to get the car. I had to take out the loan. She's let 40 dollars worth of tolls turn into 180 dollars and the toll company is threatening to put a hold on the car that I had to take out a loan for (it's not in my name, I took out the money and outright purchased the car, putting it in my mom's name).  


I love my mom and I want her to succeed when I move away. I'm listing all these negative things because I am hoping someone can give me advice on these points and to paint a bigger picture of what is going on. I really love the house she lives in and I would love to either take over the house and fix it up, while my mom gets an apartment (something she said she was considering) or for me to move out and get my own apartment while my mom fixes up her house.

I have asked other's in my life for advice on the matter but I wanted opinions from people least likely to hold a bias in my favor. I would like to give all the details but I don't want to overwhelm any body, so I'll try to be brief but fair.

I have a friend, whom I've been friends with for over ten years. About a month ago she disclosed to me that she was feeling abandoned, not as close to me and that some of my text messages sounded unenthusiastic or like I had a problem at the moment. None of this made sense to me because 

1. I had seen this friend less than a month ago(at the time she brought up the problem) 
2. One cannot decipher tone of voice through text. Often times I am busy or have nothing else to add to the conversation. 

What made me highly uncomfortable was realizing she was making assumptions based on her feelings not something I actually did. And when I spoke the truth and told her no this was not the case, that I was not having a problem with her, or weeding away from the friendship (on multiple occasions... I've had this problem with her before) I was later accused of gaslighting her. 

This is  angering for two reasons. 
1. I took it to heart that I could possibly be accused of gaslighting anyone after knowing how harmful and badly it hurt me over the years growing up with narc parents. 

2. One of the major psychological abuse tactics I had to deal with was defending myself against false allegations based on what my narcs felt I did. I've learned over the years that they, being the illogical bunch that they are, believe their feelings are facts. And I also believe the narcs I grew up with are more inclined to negative feelings(paranoia, insecurity, aggression etc) . And because they think their feelings are facts, this justified their narcissistic rage/abuse. For example, I would gray rock my mother. She felt like this was me being disrespectful. And no matter how logically I explained or no matter how much evidence was there that proved this wasn't true. It didn't stop her from attacking me and feeling validated in her outrage.

I also believe that any time this friend feels abandoned, it seems to happen when my life undergoes these major positive changes. About four years ago she had wrote a lengthy email to me stating she didn't appreciate my not telling her I was leaving for basic training sooner than the two weeks in advance I gave her. That this move was a threat to the friendship. However, there was no threat when she was moving near the Canadian border. Even knowing within the short time span, it wasn't as if we would see each other often with her moving so far hasd I not left for training. It was only a threat when I did the same and moved away for a number of months to, like her, return home after my training was complete. Now, the current major transition is that I moved out on my own with my fiance. 

I also noticed petty competitions and small evidence of her copying me. (ie, getting the same piercing, writing a novel with a character similar to the name of my character in my novel, tattoo ideas similar to mine, even considering getting the same pet as me etc) 

I don't know what to make of this and as I'm writing this there's a nagging feeling inside that is telling me it's not a big deal. Or I'm not giving her the benefit of the doubt. But then there's there's other nagging feeling that says it is a big deal and something is seriously wrong. I understand that emotions are not facts and I am open to be proven wrong. But I am seeing certain mannerisms that I left out in attempt to make this brief(I failed lol), body language, behavioral patterns etc that are warning signs. 

What is this? Is this a toxic friendship? How do I go about handling it?

698,"(Names have been changed for privacy). 

I have a group of internet friends. We all met each other on a mobile game and we talk daily. Recently, we have growing concern for our friend Sally and her new-ish boyfriend, Ralph. 

Sally came to me for advice because of experiences I have had. She told me that Ralph is a meth addict who really wants to get clean. At first, I sympathized with this. I know how hard recovery can be. To help, I found NA meetings and places to get help in her area. Slowly, I began to realize Ralph didn't want help. 

Suddenly, a whole luggage set of drama got told. Ralph had done some sex work. An ex of his had damning videos and evidence of the illegal and unsavory things he has done. The ex is apparently black mailing Ralph; saying she will release everything unless he comes up for money for a sex change. (The ex is male, transitioning to female). 

Sally got caught up in this and is now being threatened by the ex. Sally has been letting Ralph smoke meth when she is around. ""At least I know he's being safe when I'm around."" The other day, Ralph woke up and said he wanted to flush the drugs and be done. The problem was, he couldn't find his stash. He immediately blamed it on Sally (who luckily is smart enough not to touch that shit). He said if she didn't find it by the time he got back from smoking pot and hanging out with his brother; he would leave her. Sally tore her place apart. The drugs weren't anywhere to be found. He's getting pissed. 

He comes back and admits that he took the drugs and used them. Also saying things like ""I can't live with you anymore, your place it haunted."" She's had to bail him out of jail twice so far. 

Our friend group has desperately trying to get her to realize she needs to get out while she can. I had a drug addicted ex. I know how this ends. The problem is, she just makes excuses and forgives him. 

I know this is a ""you can lead a horse to water..."" kind of situation; but does anyone have any advice? ",18Mar2019,2

We recently moved so I only have 2 friends but they’re still more like acquaintances. My life is unstable right now but I hate feeling miserable every second of every day.

701,"Well, I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place right now and I need your advice. In the beginning of 2017 I interviewed for a nannying position for two amazing kiddos, I got the job and was told the dad would stay home while I was there one day of the week while I watched the youngest and the oldest at school. Cool, kinda weirded me out cause who wants to feel watched? Well, he’d leave and run errands and his location was tracked on the kids iPads so I’d always check to see when he might be coming home. I’d notice he’d be at a restaurant or the movie theater but who am I say anything - it was his day off.

Well things go quite normal for awhile, but at the end of 2017 the wife told me she was filing for divorce and told me she’d still need me as a nanny. They eventually made up and didn’t divorce. But after her filing divorce and making up, the beginning of 2018 things started getting weird. I’d wake up in the morning to a text from the dad at 12am saying “Hey.” He never showed any interest in me before, and I never replied because I knew he must of been drunk or something. When I’d come to work the next day I found beer cans all over, and I pretended like it never happened. Then again, I wake up to another text saying “hey” at 1am, I ignored it and never replied.

Every time I went into work I pretended like it never happened, and we never made eye contact or talked. One morning I get a text from the mom saying that the dad said I could have the day off because it was super snowy outside and too dangerous to drive. 10 mins later I get a text saying “Feel free to come over if you just want to hangout.” My stomach sank.. I sat there staring at my phone and didn’t reply but funny thing his wife texts me saying she had almost made it into work but they shut down because of the snow so she was heading back home. I immediately texted him saying that his wife just texted me saying she was headed back home but do you need me to watch the kids? He texted back saying “nope, enjoy your day off”

He sometimes would message me random thumbs ups or heys here and there, and I AWAYS NEVER REPLIED. One time I had cleaned their garage out for them and sent pics, his response was “If I wasn’t married already, I’d marry you.” I didn’t respond. I finally decided to quit because of how uncomfortable I was. 

Well just recently the mom asked if I could babysit while they went to a party, I said yes thinking he got the clue I’m not interested. I told the mom I’d probably stay the night so I wouldn’t have to drive home at 2am, well the kids are asleep in bunk beds of the youngest room. The oldest just had gotten a new bed that looked sketchy for adults to sleep on so I slept on the floor next to bed.

I wake up at 1am hearing them get home, I check my phone to see what time it was and put my phone back on the bed and laid back down. Not even 2 mins later I hear the bedroom door open and here comes stumbling towards me is the dad.. I kept saying that it was me, not the kids in here. Then he gets onto the bed, saying it would be safe to sleep on and that it holds him up. I got so uncomfortable I immediately got up and went downstairs to find his wife putting some stuff up, I sat on the couch just talking and he came rushing down the stairs like I was telling her how creepy he was being - which I wasn’t.

He then goes back upstairs to the sketchy bed and lays on it, I told the mom I needed to grab my phone and that I was gonna head home. I go upstairs to the room he’s in, turning the light on saying I was looking for my phone. It was NOWHERE. I knew he had it, so I went downstairs pretending to look for it and went back upstairs praying he was gone but wasn’t. He was like “do you need me to call it” I told him yes, and started looking outside of the bedroom for it, when I come back to the room it was on the bed and he handed it to me. I told him I was going home, and he was very close behind me and slid away from him so fast that I kinda tripped a bit and he grabbed me to make sure I wouldn’t fall. I dipped the fuck out, and as I was driving home I get a text from him saying “Come stay” I obviously didn’t reply.

If I was the mom I’d want to know, but also I can’t bring myself to telling her. I don’t want her to hate me or blame me. I did nothing, and have been screen shotting his texts in case it blew up in my face so I could prove I did nothing. Him and his wife are both very attractive people. And I don’t understand what goes through his head. I am 20 and 10 years younger than both of them, and I look at the mom as a good friend. She’s amazing, and I’m there only for her and her kids. I’ve never looked at the dad in any special way, never spoke to him special. And my boyfriend and I have gone to events with him, his wife, and kids. 

I’m worried to tell her because what would she do? Her family is in a different state, and she once told me when she filed for divorce that she swore he’d kill her because he’s crazy but she kinda giggled about it. He suffers from PTSD and is on a lot of meds. I’m worried about him being dangerous.

Also, if he’s creepy towards his nanny, lord knows how many people he’s been with or tried to get with while being married to the wife. So my question is, should I tell her? Would you want to know? ",18Mar2019,2
702,"Dad: **You look like you didn't sleep well last night.**

Me: **I don't know.**

Dad: **Did you sleep?**

Me: **I am not sure** ( I know if I had said ""I slept well"" he would still say the next dialogue, I am pretty experience with talking with him, so I have pretty much bottled up this whole thing. I didn't bother myself saying it, because I look tired and am, physically and mentally.)  

Dad: (Not literally, we don't speak English) **Hell you no, you didn't sleep.**

Me: **...**

&amp;#x200B;

Like, it had nothing to do with our previous conversation which was about whether I am getting better at playing piano. He just randomly talks like this and it's annoying. It wouldn't improve my sleeping even if I had trouble with sleeping because he just sh\*t talk with me. I don't have any trouble sleeping but he just is so delusional and I just can't comprehend how he thinks.

Sometimes he just talks about me getting more weight although, it doesn't help me but he just makes me sure that I am aware of this, not to mention, he is much more fat than me. 

My point here is, sometimes he is just so jerk and when I want him to know what I feel about this, he doesn't understand. He went back to work (he came over just for a break) so I hope he goes through this conversation, but I doubt, because he doesn't have that much of empathy although he acts like he has. He cares too much but it never helps anyone and he thinks just because he cares, he is doing his duty as a parent (smh).

I hope you guys get the point I am trying to make here and I wish I could get some advice(I have tried everything). This really grinds my gears. 

I can provide more information if needed.

I think that I'm in control of them, and that I could stop them whenever I wanted, but that's not true, because even if there are some weeks that I don't have a lot of negatives thoughts, they are always there, in the background, and there are a lot of times where I feel a lot of stress because I have suddenly a lot of these thoughts and worries. And it isn't only thoughts, I have a sensation of doom all the time, that I'm going to harm someone. Also, I believe that I'm a burden to all my friends and I think that they can leave me everyday or that I'm boring and they don't really like me.

I suspect that I have anxiety, but I'm not really sure. I believe that it isn't a big deal and I'm actually fine, however I still have these thoughts. When I started being like this, I was very stressed and scared all the time, but now maybe I've learnt to deal with it, but I think that it still cripples my life in more subtle ways.

Basically what the title says. She’s in her early 20s and physically attractive, and the doctor, as she described, in his 40s (and she suspects has a wife and kids). She went for an eye check up and the optometrist noticed she was wearing something Zelda related. He comments on it and she responds in a typical “yeah” and doesn’t really make conversation with him.

Some time later, she gets a random call at 9pm at night and it’s the same optometrist asking her if she’d like to join him on board game nights with his friends. He asked her if she’d like to have coffee with him another time too, and then he also says things like he would like to let her borrow his books and other things that are making her even more uncomfortable. She told me she didn’t respond much except for saying “oh no thank you” and hung up as quickly as she can. 

I suggested that she report it back to the medical office, but I wouldn’t know to who or how. Also to not go back to that optometry because obviously that doctor doesn’t respect patient confidentiality.

719,"I’ll be starting a Physician Assistant program in the fall, but I’m not actually passionate about the career and field like I feel I should be. When I started college I had plans to be a doctor, but during my sophomore year decided I didn’t want to spend the time, money, and energy. After looking around at various other medical jobs (since my bachelor major is pretty much only useful for the medical field) I finally settled on Physician Assistant.

I told myself it was a good choice: shorter schooling, high job satisfaction, and a salary that would easily put me in mid to upper middle class. I knew it wasn’t my top choice for a career, but I convinced myself that it’d be worth it for the money and the ability to help people.

And so I went through the long application process, telling myself the whole time that “hey, i might not even get in. If i don’t, I’ll pursue something else”. I barely put in any effort. I saw other people doing mock interviews, studying for the GRE, asking for all kinds of advice from mentors and books. I did none of those things, I even turned in my applications fairly late in the cycle, yet I still got in to a few schools.

Now, as it gets closer to the starting date, it’s becoming more “real”, and I’ve realized I have absolutely no passion for medicine. 

Devoting all my time and energy for the next 2 1/2 years, while also going to debt, to learn this sounds like a nightmare (PA school is known to be as intense as medical school simply due to the amount of information being taught in such a short time). 

But I’m too afraid to withdraw. My current bachelors is basically useless if I don’t go medical, and the field I’m actually passionate about (History) is much less secure in terms of finding a good job. Not to mention I’d have to go back and get a new bachelors which would put me in the debt I managed to avoid in my first bachelors. 

I know that if I withdraw, I WILL have much less financial success until my 30s, and I’m worried I won’t succeed in this complete shift. I don’t know what to do and I feel myself spiraling deeper down.",18Mar2019,1

I'm a 19 years old guy that it's in the middle of his first law school grade. It's a 4 year grade if you pass everything at the first try and I'm not that kind of student, my guess is that it's going to take at least 6 years. I started liking this grade first months but I rapidly lost interest in the second quarter and now I'm not going to class at all. 

This last week's I've been thinking about dropping off and going for a 2 year grade of a different kind that I don't know if I'd like. The thing is that I'm not 100% sure about dropping off and now I'm afraid that this last 2 weeks of not going to class are gonna set me too far behind to catch up. My best friend who was in my same class dropped off (that's one of the reasons I'm going to class).

Another reason why I'm not completely sure about dropping off are my parents. They are really strict and I've been told that if I didn't pass everything I would have to pay for it with my own money and I don't really have the means for that. I didn't tell them yet that I'm thinking about dropping off and I intended to tell them when get 100% sure of what I'm going to do next year. And the worst part is that I don't know if they would pay for this 2 year grade if I decided to drop off and change.

That being said, I really think that law school has more jobs in the market but I don't know if anything that has to do with law is going to make me happy and since I'm probably going to be stuck with what I study forever I really want to make the best decision possible.

If you are thinking about asking me what do I like, the thing is that I don't really like anything at all and I don't think I have a talent on something specific that could mean a job later on. 

I hope it's understandable and wanted to apologise in advance if something wasn't clear (I'm not native English speaker).

Hi Reddit fam. I 32F am in a serious fucking slump right now. I typed this whole note up while I was hiding in a starbucks because I just cannot fathom sitting in my fucking office for another minute. 

To be clear, I am not depressed and want to continue living. I am at a crossroads and just too scared to pull the trigger (quit my job). See below for context. IT’S LONG.

I. HATE. MY. FUCKING. JOB. I, am a 32 year old single female professional working in a male dominated sales environment. My workplace is as capitalistic, cut-throat and corporate as you can imagine. I am very proud of what I have accomplished. I have successfully worked my way up the organization and currently hold a very high-power prestigious position. I am not only the only female to sit on the leadership team, but also the only female shareholder and part-owner along with a dozen men. I am regarded highly by my peers, staff and other management. I loved the high-performing sink or swim aspect of the job for many years. I thrived in it in fact. I am competitive, tenacious and a relentless workhorse. 

Ever since I can remember, I have wanted an opportunity like this. As a young girl, I envisioned being in a position of power, authority and leadership. I am an outspoken, opinionated and boisterous businesswoman. For years I felt like I had found my forever workplace. I could not believe I found somewhere that was such a perfect fit for me. My personality is celebrated and my firm has stuck by my side through some very difficult personal situations over the years. For the most part they have been nothing but good to me so I feel very loyal to them.

That being said, we are a small to mid sized private firm. Now that I am involved in the thick of things and take part in many closed door conversations, I am starting to question the point of it all. I think I am having a real shift in my personal values. I feel like I just don’t fucking care about the work anymore? I have lost all passion and am becoming very complacent. My colleagues annoy me, the work feels menial and I have to force a smile on my face. I am really suffering. 

For the purposes of this post, I will try to simply list my issues with the workplace. We run our business like a family mafia, lots of smoke and mirrors and small-minded thinking; my new manager is a sexual predator and *highly* unethical; the men on my leadership team are fucking narcissistic pigs; I work with a sociopathic ex who lied to me for our entire relationship (I should make a separate post about him in r/cheating_stories); colleagues who hold higher titles than myself are held at lower standards and expectations simply because they are lazy fucks; I am often guilted by my manager and president about “how much they did they for me and don’t you know that you won’t find this elsewhere?” To be honest, it has become what feels like emotional abuse. Lines are often crossed between personal and professional and I feel very uncomfortable and on edge always because I am never sure what could or would be asked of me at any given moment. The fight does not seem worth it anymore. Wow after typing this I guess the word toxic encompasses it all lol.

I am looking for advice and reassurance from others that have left promising and stable careers who have not regretted their decision but rather experience and feel a sense of freedom. Whether that was for a new job, a new lifestyle, travel or nothing at all. I know there are other opportunities out there but I am terrified to let go of what I have. The comfort, the relationships, the money (I love money), the shareholder component etc. As a firm, we have a defined 5 year plan that in theory will translate into a lot of money at the end providing we are successful. but goddamn - the thought of 5 years makes me sick. 

What if my manager is right and I’ll never find better? What if I leave and regret it? What if the grass isn’t greener? What if I don’t find passion in the workplace again? What if this is just what a job becomes over time? Existential angst and the meaning of life is one of my FAV topics to discuss. 

I am at the end of my rope here and some days fantasize about walking out the fucking door. I am trying to treat this like a breakup and not stay because it is all I know and what I’m used to. I know that I am capable of great things. I am unique, confident, intelligent and the most hardworking person I know. There *have* to be other excellent and unique opportunities similar to the position I’m in currently, possibly even better.

By the way, I totally understand that I should be grateful for what I have, and I am. I am fortunate that I have options. I live in a wonderfully progressive North American City, I have a great group of friends, a stable family, I am healthy and happy (for the most part). I need some success stories on how to pull the trigger and just fucking go for it!!!

TLDR: Too scared to leave my lucrative and stable career that I took years to build that I now fucking hate. Someone please convince me that I can be happier elsewhere if I just take the plunge.",18Mar2019,1
726," 

My dad, Jeff Edwards, is a Methodist minister in New Jersey. He's a deeply loving and compassionate person who goes out of his way to care for the down and out. Over his career he has created thriving community of openness and acceptance at his church, the home for a thriving LGBTQ and minority diverse community despite the hostility towards homosexuality by the Methodist Church at large. 

He hates big banks, Wall Street, etc, and believes vehemently in telling the truth. 

And he gets easily stressed out about money.

So....

In April of 2018, **my** **dad deposited his checks** into the ATM at Wells Fargo, as he’s been doing regularly for the past ten years.

That same day, four fraudulent checks were deposited at that same ATM as part of a check fraud scheme by someone named *'Cousin Swing.'*

Police subpoenaed Wells Fargo for photos of the person depositing the checks. They said they could not automatically link the checks to security footage but would review their data and send photos of the person they believed had deposited the counterfeited checks.

**But the bank sent photos of my father,** with the fake check numbers written on the bottom of the images, falsely linking his image to the fake checks rather than this *'Cousin Swing'* guy. 

The police put out a search, posting my dad's image all over their facebook and multiple local radio stations. 

Unbeknownst to us, the police interrogated *'Mathis'* (the account holder) who **gave a description of** *'Cousin Swing'* a person who claimed would split the money once depositing the checks into the account.

**They look nothing like my dad.** 

Two weeks later the same check fraud event occurred at a nearby branch where an ATM photo was recorded of the perpetrator **matching this description of 'Cousin Swing'.** 

So...

When my dad finds out about this (someone from his congregation sent him the link) he went to the police to clear his name, bringing his bank statements.

**When he arrived they interrogated him, arrested him and charged with third degree forgery.** 

**When he protested and said somebody made an error, they said ""if the case did go to trial, who would the jury believe -- a bank security expert or him?""**

After a long hard year the case has finally been dropped. It is mind boggling the level of incompetence at both the police level and at the bank, and absurd that we live in a society where the police trust the bank's 'expert' over their own evidence. 

As my dad put it, **""I wonder what happens to somebody who might not have the resources to defend themselves”**

My father is now bringing a lawsuit against both Wells Fargo and the Police Department. 

*- Any advice on our situation and moving forward would be greatly appreciated -*

729,"Might be a dumb question but i don't know. I'm frustrated and depressed and upset with myself and i seriously need help.

I was friends with these two girls (We'll call them C and P) for a while (Both since June/July but i didn't really talk to them outside of roleplaying until a couple months later) (If it helps any more, we are/were internet friends only). Back in February (this year) things fell apart. I don't know what i did but i know that i hurt them. I have apologized but it didn't change anything. They thanked me but nothing else. Until recently, while we didn't talk like we used to, we'd have brief conversations or replying to things the other said on the forums we met on, or in our shared Discord server. But... even that has ended now. They ignore almost everything i say now.

Everything that's happened has really brought my anxiety and depression up. Mainly my anxiety. I feel nervous to read anything they post. I'm always worried they're talking about me how they talked about the two other toxic friends we dealt with in our friendship. I'm scared i'm just as bad or even worse than the other two toxic friends. Seeing them talking to each other makes me feel panicked because it brings back memories that i miss (Though it also gives me memories to when i'd always be paranoid that they didn't like me anymore).

Thing is... i feel hypocritical. I feel like i practically abused them yet i miss them. I truly regret what i did. I dream of having them back, or at the very least, having back the connection i felt with them. I know i'm toxic and i want to change. But is that okay? I know i probably sound dumb for asking.

730,"This isn't a huge deal, I don't think, but I can't stop thinking about it and I could use some advice.  I live 4-5 hours away from my parents/little sister but we see each other every few months.  I was 12 when my sister was born, so I helped raise her and we've always been close.  Now that she's a teenager she's scaring the shit out of my mother by........ being a normal teenager, in my opinion. 

Some background: as a kid I kept my entire life from my mom because I was scared of her anger/judgement, when it came to both small and big things.  I didn't let her know what kind of music I was listening to (punk/hardcore) because I thought she would disapprove... I rarely ever had friends over, always went to other people's houses because I didn't want her to see my actual, unedited personality.  From there, she never found out that I was drinking almost every day in high school, or that I started watching porn when i was still in elementary school.  I wasn't a delinquent in any sense, I graduated honor roll and got my bachelor's degree, have a semi-decent job at the moment... but I think if my mom had known everything that was going through my head when I was my sister's age, she would have been even more terrified than she is of my sister.  I was also pretty introverted, while my sister is definitely a popular social butterfly at school - she has friends over all the time, she doesn't spend anywhere near as much time alone as I did as teen. My sister is also a good student, plays sports, has a ton of friends.

I give my mom advice for helping to deal with my little sister a lot, subtly trying to show her the areas where she messed up with me and how she can avoid that with her.  My mom is currently very anxious about a lot of normal teen things and I don't know how to help. She can't stand all the sexual innuendo in the rap/hip hop that my sister listens to, she's also suspicious that my sister has been juuling (which she might have legitimate reason to be), she's scared that my sister is going to have sex too early because she caught her watching porn (with her friends for some reason?) and because she has a friend who lost her virginity, now finally she's terrified that weed is going to be a gateway drug.  

A few months earlier, I asked my sister to tell me if/when she ever smoked weed, just so I could keep an eye on her.  I promised her I wouldn't tell mom. She texted me a few months later and told me that she smoked weed with friends and was okay. I told her to be careful and to let me know if anything ever happens. This morning my mother called me to tell me that she knew my sister had smoked weed, and that she knew I didn't tell her.  She didn't seem angry so much as disappointed... apparently my sister has been smoking more since then, but I can't tell how much of this my mom is exaggerating and how much is legitimate. She started mention to how at her age weed can be a gateway drug toheroin/opioids.  I want to check in with my little sister, to make sure she's okay/to gauge how serious the situation really is, but I don't think she'll tell me the truth because she thinks I'll just tell our mom.   

I don't know whose side I should be on here; I'm worried about my sister, but I also think she should be allowed to be a teenager with secrets as long as they're not life-threatening.  I'm also worried about my mom losing her mind because of my sister.  I love them both so much and I want to help but I don't know what to do.",18Mar2019,4

These projects are either not close to where me and my husband have settled down, or are in a different country - to take these opportunities it would mean me working away Monday to Friday or in 3 or 6 month blocks. My company covers the cost of a rented apartment away from home, all bills including food when working away from home so supporting myself away isnt an issue. 

Firstly my husband is not keen or happy with the prospect of me working away, even within the country, I can't imagine he would even let me go if I were to take an overseas offer so I have to consider him and his feelings. 

Secondly, I feel stuck between the strong maternal instinct in me which is saying and wanting to have a child right now, and the other side of me that relishes the challenge of new experiences, new projects, large infrastructure works and meeting new people across my industry. 

Obviously if I have a child, I won't be able to work away at all and this would leave me trapped in a boring regional office hoping that a semi-interesting project pops up every now and again that I would be limited to assisting on, not leading. 
Similarly I worry that if I take my chances and aim high for the better experience and eventually higher wage, that I'll push my husband away and I will be at a point where I wont be able to have a child. 

I love where I work and I wouldn't change it, my current project though, which is a big infrastructure job, finishes in around a year, so I have a year to make a choice to stay grounded and start a family or chase the career dream and push myself in a different city or country. 

I don't even know where to start in deciding which one is right as some days I can't think of anything better than having a family, and others I long to see more rare and interesting aspects of my work and I imagine myself regarded as a specialist in my field in the decades to come. 

How do I go about deciding on this impossible choice? ",18Mar2019,2
732,"I unfortunately know of someone committing food stamp/welfare fraud. They were able to claim disability even though I know for a fact they aren't disabled and they brag about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is that I recently stopped being friends with this person for dating my niece behind my back. This person is completely self serving, sex offender, transient and on welfare, my niece has a 7yr old daughter and I don't approve of this relationship. You just don't date your friend's family. Not cool. So I stopped being friends with them and kinda disowned my niece.

Now, I can't get this nagging thought that I should report them for fraud but I know it's my own immature emotions trying to get revenge for putting a wedge between me and a family member who lives 3000 miles away.

733,"So, this shall be difficult and long.
I am currently 17, my birthday is in August. By which time if I leave for Ireland I will be 19. I’m including my age because I’m quite young.

My mother has offered for me to move to Ireland with my family there next September....the only thing holding me back is my partner. I don’t know what to do, and it’s making me rethink everything being giving this opportunity to do what I once dreamed of.

Before I was in a relationship my goal was to move to Ireland, live overseas and enjoy my life. Be the free Pagan Hippy I was....I’ve changed. Now my partner is able to come with me if they wished to....however they don’t want to leave family they have here. I honestly don’t understand as I don’t have much family anyway. Only my mum here in Australia. 

My partner wishes to live in Australia all their life, in Brisbane. And I don’t know....it’s lovely but my aspirations have really been crushed. And they have done some shit things. They crushed on my best friend and ended up sending them messages, and wanting to have a coffee date in an afternoon....telling me they needed a haircut that day....they said all the same things they sent me when we first messaged. And it kind of ruined me. When I caught them out because my friend outed it all....they were a mess. To know that it wasn’t going to stop until my friend stopped it, it fucking hurts even more. They threatened to kill themselves and I had to just hold them and comfort them in the time when I needed that. They say they are so sure about me, and yet I found older messages from another person while I was away on holiday....in Ireland. So if it didn’t stop them then? Why would it stop them now :( 

We are moving out....yeah at 17. Moving in together at that age, they’ve been buying all our stuff to move out and looking for places. I’m excited, but just very scared. As they say they want me forever....now at the age of 17 no one knows for sure who they will be with. Emotions change and people do.

We constantly have arguments, everyday something small. Which ends in my mental health ruining it all and me having a full blown panic attack and bashing myself. And them just getting sick of it and sighing...
I am also currently fully dependent on them. As I ran away from home due to an abusive father and I cannot live with my mother.

They say they want me, but we’re young....we have our whole lives ahead of us. So much to do. And I am so scared if I don’t take this offer I’m going to be so lost. If I stay will they just leave me? I will have nothing....then I will regret not taking the offer. Or do I stay and see where this goes? I am in love, I love them so much. I am just unsure if they love me. They say they do, but when shit happens you don’t really know.

Please, I really need some advice from some people?

735,"Hey friends, 

So I’ll explain the main points and elaborate on them below. I am 25/m who is a graduate student at a local university. I haven’t attended classes in 2+ weeks for several reasons: I chased off a woman I fell pretty hard for, stopped taking my medications, I’m hardcore addicted to using my smart phone, and have lost motivation towards being a contributing member of society. I have been wanting to escape society and live isolated in the woods. And this is where we are. 

To unpack this: I was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I tried one medication, which seemed to do fine for about a week, and then things got worse. I chased off a girl I liked because she was sick and didn’t want to hang out one night (I definitely was an asshole there), and she refuses to talk to me. 

Then my insurance denied coverage of my therapy sessions (recently moved to a new state, so my fault on that). So I’m slapped with increasing debt, and decided that I’m attending mental health sessions that seem to be a huge scam. So I stopped taking my medication outright, which has really been messing with my head. I decided to stop attending school because of my increasing paranoia, and decided I want to move off the grid and self-sustain myself. 

I told this to my parents, and they naturally flipped out. I told them I am not taking drugs nor drinking alcohol, and that this is a conscious decision. They think I’m suffering a psychotic episode, and want me to come home, which I want nothing to do with home life. 

While all of this has been stacking, I have relegated a daily routine of staying in bed watching YouTube and exploring dating apps. The reason I’m so reliant on dating apps is that I’m hoping to find a woman to help me through this. But alas, I get rejected over.. and over.. and over again. Sometimes it’s me getting bitter and conceited, so I again can acknowledge it’s my fault. 

Most importantly, my recent stint of isolation has made me oh so addicted towards my phone. I have been living a pathetic sheltered life spending all day watching YouTube and hoping a woman gives me the slightest attention and can help me out of this hole. 

When this all started to initially spiral, my friends would tell me to get help and then refuse to talk to me until I got better. Therapy hasn’t been helpful, and I lost motivation on medicine being out there to help. I feel the only way to rectify the situation is to destroy the damn phone and live a sheltered homeless life. Maybe it’s a conscious decision, or maybe I am experiencing a prolonged episode. 

There’s parts of me that wants to get better, and there’s other parts that sabotage all those steps. There is a colleague who wants to help, but I treat him differently because he’s of the same sex. 

Can someone please talk some sense into me and clarify what’s going on in my head, as well as detail what I should do. Everything is a blur at the moment, and I would be forever grateful for anyone who helps me out of this hole. 

If you read this far, thank you. ",18Mar2019,1
736,"So me and this girl have been friends for about 6 years, the kind that happily blow in and out of each other's lives but are still friends.

Well we had a huge fall out at the beginning of the year. She said some really hurtful things and I basically told her that 'if that's the way she thinks of me then there is no point of us being friend's'.

It was a really tough decision, but ultimately something I had to do for me.

Anyway, I haven't seen or spoken to her in about 2 months, and I'm in a little bit of financial trouble, nothing major, but every penny helps.

This is because in the past he has threatened to kill himself if she didn’t do something he wanted and has been verbally abusive towards her. He also is possessive and dictates what she can wear and who she can be around. He’s also told me to kill my self.
     I’m asking for advice because my friend has said that her boyfriend no longer threatens to kill himself and he didn’t mean it when he said I should kill myself. She also said he’s stopped being verbally abusive and she sticks with him despite the bad things he’s done because she “just really likes him”. So am I just intruding in their personal lives?

741,"I've been working as a software engineer at a small company for just about 4 months now. They recently hired my predecessor back as a contractor part time to help transfer his knowledge to me. He was known to make changes in the code and promote/deploy these changes without telling anyone. 

Last Thursday he deployed some changes to a vital part of our internal software that caused some issues over the weekend. My boss isn't happy because it went against procedure and he had to deal with it over the weekend. 

My boss want to hold a meeting with the team tomorrow to figure out what happened. I just met with him and told him that it was due to this contractor. My boss then told me that at some point in tomorrows meeting, he is going to ask how untested code was deployed against procedure. At which point I will be able to inform everyone that the contractor is responsible. 

To make matters worse, the contractor seems to think it was me who deployed the code. I'm certain everyone will believe me over him (since he has a history of this behavior). But how do a point the finger at this guy in a professional way?

We are together in two courses and he always is the first to leave, he gives a fast ""goodbye"" to my group of friends and goes running alone. He is also alone most of the time, if we want to chat with him, he gives short answers or just stay quiet most of the time. At first I decided to give him some space, maybe he just want to stay alone for a bit, but this is the third week acting like this and recently a friend told me he is posting ""weird stuff"" on Instagram. I have no social medias so this friend showed me, he is posting very depressing quotes and drawing very dark stuff.

Before the break up she was always crying about us. She asked me to stay in her life, to keep seeing each other and that maybe we might get back together in the future. She even asked me if I'd like to sleep at her place from time to time and if she might come to mine when she wanted to.

All of this changed the day she moved her stuff to her place. She almost stopped texting me. She rarely wants to see me. She never wrote anything like ""I miss you"", or something. She almost seems annoyed when I get in touch with her. She doesn't even want to have a phone call with me.

I mean, this is not the same person that walked out of this house a month ago. What happened?

I'm talking about a woman that was so jealous of me that she'd have killed if a girl was interested in me. Now she doesn't even want to know what I'm doing and where I'm.

There's these young kids who live down the block who seem to live with whom I presume is their grandparents. There's at least 5 of them and they seem to be between the ages of 1 and 9. Now it seems to me that the guardians might be slightly negligent, but I know nothing about parenting so I try not to judge. Last fall I lost my cat for a short while (she turned up later that night) and was looking for her around the neighborhood. Long story short, two of the older kids saw me looking for my cat and told me they had seen her. However it soon became evident that they had not seen my cat and were just rambling on because they wanted to talk to me. Like I said I don't know how to interact with kids but I tried to thank them for their help and then go back to searching on my own. But the kids did not get the hint and WOULD NOT LEAVE ME ALONE. They kept telling about anything and everything, which I would respond with ""mmhmm"" and ""that's neat."" I was mostly tuning them out as I walked back to my house and eventually I literally had to close the door on them because they were just standing on my porch while I stood in the doorframe waiting for them to leave and I couldn't find any other way to make them stop talking to me. However, after the whole thing happened I suddenly remembered something that one of the girls said when I was half listening. It was something along the lines of, ""one time I didn't want to go to bed so *so and so* (the way she said it it sounded like a parental figure) threw me into the bed and it really, really hurt."" And I was like, wait, is she being abused? Sometimes I think maybe I should let the authorities know, but also at the same time I don't know if the kids are actually being abused or not. Maybe I misunderstood the story or maybe this was when she was living with someone else and because of this the kids are now living with their grandparents?

I deferred my acceptance and am taking a gap year, during which I’m working and living with my boyfriend in our own little place. 

It’s honestly going wonderfully. We split domestic duties evenly, we get to spend every day with each other, we have combined finances, etc. It’s like married life minus the ring. We have our ups and downs, we’ve seen each other at our worst and come out the other side. My boyfriend is dependable, hardworking, honest, devoted, caring... I could go on forever. He has his flaws but none of them are dealbreakers or even close.

Next year we’re both due to start college, at different schools about 30-40 min apart. Hence the reason I’m posting here. I’m not sure if I should stay living with him, or move into the dorms. (He’s going to community, so there are no dorms, so this isn’t an issue for him) 

My relatives said we could stay at their place rent free for the 4 years of college. But they live close to an hour away from my school, (only 20 minutes from his). And my grandmother said she’d pay the extra tuition cost to stay at the dorms. So financially there isn’t anything to consider. 

Anyways. I want to live with him, and work towards a future with him. He’s everything I want in a man and honestly? I’m not sure I’d ever find another guy like him if I let him get away. 

But I also want to be close to my school, to have friends there and not just be a commuter student. If I was just going to be a commuter, I might as well go to community and save myself 40k a year. Plus, I’ve been incredibly lonely this year, since I work with little kids and the only interaction I have with anyone my age is with him. I’m confident we could make our relationship work if I chose this option, but he isn’t so sure. He feels that we would drift apart, that we would get too busy, etc. He fears that we would lose our spark and our connection. Whenever I bring up living in the dorms and how that would work out for us, his tone always changes to one that is very pessimistic about the future of our relationship. 

I so don’t want to let this relationship fizzle away or even risk that. But i also want to be able to fully immerse myself into the college experience, not have to worry about a 2 hour commute each day. Basically, I want to have my cake and eat it too. But that isn’t how life works. So Reddit, what should I do? ",18Mar2019,1
763,"Me 27M her 30 been seeing each other for over 2 months now very interesting woman which I started to fall in love with more and more every day however there is something that keeps me awake at night .

More about me I was not born in this country and my English is not the best and I’ve been told before my accent sometimes fogs the words I’m trying to say and it comes out as missed understood . Grew up in poverty learned to appreciate the small things and always tried my hardest to stay humble. 

Back to what keeps me up at night so lately I’ve been sleeping over quite a lot and laying next to her every night and waking up to her every morning. Her sex drive not so much however she has previously survived cancer and recently in the last couple of years she had developed a decent size bump in the stomach area not  very visible unless you put pressure /my sex drive up through the fucking clouds and she was aware of this when we first started dating in fact my first day over after talking to her for couple days we ended up sleeping together and it was an above average sex for both of us. She has told me before that it sometimes hurts her stomach area after intercourse and it almost feels like shifting inside so I improvised with the positions where it would be less penetrating however sometimes I cannot control myself once I’m in. Now that I spend more time over and getting more comfortable with her we are less and less engaging in sexual activities. I took it upon myself and let it come when is time but that seems to be backfiring quick since I’m getting more sexually frustrated every day. 

Today being Monday is almost a week since we had tried to do anything with the last time being a bj before taking her to work last Tuesday . This morning her period has arrived which is always good sign for me because I am not ready to have my first child yet however I almost feel odd about continually having to ask my girlfriend to be intimate. How do I break it down to her in a way that she would understand and not make it a big deal. She is strong activist so I figured I’d ask one of the largest activist group any advice to how to break it down for her would be greatly appreciated

The only problem is that I hated it. I always wanted to join the Air force academy, a college type institution, you get in and after 4 years you get out as a lieutenant.

770,"About 5 months ago I got out of a relationship with my ex of 3 years and things have been looking up for me. She had narcissistic tendencies and turned me into an even more unsure, indecisive person than I was before meeting her. After splitting up I moved back home and my immediate thought was to work in the field I had worked before I left, but quickly figured out after a couple months of interviews that I didn't want to do that type of work anymore. Been back and forth on if I want to work full-time or part-time, college or no college, and (over the past couple weeks) whether or not I should invest time into learning web development/programming, something I'm interested in but kind of unsure about, especially if I decide not to do college.

I'm constantly thinking about if I'm doing enough to maximize my time and it has the opposite of the intended effect: I just get more worried. I can't stress enough how little long-term plans mattered to me until about 5 months ago. It's like leaving the horrible environment with my ex has changed me permanently as a person, and I have lots of drive, I just am struggling to find a place to put that motivation. 

Right now I'm applying for cushy part-time sales positions where I can hopefully meet some new friends (I don't have many) and have some money coming in while still giving me enough time to learn web development, work out, and work on my other hobbies. Part of me thinks anything less than full-time work is a waste of time though, so I'm back and forth. Any advice would be much appreciated. ",18Mar2019,1
771,"For the past couple of years I've been really confused in trying to figure out what I want to do with my life. As a kid, I really wanted to be a fashion designer or something but I think I'd like to have a solid career, and I'm starting to like other things- like dermatology, which is surprising. When I applied to college and made my decision almost a year ago, I only applied to art schools and two in state universities as a backup plan. I was set on being an artist but art school was way too expensive and now I'm at UNCA, and up until a couple weeks ago I was definitely planning on majoring in art. However, in one of my studio classes, I got really turned off to the idea of my professor pretty much grading my art based on her own guidelines and not taking into account how hard I worked.. so I'm really considering doing something else and maybe minoring in art. 

I do art to express myself and feel good, and I think I've realized having others judge its worth is really not for me.. and that if I continue forcing myself to create art that I don't like it'll only make me unhappy and ruin my enjoyment. I have thought about possibly majoring in women, gender, and sexuality studies, and possibly double majoring in that and something else, with a minor in art or art history- because I've already taken classes to fulfill some of those requirements and art history does interest me. 

Though I like it in Asheville.. I really am unsure about staying here. There are not a lot of options as far as languages which really is disappointing. I want to learn Korean but they don't offer it here and I would teach myself but I want to be able to actually understand and speak the language, and I feel like I would be able to do that best in a classroom setting. I also want to go to PA school for dermatology, and I know staying here would be cheaper, but attending a school known for other things might be a better idea. I know UNC offers Korean as a language, and is a good school for sciences- which I would have to be knowledgeable in for me to even apply to PA school..

I like it here, but I don't want to limit myself. I want to learn a different language that I actually will enjoy speaking, and be able to feel confident in my studies. Also, UNC offers art as well as art history, and I'm pretty sure they would also offer something similar to women, gender, and sexuality studies. I guess I'm just unsure of what to do.. it's definitely cheaper to stay in Asheville, but I don't know that it would be worth it if I can't study all of the things that I want? I'll probably apply as a transfer for UNC for the spring semester of 2020 just to see what happens.. but if anyone has any insight or advice I'd appreciate it.

772,"By nature, I like to argue and take the opposite stance against everything. Someone could tell me something that, in an isolated situation, I would completely agree with, and I feel the need to argue with them and tell them why they're wrong. I do it for absolutely everything, even the most extreme views. I don't know why at all.

In some cases, this is good because I can always see both sides to every situation. But a lot of the times, it isn't a good thing. A lot of my friends think I'm ultra conservative because I like to argue against their liberal viewpoints, but I'm actually pretty liberal and I just feel the need to argue with them. Or even when friends are telling me their personal problems (ie. my mom is being really mean) I feel the need to take the other person's side. Luckily, I've gotten pretty good at suppressing the latter urge but it's still there. Also, important to note that this doesn't just apply to my friends; I feel the need to play devil's advocate with teachers, my parents, strangers, anyone.

Me and my best friend got into a fight last night. We’ve been best friends for over a year and this is our first fight EVER. (I’m a teenager so it’s gonna seem kind of petty to some of you, so bear with me) 

So basically, it didn’t start out as a fight. I was venting to her how I was upset that some people in our friend group were keeping things from me. And that whenever I say anything they always tend to gang up on me. I then told her “At least no matter what happens I know I’ll always have you”

But the people in our group chat didn’t let up and kept being rude to me, so my mood went downhill. And my friend didn’t defend me which kind of stung. I eventually said something to her like “They don’t care about me” (I was texting my best friend separately). 

She then flips out and says something like
“Why are you taking me for granted? I care about you. I can’t keep tiptoeing around your feelings!”

Which came out of nowhere. And that really hurt me because I told her that I always have her by my side before. And I also said “They don’t” which doesn’t include her. And I always defend her name and stick up for her. I screamed at a girl during class for calling her stupid. But she didn’t defend me to our group. So how was I taking her for granted right then? 

I then said “What the fuck?” And she was like “Sorry, didnt mean it” which didn’t sound very genuine. I don’t know. But we haven’t talked since and my friends are on her side of this. And I feel really alone. 


So should I message her first to make things right?

We were really close when we left school for uni and used to text and face time all the time, but when she got a bf things changed, but recently I’ve seen and noticed that since we had a argument around summer which was because she didn’t really understand that I had other things going on in my life and couldn’t talk all the time and thought I always turned to her for help and disregarded her when I didn’t need the help anymore.

My best friend, lets call her “Amanda”, did something that bothered be last Saturday. We have a mutual friend, lets call her “Emily”, who is a new friend of ours but Amanda seems to be really annoyed by her. I understand there are times she could be annoying but nothing big to where I’d stop being friends with her or anything close to that. She’s actually a really nice person! 

Here it goes: Emily was going to buy ex from Amanda. They agreed on the time that Emily was going to pickup the stuff from Amanda, but when the time came, Emily said she’ll be about 40 mins late. So then Amanda tells Emily that she can’t anymore because she will be leaving home soon to go somewhere. 

After that Emily said “Maybe I can pick it up where you are? But you probably don’t have it huh?”

Amanda said (and this is where I think she went overboard): “No bitch I don’t have it, fuck off” then blocked her. 

I don’t understand why she had to be like that. Yes, she said she was going to be late but it could’ve been settled in a nicer manner. So then Amanda screenshoted it and sent it to our friend group, saying something like “keep this bitch away from me I don’t need that negativity in my life”. I don’t see the negativity here other than her awful reply.

I wanna call Amanda out but I know I’m not perfect either. I don’t know what to do because I feel so bad for Emily, she didn’t deserve that. So I was thinking of telling Amanda that she was too harsh but I don’t wanna start drama or take sides.

787,"Spring and summer are always the worst months for me because I go through constant paranoia and stress. I live in a 3-level house with my mother, her sick cat, and my kitten. I am the only one that cleans *everything* in the entire house. I make sure to do it because I have an *intense* phobia of bugs and insects. I also have a cat allergy. As we all know, these issues are exacerbated by the heat of the warmer months. 

Because I am the only one that keeps the house together, my day is spent mostly cleaning and taking care of the cats. My mother is quite obese, so she also has me take on personal chores for her like washing her clothes and making her dinner because it is hard for her to stand up.  She also is getting deeper into a hoarding problem, so there is something new she tells me to bring in the house every week. We already have a strained relationship, so if I ever refuse to do these things, her verbal abuse will follow. 

I am getting tired of the constant cleaning up of bloody cat vomit and cat pee in various parts of the house because my mother refuses to put the poor cat down or even just take him to a vet. And I'm sick of feeling like I'm suffocating in my own living space (because of the cats, because of my mother's hoarding, because of my phobia). But the reason I haven't moved out yet is because my mother pays for the rent and food for me to eat. 2 things I can't afford on my own. 

I am just now getting a full-time job at age 21. It pays minimum wage, but that's all I can get because I haven't finished college. I live in a *very* high cost of living area, so the most I'd be able to afford is a room. Rent would be about 50% of my monthly income. I wouldn't be able to afford my kitten, so I'd have to come back to the house at least once a week to clean his litter box.

**TL;DR:** Do you think I should (1) keep dealing with the miserable life I was given until I graduate because its basically free and saves me money or (2) work as hard as possible to live on my own even if it means giving up financial stability and maybe postponing my college graduation?

789,"Hello, I'm in such a confusing and messed up job situation. I really need some guidance. I am currently the leader of a pastry department at a restaurant. It is the first restaurant I've worked at and I've been there for a year. I started off working with several others as just a pastry cook. One coworker made my life absolutely awful. She was good at her job, but disrespectful and rude to me and nearly everyone else at work sometimes. Her attitude was very bi-polar and she was good at kissing up to management, and eventually made her way to leading the department and being my boss. I've complained about her to everyone I know for almost a year. I told her directly that she treats people horribly and she never really sees herself that way. I talked to management about it, cried to many people about it, people left the restaurant directly because of her, and I eventually decided to work in the front of the house to escape her, because I really loved the place and didn't want to leave just because of her. Eventually, a new manager finally realized that she needed to be let go. Everyone was scared of her and disliked her. So, I took her role once she was fired and did a great job. However, this place is in shambles due to FOH management and kitchen issues- nothing on my end. My favorite coworkers have all quit and the GM was just replaced. I need to leave this job, despite being in a great role here I think. However, I don't want to work just anywhere. I want to work in a really nice place and be a part of something where I can grow and learn. 

&amp;#x200B;

I applied to four places and all responded quickly. The first restaurant, my top choice, is an amazing Japanese restaurant in a newly opening hotel that has restaurants all over the globe. During the interview they mentioned the person I used to work with and I was too shocked to say anything more than ""Yeah, I know her"" basically. So, then they offer me the position today and I decide to tell the person over the phone that I should've said something sooner and explained my history with the coworker. She said that she already accepted the position and that it was up to me to decide. Fair enough, they don't know me or her so it would be crazy to just trust my word. I just wanted them to know regardless. I really really want to work here. I think theres great potential for growth and possibly even travel, as they seem to open new locations frequently. The desserts here are amazing and beautiful. I want to be a part of this. But can I work with her?????? I REALLY REALLY don't know what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had another interview earlier and two more this week, but I have to tell this other place my decision tomorrow. The interview today went amazingly and I believe they will hire me as well, but the location is further and its a lesser known, smaller place. Still nice, but it's not something I'm as excited about. The pros of this other job are that the pastry chef is so down to earth and really wants to get along with and have a great time with her pastry team. I know we would get along and that I could be really happy there.

The issue is that my parents and I knew he was going to propose this week, but he told us it would be on the 20th (in 2 days). They are on a trip to Los Angeles with his parents visiting his sister. Since his family is there, we thought it’d be nice to surprise my sister and show up. We live quite far, but we booked tickets to be there on the morning of the 20th and told her boyfriend (now fiancé) that we are coming. He was quite excited, and we made plans to meet up with them at dinner to surprise her right after he proposed. So imagine our surprise when she calls to tell us that she’s engaged! We are totally bummed that we aren’t there. She also seemed to be expecting my parents to walk around the corner any minute while they were on the phone. None of us told her that we are coming in a couple of days, and we obviously don’t want to ruin the mood by complaining that he didn’t wait. So, now what I am asking is how should we handle this? Also, I’d like to do something special to surprise her and celebrate her engagement, but I am having trouble coming up with something. Any tips on something that would be fun to do in this situation around LA? They are staying near the Grove, and that’s where we will be going as well. Thanks in advance! ",18Mar2019,1
798,"I sit next to my crush in one of my classes, and lately I've stopped saying hi first in class, and running away when we cross paths outside of class. 

I'm pretty sure they've been taking these actions as disinterest and dislike towards them when it's the farthest from the truth. 

We used to have pretty animated conversations in class, but since I found myself liking them I've been acting a bit weird and distant out of fear. (Also: I'm not out of the closet but they openly are....I found out they were when I wore something that subtly symbolized being LGBT in my outfit and as soon as they saw me they mentioned they went gay clubbing with full emphasis but I acted like I wasn't listening. Anyway, but there's a chance they might not be attracted to me in return but I don't know.)

It got to the point where they've been also acting a bit stiff and distant towards me in return, and I got sick of it so I've contemplated asking them to hang out on the down low to get to know them a bit better because a date would be too high pressure.

Right when class was dismissed, I asked them if they had a minute to spare.

They looked a bit surprised and repeated my question to clarify, and so I asked if they were available this weekend. 

I specified to appear casual, ""I have to show up to school for an appointment, and since it takes me a while to get here, I was wondering if you'd like to accompany me and spend some time together...""

They said they weren't busy and said sure. I was like, ""...if you want."" but then insisted it was okay and they could show up at the time I requested. I think it came off as a bit too vulnerable for someone I never hung out 1 on 1 before, so then  I added, ""I would have asked \*specific friend's name in the class\* but I already see them everyday, so yeah. :)

They looked a bit taken aback for a few seconds, but then asked to swap numbers and told me to text them.

So yeah, I don't know if I came off as if I was romantically interested, but I'm nervous about seeing them again. I'm planning on bringing a game and buying them bubble tea, but they don't know yet.

What are some signs I can look out for to see if they're into me like I'm into them during the hang out?",18Mar2019,7
799,"First time poster, litterally have no clue how this place works, but I need help so whatever.

I've made macarons twice now, followed the instructions very clearly, but both times they come out sort of splooting outwards, not growing upwards.

I've no idea what to do because I'm not experienced with baking, and I don't know anybody who can help me within my family or friends.

I think it has something to do with my altitude, living in Colorado at above 6000 feet, but like I said I have no clue how this affects baking or what to do to fix high altitude baking.

Hey, so for context:

 I have been in a really bad spot since last August with my mental health. It's been really hard for me and my family, and I've been seeking professional help for about a year now. About a week ago, I hit a really low point, and I've had two essays and a project to do simultaneously. One of the essays is finished and turned in, and the other is due this Friday. The rough draft for it is due tomorrow.

Anyway, so I was making good progress, but I got super upset when I was having trouble finding articles to use as reasearch for citation. Since I don't have access to the school databases at home, it makes it harder. My parents had a convorsation with me about it, and I couldn't help but cry for no reason. I guess the pressure was getting to me. Anyway, I couldn't really articulate what was going on, because I've spent the past 2 weeks being completely silent at school. (I have no idea why I'm doing this to myself). So I broke down after leaving the room, and no progress has been made. My mom's multiple attempts to talk through it with me have failed, because I refuse to let myself speak. I honestly have no idea what's been going on with me. I really need some guidance.

TL;DR: I've been in a low point, and have been stressing over and essay. After an argument with my parents about said essay, I broke down. Idk what to do",18Mar2019,2

806,"Pretty long read but I'd really appreciate y'all advice.

I didn't used to have any confidence because I attached my entire self worth to basketball, a sport I've come to realize I never really liked. But I was dead set on making the NBA, so every time I was on the court, I was in my own head causing me to play like shit. Combine that with coaches that expected me to be the second coming of LeBron based on my work ethic and practice performance, and I hated myself for a while there. 

But, I'm glad to say I'm completely out of that rut now. I quit about 8 months ago. I went back to my first love of soccer, and I'm focusing on that now, as I am quite talented. Hoping to get a semi pro or pro trial this year. I'm only 17 now, so I'm gonna chase the pro dream before it's too late. 

Now when I quit basketball, I got my confidence back. When I was playing ball I never allowed myself to have any fun, go out, chase girls, really any of that. I was a 16 year old virgin (doesn't sound all that bad when I'm typing it out but I thought I was a fucking loser, not in small part cause my dickhead coach would always tell me I needed to get laid to play better) I had kissed one girl and I was very insecure about it. 

My friends started to invite me out cause I swallowed my pride and straight up asked them to be included more. So they did invite me out. Now I never really gave it much thought, but I discovered that I'm quite good looking, and years of sports have given me a good body. Plus I'm 6'2, that's always a plus. Without really trying I can attract women, wasn't long before I lost my virginity. One party I hooked up with a girl that my supposed good friend claimed his childhood friend had feelings for. He never told me the extent of that and actually encouraged me to go do it. Then he had the nerve to lecture me about how I shouldn't have done that, I tell him how I deprived myself for years and he says ""I don't give a fuck."" Cold. Not the only time he's said those words when I tell him about something I struggled with before. 

From then on he and another supposed good friend have been resenting me because I get more girls than they do and overall I'm just finally seeing myself as quite frankly, a pretty awesome guy. Like they've gone out of their way to stop me getting with girls, telling the girls I'm an asshole, I'm crazy, whatever. They're a couple of lil bitches. They also just make little snide comments about me that I've heard about. Overall, those 2 guys who I used to consider a couple of my closest friends resent me now that I've bettered myself. 

It really hurts me that these guys have turned on me. Every time I'm around them I kinda hope one of them crosses me so I can pick a fight. But that'll never happen.",18Mar2019,1

I tried to keep my cool but I had a visibly annoyed face and said “Ian, why would you do that?” I said it once or twice a bit sternly with a straight face, which shocked him a bit bc normally I always have a big smile on my face with him. but after I was like ok calm down it’s not a big deal. I felt bad because he was a bit quiet afterwards so I tried to be extra nice. I hope I wasn’t an asshole and I definitely don’t want to be that person who gets mad when people spill shit, I was just annoyed cause he purposely did it and now I don’t have my water for the day.

811,"(this got deleted from AITA, this isn't a fake story, please help me figure out how to get out of this)

I was experiencing a dry spell and by buddy told me about an app called Whisper, he said it worked better than tinder.

After downloading the app, posting my own whisper, and having a few chats that went nowhere, I saw a whisper posted by someone 20 miles away that simply said, ""I'm bored."" I replied and, to my surprise, got an instant response. We chatted a little bit and then exchanged pictures... this girl was absolutely stunning. I didn't want to lose my chance so without her prompting it, I asked her if she would accept $600 to hang out with me. To my surprise, she said yes.

After a short phone call she gave me her address. When I got to her house, I noticed a security camera facing where she had instructed me to park. I felt a bit hesitant but I reminded myself, I had only offered to pay for her time, so I didn't think it would be an issue.

When she answered the door all was well, she was already wearing a silky robe and practically dragged me inside and to her bedroom. We had instant chemistry and after the first time that we had sex, I asked her if we could have a round without a condom. She said, ""Yes, but only if you cum inside me."" At first I was a bit confused but then figured that must be her fetish... so we had two more rounds that way.

I told her I had work in the morning so I needed to head out. She asked where I worked and I told her. She asked me what my full name was and I told her that too. Then she suggested I just spend the night, promising to make sure I wouldn't wake up late. I obliged, I was actually starting to fall for this girl.

Next morning, she asked me about the money. ""Oh, did you still want that?"" ""Well, yeah, of course,"" she said. I stumbled to my wallet and put $800 in her nightstand, $200 more than I had said, because I had a really great time.

I left for work and had one of the most productive days I've ever had. I texted her a few days later and asked if she wanted to get together over the weekend. She said she was busy but that she'd love to keep chatting.

A few weeks passed and she was busy every time I asked her if she wanted to get together. Eventually I flat out asked her what she was busy with, and that's when she told me... she has a few sugar daddy's, and she only sees men when there is money involved, but that she'd be happy to schedule a date at the same rate as last time.

My heart sank, I'm such a fool.

I decided to just try and move on from it all but then last week I got call from her. ""I'm pregnant,"" she said, ""and you're the only guy who I had sex without a condom with.""

I told her I wasn't ready to be a dad... she said that was fine as long as I paid child support. I felt like I had gotten the wind knocked out of me when she said that. I quickly made an excuse to end the phone call and haven't called her since.

815,"I have an addiction to cutting friends out of my life. It hurts me every time but for many of the friends I have, I feel a burning desire to cut ties with them, often for no reason. I do this several times a year. The culmination of all of my friends, both online and offline, is three people. One of which I live with. Another person is someone who I have attempted to cut from my life for no reason about 3 times now, but I have kept returning. They understand. We have both concluded we will likely be livelong friends.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently cut ties with an unfathomably special man for no reason. He was somebody who I desperately needed in my life. I feel very sick and have difficulty walking right because of what I did. 

He said he felt our friendship would last for a very long time a couple of weeks ago, I feel a strange rush of power from being able to completely dispel this idea of his. I am a suicidal depressive and this person is one of the only people I can rely on to make me calm during times of intense danger. They did a lot for me. I loved him platonically, easily. Cutting ties with them is an incredibly stupid, drastic idea, so I did it.

&amp;#x200B;

A close friend of mine who I have spent a lot of time with is moving to another city. They messaged me on facebook asking me if I would like to meet up with them one last time before they move. I want to not respond at all, even though I want to see this person. There is a (not literal) voice in my head telling me that seeing this person is like ""giving in"". I have no idea what it is exactly im giving in TO however.

&amp;#x200B;

I do not believe I do this purely because I am a sadist who revels in hurting others, I hate the fact that I do this. I do not want to see my friends hurt. I can't imagine how upset my friend is. But rather I have this strange addiction to doing incredibly drastic things that shock or surprise the people involved. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also have a habit of leaving online communities that are very important for me. Places where I can go to discuss my depression in a safe and caring environment. Safe spaces, essentially. The second something incredibly minor upsets me, I will leave. It hurts me when I do this, and it does me no good, yet I can't stop doing it. I also have a habit of deleting online accounts over and over again.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been doing this since an early age. When I was a small child I would deliberately throw out my favorite toys, and bin my own schoolwork for no reason. I have a weird addiction to getting rid of important things vital to my happiness, or general well-being. From people to items. I do not remove random things from my life, I have an addition to removing only things I have a great emotional connection to.

So, I like my best guy friend. I have for about a year now and I was never going to tell him because I thought it was weird that I liked one of my closest friends. I was fine about it and all was fine, it wasn’t that big of a crush and I was (and still am tbfh) fine with just being friends. The problem is that it hasn’t gone away and the crush has gotten bigger (if that’s how you’d even describe crushes? Idfk, bare with me please)

Fast forward to a few months ago and people find out and start telling me that I should ask him out. The feeling of telling him being weird turned into a feeling of not telling him being weird. I’ve had numerous opportunities to tell him that I like him (all of which I noticed in the moment), I just didn’t know how or what to say.

I can’t just see if he asks me out because I have a reputation of being a very independent person who doesn’t need a relationship, plus he’s never dated/asked anyone out and he’s really antisocial and shy (so am I, that’s kinda how him and I became friends.)

I’m not even necessarily looking for a relationship at this point (it’d be nice, but it’s not a big deal to me), I just want to be honest and tell him.

I know it’s a pretty small problem compared to all of the other ones here, but it does bother me whenever I see him (which is quite often considering the fact that him and I are really close friends)

827,"Throwaway account for a bit more anonymity

Background:

This girl was my best friend starting freshman year of high school for the following 6 years. At the end of sophomore year of college we started a long distance relationship which ended a month or two into the start of Junior year when she broke up with me (citing that we got together too soon after she and her ex of 4 years broke up). 

We didn't talk for a few months until I reached out to her on her birthday in December of Junior year to try to be friends again. We talked  inconsistently from that point on and hung out once at the start of the summer.

She then started dating the boyfriend in question and stopped talking to me. I only sent her 3 messages that summer, the first 2 asking if she knew a guy I worked with who went to the same school she did and the 3rd was a private message with one of the Facebook friendiversy videos because I wanted to see if we could start being friends again.

The day after I sent the video, she blocked me on all social media. It has now been about 2 years since then. I've long since moved on from wanting anything other than friendship from her. The other day, a mutual friend of ours told me that her boyfriend just passed away.

I want to reach out and give her my condolences and make sure she's ok. But I know she's grieving and I'm not sure what to do. She's always been my best friend before everything and I want to offer my support but not if it seems like it would take away from what she's going through.

Should I reach out to her? What should I say? Is there anything else I can/should do in this situation?",18Mar2019,1

829,"Alright, so I come from a strict family. My moms pretty religious and all that. So, I gotta keep things on the down-low. I have one party for my partying, and it’s to never go to one where too many people will recognize me. Anyways, a few of my friends from another school convince me to go to one of my guy friends (who invited me personally). I end up getting to the door and make a decision and leave my hair out.

Everyone I know starts freaking out. I’m generally known by people cuz I’m social, but they only know the funny girl in the headscarf, so it was a shock when I was throwing back the drinks. Now, everyone’s in shock, but accepted it. I accidentally grind on the host of the parties dick a.k.a a close friend (I was passing by) and he calls me out for it and tells me to continue. I keep going cuz what the heck right? It’s a party. 

Later on, I’m dancing in the living room and somehow host is there and we start dancing and talking. Suddenly, he asks (I actually laughed my ass off at this) “how haram are you going tonight” and I say I don’t care. We start making out and everyone basically jumping off the roof.

After that, I went far off, made out with some guys, grinding, dancing, all that stuff.

Now, everyone knows what I’m really like and I really regret it? What should I do?",18Mar2019,199

I've definitely dropped multiple letter grades in all of them but I'm too scared to look at my grades or email.

831,"I'm in Germany doing an Ausbildung. Basically dual work and study for 3 years as a trainee with shit pay. In May I've got my final exams and if I pass I'll have my title. 
I absolutely the sector of work and can't make myself study for it because I hate it and have no interest.
Only got into this field because it was easy to find a position.
My boss at work is an absolute massive asshole and abusive...the pay and hours once I have finished will be shit as well. Working at a hotel.

Would it be absolutely stupid to cancel it so close before ending? Isn't it too late now anyway to study for the exams? Why can't I just quit and get a normal job without Ausbildung in something else that I don't hate?

834,"Honestly, I dont know where to begin and I have never made a post like this before. My now ex girlfriend whom I have a child with and still live with broke up a few days ago. Normally I would already be out of the house and settling into a new apartment by now, but I'm not able to do that just yet. Unfortunately I'm broke as a joke after moving from southern california to orlando, then from Orlando to southern indiana. So moving out is off the table at the moment. I'm going to be honest here and say that over the past 2 years I have not been the best boyfriend. I can be very short tempered, cold and sometimes just flat out childish. When I met my now ex girlfriend I just couldn't get enough of her and I would do everything in my power to make sure she was happy and felt special.  I guess you could say I was a romantic because opening doors, surprising her with flowers, treats and love letters was a daily thing back when we first met. It made me feel good to do those little things. Now, I dont want to go into too much detail about our fights or things that we have done to eachother to cause resentments but i want you guys to know that I went from being a really good boyfriend to shutting down emotionally. I was cold, distant and I could no longer give her the love she needed.... To make things worse I was this way while she was pregnant with my son. I know I sound like a terrible person and the worst part is that I couldnt recognize these behaviors. More importantly I couldnt change them. At this point in my life I am stuck in a state where I know no-one and have no family. Reddit is my only way to get this off my chest and try and gain some positive feed back. I would never post this on facebook because lets face it.... It would be a shit show. I know I didnt go into much detail about whats currently going on in our relationship. I guess I just want to know what I should do to better myself as a person. I apologize in advance for my terrible sentence structure and punctuation... ",18Mar2019,2
835,"I am a 21yo male,  6ft1 currently 191pounds. 6 months ago I was 240pounds, stocky bulky build. I grew tired of being so big and heavy si I began to lose weight,  people have congratulated me for my success in the gym and eating, but I've had family members tell me""youre getting too small"" or "" youre not meant to be that thin"". However being overweight and all the problems that come with it run in my family sp I never took the reactions to heart, but I have recently had friends and  Acquaintances tell me also im getting kinda small and one even told me I looked happier while bigger. My goal was to stop cutting when I hit 185 or so, I genuinely do not feel I have lost to much weight especially considering all of the upper body fat I have left over.

836,"My girlfriend of 3 years is gone away with her step brother, there not related but they grew up together as brother and sister. They were with each other years ago so she has told me. When they got to the hotel there was only one bed!! She told me she tried everything to change it but couldn't until the next day. So they slept in the same bed that night!!! The next morning they were in bed until 12 or half twelve in the day, she wasn't in a rush to get the room changed obviously. I tried messaging her and she said she was getting up twice both times she text and said ""sorry we fell back asleep"". I am now accusing her of being with him. She claims I'm having a mental breakdown, denies it all and doesn't see why I should be annoyed. She doesn't think she is doing anything wrong by sharing the same bed.

Nothing seems to give me satisfaction or enjoyment to the point where I am seeing the days and months fly by with nothing being achieved or cared about.  My current job gives me zero enjoyment or feeling of achievement. I can spend time out with family, friends, or even myself and yet I would rather be alone, and if i am the boredom drives me insane due to not being able to find any drive inside me or any motivation at all to do hobbies I know deep down I love.

839,"My friend is a commissions artist for VR Chat avatars and the like, it's how we came to know each other. She does these quite frankly awesome and cool avatars for people, however there are some people that abuse Paypals chargeback feature so when asking for a commission they will simply chargeback the money and have an avatar for free and making sure she gets no money for her hard work.

Any commission artists of reddit or anyone who has any general knowledge about this area is there any other way so that my friend can still do commissions without the worry of some d-bag charging back a decent chunk of change.

840,"My daughter is 5 years old, 6 in August. She has been 100% potty trained since 18 months. Since then, she has only ever had 1-2 accidents and it’s been when she was super sick and only during sleep. This weekend (Friday night) we had her first ever sleepover with a friend from school. This is also the first time they’ve ever hung out outside of school. Friend is 6 years old. She is still not potty trained, and pees herself multiple times a day. We had to bring her to the bathroom every hour to try to keep her from going on herself but even that didn’t catch it every time. Today, after school we did homework, made some treats to bring to the class tomorrow, and she headed to the neighbors house to play like she does several days a week. She just came home to change because she had peed herself. Husband and I were bewildered because she has never done this. She told us she didn’t want to step on the pine cones to get to the bathroom and tried to hold it longer and it was an accident. We don’t want her to feel like she’s in trouble about it, but we’re not sure how to handle this situation. She’s far too old to be peeing her pants, especially awake. We’re scared this happened because she saw her friend doing it. Thing is, she’s never been too impressionable, as far as you can say that about a 5-year old anyways. So, reddit, what do you think? Random coincidence or copying her friend? How do we deal and prevent it from becoming a new habit? ",18Mar2019,0

844,"Now a days it seems that being transgender is pretty normal amongst society. 

I have no problem with gay and bi people but transgender people personally make me uncomfortable 

I personally don’t think its a normal thing to do and feel bad for the people who indulge in being transgender (especially very young people since I don’t think they should have the responsibility of choosing something so life changing at a young age)

It’s not like I hate transgender people or would ever talk down to someone because they are trans but i personally just disagree with it

845,"I changed school last year, I made some friends (I don't have trouble making new friends) and then summer started. 

 Classes started again and there's this kid in my class...

Ok now, this kid is a dickhead. He will laugh at anyone, even the teachers. He is the cliche of a rich kid.

Why is he a dick? If he sees you falling down he will laugh at you, but in a way that's meant to anger you (and he will not ask if you are ok)

If you tell a joke that was meant to your friends he will laugh at it sarcastically and make fun of you.

I have long hair and he constantly makes fun of it.
