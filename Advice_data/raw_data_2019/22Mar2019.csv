0,"I have been playing my Wii for some time, and been playing Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, an old game my family bought in 2008(?).  Recently (and since who knows when I last played), it’s been acting up.  It always shows the Wii title when inserted, the game loads, and during the beginning cutscene and/or title card (Not always mashing plus and A the whole time), I get the game disc error.  I keep cleaning it with water and a hand rag (smoothest surface I can find), and it is taking more and more to diffuse the situation.  What should I use/do for my game disc?  Side note, the game has no gameplay hinderances when I’m playing it.  There is no need to eject the disc since it runs smoothly afterwards.

2,"So about 4 or 5 months back, me and some old friends kind of fell off and it spiraled down into us hating each other. Since then I’ve been just doing my own business and worked on myself and now some of my friends told me what happened according to them, which by how they explained are things that never happened and what my closer friends said they knew I would have never done. Lies like saying I asked one of the friends to prom and threatened suicide because they didn’t want to. Like what, I don’t even want to date or go out with anyone yet nor do I have interest in it.

What can I do about this? People I barely know are judgmental of me because of this and some friends I’m not as close to have cut off contact with me. Idk if I should talk to my school counselor or what because at this point I feel like they’re just trying to put me down and set me up as a “bad person.” Those people also outright said to me that they wouldn’t talk about me back when we stopped contact, which obviously wasn’t true.",22Mar2019,1
3,"Okay so, first thing's first, sorry for any formatting issues, I'm on mobile and it's my first time posting on reddit. Usually I just kinda lurk and browse lol. This also might be kinda long so bear with me. So here's the deal: I [18f] was talking to my brother a couple days ago [14m] and he was telling me that some rumors were being spread at school that he was supposedly calling some girl in his year a whore. (Not true) Word spread to the girl's boyfriend and he got pissed and began threatening my brother. The last few days this kid has been harassing my brother at school, calling him a pussy and saying he and his friends are going to beat the shit out of my brother. My brother already told him he didn't call this guy's girlfriend a whore but the guy just won't seem to back off. Now, my brother told me all of this in confidence, so I hadn't told my mom or anything. Fast forward to today, my brother tells me 2 cars full of high school seniors were coming to our apartment to fight him. I, very clearly shocked and panicked, text my older sister and inform her of the situation because I was unsure of what I should do. My sister calls the cops and my mom. Cops tell my sister they can't do anything because my older sister isn't physically there. (She was at work.) The kids bothering my brother end up not showing up. My mom however, is still very pissed and worried, rightfully so. 

My mom wants to go behind my brother's back and go to my brother's school tomorrow to talk to his principal. (My brother is very against this.) My mom does not want my brother to go to school for now so he doesnt come into contact with the boy. My mom is also asking me to figure out the boy's name so she can tell the principal about what's going on, who's involved, etc., so theres some sort of antecedant. 

Okay so, here's my issue: Do I tell my mom the kid's name and let my mom go through with going to his school and talking to the principal or should I just let my brother handle it? Usually I would go with the former decision but the guys harassing my brother seem to be very violent, aggressive, and have threatened him saying they're going to bring guns and knives to whatever fight does happen. Also, not sure if this is relevant but the kid in question also has an ongoing court case happening for some other issue of behavioral misconduct/aggression. That being said, if those kids found out my brother ""snitched"" to the principal the beating might be worse. And also there's the issue that I don't want to lose my little brother's trust. Moreover, if they do fight and my brother gets expelled, my mom has made it clear that he'll send my brother away to Mexico to live with my dad. (We live in CA.) So, what to do?

tl;dr: my little brother might get jumped by kids harassing him at school and I can either help my mom by giving her the information needed about what kids are involved so she can tell the principal or I can let my brother handle it. If I help my mom he might be labeled as a snitch and things will get worse for my brother. What to do?

4,"Two years ago I worked in a tech cubicle farm. I was the only woman and became friends with ""the guys"" on my team. We did the traditional coworker hangouts -- happy hours, holiday parties, lunches, smoke breaks. 

I was laid off but managed to keep loosely in touch with a few of the guys. We have a small group chat, and I have side-chats with each of the guys separately for different topics. 

I have always been very attracted to one of the guys. He's 9 years younger than I am, single (divorced), no kids, and he's the hub of the friend group. I had lunch with him and another of the guys a few weeks ago. That lead to me attending a house party at Crush's house on a weekend (which involved drinking and getting stoned (it's legal here.)) And then another. And another. And another.

[One thing to be clear about -- my husband knows of the friendship and I do not lie to him about where I am going or the drinking or the weed. He's knows I might be home super-late.]

Here's my question -- there has been some casual flirting. One night he kept grabbing my socks and flinging them across the room when my feet were on the coffee table. Or he'd grab my toes. This was in a room full of people.

But not much beyond that. 

I fell asleep there a few nights ago and (accidentally, I swear) wore one of his hoodies home.

He texted me the next morning to ask if I'd ""taken off with it"" and said there was no rush to return it. Just bring it ""the next time I come down"".

I'm not sure I want a full-fledged sexual affair. But a make-out session sounds great. 

How do I let him know I'm into him and free (despite my married status) to have a little fun.

A text message? (Examples, pleqse!)
An overt physical signal?

I haven't made a move on anyone in 25 years.

Help!

5,"Throwaway account for anonymity's sake. Sorry for the length of this post but it requires some backstory.
tl:dr at bottom.

We have 5 English bulldogs that fight each other often. These fights they have are very serious and they injure each other often, there are scabs and wounds all around the dogs' legs and faces. The dog fights are incredibly common and happen at least 6 times a day for about half a minute or until someone physically pulls them apart from each other.

We first started out by owning one dog, but she gave birth unexpectedly and we then owned the mother and one female puppy, that puppy grew up and began to fight the mother, it was very rare at this point though.
Some years later we adopted two male puppies, they didn't fight with the other two but the fights started to grow more frequent between the mother and daughter.
A few months ago my mother's coworker needed to get rid of an English bulldog and my mom adopted the new female dog into our family. This dog now initiates most fights and is problematic in general.
We are now at 3 old female and 2 younger male bulldogs in our small house, and the males are starting to join in the fights.

I tried to confront my parents and talk about this huge issue, but they play it off as a joke or not a big deal. 
As for the dogs, we tried discipline, time outs, and even shock collars, but it's like they completely ignore anything and focus on trying to kill each other.
For the record I tried to talk them out of adopting more dogs since we had the first two, but they did not seem to care about my opinion.

It has grown incredibly stressful on me as I am freshly graduated from Highschool and unable to move out due to being unemployed. I have no idea what to do to convince my parents to get rid of a few dogs or how to prevent these fights from happening in the first place.

Anything would be appreciated at this point.

TL:DR - Our five dogs fight a lot and parents won't get rid of any, unable to move out myself because I'm broke.",22Mar2019,1

8,"(I’m a 21 year old female)

I feel like a lot of things that are wrong with our house comes down to my younger brother. 

He is a very messy person, I would say the majority of the mess made in the living room, kitchen and bathroom is made by him. 

He leaves plates and empty packets in the living room, after he makes himself food in the kitchen he will leave it and walk away. 

His room is absolutely disgusting, he is the only one with a severe mold problem because he never bothers to open the window. But that’s in his room so I don’t really care.

Now, trying to fix it is extremely difficult. When it’s time to get everyone to do chores, everyone is willing to do it (22F, 13M siblings) except for him. He will throw a fit, and he is 6’1 and very strong so he tower overs the women, and threatens to beat my little brother.

I’d like to add on top of the cleaning thing, he also over eats, my mom will go grocery shopping on a Thursday, everything will be finished by Saturday morning, when it’s meant to last a week. All eaten by him.

I don’t think it’s fair for any of us to clean up after him constantly. He also doesn’t change his bed sheets unless my mom does it for him, will literally whine for ages until my mom finds him underwear before he takes a shower.

Why doesn’t my mom do anything? She just left my abusive father, and my younger brother does the same thing my dad did to her. He yells at her, makes her feel stupid, aggressively gets up in her face. She broke down one day crying and told me she is scared of him (I don’t blame her, he is a tall, strong adult male) She said she feels like she is reliving her traumatic experiences with my dad. 

What can we do as a family? Specifically my mom. He really is just a person that contributes absolutely nothing to this household, on top of being a mean and aggressive person. 

TL;DR 18 year old brother is lazy, makes the majority of the mess, eats all the food. Doesn’t do anything for himself. Aggressive towards my mom, after she just got out of an abusive marriage. Makes trying to give everyone equal chores a living nightmare. ",22Mar2019,1
9,"I have been job searching for the past 5 months. It depresses me how long its been. I had a couple of interviews in the past, but they didn’t result in anything.
I just got a voicemail for an interview and it’s a location an hour and a half from where I live. It’s also in an area that kind of worries me. I know my anxiety will screw me over and I feel like I just sabotage myself in the end. 

I don’t know. Should I just suck it up and try my best and just do the interview? 

And if I do end up getting the job, just suck it up and hate it like most people do? 

Or is what I’m feeling purely anxiety and I shouldn’t speculate until things come into place? 

Because I know for a fact I will hate it. I would rather be in a different field, but it feels impossible to get into since I don’t have much experience in that field. ",22Mar2019,1

Not to turn into a sob story but growing up my mother used to tell me to stop singing and performing arts will get me no where. She wanted me to be a dental assistant. Up until maybe last year I decided to say fuck it and post a video of me singing. I had so many people telling me they had no idea I had such a great voice and I needed to audition for American Idol etc. Etc. It was all flattering and eye opening but I still have this self doubt that I'm fighting so so hard to get tf over because nothing makes me happier and feel more like what I'm supposed to do in life than singing. But here's my problem, I'm now 21. Have a FANTASTIC guitar player who's talented beyond belief and were writing music together. He's been playing since he was a kid and can instantly come up with a great song and were working on multiple but I'm struggling so hard on melodies and lyrics for a full song. Or vice versa. I wrote an entire song  not too long ago but can't come up with a single melody. I feel like I'm holding him back because we're kind of at a stand still on writing until I finish at least one of our songs. It's so stressful because I have the beginning of everything I want out of my life but no idea where to start with song writing. Or I can write a full poem but it doesn't really fit properly as a song. It's so upsetting because I know deep down I can do great I just am not exactly sure how to go about it. Part of me is upset I didn't admit my love for singing much earlier and start a band much younger because I feel like most people at age 21 who made it big started out much younger. I need help or understanding of what I'm doing.

I live with my sister, her fiance and their baby. I'm two years younger than them. Sometimes I sleep in the baby's room cause it has a twin bed. In the baby's room they have a baby monitor that allows them to see and hear the baby. 

One night I was sleeping in there and I was lying down on my stomach. Around 3:30 I was in a light sleep when I felt something poke my lower back. I didn't move a muscle. I then felt my blanket being slowly pulled down. After the blanket stopped moving my heart started to race and my breathing was rapid. I couldn't move, I was too scared. A hand lightly rested on my mid back for a second and was lifted only to move to my lower back but with less pressure.

I slowly lifted and turned my head to face the person pretending to be half asleep. It was my sisters fiance. He asked me if I heard the baby crying. I shook my head no. He then said 'oh I keep hearing her'.

When he left the room I looked to see how far the blanket was pulled down. The blanket that rested on my back was now past my butt.

I dont know if his intentions were genuine or not. I feel like it is but he had no reason to pull my blanket off, especially since it gets cold in there. He also could've tapped my shoulder or arm to wake me. I have slept in this room many times before and this is the first time he has ever woken me up to ask about the baby.

24,"Recently, my family came home after picking up my little sister (10). Apparently, she lost an earring while showering, which caused her to cry. Dad and mom gave the usual ""It's okay, we can buy you a new one so don't worry about it"" speech. My sister was still crying, and apparently that was unacceptable to my dad. So he then told her to stop crying, which she of course didn't do. Since she didn't stop crying, my dad eventually started angrily telling her to stop crying ""since it isn't a big deal"". So then my sister has to try and hold her crying in.

Soon, they arrive home, where I come into the picture. Sister starts crying again, and dad gets angry again. I get mad at him, since this isn't the first time it's happened and I'm 100% sure he's either caused it or made it worse. Mom fills me in, and I almost go into a rage. My dad has never been an emotionally smart person, and is quite easy at lashing out on even small things. I've gotten used to it and hardened by it, so to me it's no big deal. But I can't stand him lashing out at my sister like that, since she can't handle that heat.

Queue the big argument. He says that she should know better than to cry about an earring, that she should handle her emotions better and need to learn to do so. I counter all of it with that SHE IS TEN and does not possess the emotional maturity for anything he suggested. He is unable to sympathise with her, I try to make him understand. I notice that he clearly feels like he's losing the argument since he points out and gets angry at me swearing. In the end, he somewhat calmed down and the point somewhat got to him. Hopefully, he understood getting angry solves nothing and you can't prevent upset when it's already happened. I know he's a stubborn guy, so I'm sure the lesson won't last long. Is there any way that I could make him understand better? My mom and I think sister fits the traits of HSP (hyper sensitive person) perfectly, but I don't think dad will be receptive to that ""diagnosis""  since he takes most mental health issues as junk from people ""not mentally strong enough"".

We do the labs and even exchange numbers in case we need help later. This is a retake so I'm familiar with the labs. Because of that, I knew how to get things done faster, what the professor (it was a retake with the same professor) wanted, and was the first to move and prepare the next steps as the lab went along. Time went on and we got to the understanding that I'm more softspoken than the other two. Although I'm on the less talkative side I made friendly body language, shared laughs, and made jokes. But at some point, the other two really hit it off. Now, I don't care if those two chat it up, honestly I'm more concerned about passing my retake.

tl;dr   ::    the two are besties and for reasons beyond me Kate is trying to make it a point that I'm dead weight and they are the ones taking the lead in the lab group.

&amp;#x200B;

((((((((((((((((((For example, if I'm weighing something and its 0.002 grams off, Kate will talk me out from just taking that weight and proceeding with the lab when lo and behold, we'll be mixing and adding other substances without measuring them so exact readings didn't matter in the first place (which i KNEW and told her but she keeps repeating ""iTS juSt iN CaSe""). So instead of moving forward, we're 10 minutes behind standing at a scale trying to get a pointless exact reading. Another time, we need 2 more grams of a substance. I say lets get 2 grams and add it to our unused beaker of substances and just add 2 to our recordings. Kate says no. Instead, we need to dump out the beaker and start the fuck over from scratch. So again, we're wasting time at a scale. Kate once reported there was only two people in the three-person-group when I'm literally standing in front of her. Additionally, if we split the lab work up, the other two does NOT come back to give me the data or tell me anything when we regroup even though I tell them what I just measured or make sure they have the necessary information. I also feel like they're watching my every move, waiting for me to fuck up or something. Its annoying, I'm frustrated, and I don't appreciate the ostracizing or downsizing. These are the chapter titles I would give the weeks that ensued: 

Chpt1: I miss getting along and I don't want to make a scene so I'll keep being nice

Chpt 2: you two can do whatever you want so long as it doesn't affect the lab work

Chpt 3: its affecting the lab work. i see you're also throwing shade at me.

Chpt 4: (stfu Kate)

Chpt 5: I want to work alone but that's not allowed

I went from happy and excited &gt;&gt;&gt; feeling unwelcome with less desire to joke and get along &gt;&gt;&gt; feeling criticized and borderline arguing so not wanting to participate &gt;&gt;&gt; and now i'm apparently ""the useless one"" in the group that gets asked ""yOu WaNT tO Do ThIs PaRt?"" the line that someone who's not doing anything gets asked, like lowkey pity invite to participate.))))))))))))))))

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 I tried different methods for weeks but its not working and I'm getting fed up with their bull crap. What attitude should I bring to these two? I would rather give them the sour stare and intentional dead silence, maybe even stand close enough to fog up their eyeballs with my angry breathing, to make every minute of that lab as uncomfortable as possible for the two but I don't want it spiraling into drama later. At the same time, I'm tired of playing friendly with people who are out-casting me. Switching groups is not an option, its a very small class and we're already weeks in so the other groups are already too comfortable with knowing who they're working with.

35,"Hello everyone! 
I'm looking for some advice to help my mom, and our neighbor. 

So we've been living in this building here in NYC for about 5 years now. And since the day we moved in here, we've had so many problems with our apartment. First off, we have no light in our living room. The light in the kitchen doesnt work. And The bathroom leaks into the apartment downstairs, so every few months or so.  

My mom has complained and complained to our landlord and the man has offered no solution. The  landlord came a few times to 'fix' the leak, but he basically got a couple a silicon tubes and just put it everywhere in the bathroom. It looked disgusting, mold started to grow under it. My dad ended up cleaning all of that out, and putting that paste, the silicon, and he fixed the bathroom himself. 

As for the light, my mom put a floor lamp in the living for us to have light. But it looks terrible that the living room always has this dim light.
What makes this particularly infuriating is that  the living room ceiling fan is turned on with a remote control. And there is no remote. Which is why we have to use the lamp. We've been asking for that damn remote ever since we moved in here! He asks like he forgets, and that he doesn't understand. And for our kitchen, the bulb keeps blowing out, it's the same remote controlled ceiling fan thing. The remote doesn't work sometimes, and just recently, in the fan, where one would screw in the buld, threw some sparks! Smoke came out and everything. My mom called the land lord in panic, and they said they'd come to fix it, but of course, they avoid it. 

I'm a bit embarrassed by this next thing, but for the sake of this, I need to share it with you all. Two years ago, the building got INFESTED wkth bedbugs. And the landlord brought in an exterminator, but MY MOM HAD TO PAY FOR THE SERVICES. It was a waste of money since the bigd are still here, to this DAY. And we've been complaining and the landlord tells my mom that we need to pay for the exterminator, again.

Our neighbor has some problems in his apartment too, and he's also addressed them to the landlord, but the landlord also ignored him. 

We're really frustrated. My parents fixed up this apartment so well, fixed the walls, painted and repainted the apartment. Paid that exterminator Fixed the bathroom. All of this came out of the pockets of my parents. 

And the guy has the nerve to raise the rent every year, and he charges my mom a RIDICOLOUS amount for electricity, when we

39,"Boyfriend of almost 2 years has parents who are abusive via negligence to their cat. He is 15, old but healthy. My boyfriend has known that cat since he was a small child, but the second they got their dog (who they've LITERALLY ruined and made dangerous because they've turned him into a monster, and his breed is innately aggressive and needs training he never got) they've been confining their cat to the top floor of their house, never giving him any love, and letting the dog torment the cat into isolation. I as the girlfriend have felt so bad for the cat when I've gone to visit for birthdays and holidays that I sneak water upstairs and cleaned his litter box.

My partner is not in any way opposed to putting the cat down if hes in pain or unhappy. But this cat is sweet and healthy and only wants to be loved. Hes too old to be adopted, and we have a cat who has not reacted well to him in the past when weve tried to socialize them. Adopting him is not an option.

His family is shitty. Period. they are terrible pet owners. They neglect the cat and let the dog do whatever, including post a legitimate danger to others. They bring the cat to the vet every couple of months, even though hes totally healthy, to ""see if its time"". They already rehomed another cat they had for many many years, so now hes even more isolated. He is totally alone, unloved, and basically has owners that are desperate to put him down so they can stop *pretending to* take care of him.

I dont know what I can do to support my boyfriend. This is justifiably infuriating and devastating, especially because we have no options to adopt him. Even if we didnt have a cat opposed to socializing with another animal, he has a history of severe anxiety when he has moved and we dont think he could handle the stress. My partner has offered to spent up to several thousand dollars on medical bills to heal and re home them but they won't let him. 

His parents are pieces of shit and while we both agree on that, obviously he loves them. He just wants the cat to be loved and they wont let him take matters into his own hands and re home this beloved animal. They just want to kill the cat and call it a day, and I dont know how to support him going through this situation.

I've done a vocational training (I'm from Germany) and am officially a mechatronic technician, but the problem is I never really worked in my profession and probably forgot everything I learned. 

I decided to do my A-levels in an evening school which I did pretty well with an average of 1,9.

Afterwards I decided to start studying computer science in an elite university but am still unsure if it is the right thing for me.

I've never really needed to learn anything before but now I'm confronted with a lot of stuff and I handle it pretty bad tbh.

45,"Throwaway because my friends and bf know my username, sorry this might be long.

The title is a tad bit misleading, but let me start off by saying I love my boyfriend dearly. He’s a really a great guy and I love being with him. 

A little backstory: My [F/23] boyfriend’s [M/25] parents went through a very nasty divorce about a year ago. They were forced to sell his childhood home, and his mom moved into his grandmother’s small apartment.

After his parents sold the house, my bf moved in with his older brother and fiancée. BF pays them rent (a small amount, maybe a couple hundred dollars a month) but buys his own groceries, does his own laundry, etc. 

Now, this is my issue. BF talks about how his mom is planning on moving into a larger home because she wants her own place again. He says once she moves, he will live with her. At first he said he is doing it for moral support because of the divorce, but he then revealed he thinks paying rent is stupid. 

If it ever comes up in conversation, he will talk about how rent is throwing away money, a waste, etc. and how he will buy his own place instead. Now, this hurts my feelings because I have been on my own paying rent since college, but that’s a whole separate thing. 

As I mentioned, he says he would rather save up to buy a house, which I understand. However, I know there probably isn’t much saving going on because he always complains about how he needs to actually start saving and he’s so broke. I know for a fact he is making about $80,000 at his job, I don’t see why he can’t set aside enough to move out on his own. For reference, where we are, to live with roommates it would probably be about $500 - $800, or $1200 - $1500 to live alone. 

I think there is some insecurity going on, because a few of his close friends have already bought their own homes. 

Am I being unreasonable? I guess I’ve always been around people who move out of the house after high school and don’t go back. Maybe his situation is normal in some places and I’m just not used to it? 

TL;DR: BF currently lives with his older brother and is planning on moving back in with his mother once she gets a bigger house. He won’t  pay rent because he thinks it’s a waste of money. He says he would rather buy a house, but has put in little to no effort on saving money. ",22Mar2019,3

47,"My grandma has had new neighbors move into the condo below hers a few months ago. My grandma being in her 80s and super sweet, is friends with most of the neighbors and even was with the previous few who lived below her. She had never gotten complaints in the entirety of her living there (easily over 10 years). 
These new neighbors have written to the HOA, outside people and have called the police at around 12:30am one night all to complain about noise. The HOA mostly blew the complaints off as my grandmother is a well established resident and has never caused issues before. The neighbors then tried to bring it up at a meeting and everyone sided with my grandma as some noise is to be expected in a multi-unit building. 
 The last straw was the police call. At the time my grandma was asleep and her older son was awake and watching tv (not loudly I should add).  The police showed up and woke my grandma up as they had a report of “domestic disturbance”.
The neighbors said they heard stomping above them. 
My grandfather recently passed and the complaints have been pouring in since then. I feel terrible for my grandma. This poor woman lost her husband of over 60 years, is trying to get her son back on his feet, and is getting harassed by these neighbor demons.

While I am still the same person I am now much more aware of other people because my hoyfriend is extreamlyyyy introverted and doesn't really like talking to people very much and he especially doesn't like touching them, not even his family I am the only person he has ever liked hugging or saying he loved.

She lives across the ocean in another country, so I've been trying not to get too attached to her.

60,"To start off, I’ll give some background. I have a circle of about 8-9 friends and we get along pretty well most of the time. My friends occasionally tease me because they see me as an “easy target” which I don’t mind, because it’s just teasing and doesn’t really get out of hand, and this pretty much happens to everyone.


This specific friend, I’ll call her Kristie, however, steps past the line of where I’m having fun with casual teases and actual insults and bullying.


Last year, Kristie and I had a bit of spat where we pretty much didn’t talk to each other for a few months. 


We were at lunch, and she was trying to coax me into giving her one of my food items that I can’t remember. My group of friends hadn’t really come together yet (this was last year), so it was only about four of us that sat at that table daily, but I was still friends with everyone currently in our group, we just weren’t all at once. She kept trying to make me give it to her and eventually became aggressive. She started throwing noodles from her soup at me, and I began to get upset and near tears. Occasionally, I read at lunch when we have no exciting things to talk about, so when she threw the noodles at me,  I brought out a book and began to read as like a security blanket.


My friend group is pretty much the definition of “try hard” in school, and we sometimes make fun each other for who is the biggest one, which is often me.


She says something along the lines of, “Oh go and read you little nerd!” At that point one of my other friends speaks ups and says that Kristie is going to make me cry. Kristie then tried to apologize, but I didn’t respond, and I continue reading with tears in my eyes until the next class.


I pretty much don’t speak to her for the next few months until the school year ends, while in the beginning she tries to keep apologizing. It kind of created this weird rift between the four of us that sat at that table because of my refusing to speak to her.


Eventually she gives up on that. Side note, I myself am Asian, and as is a few of my other friends in the group (will be relevant later) (Kristie is white) One friend, Katherine, one of the Asians, didn’t eat lunch with us because she had a different lunch period. Sometimes though, Katherine will eat with us when we have like a half day or a day when the schedules are different. 


About three weeks after this initial incident, she said at lunch, intending for me to hear, “You know what? Next time Katherine sits with, I’m going to tell her to sit by me, (Katherine normally sat next to me on the days she ate with us) and she’ll be my new Asian friend.” 


Obviously, I saw this as extremely offensive because I don’t think people should just go around act as though an Asian friend is a special thing (hard to explain what I mean) but I kept my mouth shut because I wasn’t speaking to her.


Over the summer, we don’t speak to each other of course, but when the new school year begins, I return to talking to her without any explanation because I felt that maybe I should forgive her.


She acts pretty nice at the beginning of the year, until a few months in, where she goes back to her old ways towards me.

Fast forwarding to about three weeks ago, I suffer a mild concussion, where I can’t eat in the cafeteria for a few weeks due to the noise. I instead eat in a teacher’s room. Kristie kept nagging me about it saying I was lying about my symptoms and that I should’ve been better already. She was saying this about a week after the diagnosis when the average recovery time is around three to six weeks. 


Recently I was at a birthday party for one of my friends, and Kristie was also in attendance. The party was at a typical bowling, arcade place. I win a few prizes and later we drive home. While in the car, she takes one of my prizes, those colored balls with hundred of tiny tentacle things on them, that is not sticky, but will stick to hair. She takes it and hits it into my head causing many of my hairs to be pulled out which I later have to pick out of the toy. 


She then takes my head and mock tries to bang it into the seat in front of me saying, “I’m going to give you *A* concussion.” As if pretending that I had never had a concussion insinuating that I was lying about the one I had.”

A few weeks ago, I accidentally spill something small on her at lunch to which I apologized and cleaned it up, despite this, she yells at me for it. Today, another friend spilled something on her and she just shrugged and got some napkins.

She constantly puts me down and bullies me and I’m pretty tired of it; however, I don’t want to create that same awkwardness and rift that was between us and the whole friend group last time I got fed up with her. How can I deal with this and not do that?


I’m so sorry for the SUPER long post, and please direct me to any advice subs if you know any.

61,"I work mowing lawns for one particular non residential property. 

In the past I worked in conservation. I loved it. It was hard work and I was with like minded people and I felt like I was making a difference. I hated weekend. 


I'm depressed working where I am now. I have not had one ""good day at work"". Even working at Subway with an abusiver manager i had good days.

Its really lonely, there is no one to talk to. The only work to be done is mowing the same lawns over and over, even when they don't need mowing. I run out of work by wednesday each week. I've tried finding other work to do but most of the time its just pulling weeds or picking up leaves. Its all aesthetic.

There is no pruning to do, as there are no plants. I cant do planting because it isnt the time of year and when i mentioned it to the boss he didnt seem keen anyway.

Im not being challenged in anyway, and its affecting my work ethic.  I find myself bludging on my phone, and having extended breaks. Ive been caught doing this and i think they definitely arent happy with my work performance. I feel really ashamed, so i work really hard for a few days, even if its just picking up leaves.  But a few days later i start to feel depressed and start to bludge again. There is zero motivation for this job besides trying not to get fired. 

There are two of us. The other person is super quiet but in the few convos we have had he admits there isnt much to do. I see him mowing lawns that literally were mowed yesterday just to look busy. He has the discipline and patience to do this stuff but I really don't :( 

5 out of 7 days of my week are spent really depressed. Then the weekend comes and goes in an instant. I don't want to waste my life spending that much time unhappy.

I want to work somewhere that challenges me, or has some job satisfaction. I want to feel like I'm helping. All I'm doing here is keeping a bunch of lawns nice for people who work inside anyway and never look at them.

I feel really selfish wanting to leave a job when so many people are struggling to get work. But its like that isnt enough motivation for my brain . it's truely getting me down. And i wouldnt be surprised if they fire me anyway some time soon. 

I've tried telling myself all the usual stuff: everyone hates their job, at least I'm getting money, it will look good on resume. 

But I don't think most people hate their job this much. And if they do then i think they are  silly for staying. 
I'm not saving money, I've been spending it on takeout and junk food because I binge eat when I'm depressed. I literally have nothing to show for it so far. 
It won't look good on my resume because they won't give me a good reference. 

I have also thought that I will stay until I find another job, but Im not finding any time to job seek. By the time I get home I am so tired I spend a couple of hours hanging with my rabbit and boyfriend (Im desperate for interaction after a full day of loneliness) and then I sleep.

I really really really want to leave but I feel ashamed and weak for wanting to do so. But I'm scared if i don't leave now I will get fired or I will blow up and have a panic attack at work. 

I feel like a spoilt brat for wanting to leave. 

I'm either a spoilt brat or society has successfully engrained into me job=success and I'm beating myself up for considering leaving. 

I keep feeling like a failure/ loser/weak for wanting to leave. But then get random bursts of ""wtf life is short go do something you love even if you will be poor for a while. Fuck what people think""

Eventually everyone else who followed the leader started dealing with me from a distance. I brought this matter up to them and told them that I am a kind person, and that I do not want to seem as if I am trying to take over the group, but I think that they disregarded everything I said. Recently, I have been experiencing depression and this experience that I was going through made me feel bad. I even told them about how I felt depressed and that led to them estranging me even more. I also did make some mistakes on my end, such as being a bit annoying because I am always hyper, talking, and sometimes a bit cocky (but not too cocky trust me on that).

She initially gave me grunt work to do to ""get my feet wet"" and had me attend a couple courses to help out and see them in action. She was pleasant, but not very giving on details and what goes into preparing these courses. 

9 months, and MANY excuses later, she has yet to share instructor lists, volunteer lists, expiration information, agenda prep, room contracts, etc. Nothing on what goes into setting these up. She keeps all information on her personal drive, and nothing on the department drive for sharing. 

I have expressed my concerns to our boss, and the boss insists they have stressed to her that this training needs to happen, and provided a deadline. After the dead was given, I was actually removed from meetings, uninvited to courses, and she has stopped giving anything. 

She is VERY passive aggressive when I speak to her in general. I am not the only colleague that feels this way or sees the behaviour.

So heres the scoop.

I havent spoken to this guy in over a year. We were really close for a long time, but he never really put in the effort to maintain our friendship that I did.

When he moved to another state we inevitably drifted apart.


Anyways. Well he had this girlfriend and to be honest he was never very good to her either, but he never did so much as cheat on her. Apparently at some point early in their ~4 year relationship she cheated on him. My sister told me this, as she used to be a close friend of hers. 

She went on with their relationship for some time after doing this, and he ended up breaking up with her because he didnt see their relationship as sustainable when he moved away. He also wanted other things. 

A few months after they split he tried to get back with her, and they did go on a few dates but she was seeing other people at the time and he couldnt handle that so he cut things off.

I know the end of their relationship really affected him and he blamed himself and felt like an asshole.

Should I tell him after not speaking to him for over a year? Or just leave it be? 

I dont wanna reopen the wound, but I dont want him to be left feeling how he did.

79,"I am not sure if this is the right place to post but here I go.

I am in a real bad place right now. Since 18 I have been a professional poker player, never had a proper job. This gave me a very good life for a long time, so many trips abroad and never had a care in the world.  

I wasn't too greedy with poker. I could have worked longer and harder and of course saved money but yeah. Back in the day it was like a money tree so I guess I was ok just doing 50-70k a year tax free.

I am from Ireland but I would spend a good few months of the year in the US and it was great. So 11 years or so of just doing what I want; usually it would be grind online for a month then go off on holiday somewhere for a month or just do an extended trip playing live poker at casinos in Vegas/Macau/Barca etc.

Things changed 6 months ago when suddenly I hit the worst run I have ever had. I had about 20k in cash, no debts (only had 1 credit card for travelling but always paid it off in full), and my rent paid for 6 months in advance.

As I write this, my finances are €100 cash, $75 on a poker site, owe €25k in credit cards and loans and my rent and a load of other bills are due in a few days.

My mental health is so poor right now. I am not eating. I have been drinking more (despite being Irish, I would only have the odd drink socially with friends, now its whisky every day). 

I haven't seen my friends or family for a while. I keep having trouble breathing when I'm just at my computer.

I don't know where to turn. I've literally NEVER had a job or claimed any benefit or welfare of any kind. I don't even think I could manage an interview right now, my confidence is non existent.

83,"Hello, I apologize if I’m posting this question in the wrong subreddit. This is something that has been on my mind a good bit for the past several months. As a new user on Reddit that has had fairly good luck with receiving logical answers to previous inquiries, I thought I’d try my luck here too. 
I was in a long-distance relationship for about four months. My s/o broke up with me for reasons that were largely unknown to me, other than they simply did not think it would be practical to continue on with it (which is completely understandable). I was considering breaking up with them myself as I did not foresee a logical continuation to the relationship, but did not have the strength to at the time. I was civil despite receiving the shorter end of the stick and we stopped communicating from there, despite not having any hard feelings toward one another. This occurred late last year. I found it rather odd that, despite the lack of communication as well as the breakup itself, this person continues to be very active on my social media. Their activity on my page has not waned despite the lack of communication for nearly half a year. They have consistently liked all of my posts with both of their accounts (and are often the first to do so), watch every single one of my stories (although that does not bear much significance alone as flipping through stories is rather commonplace), interact with my music suggestion boxes/polls on my stories every time, continue to follow my friends (despite never having met them) and like their posts despite the fact that most of them unfollowed my ex, as well as follow any new accounts that I happen to create on a whim. This person has also liked many posts that I have liked in the very order I liked them within minutes of me liking the very same posts (I assume they use the activity tab to do this; I would not know as I barely use that feature, other than the fact that I have accidentally swiped to it and have caught it at least five times). They also like comments I have left in response to other people’s comments on my spam page. My ex continued to do all of this, even though I never interact with their pages whatsoever. It doesn’t bother me that my ex is active on my pages, in fact it does not provoke any emotions at all rather than simple curiosity. I know I may seem hyper vigilant, but it is impossible for me not to notice as this has been happening for nearly half a year. As someone that’s overly analytical, I’m probably overthinking it. However, I would appreciate any insight as to why this person may be acting this way. I would not deem it as significant if our relationship had been IRL, however our relationship was held strictly to a certain social media platform. That is why it is very noticeable. As an added note, this person has some mutual IRL acquaintances, which they interacted with before they moved to their current residence (my ex and I never actually met in person despite us living very near to each other at one point in time). Additionally, immediately after they had broken up with me, they asked if I was to remain in [insert state here] “forever.” That struck me as rather odd. Anyway, those were two additional tidbits that probably aren’t significant but might play into it a little bit.

This isn’t technically a divorce situation, but... In a strange way, it kind of feels like one?


So, a few months ago, my aunt (mom’s sister) told us that she would be having a birthday party. She really, really wanted us to come, because she hasn’t seen us in maybe five years or so (she lives quite a few states away from us.) My Mom is immediately excited. Mom asks the date, so she can watch the flight tickets to find the best deal possible (because our financial situation is pretty shit) but her excitement is immediately deflated when my aunt tells us it’s the last week of school. The last week of school is absolutely mandatory, due to a few important school events- but my aunt, really really wanting us to come, says she’ll change all the reservations for the party and all the details just for us to come. Problem solved, we can all go, everyone’s happy, end of story.


Yeah, sure.



My dad gets an invitation to a wedding on the same. Exact. Day. Of the birthday party. 


It’s in Canada, for a few of his cousins that I don’t think I’ve ever met or heard about. Apparently, a lot of my dad’s family is going to be there, a few of them friendly and familiar faces for me.



So now my dad is very adamant about me going with him. I’m a little reluctant- I love my dad, but I know if I go on a trip with him alone it’ll be nothing but anger, tears, and awkward silence.  Actually, he wants that both me and my mom go with him and forget the birthday party, but my mom is definitely not agreeing to that. The way their relationships been, my mom would much rather punch a grizzly than take a trip with him, and she would never miss this trip to see her sister in a million years. But my dad says that weddings are once in a lifetime, and that stupid birthday parties happen every year. I should meet my family, she should meet the rest of his family, etc etc. It’s started another war in my house... not that those are uncommon... it’s just that this one feels different. 


Amidst their arguing, they’ve decided they want me to make the choice. I don’t know what to do. If I’m honest, I care little for either event. I’m not really “close” to either side, I love both sides of the family equally... But this feels like I’m choosing which side of the family I care about more. Or- which PARENT I care about more.
I would be more comfortable with my mom, but I know my dad has feelings too. And he’s really not an evil guy, I know this.  He would be hurt if I chose mom over him, and even more hurt if I turned down a “once in a lifetime event.” Because he’s right- a wedding is a once in a lifetime event. No matter who I choose, I will make the other upset. Ugh. I wish I could do both.

Neither of us have talked to anyone else about it and online information is all over the place in terms of consistency. What are out chances of concieving?

90,"I just wanted to make this post for anyone who is disabled, unhappy, unmotivated, broke, drug addicted, and a hopeless romantic who can't get over a broken heart.

On this day 4 years ago I was all those things. Today on the mark of 4 years of sobrity, and a few months into my full time job, all managers are recommending a dollar an hour raise. I have over $2k in total savings and investments after a few months on top of paying my bills and child support, my days off are spent tinkering with my home lab network and keeping up the house. I wake up at 2:30am every day to walk my dogs 3 miles and read the news and do my market things before work at 6am. I don't have to worry about a relationship, just improving my life and trying to undo the damage I did in the past.

Understand this took 4 years of grueling hard work after over 10 years of destruction. You can do it I promise if you put in the work. 

If anyone told me I would be where I am today 4 years ago I would've laughed at them. Just remember that all the horrible things we've been through are only as permanent as you allow them to be. It seems so far away when you're in that state of mind but if you take small steps each day you'll get there.

Every day, every hour (sometimes two hours), their smoke will start seeping into my apartment. This happens through the sides of the door that aren't properly sealed, near the door frame. How can I seal these parts of the door and create something like an ""Air Proof"" door?

94,"I have three roommates, two of whom presently live in my apartment with me. One spends most nights at her boyfriend’s place and the other one is basically only at the apartment to sleep and is never home on the weekends. The third roommate could not register for classes this semester, so she’s living at home this semester. 
I asked my two roommates if I could bring my family dog home for the end of the semester (March 10-May 4) and they said yes, so long as I am responsible for him. My family has not been doing so well with the deterioration of my grandma’s dementia (I live with my mother, grandmother, and sister back home.) I believe I have been responsible but we have had three disagreements over the last two weeks. 
The first disagreement was on a day where I typically am gone from 12pm-9:30pm. This was two days after I brought him back to college. I asked if any of them would be able to feed and let him out as I usually go straight from class to work; I gave them the option to say no. Not only were they home and not willing to do so, I received a long text about how the dog is my responsibility and I need to take better care of him. So, I was late to work after my classes that day to let him out and feed him but my boss was understanding. 
The second disagreement was only between one roommate and I. My dog would leave kibble on the floor after his meals and my roommate was upset that he would leave it everywhere. I told her I would clean it up later that night as he still likes to nibble on it. She was fine with this. Three hours later, I receive a text from her while at a bar with my friends saying that the kibble was a distraction and should’ve been cleaned up before I left to go out. I told her I’d clean it up when I got home, but that was not good enough. She said “it’s piling up in the corners. He should just learn to eat it in his bowl.” I asked her why the understanding has changed and if she had any pointers for training. I cleaned it up later that night, talked to my mom about a solution, and there haven’t been any problems with kibble since the following day. 
The third incident was today. I received a text from my roommate who confronted me about the kibble that my dog had peed on her rug in the living room today. I told her I was already at the store and I would buy some cleaning supplies and clean it when I got home. This also was not good enough. She claimed that the apartment was so messy that it stressed her out and she didn’t even like coming home to it and there was a bright yellow stain on her rug. I cleaned it up off the rug and it turns out the stain was already there, but there was still pee on it from my dog. I reminded her of my situation and said that her frustration being taken out on me was really stressing me out. (I believe this frustration is from her mental health issues and her manipulative boyfriend, but that’s another story.) 
While I was at my friends’ house he apparently had another accident and pooped in the living room. This is the first day he has had any type of accident. This evening at my friends’ house, I received another long text from my other roommate, this time saying that they want him out ASAP. Their reasoning is that I deceived them (I was straightforward about my dog), that I have not been taking care of my dog (which I believe I have been), and that I’m stressing them out. I talked to my friends and we have come to the consensus that he’s still adjusting. 
Who’s in the right here? Am I not doing well at taking care of my dog? What should I do?
TL;DR: Roommates want my dog out after I asked for them to help with feeding and walking one evening, he left some kibble on the floor for a few days, and he had one accident in the living room. ",22Mar2019,0

96,"His dad went to an uber selective college that's recently been in the news. He got my friend an interview with a dean of the school and donated some money, and now my friend goes to that school. I was frustrated because I know  that my friend couldn't have gotten in without their dad pulling out all the stops for them. 

I eventually figured that where you go to college doesn't really matter in the long run. I've been building up my resume with jobs and extracurriculars, and I earned a cool internship for this summer that I feel great about. 

But today, I felt resentful again. My friend has been applying for internships with no luck because he's never had a job before. He just sent me a screenshot of a message that his dad emailed to a connection of his. It was titled ""asking for a favor,"" and it asked the friend to see if there was an internship for his son. 

I  understand that if I was a parent with that kind of means, I'd do anything to help my kid. I also recognize that I have certain privileges that I'm grateful for, and that other people might think are unfair.

Clothes, handprints, pictures, charms/necklaces in their remembrance... It’s a lot. It’s a lot for anyone to process who has never been in this situation. 

She is a photographer and recently posted a photo of her child’s urn in a field of bluebonnets (we live in texas), and she went on to write this paragraph about how this isn’t how she pictured her sons bluebonnet photos, and how they will always be in every family picture...

112,"I’m new to Reddit so idk if this story belongs in this sub so please let me know, thank you. Also this is a long story but I want to paint the picture as best as I can. 

Backstory: I’m a high school senior and this year I had music class with a friend. We’ve talked since my junior year but never really hung out or got to know each better other until we had the class together. This story is currently happening so I will update when new things pop up. 

Cast:

Me- me

F- My friend (male)

Gf- My friend’s girlfriend

Bf- best friend

Ff- My friend’s friend


So in the beginning of the year me and f are walking down the hallway after class like we usually do. All of a sudden a girl comes up to him and hugs him. They start talking in Korean (both f an gf are Korean, f transferred to my school from Korea). I’m currently learning Korean but I’m a beginner so obviously I’m confused. F looks at me

F: oh this is my girlfriend 

Me: what? You never told me you had a girlfriend. 

I recognized her. I like k-pop and my school has a k-pop club. Their first meeting of the year happened the day before this. So I said hi and we shook hands then I left to go to my next class. Nothing happened after that. 

Skip to December and that’s when things take a turn. So gf usually posted about f on Instagram so it was obvious when things weren’t doing so well in the relationship. One day (because I’m nosy) I look at her account and see that all of her pictures of f are gone. I assume they had broken up. Two days later f tells me that they broke up (I had to act like I didn’t know already lol). I thought nothing of it after until about 2 weeks later. My school had a festival and gf was in it as well as me. I tried to tag her on my post about it but I couldn’t find her account. At first I thought that she changed her username so I just brushed it off and didn’t tag her. But then one of my friends posted their festival pictures and had her tagged. And guess what: her username was the same. I began to do some snooping and came to the conclusion she had blocked me. I talked to a few of my friends about it and they suggested I tell f. So two days later I told f and this is how the conversation went

Me: hey f I wanted to let you know that your ex blocked me on Instagram

F: what? Why?

Me: idk, I’m not mad or anything (I was) but I just wanted to let you know

F: oh, well she isn’t my ex anymore, we got back together

Before I could say anything he went up the stairs to go to his class. I rush to my next class and immediately check Instagram and surprise to see that I am no longer blocked by gf. I know this because we both followed each other and it said Follow instead of Following. I’m pissed at that point, I decide not to follow her again and just go about my day. January comes and f is graduating (my school let’s you graduate early if you meet all the graduation requirements, so he is currently not in school rn). February rolls around and I go to k-pop club. I didn’t go at all between November and January because I was busy with another club I’m more dedicated to. Gf is there (forgot to mention she’s a board member of k-pop club, the secretary or treasurer idk). The next day I’m sick and I stay home. Again, because I’m nosy I go to look up her account and guess what: IM BLOCKED AGAIN. I have 5 accounts in total and 4 of them were blocked (the last one is a private spam only for close friends). Not only that, she blocked my best friend too (her and f only talked to each other maximum twice. Bf and gf never followed each other either so like ???). I’m LIVID and this has been the root of my beef with this girl. We barely talked but I had been nothing but nice to her and she doesn’t like me because I’m close friends with her boyfriend. I’m sorry but that’s toxic and shows signs of insecurity as well. 

So what’s been going on recently happened a few days ago. The k-pop club had a festival every year and this year I decided to audition with my friends. And guess who shows up: F and his friend (he’s my friend too). They were there to audition too for rapping (they aren’t that bad actually). Our group’s were done so me, f, ff, and my other friend were sitting in my school’s little courtyard (the door to which is near the club room). We’re talking and everything till f gets up and goes to to the door. My back was to the door so I sit on his spot and look up to see that gf was standing there and he was talking to her. She looked annoyed/pissed. I observe this but I go back to taking to ff. A little later me and ff walk back to the club room and I see gf and f doing some pda. But omg this was TOO much pda. She was all over him: kissing, hugging, holding hands, some more kissing and hugging. She looked like she was the one enforcing it the most. Ew. This got me so annoyed, I couldn’t speak to f or anything the rest of the meeting because she’d always be around and lowkey giving me looks. I said bye to f and left a while later. 

I will update if anything else pops up. Thoughts? Advice? Please let me know if I’m in the right sub, thanks. ",22Mar2019,1
113,"So I have this highly specific and really weird fear: one day, when I get married, I won't have anyone to ask to be a bridesmaid. Let alone a maid of honor.

I had a couple of close friends in high school and college. One I'm still in contact with, even though she moved. One I want to reconnect with, although she's moved too. One wants nothing to do with me. One I would like to contact, but is unresponsive on FB and has changed numbers since high school. 

I have some girls at work that I talk stuff out with on a regular basis, but I feel like for the most part that's because we work together. They all have other friends, and if i got another job and tried to stay in contact, I'd be the only one putting effort in.

115,"This is a really long story so i’m going to try and condense it as much as possible. I told a good friend of mine i liked him a month ago. Feelings weren’t reciprocated and as heartbroken as i was we stayed friends. There was a little bit of drama that came with it but within a week later it was in the past and we were able to joke around about it. Cut to last weekend we saw each other at two parties (first time seeing each other since my confession of feelings) . Usually at these parties because of my feelings i would be all over him but now since everything was out there and i’ve been moving on i decided to give him more space. He took this as me acting weird. So when he was really drunk he told me that I’m acting weird and “i hate him because he doesn’t like me”. This pissed me off because i found that insensitive and we got into a fight and after half an hour of this i left the party. Texted him that night and we talked it out through the night and the next day and agreed to put it in the past and stay friends. We talked a little bit the day after that but none at all the past few days. I should probably add we met last May and have spoken everyday since then except for well these past few days. I really value his friendship a lot and he means a lot to me but i cant tell if its the same on his end. I don’t know if he’s always waiting for me to talk to him first because I was the one with feelings and he might feel awkward to initiate conversations with me thinking i’m not over him and could catch feelings again? He also always says he doesn’t want anything to be weird or awkward but it doesn’t seem like he’s trying to help that at all? Also i did approach him several times at these parties and tried talking to him and it didn’t seem like he was really trying at all. I can’t blame him for feeling weird because it isn’t really the best situation, but i just feel like he could make more of an effort as well? Which i have told him before but he usually ignores that part of my texts. I should probably add that he is 3 years older than me and we met through my cousin who is one of his best friends. Also, when i confessed feelings he told me he never really saw me as anything other than his friends little cousin. The reason i told him i liked him in the first place was because i was led on pretty bad and anyone who knew us had thought at one point or another that something more than friends was going on. I’m not sure if i should text him trying to talk to him and save our friendship. I’m afraid if i never say anything he will let it die out. ",22Mar2019,1

117,"To elaborate, I’m an 18 year old male. Throughout my life, I’ve had maybe one or two interactions with women outside of school context (still in high school). If it’s online, I have no issue communicating with them, most likely due to the fact that it’s behind a screen reducing the pressure on myself. However, the same is not the same in real life, or however it should be stated. 

I think this is where most of my anxiety stems from- the lack of interaction with people of the opposite gender. As a direct result of this, when it comes to a girl that I have a crush on, which can be rather frequent, I get extremely anxious, embarrassed or nervous about it, and while I can still presumably mask how I truly feel, I can never put forth the courage needed to make a move. 

Another part of what I’m assuming is an origin of this, or maybe a result thereof, is that I assume many things, the hypotheticals which are unlikely to happen. Such hypotheticals include mostly the fear of being rejected and mocked, or “shamed” for liking someone I guess. As stated, it’s probably unlikely for it to happen, but because of this fear I am essentially unable to do anything more towards a woman than just talking to them occasionally, which would be hard to consider them as a friend at that point.

I have OCD, or Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. I’ve had it all my life, and I remember noticing it in my life since age 5 or 6. I’m sure most of you think of OCD as, “he probably needs everything to be in order”, or “he probably keeps everything super organized.” That’s not how my OCD is. I could care less about how organized or nice things are, mine is focused primarily on how clean things are, and is germ orientated. Every time I touch something I think is dirty I have to scrub my hands, and clean whatever was dirty. If it’s too dirty, I cannot really clean it. There is too much of a risk of it touching me and my body getting contaminated or it spreading. I will clean it If I can, and If I use it or need it for something, for example, a contaminated chair that I have in my house, I would clean. If it’s a dirty doorknob in public, I wouldn’t clean it. I would just wash my hands after. 

Back in middle school, my family car pooled with another family that went to the same school that I did, because the school was kind of far away, and it just made life easier. The mom that drove the car, and the child that went to the school with me, I immediately saw them and their car as contaminated. Whenever the child rode with us, she would pick her nose and proceed to touch the door or seatbelt, and she just smelled gross. The mom’s car was disgusting, stuff was everywhere, they had a baby that sometimes slobbered on me, the girl was there, it was just gross. Over to coarse of middle school, and even High school, the germs slowly spread across the house, different areas of my parents car, stuff was getting contaminated. One of the most contaminated things is a jacket (I obviously never wear it anymore) that has the germs all over it. I wore it in their car a lot to kind of touch the car for me so I didn’t have to scrub as hard while in the shower when I got home. I’ve had this jacket sitting on my closet door for years, and why i didn’t dispose of it is beyond me. It doesn’t even fit me. 

I’m in college currently, and while I was away my dad had some carpet guys come in and they removed all of the carpet from the 2nd floor. I was fine with this. I didn’t have any problem with this when my dad told me, I was fine with my dad and the movers moving my bed and dresser etc. out of my room so they could change the carpet, I was totally okay with it. The 2 things they HAD to move around though and touch were my 2 hats, and the contaminated jacket. They had placed the jacket on a hook over the 2 hats. 

Obviously this is not their fault whatsoever. They didn’t know, and to someone without OCD this is fine. I’m just mad because I really wanted to bring those 2 hats with me to college, they are my favorite ones and I’ve had them for a long time now. They are 20$ each, and I only have 1 other hat at college that I am wearing a little too much. 

My mom and dad just got divorced, and I know they are tight on money,and  like I said I’m in college so I’m tight on money. My dad offered to buy me new ones cause he understands my situation, but I just can’t take his money. I’m kind of devastated. I had 2 of my favorites hats be completely ruined that I can’t wear ever again. I can’t wash them either because they are too contaminated. 

What do I do?

I love to keep things tidy, clear and ordend in my life. It helps me keep my mind clear and feel in control of my own life which I find to be very enjoyable and rewarding. I if I may say so, I am actually a bit proud of myself how well I have been able to do this living on my own for the first time. 

HOWEVER, when it comes to finance my brain feels like it cannot comprehend. As long as I can remeber, no matter how much I learn and inform myself, financial stuff seems unbelievably abstract to me. 

The whole concept of banking, aswell ass the enormous amounts of people working banks of which I have little to no clue to what they are doing, is hard for me to make sense of. 

Also the way of knowing how to go about financial things like doing taxes, investing, trading etc. Are extremely unlogical to me. It makes my brain hurt and feel frustrated. I am always only left with the question how people can cope with the finacial world like it is something simple and easy.

I would love to know how to understand and see the bigger picture, so simple tasks like personal finance becomes more easy to handle. 

Untill this piont in my life I have not needed, and mostly avoided finacial stuff, but I would love to learn,! I would like to start my own business and kickstarters one day.

127,"Hi,
(Sorry for my English, it's not my native language and I'm writing this still shocked what I've seen)

my story is going to be a bit long, but please take time to read it all as it may include some possible tips what may be happening. 

I have a cousin. He's one year older than me. He comes from a rather abusive family. His mother drinks. He was brought up by his grandparents who have unfortunately died. 
We've grown up together, spent every weekend at my house having fun outside. We used to make some youtube gaming channels and try to gain subscribers. He used to be a fun-type person, always partying, drinking and smoking weed. This lasted few years until he actually began getting recognised. He started to earn some big money (at least for a 16 year old, $1000 a month with no real bills to pay). Our friendship vanished, we got into few arguments and we lost contact. My only possibility to get any info about him was through his youtube channel. I saw he met a girl on youtube.  Eventually he moved to her city and they made a relationship. The thing is, this girl was suspicious from the beginning. Very manipulative type, obsessed about him. He tried to break up with her and it used to make her try to commit a suicide. So, he decided to stay with her so she's safe. They moved back to my city and decided to rent an apartment. She found a job at a local grocery store and he was working on his youtube channel. Things got quiet for few months. Now it's 2019, I'm 19 and he's 20. And here's were the things start going very weird and disturbing. Suddenly, a song gets uploaded to his channel. I check it out and completely didn't know what to feel about that. Just sobbing to microphone about making mistakes and how he will change. The other day a second song gets uploaded titled ""changes"". As you may think, about making changes about himself. Today I woke up and at 7:00am his girlfriend starts texting me (she hated me all that time because as I said before, we got into a few arguments with my cousin) ""please come to our house, XYZ has some issues"". She started to ask everyone to come to their house. She even called my mother to invite her (it was 3pm she was at her workplace). During the day me and couple of other random people thought that maybe she gives him some kind of pills as she prepares the dinner. In the evening I decided to give him a call. They sounded like fucking psychos and didn't know what was going around them. I used to take acid with my friends and abuse it a bit (like 600uq) and didn't hear anything that fucked up, and trust me, people on 600uq are totally out of this world. She totally wanted me to come there. I proposed that if she is so desperate, order a cab and come over to my place. Please note that we live on the totally opposite sides of the city so it was very far for me to come using public transport. Eventually they accepted to get a cab and began to come over. I called them a few times more and here's were things start to get very weird. He was using his loud speaker during the call and repeating everything his girlfriend said. If not, he was saying that if I stopped using drugs we should make ourselves a new path of life, everyone who's listening right now. I asked him, who other than me and you can be listening? He said that he doesn't remember a thing and that some people were coming to his house during the day (I think friends though). I asked him if he has taken anything or if he has made his food on his own, he replied 'we only took some to get relax' and was generally lost in his mind. She then texted me that he wanted to kill her and himself and that he was abusing her for 2 years. Let me mention that she's also from an abusive family. They took their dog, a guitar and lots of completely useless items. After some time they come and it's not the same person I remember. He didn't know what was going on. Didn't know what he did take with him, where he was or so. She has taken out about $300 from his account and decided to buy $100 of weed right now. Then he destroyed her guitar. We gave them some of the weed they have bought because they were not capable of holding it. We thought that it may chill them out and make sleepy. After that she said that my cousin smoked 5g of weed and she did too last night. He always had strange dealers, maybe it was spice? My cousin said he doesnt remember when he last slept, ate or drank anything. We moved to a petrol station to get something to drink. She asked about his PIN number using the argument that if he trusts her she needs to do it. He did give it to her. She acted as his guide, he wasn't capable of doing anything. Then she payed $30 for useless items on the petrol station, 3 usb cables, couple of monster energy drinks and lots of knoppers. She called a cab just to cancel it and pay the driver $5 (its like a big mac set with fries and coke in my country). Then she got home. From that place she started texting me things. Sent me a video of them growing weed at their place, which made me cancel my idea to call an ambulance as I am going to be seen by my family as a traitor who made his mother be in pain. She started sending me videos of my cousing just starring blank on the wall and her talking to him about his dead grandparents. Besides she said that life's a dream, they will adopt 2 more dogs, get married and that my cousin is having issues with his mind. 

(At the end I would like to add that she also wasn't 'sober' and acted like a legit crazy)

I'm completely lost, don't know what to do and extremely worried.

128,"Disclaimer: I know Reddit is no replacement for therapy, and I see a therapist currently.

I've done things in my life that I know, objectively, I should be proud of.  I've overcome a lot of obstacles, I've accomplished a lot for myself considering what I've been through.  I don't think I'm a bad person, but I just feel so indifferent to the things I've done.  It makes me more ambitious , I guess, because I keep trying to do things that I know I should be proud of, in hopes that I could finally be proud of myself.  

When I was growing up, both my parents were emotionally distant and didn't really express any pride for the things I've done.  I infrequently heard the words ""good job"", especially from my dad.  They weren't....*not* proud of me.  They just never expressed it.  They expected me, as a child, to be proud of myself.  Maybe some kids have that hard wired into their brain, but I definitely didn't.

I'm a 23 year old woman and I  recognize that I can't blame my parents for my attitudes as an adult if I have control over them, and I would like to help myself.  I'm between therapy appointments at the moment, so I'm taking to reddit to get some advice.

tldr; I'm not proud of myself even though I know I should be.  I can recognize the things I've done as being worthy of pride but I'm indifferent.  What are some self-talk or other techniques I can use to overcome this?

131,"for a little bit of context my dogs are protective when it comes to our home (we live out in the country). I was inside when the incident was began but from what my sister told me, her and my mom were going to go out on a walk so they opened the gate but still hadn’t left. Two unfamiliar girls came near our home on a golf cart with a big dog following behind them. My sister said that they saw our tiniest dog and was coming near by to pet it and the dog followed. Our tiniest dog barked when the dog was near her and that’s when hell broke loose. 2 of our other dogs rushed out and started to fight the dog (mostly yipping at it’s paws since they’re pretty small themselves). The girls drove away and left their dog to fend for itself. This is when my mom started yelling for my dad and I followed him. Our oldest and biggest dog also went out to fight (who was the same height of the new dog) and then we all started to get our dogs away and getting fight to stop.

132,"This has been something bothering me for the past couple weeks like crazy. I've literally been sick. I'm currently in a relationship with a great girl for 2 years. She's an amazing person, I believe that with all my heart. After our two years it's kinda expected for us to start thinking about marriage. I just have no idea what so ever if I'm ready. I've actually told her that I'm scared to get married and it really upset her. So I guess I've been lying to her now that I want to marry her. It's not that I don't want to, I'm just not sure if I want to marry anyone. I want to live my own life for a little bit. I guess I don't like spending that much time with anyone. We are both in college but different colleges. So we do only see each other on weekends. I haven't made any friends in college. I have four from high school that I hang out with, but I don't even see them that much and I'm happy. I also have a friend that's two hours away but we stay in contact and work together on projects. He's probably my only real friend, but I honestly don't want others. I like to constantly learn and work on myself, I am worried it's a problem. Anyway her and I get along great. I would do anything for her and she would do anything for me. We don't really fight, but I feel like I'm not very nice to her. It's not like I'm mean but it's like I neglect her. I'm never board and I always have stuff to work on. But she doesn't really have anything see likes to do. If she's done with school she just wants to hang out. I guess what really scared me was I said when we got married I would like an hour to myself every day to work on some projects. She didn't like this at all. She started saying how other people she knew would never allow this. (I also wanted an hour for the gym but she could tag along). But I guess it really scared me. When I work on stuff I kinda like to be alone. I wanted to start a business with my friend and I'd being working full time so nights would be the only time to work. Anyway things that are already affecting me is I like to go to bed pretty early 9:30ish, but she does work until 9 nights so it's more like 11:00 when I go to bed. We talk on the phone for a few hours usually. I just don't feel as good when I go to bed late. This is completely out of her control. She also doesn't really like going to bed early. Even though once she said she did and yelled at me because we were up so late. I mean I would be fine 30 minute or no phone calls. So it's kinda me, I don't really need people as much either. I know I would get depressed if I had no one, I'm not obvious to this fact. But I can go a few days without people. I usually just talk to her like all week and it's plenty for me. Before her I spent 90% of my time alone. Like it was kinda awesome, I never had a girlfriend though so I thought I was weird and couldn't get one. I hooked up with a few girls and that wasn't bad. I'm afraid the grass is greener on the other side though. When I was single I knew I actually wrote it down that I wouldn't want a girl who was needed or needed me a lot, but I also wanted a girlfriend(thought I would be happy forever then). I used to journal every night and my thoughts aren't much different now then they were then. I guess another thing is I don't have any space I feel like. She read my journal. I told her she could if she really wanted to. That's okay, but now I feel like only a spot in my head is where I can feel things and think. She is an awesome person truly, people think so too. I'm also started to lose my hair which makes me feel like my time is limited to find a girl. One thing that might actually be the answer to this is if she broke up with me I think I would be okay. I guess I'm okay because the decision is off the table. I'm just so torn between staying with her forever or leaving now. I just have no one to talk to about this.

Hi,

I'm a male teen in middle school and I'm having some issues.

Background: I'm in the school drama club, I have a few extremely good friends, but this isn't about them.

I'm stuck between a couple of friend groups that are a mix of my good friends and the drama kids. I have one great person that I hang out with a lot, yet the people that he likes to spend time with seem to kind of either pretend to not notice me or sometimes just kind of include-yet-not-include me in things like parties and ""hangouts"".

On the other hand there's the drama kids, that seem to like me sometimes, and I can hitch a ride with some of them, sometimes do something fun together occasionally, but yet I feel unappreciated. People won't talk to me voluntarily. They engage in conversation if I speak first, since I am a very social person and so are they. But since they are social people, I feel a little hurt when I'm not considered for conversation amongst the other drama kids.

The one friend I mentioned earlier comes to my house a lot, and I go to his often, and we play video games and generally just have fun. But I feel like sometimes when it comes to his other friends (which I also know very well at this point and we get along,) don't think of me first for invitations etc.

Now I'm not trying to get attention or get invited to every party or be the self-conscious teenager with anxiety that literally every body else is, because I'm not. I have lots of self-confidence and I get along with people. Yet I feel like it's not that I'm being pushed away, but sometimes I just need to *insert* myself into something in order to be thought of.

On social media, people post pictures of drama club rehearsal and backstage fun, but I'm not included, not even in my fellow stage managers, although I know that they do have pictures of me.

I'm an artist, and I design the drama club's poster. Today, the producer of the play passed out posters. It was great. Everyone congratulated me, they said the poster was amazing and thanked me. But I didn't feel like I was present, I was just that one guy that created the poster, and people look for me when they absolutely need me.

I'm not that one guy that everyone avoids at school for being weird, or someone that wants the spotlight all the time. I just want to be considered.

I thought that taking a break from the pretty rigorous academic sequence I was in the middle of would help me figure out what I was truly interested in and what majors/careers I should be pursuing in college.  However, after a few semesters, I realized I didn't give a flying you-know-what about what I was studying, and developed an intense hatred for the constant conversations about grades and internships that everyone around me was having.  That's not to say that I no longer cared about academics - I just had a different perspective on what was worth getting stressed about because of my experiences on my gap year.  I also got the feeling that the school cared so much about its reputation as an ""elite university"" and made certain much harder than they needed to be by requiring that you take difficult classes only tangentially related to the major itself. 

So, I decided to transfer.  I found a school with what I thought was the perfect program to combine my passions and ambitions and bingo-bango-bongo, I left my first school in the middle of the year (it didn't make sense for me to pay for a whole semester to take classes that wouldn't help me at my new school).  I visited, applied, got accepted, and have been spending my time getting everything together to smooth the transfer process.

Now, a few months out, I'm realizing I may have done everything for the wrong reasons.  I left the only girl I've ever loved, a ton of friends that care about me and value me, and an incredibly open and accepting social environment, and for what? To make some rebellious statement about the competitive culture at the school that no one heard or cared about? Was there really no major for me there? Or was I just trying to get attention by making such dramatic decision? Now that I can take a step back, I honestly think I was just scared of taking hard classes and wanted the easiest path through college. I convinced myself I was genuinely unhappy and told myself whatever I needed to hear to justify leaving, no matter the consequences.

But then I consider other reasons why I left.  I do think a lot of the people I was around were immature and had screwed-up priorities, but I think my new school could be even worse with that.  Plus, it's college.  That's what people are like.  Also, everyone seemed so up their own rear end about being at this top school and being ""so smart"", I got exhausted and wanted somewhere a little more down-to-earth.  I just don't know if I found the right place.

There is a chance I could apply for readmission to my old school, as I've found a major that I could really see myself getting invested in, but is that just me telling myself whatever I need to hear again to keep from starting over?  Am I making excuses to try and get back with my friends and girlfriend? Or is this what I really need to do?  I know you can't answer these questions for me, but I don't know which of my thoughts are genuine and which I'm fabricating to justify my decisions.

I realize this is a pretty specific circumstance, and I'm not expecting any feedback, but any advice from anyone who's gone through something similar would be appreciated. 

I just don't want to feel like every day is pointless anymore.",22Mar2019,5
143,"Within the last few months, I have come to the realization that it is time to make a very drastic change in my life and move away from my lovely state of Illinois. This has come after living and breathing the small town midwestern lifestyle for my entire life and absolutely coming to resent it. This is especially true during the winter times where everything in the area turns lifeless, cold, and gray for months on end. The grass, the trees, the people. I don't know why anyone would actively choose to continue living here with its lack of stimulating scenery, lifestyle, and topography. I have had serious bouts of depression throughout the previous winters living here and this winter hit me incredibly hard. To be frank about it, I don't think I can make it through another year stuck in this place.

&amp;#x200B;

With that being said, I need help. Serious help. I have been obsessing for the last month about where exactly I want to move to in this beautiful country and....well I have gotten almost nowhere meaningful.

&amp;#x200B;

Some Stats About Me:

\-**22M**

**-Able to afford up to \~950/month for apartment (Just me and the cat so 1BR or Studio is ideal)**

**-Hates long cold winters**

**-Physically distressed by the sight of cornfields**

**-Major outdoor enthusiast**

**-Curious about city life**

**-Prefers commuting by bicycle whenever possible but does own car.**

 

Here's my list of top qualities contenders so far and their biggest draws and flaws as I see them:

\-**Colorado Springs, CO**

**Draw**: Outdoor person's paradise/Cheap Cost-of-Living   **Flaw**: Cold Midwest winters as usual

\-**Denver, CO**

**Draw**: City Living/Fairly Outdoorsy    **Flaw**: Cold Winters/High Cost-of-Living

\-**Tampa, FL**

**Draw**: Great Weather/Cheap(ish) Cost-of-Living   **Flaw**: Hurricanes might destroy my house in the future/Not Bike   
Friendly

\-**Austin, TX**

**Draw**: No Winter Weather!/City Living    **Flaw**: Not Very Outdoorsy/ Apparently very hot/humid in the summers

\-**Los Angeles, CA (Thrown in as a pipe dream)**

**Draw:** Great Weather, City Living    **Flaw:** Wildly prohibitive Cost-of-Living

 It seems that everywhere that I have looked to as a possibility has had at least one major downside. I totally get that these draws and flaws are not all on equal footing and even from writing this, I have helped myself getting a bit of a better understanding of what exactly is keeping me from making a decision.

I'm looking for advice from any redditors who have lived in the cities mentioned above. What was/is your experience in your city and do you think it would be a good match for me? Are there any misconceptions about your city that I may have gotten wrong? Also, if you live in a city that I didn't mention but think it should make my list, please let me know! I'm really open here folks and I have a few more weeks to really nail down a destination so please any advice you can spare would be MUCH appreciated. Thanks!!!",22Mar2019,2

145,"So I (17 M in Illinois) have basically been in total panic mode for awhile after realizing the full gravity of what I did six months ago. Anonymously, using an app called kik, with a few other people, I traded a few images (maybe around ten images) of random teen girls that someone else anonymously sent me. 

At the time I believed I had some sort of legal immunity since I was also legally a minor and teens trade nudes all the time. Then I realized that I'm stupid and this isn't the case AT ALL, and since it is almost certain these people were across state lines, the FBI will get involved if anyone does. This would be very unlikely to even happen but as long as it's a possibility I can't stop thinking about it.

I did a lot of research since then and I found that I might only face a misdemeanor charge since Illinois law classes a minor distributing pornography of another minor as a misdemeanor. But since I'm 17 and only a few months below age of majority, and these girls might have been a few years younger than me, hell maybe in fucking middle school, could they just say ""fuck it, slap him with CP charges?""

And since it was almost certainly across state lines, I might face federal child pornography charges. If that happens I'm just committing suicide. The guilt and anxiety is already torturing me despite talking with a therapist regularly and I couldn't handle being hated by all of society for the rest of my life. All I want is to be as law abiding as possible for the rest of my life and be normal and go to school and hang out with friends but it's probably too late at this point. I probably destroyed my life and it's only a matter of time at this point.

I haven't looked at any pornography like this in six months (and have no urge to, it disgusts me now) and plan on fully cooperating with authorities if they ever arrive. I have also never been convicted of anything. I thought about just confessing to local police but I've already gotten rid of any evidence I could have. The only evidence that exists is on other people's phones somewhere but could definitely be traced back to me.

Also, I think most of these images did not show breasts or genitals, but I'm not sure about that and I want to know what the charges will be if they did anyway. Just assume they did. Nothing incredibly explicit or extreme but definitely child pornography all the same, I don't want to minimize it either. Don't sugar coat it, I want to know the full extent of what I could face.

Thank you so, so much to anyone who takes the time to read and answer this. I know I probably don't deserve help but I need it.",22Mar2019,1

The dilemma I’m facing is that I was raped many times by one of my cousins when I was 6 years old. I’m not going to go into much detail about what happened as it was a very traumatizing event and it tore apart my family. I told my parents and they told his parents. His parents didn’t believe that he raped me. And thus our families have been split apart. I have not seen him nor his family in 10+ years and the thought of being in the same room as him again and seeing him in person sends chills down my spine. I am now an adult [22M] and some of me feels like I need to face my fear. 

I initially responded that I was not going to go but now my aunt who’s coordinating the event tried convincing me to go telling me I’m going to be “safe” and how there’s 50+ people there so it’s like I won’t even notice him (which I think is bs) On top of that she says it’s a “duty” to go. She even said that she wants to take one last family photo with everyone in it but that’s the last thing I want to do is have a photo with the cousin that raped me. She says that I need to face my fear and free myself from chains as it’s not good to avoid going places just because one person is there. I feel like she’s being selfish and not understanding where I’m coming from. 

My dad says I need to toughen up and life is all about being uncomfortable which I totally disagree with.

My mom is the only understanding one who says I don’t need to go if I don’t.

My question is should I go or not? Am I being selfish by not going bc of one person? Do I owe this to my grandparents? I feel like I need to do what’s best for me and not listen to any of my family.

167,"Warning- wall of text imminent. It's a culmination of ranting and backstory. Tl;dr at bottom though!

I've known my roommate for a few years but when we decided to share an apartment it was kind of a spur of the moment decision. I had just gotten a good job, had no savings, no furniture of my own, I hadn't lived on my own before so it was completely new territory for me. We knew each other but not very well at all, we were mostly mutual friends with another person. I knew he wasn't a bad person and was very outgoing and generally kept a pleasant demeanor so it didn't seem like a bad idea. He said it was okay if I didn't have savings, he'd front the initial cost of rent and would even cover an extra month if need be. 

So we took the plunge and everything seemed okay. Of course there were a few things that annoyed me about him and I'm sure vice versa. Like, I owed him from move in and every time I mentioned buying something for myself he'd always chime in, ""Remember, you still owe me money!"" After about a month of this I gave him a good chunk of money and when he asked where it came from said, ""While you were babysitting my wallet I was saving money."" He tried to tell me he wasn't concerned about my spending, but rather it was a reminder to himself. Terrible excuse but whatever.

Mostly it was a series of small annoyances that piled up like every Saturday I have my friends over and we cook something and he'll come out of his room to help himself without asking. One time he started eating freshly cooked vegetables with his hand right from the pot before anyone got any. Another time one of his friends somehow managed to piss on my bathroom floor and cleaned it up but left my bathroom trash can full of piss soaked paper towels. Then there was the time he stole two rolls of toilet paper from me without asking if he could have any. But then he got laid off from his job. He had a decent amount of savings and got a good severance check and was on unemployment so money want a problem. But he started doing less and less around the apartment. Not long after he got laid off I got a better paying job but started working overnight instead. Even though I sleep during the day and he's home all day I still bought and brought in/put away all the groceries (to be fair we did split the cost at the end of the month), did 95% of the cooking, did the dishes, got the mail, took out the garbage/recycle, etc. The only responsibility he took on was paying the rent because I don't have a checkbook and, at the time, we weren't set up for online pay. Whenever he contributed to the chores it was a small shock but it still wasn't enough. I decided that every time I did something he could have/should have done I would take a couple dollars off of what I owed him.

Recently I decided enough was enough because of a couple things. The first and imo more pressing issue was when I noticed our rent was $100 higher than normal. We had started paying online by this point. When I asked him about it he said we got a late fee because, ""I paid the rent on the third but it didn't process until the 5th. Also I was waiting on you to do your receipts."" (we tally up groceries and shared bills via receipts when rent is due to see what the split is). Now there's a couple things wrong with that. The rent can be paid any time, with our without doing the receipts. All the receipts are for us to figure out how much I need to give him once it's been paid. As far as the date goes, I was fairly certain the apartment folks go by when rent is paid, not processed and I confirmed that with them today. Also, online shows only the date rent is paid, not processed. It showed he paid on the 6th. We have between the 1st and 3rd to pay (though I very recently discovered we have until the 5th). So worst case scenario, he lied to me to cover up his mistake and get me to help pay for it, or best case, he's irresponsible and didn't pay attention and thinks it was processing time.

The other thing was the ants. We started seeing little sugar ants in our bathrooms. Now, we keep a fairly clean apartment and we don't leave food out so we knew it wasn't us. He told me about these sugar, water, and Borax and traps and said he'd make some up. He never did so on a weekend he was gone I made some and out it in the kitchen. This was Sunday morning and he came back Sunday night. Monday before I leave for work he tells me the trap has to be refreshed everyday and he'd mix more up. He never did until three days later. We'd also gotten a notice that maintenance would be by to do measurements for renovations right as I wake up to get ready for work I suggest we email then to let them know about the ants ahead of time. He says sure. I go get ready for work, take my shower, prepare my lunch. Then, right before I head out the door I ask which one of us should do the email. He says, ""Well, we both have free time. Do you want to tell the tale?"" Yeah, sure, you do nothing but play videogames all day but I guess I'll do it.

The last minor annoyance was the vacuuming. I sleep from about 8am to 4pm. I keep my for cracked so my car can go in and out. He decided to vacuum the living room at 1am. When I walk out because, screw it, I'm awake now, he chuckles and says, ""Oh, did I wake you?"". I've learned he doesn't think of others very much and it's been a lot of little things like that.

You might say, ""Why didn't you talk to him about it?"". Well, two reasons and they're both probably not very good. One, I hate confrontation of any kind. Two, he's an adult, I shouldn't have to get on him about household chores. He should understand the responsibilities of shared living and commit to them equally. Now, I'm not going to say I'm a perfect roommate. When I did the dishes I'd often leave big things in the sink that didn't fit in the dishwasher and ignore them for awhile. Sometimes I paid him rent a week late or $60-$100 short but I always made up for it the next week. But I definitely contribute much more than he does and without excuses.

I decided today to get an apartment with my best friend but I still have to tell my current roommate and tell him soon as our lease is up at the end of May. I also want to keep the apartment myself because we got a good deal. But 90% of the furniture, dishes, electronics, etc. are his so he'd end up having to do a lot of work to move out, much more than I would. How do I a) tell him I don't want to share an apartment anymore and then fairly decide who gets it? He hasn't bothered looking for a job in months, got off unemployment a long time ago, but he still has a decent amount of savings.

Tl;dr I have an inconsiderate roommate who I like hanging out with but hate living with and I don't know the best way to tell him I don't want to live with him anymore and don't know how to fairly decide who gets the apartment",22Mar2019,1

He lives in Athens, GA. I've been considering moving out there and applying to UGA just so I can be with him, and I'm really close to actually doing it. I know that we probably wouldn't last long if at all, but I really like this guy, and I can't get over him. How do I stop myself from going through with this stupid plan?

TLDR; I like this dude a lot, but I know he's prpbably not as into me as he says he is. I wanna move out to his state to be with him. Stop me. ",22Mar2019,1

175,"Hey Reddit, 

I don't know if this is anything that can be helped, but I'm desperate. Willing to try anything. So, here goes. Excuse me if this gets a bit long; this has been building for a long time.

Six months ago, I thought I had it made. I was a 24 year old guy, recently married (To a woman we'll refer to as ""A""), having bought a home of my own. Decent paid job. The works. I thought I had it all sorted out. I'm a person that has never really suffered from mental health issues (this is relevant), and had always been pretty confident and outgoing. My wife and I are/were in a half open relationship, where I was allowed to stray physically on the proviso that I always came home. We had had this arrangement for three years, and although I never really acted on it, occasionally I was reminded of its existence.

Cracks started showing about nine months ago, when I began getting intrusive thoughts at work. I regularly worked night shifts, and it was moderately disturbing at the time, but I could brush them off fairly easily. I had known people get them on the job, and was fine dealing with them. I associated them with a slump: I had achieved so much in a short amount of time, I was worried that I'd stagnate from there. I had tried to move upwards in the company I worked at, to no avail.

Roll on July, and I meet a girl (We'll call her ""B"") through a mutual friend. She was cute, with similar humour, and I instantly found myself drawn to her company. For the first time in three years, I seriously considered evoking the open relationship agreement made years prior. I went through the proper channels, cleared it with my wife, all good. Over the months that followed, this girl and I became closer, made out a bit at a party, I made her aware of the situation with my wife, and for a time, all was good. ""B"" and I went for drinks, entered a casual physical relationship, all is well. 

Around October, the cracks become chasms. ""A"", previously supportive of the change in relationship dynamic, started watching me closer. I'd find texts read/deleted, my laptop out of place. I had to keep her up to date with where I was, and what I was doing. We got into fights about what may or may not be happening. The more this developed, the more I took solace in this female friend. She saw what was being done, and shared her opinion that the relationship was on the verge of becoming controlling to the point of abuse. Mid October, I had met ""B"" for lunch, before meeting my wife. Upon seeing ""A"", I freaked out. Told her to go home without me, ran off into the city, tried to get my head together, met up with ""B"" again. Spoke to her about my situation and, after the slightest bit of persuasion on her end, decided to skip town for the night. It was a magical night; we ended up arriving in a city I had never been to, with nothing booked, no more than what we had brought to lunch that day. We walked around, soaking up the night life, getting to know each other, and stayed awake all night until the train station opened up the next morning. We returned to our home city, grabbed a nap at a hotel, and life resumed as normal. My wife was unaware of what had transpired this night, under the alibi that I was staying with a lifelong friend in an adjacent city.

A week later, I properly broke. My family had gotten involved. Before leaving for my night shift one night, I was sat down at a dining table with my wife, my dad, my sister, and my mother-in-law. They had seen the cracks forming in our relationship for a while, and had stepped in to try and get to the bottom of it. Nothing was really achieved, besides me ending up freaking out again, crying on my kitchen floor, suggesting to my wife that we take a break from our relationship. It wasn't taken seriously, and I left for my night shift afterwards. Around 2am, I can't take anymore. I break down at my post, and was sent home early. Instead of returning home, I instead elected to get a taxi to ""B""'s house, and we end up going for a walk until about 6am. From what I tell her, she becomes aware that not only is ""A"" seemingly controlling my life, but my family openly supports it.

Following this night, I stay with ""B"" for a while, take time off from work, get entered into counselling sessions to help deal with my breakdown. Everything stabilises for a bit. I am checked on everyday by any combinations of my friends, or family. Despite this, I begin to isolate myself from the world outside. I miss my anniversary. My birthday goes relatively unnoticed. I come and stay with my family for a few days over Christmas, but go straight back afters. On New Years Eve, ""B"" cracks. ""A""s mom and one of her friends has gotten a hold of ""B""s social media details, and are dropping passive aggressive comments towards her. She ends up rather explosively berating me. Telling me to tell the abusive people in my life to get the hell out. By the end, I feel so wretched I punch a hole in the wall. I am not a violent person, and have never thrown a punch in my life. However, I now believe that this event triggered my first episode of self harm as a coping mechanism. I drop a few friends messages, asking for help. Talk it out with a few of the people who are still awake. They start dropping to me the idea that my family and wife aren't the controlling ones, ""B"" is.

A couple of days later, I am surprised with a visit from my parents, who forcibly remove me from ""B""s place. I try to explain that I don't want to leave, but it is unheard. I end up at my family home, have my phone and laptop confiscated, and am effectively confined to my room for a few days. During this time, I am surprised with a visit to the hospital, where I later learn was with the intention of having me classified as a 'Vulnerable individual', so that they could have more of a say into what I do and where I go. Still without any real methods of communicating with anybody outside of my family, I contact ""B"" through a burner phone and arrange a meetup in the city. After a long afternoon, she suggests I talk to a police representative about the improper confiscation of property and being held against my will. I agreed, and tried to arrange a meeting with a representative - little did I know that would be sooner than I had planned. Afterwards, ""B"" urged me to come back to hers for the night. I do, and upon finding out where I was, my family, ""A"", and some of my friends converge on the place to try and bring me back. After another explosive confrontation, the police end up being called, and I spend my evening in the back of a police car bringing the officers up to speed. They tell my ""B"" and my family that because I'm not a vulnerable individual, I am free to stay where I please. After much deliberation - and both sides telling me heavily that the other side is controlling me - I elect to stay with ""B"" for the night. 

So began my most recent few months. Shortly after the police incident, I began Relationship counselling with ""A"", with unclear aims. We knew we needed to talk about our problems, but the outcome of either fixed relationship or amicable separation were unclear. Since the police event, ""B"" and I became closer and closer. Questions started being asked about relationship status. The situation having gone on for as long as it had, the future started drifting into the periphery. Scared of what might be said if I mentioned I was at relationship therapy, I foolishly lied and said I was at Family therapy. And so it continued for a while. During this relationship counselling, ""A"" informed me that time was running out on the marriage - and with it, our house, our pets, my previous way of life. She warned that I have until the end of this month to tell one of the women in my life that its over - all or nothing. Obviously quite distraught by this message, I panicked and began to spiral out of control. During this time, unaware of the pressure being applied elsewhere, ""B"" started to push for an end to this suspended situation. Her way was just as aggressive; after seeing how my family have treated me, she doesn't want me anywhere near them, cynical about my happiness should I go back to my old life. She insists she wants me to be happy, as long as I'm ok with my decision. I begin to have panic and depression be a major part of my life. I self harm to cope. My intrusive, suicidal thoughts - while a constant undertone of the last 6 months - flare up daily.

Last month, ""B"" cracks and snaps. She went out with the mutual friend we had met each other through one night: he had become embittered by the last few months, sees me as taking advantage of ""B""'s kindness, and becomes the president of my hater club. He begins bombarding her with - by her admission, difficult to argue with - statements about how I'm never going to be with her, I'm never going to leave my relationship, I'm just using her. We go for a few drinks after the fact, and it becomes a \~8 hour venting session at me, how I'm an abusive influence, I let everybody push me around, how I'm a coward for not facing the situation one way or another. That night, for the first time, I seriously consider taking my own life. I try to message ""A"", or any of my other friends, to tell them I'm some kind of monster. Needless to say, they begin chasing me up more. When I eventually pass out from alcohol and exhaustion, they believe me dead. The morning after, ""A"" and I talk it out. She apologises for everything, we hug it out, she explains that she cares for me, A LOT. A scary amount. She would love nothing more than to plan a mid-to-long term future with me, but understandably can't while I'm still half-in, half-out. In an attempt to reduce her perceived toxicity, she vows to give up drinking. To this day, she has kept true to that, and I'm proud of her for it. 

Over the last few weeks, things have been amping up steadily. ""A"" wants nothing more than to get me back home, ""B"" wants me to leave ""A"" and start anew. Every day, I try to confront it, and everyday, I panic. I've been bounced from Psychotherapist to psychotherapist, and none of them are able to help with my head. ""B"" is now aware that I lied to her about relationship therapy, and sometimes uses it as a point of contention for not trusting me, which leads to wearing me down by thoroughly explaining where I go and what I do. She's calmed down in more recent times - saying that the two things that'll heal that particular bit up is time and honesty, of which I have showered her with both. At this point, I am completely aware that I am in love with both women. The admission makes me feel shitty, like less of a person, but I can't help how I feel.

Over the last week or so, I've moved out of ""B""'s place and have moved in with one of my friends, who happens to be close to ""A"". It's an ok gig, to sleep on his sofa, but twice I've gone to visit ""B"", and twice its caused a fair amount of upset. Today he told me his two ground rules - 1) Never bring ""B"" to this place, 2) Never stay at ""B""'s overnight. Mentioning these to ""B"", it is even more plain to see in her mind that he's another friend only willing to help out if it means supporting ""A""'s side in all of this. This leaves the question in my mind of how fragile this living arrangement is, as I will want to see ""B"" again in the next couple days. During this time, I've had sporadic communication with ""A"" - she's still my wife, though my fall from grace has destroyed her to watch. 

&amp;#x200B;

I *think* that just about covers my situation up to the present, and now for the important request for advice. I have just over a week, Reddit. I don't know who is holding the reins of my life right now. I have two women in my life who want the best for me, but the have polar opposite ideas of what those are. I can't deny that my family and wife have shown abusive, controlling tendencies, but also similar for the other side. At the end of this month, my wife will set the divorce in motion, and we'll enter dissolution of my previous life. I have the possibility of starting anew to look forward to, or I have my old life where I had it made by most people's standards back. Either way, I lose a close friend, and a large part of my recent life. Feel free to ask questions, I might have left something out - as of this posting, its 4.30 am local time, and I've been writing this out for two hours. What the hell do I do here?",22Mar2019,1
177,"Besides painkillers(im taking liquid tylenol), they always have some other medicine to prevent from getting infections or something.

178,"Of course most people have a big game log now with Steam, and sometimes you dont get to them all. My issue is, i have so many games i was waiting for, Persona 5, Detroit, Spiderman (only the DLCs), as well as books like The Cursed Child, several comics and manga series, a book series, ext. not to mention puzzles and shit, but those i’ve learned to just wait to do.

For the most part, i just cant force myself to play these games. I love them, i dont want to get rid of them, but it’s just that i find playing a nice few games of league, or Skyrim, or something i’ve played before satisfies me.

I know growing up means changing, but i dont think this is what it is. I still frequently play games, but compared to laying in bed/sitting and browsing my phone sounds so much better. 

I hate the feeling of incompletion, and maybe it’s the stress of trophies and achievements, some that i know i’ll never achieve, that turns me off, or just disinterest, but i want to beat them, to finish them, and be able to pack them up and say “i finished this and enjoyed it.” Not to mention the massive amount of money with the habit of books and games, though thankfully i havent gotten more than one or two games every few months recently.

I’m not a procrastinator when it comes to normal stuff like work or chores, stuff that’s important, but i’ve gotten a bad habit to break. 

Should i give some stuff up, like things i know i’ll never finish? Anyone whose had an issue like this or similar, i’d love some advice, methods to break my habit, ext.

179,"okay, so right now I am just finishing my first year of university. I have not declared a major, but I am in the faculty of arts. I started university straight out of high school, and didn’t even consider other options (working, traveling, etc.) However, now I am unsure of how to continue next year, and it’s stressing me out. When it comes to choosing a major, I don’t even know where to start... English (writing, communications) has always been something that I enjoy and am relatively successful in. I hesitate to chose English as my major though, because I have been repeatedly told that English majors only become teachers, and I don’t see myself as a teacher. 
Now that I’m at a point where I have to decide, or at least narrow my path, I have become unsure of continuing in university at all.

I worry about her seeing other guys, she's basically all I can think about when I'm not doing anything but she doesn't want to date as she just got out of an abusive relationship (I was the other guy). Is it possible that I'm getting too attached or that I'm falling for her?",22Mar2019,1
190,"Ok so I (18 M, bisexual) am a senior in high school.  Graduation and prom is just around the corner. I have a group of close friends. Let’s call them Fred, my best friend (18 M), Velma (18 F), and Daphne (18 F). I had just previously come out of a 6 month relationship (the longest one I’ve ever been in) where I never actually liked the girl I was dating. It was just easier for me to say what they wanted to hear. 

Now there is this girl, we’ll call her Sam (16 F). Now Sam and I have been acquaintance/friends for almost 2 years. Sam Fred and I are all on the track team together. Everything was fine until just a little bit ago. Fred and her were hooking up, and we were just friends. But after a couple of months (a couple days after Fred and Sam stopped making out), she told me that she liked me and wanted to date me. Now when this first came up I turned her down. I told her I didn’t want to date because I wasn’t ready for it, and I was graduating soon.  (Fred had told me beforehand that he was ok if I hooked up with her) but the next day after I drove her home from practice, we were sitting in the backseat of my car. We were hanging out listening to music, when I caved and made out with her. This is where the problem started. I knew that Sam was tired of just being someone’s hookup buddy, and wanted to be in a relationship. With that in mind I was stuck. If I had told her after we made out that I still wanted to be friends, or that I wanted us to be friends with benefits, she would get furious. So I did the only thing I though I could do and asked her out. After all, I did kind of like her.

The next day everyone in school is giving me looks, and during lunch my group of friends come up to me and tell me that we all needed to talk. They were all upset with me. For starters, they were upset that I wasn’t the person to tell them about Sam and I, they heard about it through gossip. Second of all, Velma and daphne were upset about it because I had told them previously that I didn’t want to date anyone else until after I graduate. So now it seemed like I was lying. This was especially important because beforehand, Velma used to be a hookup buddy of mine, and when I asked daphne to go to prom with me (as a friend) they got in an argument. That argument was settled because I had told them that I wasn’t planning on dating anyone. Now Fred was upset because he had told me that he was ok if I hooked up with Sam, not date her. Now, this wasn’t out of jealousy, but rather out of mistrust. He didn’t trust Sam. He made out with her because she was pretty, but he told me that she was manipulative, clingy, and a bigot. On top of it all, my friends all think that I am not ready to date anyone, and that I’m not ready to handle that responsibility.

So now I’m stuck. I’m in a relationship with a girl that I like, but at the same time I don’t really want to date anyone. She’s really nice, but none of my friends like her/trust her. She told me that she might even be bi too, but earlier in the year she said the homosexuals should go to hell. I rehashed old arguments, and hurt my best friends feelings because he feels like I can’t be honest with him. I don’t know what to feel anymore. I’m torn between my choices. It feels like every step I would take would set off a bomb.

It’s already been a week since and all I’ve done is run from my problems. I haven’t talked about anything with my friends or my now girlfriend. In fact, I’ve been ignoring every text I’ve been getting, staying home from school, and just in general been unhappy. What should I do?",22Mar2019,1

The height limit is 15"", and the weight limit is 50lbs, so I lied a little bit, saying my dog is a mix with a really small breed, and that we don't know how big he'll get, hoping to buy us some time while we look for a new place to live. I know even if he does get accepted they'll want height &amp; weight updates so we're actively looking for someone else to live.

Onto the main reason I'm asking for advice, I'm 21 weeks pregnant. 

If we buy a house we have 4 contributors if you include me and my MAT pay. The current mortgage on our condo is 125k left, and we can sell it for approximately 149k, maybe a little more? We have the money for a 5% down payment of up to 400k house, and we need 4 bedrooms (one for me and SO, one for his grandma, one for my mom, and one for my baby when he gets older).

We currently pay around $2,400 every month right now with 2 contributors (my SO and his grandma) as I am not working and am on sick leave. I calculated around 756-931 a month per person depending on how much our new house costs, if you subtract the approximate $200 I'll be making due to extended mat leave... certain people might pay more/less depending on their income etc. 

After my year of maternity leave, what do I do? Like I was thinking of going back to school in September but my baby will be less than 2 months old and I don't know if I feel comfortable leaving him at home that young... I need to go back to school (college/uni) but I don't know if I can juggle a part time job and school, because I struggle in school enough let alone adding the stress of being a mom, and working. I could take online classes and just take 1 course at a time, but I have a hard time motivating myself to meet self-set deadlines.

We all want to move regardless of the dog situation, but I don't know if in the long run if we can afford it.",22Mar2019,1
195,"(I may seem like I’m over reacting. Please please don’t give me a tirade please keep it gentle in the comment section my previous relationship was abusive and I react very badly in these situations. Sorry for all the waffle)

So im 23 he’s 23 I’m not sure If ive been totally unreasonable but I did get very angry. So it started out as whenever my bf came over I’d always see this girls name on his snap, and the chat box was going back and fourth so of course I had my suspicions which I let simmer for around 3 months. And today I mentioned I had things in the relationship that bothered me and he said well what, and I said well is there anything you’d like to tell me befkre I start making any accusations. 

And he then said “oh is it about x” and I said well yeah it is. Her name is always popping up on your phone and I don’t know who the hell she is. And he said oh she was a flatmate from first year uni and I said riiiight and he said well we both failed the year (4 years ago) and we keep in touch and she asks me how I am etc and she usually speaks about work. And she asked if you’d find it weird if we spoke and I said no my gf won’t mind. 

But I just feel like I’m really annoyed because I’ve been worrying this whole time and anytime I asked he’d never say it. It’s only now he’s said it and they’re exchanging messages apparently around 3/4 times a week. But I said to him well she should’ve surely backed off messaging long convos when she knew you had a gf and the fact you havent even seen her since 4 years ago? It seems odd, and he said to me well yeah I’d be mad if you did this to me. I just flipped at him because I just think he should’ve thought about this whole time, but yet he said it would be weird if I did it? 

He’s offered to show me the convo, but I said I’m just a bit annoyed atm, I feel like the girl could’ve just backed off a bit, not to say it’s her fault but I also think my bf is at fault for saying yeah my gf thinks it’s okay for her to keep telling him her work issues. 

Obviously I’m not telling him to cut the contact. Just to respect me and say look don’t get this twisted if you see it it’s not a big deal. I always tell him when my guy friends want to hang out. The thing is I’m not angry because he speaks to women who aren’t me. That’s ok he’s not restricted to no female friends, it was that he hasn’t seen her for 4 years and they only knew each other a matter of months so it’s just strange they’re on that level?

196,"Hey guys, 

So I’m having a bit of an issue. Im (F-22) single and just recently gotten out of a tough break up. And I work with this really cool co-worker (m-25?..he’s dating) and we’ve known each other for months. I’ve noticed that he’s been giving me extra attention, which makes me think that maybe he likes me. And I have to admit, I started catching some feelings too. He recently found a new job and quit the job he works at (the one I’m at). So we’re no longer co-workers.

So now it’s awkward because we’ve been basically told each other that we had feelings for one another. And I told him that I didn’t want to make things complicated for him and his girlfriend. So I tried to back off. But when he left his job, we spoke for 5 hours straight, and we tried to control ourselves.. but obviously things ended up going a little 18A. 

I’ve never felt so infatuated in my life.. and it hurts. I’m afraid that I’m gonna ruin his relationship. I told him that we shouldn’t be doing this, and that we have to keep a distance. Was I wrong for doing any of that..? I feel stupid for falling for him.. and ... I really like him. I actually cried when I pushed him away. Am I doing the right thing? Or did I totally fuck up?

198,"ok so alt account for obvious reasons. sorry about wording because im not good with words

&amp;#x200B;

so my grandma owns the house and my mom, sister (25), and i (17) live in it. my mom pays every bill in the house and the only one my sister pays is car insurance (which she barely does at all). all my sister really does is smoke weed with her gf, go to work, and watch tv. avoiding her is literally impossible because shes in the room between the laundry room (i mosttimes have to walk around outside of the house to do laundry). she tell me i should get a job but i cant because i cant drive (getting off learners in a couple months) and it would be hard because i already juggle school, online school, and extra ciriculum activities

&amp;#x200B;

so my 1st problem with her is the weed. i dont care that she smokes it, i just dont like her smoking it in the house (and im pretty sure its illegal in florida). i get a headache every time i smell it. she tried peer pressuring me and my mom to try it and we both refused. she ruined christmas when she mixed weed with some other cigarette and we had to drive her to the hospital when we were opening presents. 

&amp;#x200B;

the second problem is extortion. the whole reason im posting this is because of what occurred tonight and im at my boiling point. so my mom and i are going out of state with our grandma to visit some family, a week before, my mother asked my sister to take care of the dogs while we're away, they agreed on $60. well about an hour ago my sister burst into my moms room and says ""hey i need the $60 by tomorrow morning"" then they start arguing back and forth (i dont think you should pay the entire amount up front especially when my sister is VERY unreliable) then my sister said ""well fine then ill just wreak the house while your away""........ then after some more arguing my sister storms off. and my moms jsut decides to go to bed.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

the last and most fucked up is the lack of privacy and out right lies. my sister has no borders for privacy. i get that im a teen and understand open door policys and all that but it goes farther than that. i was getting into the shower one morning and my sister literally walks in. no knock or nothing. im like ""get the fuck out of my room im playing minecraft"" ok i didnt say that but i was like ""what the fuck"" and shes like ""sorrysorrysorrysorry"" and gets out. this all happened in a 5 second span. so fast forward to later that night and i hear in my moms room my sister say ""he was masturbating in the bathroom""............... and im like ""WHAT THE FUCK"" now im pretty religious so i refrain from doing that kind of stuff so i was pretty flabergasted from this. that pretty much all i have to say from this (btw my moms didnt belive her)

&amp;#x200B;

so im stuck on what my options even are. i could tell my grandma and make her aware of everything shes tried to pull (she knows about the weed) but my mom says leave my grandma out of it because shes dealing with alot from other family members. please help",22Mar2019,1

The outgoing one used to sleep with us both, switching every other night. Now she has stopped switching and instead only sleeps with my sister. This makes me so sad because honestly, truly, my cat is the only real friend I have (besides my family). I don’t have any real friends at school, and I get so lonely except for when I get home and my cat is so excited to see me and cuddle up next to me every night. Not anymore. This honestly breaks my heart. I pick her up and bring her to bed but she ends up leaving to my sisters room. I have absolutely no idea why. She is a much restless sleeper than me. She enjoys the company of my cat but I don’t think it impacts her as much as it does me. I look forward to it. Does anyone have any advice as to why my cat won’t sleep in my bed with me anymore?

201,"I dated this guy for a year and a half over the last two years of high school. He’s from a deeply religious family and his mom is one of our teachers and one of my favorite people on Earth. We were friends during freshman and sophomore year and we both had feelings but there was always something keeping us from acting on them until the beginning of junior year, when I was finally out of another bad relationship and he was finally old enough to date. For the first few months, we did our best to keep our relationship fairly quiet so that his mom wouldn’t be upset with us, but despite those struggles, I was happier than I had ever been.  He had some issues with communication and stuff like that but I tried to be understanding and forgiving because he was pretty new to dating. 

We broke up about a year ago because he told his parents about us and they didn’t approve, but we ended up getting back together a couple months later, and everything was much better than it had been before. He put in more effort and the beginning of senior year was full of milestones that I was happy to share with him. He struggled with some mental health issues but I did my best to support him through that. 

I had spent the first year of our relationship thinking that we would last until graduation at the latest because he was going on a long mission and communication would be limited so keeping up a relationship would be really difficult, but on the phone late one night he told me he was leaving his family’s religion and that he wanted to marry me someday.  He also told me that his parents knew about us and they were ok with it now. 

One day I went over to his house when his parents weren’t home, and his mom found out. She talked to my mom about it the night before Valentine’s Day, and told her that apparently they never knew anything. She could tell from being around both of us that we liked each other, but HE NEVER TOLD THEM WE WERE DATING. He didn’t tell them before we broke up last year, and he didn’t tell them this year. I gave him an ultimatum and a deadline to talk to them, and when he did, he decided that it wasn’t healthy for either of us to continue our relationship. 

We do a lot of the same extracurricular activities, so we still see each other and talk to each other all the time. Every time we talk, it makes my day. We’ve always been really compatible and even after breaking up, we still get along really well. But every time I finish talking to him, I feel like shit because he really shouldn’t be able to make me happy anymore. 

I’m trying to keep hope out of this because obviously this isn’t the time for a relationship, but would it be healthier for me to stop talking to him altogether, at least until I can move on? I’m afraid of losing that connection and friendship because we’ve always been close but I don’t know if I can handle the way I feel after our conversations. ",22Mar2019,1

I've been sleeping very late, waking up late, haven't gone to class in weeks, I stopped doing my hobby I enjoyed doing, stopped working out, haven't been eating that healthy, pretty much everything is going bad for me. I don't know what to do with my life. School isn't cutting it for me after I kept trying and trying to stay in, but dropping out multiple times, I think this is my last time. I started college at 17 and I'm 20 now and have nothing really to show for it. It isn't really difficult for me, the most difficult part is accepting that it really is pointless and why I'm studying what I am(CS) when I don't really like it at all.

203,"I met a girl in class that's a couple grades ahead of me. I made a lame ass joke that nobody else was laughing at and she started laughing loudly and at great length and then started talking to me. She asked me to repeat the joke yet she obviously heard it. As I told her it she smiled the whole time then waited after class to pop out say boo and scare me and looked me in the eyes. She doesn't talk to other guys in class. After that incident she didn’t do anything as explosive. She started laughing at half funny stuff I say in conversation to other people or responding to stuff I say or asking me to repeat jokes. After I have a conversation with her she scares me. I was joking around with her and gave her a picture she was laughing loudly and saying my name a lot and I had a gut feeling from her eye contact because she held good eye contact and when I moved close to her didn’t flinch. Her friend asked me to tell the girl jokes and chase her down the hall as a joke. Early when we were joking around she held good eye contact longer than most people and I got a vibe from it and she was saying my name a lot.

The girl gets red while talking to me, hides her face, smiles, makes no eye contact. blushes and smiles when I say hi first. She can’t look me in the eyes and say hi first. She continued butting in my conversations to talk to me. Well her friend asked me to sit across from them. The girl had an attitude but found any excuse to talk to me and when they took turns with selfies next to me she had to be between us and asked me to get closer. She giggles and says my name for no reason. I told her friend I don’t take selfies she said “Me and Tina are going to take care of that”. The next day she comes and gets me when the girl is wearing something that shows cleavage for a selfie next to her. From that she blushed and asked me to get closer. When I talk to her she asks for a selfie with me or scares me. She hovers around me with her friend and approaches me with her friend trying to talk to me. Another friend looks at her and says her name when I enter a room. her friend’s comment nice things on our pictures.

When I say something bad she giggles and says my name. She compliments me a lot like new shirts haircut and so on. She has listened to my phone call with my mom and asked why I didn't say I love u at the end. Her friend goes around and finds information to tell her then she tells me what she heard about me.

For most of my life, my father has been an a-hole. And I'm not trying to sound like a brat that doesn't know his place. But my father's the kind of person that if there's any kind of mistake I make. He will blow it out of proportion. Ground me on the tip of a hat. And berate me for hours despite doing the best I can. Just as an example of the kind of things he does. He's made me practice drawing all my life, enough to actually cut into my school work and damage my grades. Yet it's my fault if I don't do good in school, because everyone else can have a good social life, have straight As and play sports, so clearly I'm doing something wrong/I'm not trying hard enough. (And I have ADHD, I literally took meds for it and he doubts that I have adhd.) Despite the fact that I basically gave up doing anything else for a few years. I seem to remember spending all my time studying and drawing. Half the time I wanted to go see my friends, he wouldn't allow me because I haven't drawn enough. And keep in mind I never wanted to be an artist. I'm not trying to be hysterical or over dramatic, but I feel jealousy and almost start tearing up when I see my friend and his father having a good time. Something as simple as being able to joke around is painful for me to watch.

Because I'm scared that I'm about to witness my friend getting yelled at for joking around.  
 And also because I wish my father and I could joke around like that. Not berate me to tears because I messed up on a drawing that I never wanted to draw.   
   
This is the kind of person my father is. And I'm angry. Because there were so many unjust things he's done to me and I don't know how to deal with it. Except store and hide the anger. But as much as I try my best to hide it. It's there. 

 I could be doing anything and if anything makes me think about my own past I get angry. And sometimes things that are just annoying, can ignite that anger and I have to catch myself and tell myself, I'm needlessly being angry in order to try to become calm again. I don't know how to deal with it because even if, let's say I got any sort of revenge it wouldn't really satisfy me.

208,"Excuse any weird formatting. This is the first time I've posted on reddit &amp; I'm doing it on mobile. Once again, my apologies. This post will be quite lengthy so scroll down for TLDR if you need to. 

I'm a 17 year old high schooler currently living with my father, mother, and siblings. Tension with my father has always been high but there's been an abnormal spike of aggression between him and my older sister (18 years old) over the past few years. 

My dad has abused me and my siblings for so long, physically and verbally. He constantly talks down to us and tells us we're worthless dogs, threatening to kick us out so we can sleep outside like the dogs we are. He gaslights us, guilt trips us, and whenever he's being a manipulative shithead, he turns the argument around to make it seem like we attacked him. 

Last night was the final straw for me. Although I wasn't there to witness it, my dad was berating my older sister as I was sleeping in my room. 

After dinner, my sister was cleaning up and told my little brother to wash the dishes. My dad, being a misogynistic pig-headed bastard, went on a whole tirade about how boys shouldn't be doing domestic chores. My sister tried to explain to him how everyone should be working together to get the housework done regardless of gender. This only upset him more as he continued to insult her: calling her lazy &amp; stupid &amp; how she was never going to amount to anything. My dad went as far as to calling my little sisters, who are under 10 years old, lazy girls who never did anything around the house. 

Whenever my older sister tried to defend herself, he told her to stop attacking him and talking back to him. He said as his children, we had to obey him and never talk, just listen to what he has to say. She stopped replying to him &amp; just took it as she didn't want a physical altercation to occur. 

He even told my older sister that only my mom loved her &amp; that he would never have continued supporting her if our mother didn't convince him to (in the recent past, he threatened to kick her off his car insurance plan). This pissed me off so much when I heard this as my sister was near tears retelling this part. My whole life, I've never really felt like this man was my father. He was shadowy figure of authority in my life, someone I was scared of. Now, whenever I'm around him, I feel incredibly tense, uncomfortable, and anxious. I can't be in the same room as him for more than a couple minutes. Every interaction with him makes my skin crawl and my stomach drop. 

I've contemplated so many times as to whether I should immediately move out once I graduate high school or stay because I feel like I need to protect my younger siblings (I have 5 younger siblings). My mother also heavily relies on me to help cook and clean around the house as I'm always home. I'm afraid that once I leave, my mom will have no one to help her. My father does nothing to help her; she's losing hair because of the stress of her day job, cooking, and housework. 

I really don't think I can stay at this house anymore. I've dealt with this bullshit for the past couple of years now. Not sure how much more I can tolerate before I snap. My father has explicitly told my older sister and I that we are no longer apart of his family anymore (over some dumbass reason I can't remember). If he thinks that way, so be it. But I know that when I'm gone, my little siblings will receive the abuse, not to mention my growing anxiety over my mom's health. 

My sister &amp; I have talked about moving out to escape my father but we've never had a full discussion about it. I have personally considered it myself to a serious extent. I was thinking of moving far away to attend an out-of-state university/college but thought that might not be fair to my family's finances. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel so hurt, conflicted, and lost. If anybody could offer some advice or insight or maybe link me to some helpful resources, I would be very willing to take it. Thank you. 

TLDR; I have dealt with my abusive father for far too long. I want to leave with my older sister once I graduate high school but I don't want to leave my little siblings to suffer from his abuse and I don't want to leave my mom alone. What do I do? ",22Mar2019,1
209,"Seriously, my mom had me at 42 years old following having my sister at 41. My father and mother were reckless and never planned to have children until my sister was born, and because she was a girl they decided to have me. I was born premature at 6 months as a result.

My father worked from home and never really raised me outside of beating my ass when I did something wrong and threatening if I ever fought back to wake me in the middle of the night with a frying pan. He was a professional athlete and businessman and taught me absolute dick about life. My mother was a trophy wife/playboy bunny and was never really around/worked more often than I saw her, thankfully in a way because she has absolutely no sense of priority or raising a child either. I was beyond neglected and given no responsibilities and as a result the shoemaker's children have no shoes. I'm a fucking wreck socially and mentally, I'm beginning to wonder if they forgot to play with me as a kid.

My father died at 19 and my mom decided to encourage me to rack up a fuckload of debt to come back home after finishing my sophomore year in college to take care of things following his passing. I really enjoyed philosophy but, the last encounter my dad and I ever had he mocked me and rolled his eyes wondering why I wasn't going to be an entrepreneur like him. So I decided to come home and ease the transition and go to business school. I didn't know the logistics financially because she always kept secret what was going on, and that ""we would figure it out""(rack up debt). I could have alternatively just taken a year off but she lied and told me I would have to start paying back my student loans immediately. 

At the start of my third year I caught a string of injuries trying to playing bottom of the barrel d3 college club and I've nearly handicapped myself 3 surgeries later. I had switched my major from pre-law philosophy to business and the past 4-6 years have been brutal to me. My dream job which both paid really well was given up because I can't keep up physically anymore. I'm 25 and following my graduation I'm stuck in a cycle of debt and just trying to get healthy again, trying escape debilitating pain and avoid joint replacement surgery. I'm stuck at living at home now and because my mom is a twig she doesn't understand what food is and I'm literally starving half the week but hey, at least we have a broken lawn mower and granite counter tops and materialstic bullshit we never fucking needed in the first place.

She's never broken a bone in her life and while she isn't directly responsible for my past 3 surgeries being unsuccessful she also never really gave a shit making sure it went right outside of minor care at home. Because she has no concept of orderliness or prioritization or the seriousness of it she just kinda goes with the flow and as a result the past 3 times I've trusted her guidance overseeing it and I'm really paying for it now. 

No due diligence was performed: first surgeon was a fucking joke, the following PT's for the revison surgeries went terrible and by the end of it we couldn't afford the last 2 months of PT, but within two months she started looking at a 2019 luxury SUV to get more debt. And oh yeah -- She didn't pay the out of pocket for any of the surgeries/PT so far and I'm now at least 20k in debt in addition to the 70-110k from student loans. I'm up for 2 more surgeries totaling $20k and will be stuck at home without work for 16 weeks. By the end of it I turn 26 and come off her insurance and there's no plan in place for how we're going to follow through with this. The question of how I'm going to even eat and live and survive here is making me go mad. This is a last ditch effort to save my legs and pursue happiness/live a pain free life for 5 years and I want to throw up. 

I don't feel confident about this and I don't know what to do.

Am I a fucking asshole for wanting to get healthy? For wanting to eat more than a half a meal a day? Am I an asshole because I'm stuck at home trying to get my health together? 

I don't think so, but regardless it's not going to change the way the rest of my family judges me and my mother runs a fucking broken household.


What the fuck should I do here? How am I going to make it out of this in one piece?",22Mar2019,1
210,"I love, love, love music, and I've been told my whole life I'm good at it. I've been in a youth symphony since the eighth grade and I've composed a couple of pieces that actually aren't terrible. It, without a doubt, is my passion.

This is my last year of high school, and I've been accepted into the university I wanted to go to. I need to decide what I want to do with my life pretty quickly now. And what do I want to do with my life? I want to get a music composition and/or music education degree. But there are some financial problems associated.

You see, my family is sitting in this really uncomfortable spot. Not rich enough to help me significantly, and not poor enough to get aid. So I'm working a fast food job and applying for scholarships, but when it really comes down to it, I'll probably have to take out some loans. Though I have researched ways to make money as a musician, my loans would be a lot easier to pay off if I majored in, say, dental hygiene.

Majoring in something more practical makes a lot of sense. I would be secure, and I might even be happy. But I can see myself at age 35, working as a dental hygienist, or as a business woman, or whatever, admitting to myself that I hate my job, and looking back and wondering why I didn't learn how to write music when I had the chance. 

I love music. Like, to the point where it's what I want to do all day, to the point where I almost hate it, to the point where I keep coming back even though I almost hate it.

But I also want to be independent and secure. I've been told over and over and over again that going into music is stupid because it can't guarantee me a livelihood. What if I find out that I have a medical issue that I can't pay for? What if I get married and then divorced and I have to raise my children alone? It would be so much easier to cope with these situations with a more practical degree.

So, in conclusion, passion or paycheck?",22Mar2019,1

Him: “Hey (he mentioned my name which he never has before), I’m super sorry to have to ask you this and on such short notice, but you wouldn’t happen to have any money I could borrow? I need $120, I was supposed to get my paycheck today for work and give it to my mom, but I already had to spend it on something else important 😬 would you be able to help me out, I could bike to you, and if not that’s alright! Thanks!”
“Oh yeah, and the main bad part is that my mom will most definitely ground me and take my phone if I don’t have any today 😬 I could pay you back either next Thursday or the one after that”
Me: sorry but my parents would never let me give someone that much and I don’t have my own money 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️if what you spent it on is so important then why would u be grounded ..
Him: “I’m usually supposed to wait for her, and then she’ll either take my paycheck or say that I can spend it on what I want/save. This week I was kinda dumb and forgot and went ahead of time, bought some stuff like basketball stuff and protein stuff already :/ how much would your parents let you? It’s alright anyway though if you cant, thanks for listening lol”
Me: oh ok.. well I did ask and they won’t let me give any sorry :P so ur mom won’t care even if u explain??
Him: “Aww it’s alright no problem! Lmao and she would care but she’d still explain that I was too impulsive probably, she probably wouldn’t get mad, but would still ground me just so next time I wont”

~Also, for extra information which may help: I asked to hang out with him again on Friday which would be tomorrow, and he said this today. Maybe he thinks I would pay for him so that he wouldn’t get grounded and we could still hang out. Or this whole thing is a lie and he just wants the money. 
We do have a class together so I could always confront him, but I still declined because who would loan $120... 
I still want to be friends with him if perhaps this was an emergency situation and I’m just looking into it too much, but that’s a pretty major thing to ask about and I am pretty mad. 
also hopefully he doesn’t see this on here but I doubt it with all the other posts hah, but it’d be whatever. ",22Mar2019,2
216,"For a little context I met this man at the retail store I use to work at. 

I’m a very extroverted person and friendly person. I also have always primarily worked around elderly people since I was 17. So chatting with people twice or triple my age is what I’m use too (and more comfortable with honestly).

Since he was new to the store I started a conversation with him.  

We ended up becoming close. He became like family. An uncle. In the year we worked together. I even met his wife. 

When I moved away to another state we stayed in contact. Not texting everyday or anything. But talking once every month or two.

Today he confessed that he’s in love with me. 

That he understands it can never happen because our age gap, but if we had met around the same age he would’ve wanted to spend his entire life with me and be with me forever.

He explained he would never cheat on his wife but could no longer hide his feelings. And he apologized for his feelings and says he just needed to get it out

I told him I was fine being friends, I don’t reciprocate his feelings and I think his feelings are unfair to his wife.

I don’t think I’ll actually remain friends with him. 

I feel dumb for not noticing the subtle things when we worked together. 

How he would say any guy my age would be lucky to have me. My grandparents and parents have said the same thing so I thought nothing of it

Or how if he was younger he would’ve dated me.

I took his comments not serious at all just a polite way of complimenting someone younger without being creepy. Plus this was a one time mention in the 2 years we had talked. 

I told two of my friends about his confession (one who did work with him as well).

Both where really disgusted

What I’m wondering is. Why don’t I feel disgusted. Obviously I’m not interested in this man I viewed like family. 

And although I do find some older men attractive (not him). I wouldn’t date anyone over 35. 

But I’m not angry or revolted.

Just 

Disappointed. I feel really empty about it. 

Is something wrong with me?

I wish he just never had told me and slowly stopped contacting me. I don’t understand his mindset. Did he actually think there was a chance? 

I don’t understand what’s wrong with people 

I currently work in a store with all people around his age and now I can’t help but question when they’re friendly with me. Do they have bad intentions as well?

Do you guys have any advice. What would you do in this situation? Is my reaction normal? 

// also I can’t contact his wife in any of you are wondering. I don’t have her number or a way of finding her on Facebook.

217,"Hi, I'm unsure of what I should look like when I go in for my interview.

It's at an energy company and I'd be a student assistant. Initially I planned on wearing a white or black collared polo with khaki's and some people said that it would be fine, and I've also been told to wear a button downed white dress shirt. 

For shoes, I don't have much. I have some ""dress shoes"" that are all black, but they are technically marching shoes for marching band. I do have all black nike sneakers with white on the bottom and you can't really see the iconic swoosh. Would those still be appropriate to wear?

What should I wear?",22Mar2019,1
218,"So I've accepted the fact that I do indeed have an ingrown toenail and I've started taking steps to fix it. Better fitting shoes was a big one since every day from work I'd take off my shoes and always have blood in my socks. I accidentally went two sizes bigger but it fits surprisingly well. I do soak my toe in warm water which makes it feel perfect and the redness goes down as well but I think I need to get surgery on it unfortunately. I've been dealing with it since October and while it doesn't hurt, it's just an uncomfortable feeling every time I have to work. 

I'm probably going to sound like a big baby here but it is what it is I guess. I'm really worried about the surgery and I haven't even booked it yet. I have a severe problem with needles and it's always been that way. They don't hurt but every time I get one something bad happens. In school when you get the hepatitis shots it always made me turn pale and feel sick, same with flu shots. When I had cavities and they had to freeze my mouth it never worked. I always had feeling in my mouth and this happened at three different dentists. I'm really hoping they can put me under for the procedure if I ask. Another thing I'm worried about is the aftercare. If I have to regularly clean and change the bandage or something, I almost want to avoid it because of the pain. 

I wish I could quit my job and just sit at home all day because once I soak my toe it's one of the best feelings and it stays that way until I have to go to work. But sadly I can't. Any advice or tips on dealing with what I'm going through?",22Mar2019,1
219,"I've been through some garbage in my day, and I don't mean like ""oh no i scuffed my shoes this has ruined my day,"" no I mean like I have literally died, been through chemotherapy, got beat up, moved every few years, almost failed out of high-school...but for some reason I just sucked it up and kept smiling. Never pursued any sort of attention, always helped when I could because that's how I was raised. Do whats right and not what is easy. Guess the shorter way of saying it is that I've always been optimistic even though I was diagnosed with clinical depression at 12. Tried all kinds of meds, never did anything to the point I started hiding my meds and saying I took them and all that.  
Sorry i'm getting side tracked. Basically i woke up today and it just clicked that i have never been genuinely happy, and i'm starting a journal with goals and all that. I'm going to do what makes me happy and not worry about what people think about me. Realized I had no ambitions because I only ever had one dream (and it was a bit out there...want to go to space xD), but now I've got goals. haha. I'm already feeling better after writing the goals down and writing a few pages in the journal...  


**My request for advice though is**...How, how do I tell my girlfriend of two years who I love so much that I have never been happy? I don't want her thinking that she doesn't make me happy, because she does, just it isn't enough due to my own fault. She isn't the kind who would leave me if I came home with a piercing or a new puppy or something ridiculous like that. My issue is I don't want her to be sad or worried about me, but I cant avoid that i don't think. Should I wait till she comes back state side from her study abroad and tell her, or should I text her and tell her. **Thank you in advance for any advice.**  


Feel I should also mention she is my first girlfriend and all that so my relationship knowledge is absolutely horrendous. *Feel stupid for making this, but the internet is the newest frontier and someone somewhere out there beyond their screen has to have an idea on how to break this news to the person I love dearly.* ",22Mar2019,1

Long story short I had a report on ecosystems.

I submitted the wrong report? I went back into turnitun and found out that I actually during the report writing hadn't referenced my references? and I used information from my friends report and I didn't paraphrase it according to my words.

The thing is ... the university is actually correct because I technically did do that in my draft report. 

My final report which has much more references and is written more eloquently and similar to other reports I've written in the past does not have these idiosyncrasies. I've submitted 30+ reports in University and was never accused of plagiarism or had a high score.

Please tell me what to do - I want to tell the Unviersity the truth because ... it's true and I didn't intend it.

We became best friends immediately. We understood each other. We went to each other for help. She even connected with my fiancé and the three of us could hang out without any awkwardness. We expanded our circle to include another awesome girl and a guy (E). I got to be close with E too, and life was good. Then, a few months back, E and R started a relationship with each other. It was fucked from the start, the whole time R was saying things like ""ill never be able to see him as more than a fuck buddy"", and then a week later she would tell him she loved him. Im glad that they found someone to be with, but since the relationship started, its been destructive for the whole group. Its hard when your two best friends start dating each other. I see much less of them since the relationship started, and have been feeling left out a lot. The biggest thing, however, is that both of their mental healths have suffered greatly since they got together. E decided to stop taking his medication for bipolar disorder in order to ""feel his emotions better"", and went off the deep end. R has been spending all of her time alone with him because he no longer can handle being around people but needs her around constantly. R has also been cancelling plans with me frequently to either take care of E or because she ""cant handle"" hanging out die to her own emotional issues. I used to be someone she would talk to for comfort and support, now she wont let anyone except E in. Its gotten to the point where i hardly see them even though R and I live together, and it sucks. I want to be their to help them through the rough stuff but they only talk to each other and wont let me help. Its gotten to the point where R has started to disregard me entirely, waiting to cancel plans until far after we were supposed to meet up and wasting a lot of my time, or forgetting that we made plans and going off with E. Im constantly left in the dust with a promise from R to be back in 15 minutes only to see her the next day. I got engaged while this was going on, and I havent even gotten to celebrate with my friends because theyve been completely wrapped up in their own shit. It sucks and it makes me feel like trash.

* Also, this was before class started and before the teachers took attendance

So I was just messing around with my friends when I jokingly pushed a friend we'll call Larry. Anyways, Larry said GET HIM as a group of people I know but not really lifts me up and pretends to swing me into the trash, normal high school stuff right? And so they are done joking around and I get put down when one of the people I know but not really (I don't know his name) picks me up and basically bearhugs me(I'm pretty small, 5'4"") and starts swinging me but I guess it looks like i was being humped ^(holy fuck this is embarrassing) **EDIT: the group of people i know but not really joins in again however they just lift my legs and i kick one away but it was like 6 people**. Everyone in my friend group(about 12-ish) was laughing except one of my friends, Fred. The unknown kid drops me and and I, being humiliated and all, start to walk like just to get away. Fred joins me and tries to make me laugh. I end up just going to the restroom and waiting for 2nd lunch to start so I could go hang out with other friends and wait for gym to end so i could grab my clothes + backpack. Thats basically where this ends. I wanted advice as what i should do, like should i report the kids that were lifting me, talk to them first, idk.

228,"I (F22) live with my friend and coworker, B (M21). We are currently in Japan for a 2 week vacation (my first time abroad) and we're having bad issues and I really need some advice on how to deal with it. We actually live together as well - however our work is online based and we have a healthy break between life and work. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure how to write this with enough context without writing out the last year of my life... but I shall try as short as possible! 

&amp;#x200B;

Me and B have issues with each other sometimes, and I have more issues with him than he does with me but I don't feel comfortable airing it especially right now that our issues are starting to ""erupt"". First off you can tell when B is annoyed, especially when we are walking together. He will do a few things, first off he will storm off ahead suddenly when something annoys him, and then he won't speak to you (at all) for about a day or longer then he'll ambush me with some kind of ""intervention"". This happens regularly, sometimes the ""intervention"" can take weeks tho. The second thing he does a lot is he will be really standoff-ish and shout at me. He will also always add ""you're my bestmate"" when we talk about our issues.. 

 

He had one of his huffs yesterday, which I learned 12 hours after was because I didn't say ""please"" when I asked him to hold something in a shop while I got money out and that I had accidentally coughed to close to his ear  and not said sorry earlier. His words were ""you don't respect me anymore"" and ""you don't appreciate me"".   


This happens a lot really, he has these little trivial weird issue with me all the time which I just don't understand. Just a few months ago he pulled me up for.. kissing my girlfriend in public! He even had the cheek to demand she start paying bills of our shared flat because she sleeps over with me (we buy and cook our own food entirely).  One time I was cooking xmas dinner (super stressful it took 2 full days to make!!) I asked him to mop the floor please he said yes, waited an hour and I asked again and he proper started shouting at me that he didn't have time (was going to meet a friend to go leisurely clothes shopping after sitting on couch on instagram for an hour whilst I slaved over cooking his meal!). 

Getting into less specifics here is a list of things I think are pretty shitty that he does/has done  


Keeps leaving me behind while we are travelling (in Japan my first foreign country!) when I have no money and no phone signal. Multiple times I've sat down and thought ""fuck what am I going to do"" 

He took all of our money for the first week until I had to take half for myself 

Won't let me do any sort of directions or journey planning  even if he keeps getting it wrong 

Has now completely left me alone at the hotel to do all of the sightseeing himself after the argument at the hotel 

Locked me out of our hotel room earlier whilst he was in it! I had to wait an hour to get in because he ignored me trying to get in. 

Made fun of me in front of other friends when I was asking if it was okay for me to go for a while before our trip, or if we had more to sort out (we hadn't exchanged any money at this point and I was anxious about it, he replied with ""I'm an adult I can manage myself) 

Actually regularly will make fun of me when we are around other people  

Got travel insurance himself without mentioning it to me at all (I wanna stress I've never done this before) 

We actually missed our original flights in because he took to long in the morning, I say for 45 mins after waking up at 6:30 for him to get out the house because I was already ready. Cost me £1k in flights! 

He will always refer to the nice Scottish town I'm from as ""a shit hole"" - always 

Same for my home country, I guess it's supposed to be funny but it's really not when he says it non-ironically every time I bring it up. 

Makes fun of my accent periodically even though I've made it VERY clear I don't like it. (Scottish - it wasn't funny the first time, it wasn't funny the last 300 times) 

Will physically attack me periodically when I'm working even though I ask him not to! (in the form of jabbing me in the sides, grabbing me and putting me into choke holds!! (I've never ever ever retaliated either - he's a trained thai kickboxer and it makes me feel super uncomfortable)   
Will forcibly Steal my very special silver Scottish ring that my mother got me periodically (maybe once a month and he will keep it until I have to steal it back when he's not looking) 

Always, Always makes comments about how I dress - that I don't look good at all 

Will make me take photos of him (I'm a photographer) then post them all over his instagram and has never once credited me for any of the hundreds of hours of work it takes to do. 

Won't eat my cooking, makes snarky comments about how his is better 

Will regularly meet up with all of my friends for lunch and what not and purposely blow me off so I won't come. (Once I asked where he was going and he just said ""out"" then left. Posted all over his instagram his ""lovely"" meal with one of my friends) 

&amp;#x200B;

Since I'm in Japan at the moment none of my friends or family are online and I'm sitting lonely and feeling stuck in my hotel room :( I feel like he's really emotionally manipulative and not good for me but I don't know what to do. We have a week left in Japan.. I feel like I'm always forgiving him, always apologizing around him... what do I do :(

229,"Me (20F) and my husband (20M) live in NJ with his parents and siblings. We live here because it’s free so we can save money up to move out in 2-3 years. I love my in-laws and they like me, but it’s crowded having almost seven people living in a single family household. (Our room is actually the living room that branches off from the rest of the house). 
I commute an hour and a half four days a week to my job as a barber and work for 11 hours those days and I’m exhausted constantly. (To put that into perspective that’s 14 hours of driving and working in a job where you stand all day, not counting getting ready and getting home and powering down) On my days off I tend to sleep until noon because of how tired I am and on the days I work I’m usually so wound up I can’t sleep. (I end up sleeping maybe 4 hours a night) 

I only make about 48k a year if I keep my numbers up and that’s not really enough to move out. (Unless we wanna save no money) He’s working an hourly part time job while he’s in college. I’m just so stressed constantly. I just don’t know what to do.

230,"If that title don't get ya, nothin' will.

I know folks here have got some real heavy questions and I don't want to distract from their troubles, but I'd really like some advice on this.  Hopefully it won't be too long.

I live in the middle of nowhere in Texas.  Obviously it's a very conservative area.  I have a small bit of land and four horses.  One of my horses is a stallion who is only interested in my gelding.  I made a post about it on the horse forums [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Equestrian/comments/ap5mep/stallion_disinterested_in_mares_only_likes_gelding/).

After talking with some Reddit folks and my vet, it seems like this sort of thing isn't unheard of and we've ruled out any medical or behavioral issues.  I've just accepted that I have a gay horse and that's fine.

I jokingly mentioned this to my neighbor and he's not fine.

He went off on some crazy religious rant about how my horse is unnatural and a product of the devil and that I should put him down.  I said I'm not going to do that and he said he'd do it for me.  

I'm usually a very calm person, but I went off a bit on him and told him that if I caught him on my property, I'd put *him* down instead.  He said ""you won't catch me"".

I've even spent a couple nights in the barn with him because I'm so scared that my neighbor is going to hurt him.

I can't call the police because I don't think it'd help.  I think they'd either blow it off, laugh at me, or agree with the neighbor.  I've also had a couple run ins with them because they think I'm an immigrant.  I know the neighbor has a cousin who is a cop too, but I'm not sure where.

231,"I am a senior in high school, my distance coach, we’ll call him F, who teaches at another school has a public Instagram where some students follow him and also he’s literally just the nicest man ever. He literally has given me money for food and even bought one of the kids on the team some AirPods cuz he’s just that generous. He does keep his distance, he’s not a creep or anything, just a good hearted man. Thing is, my friend and I went through his following on Instagram and discovered that he is really into bondage. He follows a lot of hashtags containing “white women” “women in lingerie” “extreme bondage” “tied” and all these really kinky pages. We haven’t told anyone and were thinking that maybe we should bring it up because we don’t want anyone to ever see that and use it against him. They’re normal things, he’s just an old man with some kinks and we’re just worried someone might call him out for it. 
How should we address this? Just tell our other coach or something? I’m sure by now other people have noticed but just haven’t said anything because they know he’s so nice and doesn’t deserve any cruelty :( ",22Mar2019,1

242,"Hello, Reddit. I'm in a bit of a tough spot here. Throwaway account as he browses reddit from time to time.

Some background:

I am a gay male. I've been with my current boyfriend for somewhere around half a year now. He is transgender FTM, which I have absolutely no problem with and have made sure to let him know that I do and will always support him and be there for him. 

For the first couple of months, I really thought that he was going to be the one that I would be with for a long time. Things were great, and we were both happy. 

However, a few months ago, I began to have doubts. He said that he loved me, and I didn't really know how to respond to this so I kind of avoided responding. After that, I started really thinking about everything, and came to some very personal realizations. 

We had talked about the topic of sex before, but I had never really thought about it too much. He identifies as asexual, and, being transgender, has dysphoria associated with that area of his body, which is completely understandable. However, I myself am a rather sexual person. I loved being intimate and sharing sexual experiences with my past partner, and it's something that I really do enjoy. Him being asexual and FTM immediately lead to doubts on my end, as I do not believe that I could ever be fully happy or keep him fully happy if we were to be in a long-term relationship.

I have been trying to think about how to break up with him for quite a while now, and don't even really know how to even begin such a conversation. I feel terrible for my reasoning behind the breakup, because it seems selfish, but I know it has to be done because otherwise I won't be happy in the relationship and, consequently, we will both end up miserable, which I do not want to happen to either of us.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I don't want this to be a horrible breakup, because I really do care for him and want this best for him. He's a great person with a bright future, I just don't think that we are a good fit for each other.

261,"Throwaway, in case he happens to read Reddit. 

**tl;dr:** My nephew is 26, has stupidly unrealistic goals, fails to even take steps to realize those goals, lives in his grandfather's basement, works a dead end contract job, and beyond awkward. He's also stuck. His mother and father are out of the picture. As his aunt, I want to help, but am conflicted on how to do that and how to get him engaged in the real world. Wat do?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Background: **My nephew is ... ""special""** and I don't know what to do with him. 

Part of it is not his fault, and part of it is. 

On the one hand, his father was a deadbeat, my sister had him way too young, and was a deadbeat herself. She home ""schooled"" him into an asocial, cringey, weirdly co-dependent teenager that was utterly incapable of anything at 18 (Cross the street by himself? Beyond his ability to process or perform safely. I am not exaggerating.). He didn't get his GED until 21. In his early twenties, a genetic thing manifested appearance wise that it legitimately not a big deal, but crippled what little confidence he had in social and relationship settings. After that, his recluse basement dweller strangeness morphed into inceldom for a little bit, *which was unbearable*, and then subsided. You can't quite fully blame him for how dysfunctional he is. It it's hard to ignore how bizarre his just *is* \- everything from appearance, movement, and behavior. I would guess that he is not 100% neurotypical, but at the degree he seems to be it's a hurdle to adapt to (not an inescapable fate that leaves him crippled and a lost cause). 

(Before you ask: My sister is 8 years older than me, so I wasn't really in a position to take an active auntie role in his life when I was 9 years old and save him from all this/see how fucked up it was.)

On the other hand, he is 25, has no plans, no realistic goals, has refused to get training, doesn't take concrete steps to even realize the bizarre goals he has, and is noxious at times (His grandfather once was carted out by paramedics after a heart attack, and nephew complained to me that they were noisy and woke him up *as I was getting in my car to go to the emergency room to deal with a father who might be dying \[He's ok, it was small\]*). He thinks that everything is a-ok, when the only reason that he is not on the street is because grandpa foots the bill for his essentials (mainly housing. Here in LA, rent is expensive). He does not meaningfully contribute to the household. His last ""job"" was more him giving away labor as an unlicensed carpenter for a couple stores that were opening up and not getting paid. The new job gives him money, but no benefits and it is a contract. No insurance. No savings. No plan for when he gets older. 

Unfortunately for him, grandpa is getting old and has potential health stuff that could strike. He's on medication to help stop more heart attacks, but something can happen him to a point where he needs long term care at any time. When this happens, the house will likely be sold to pay for that care and nephew will end up homeless with no phone or anything. Even if grandpa stays there, his savings are being expended in part because of all the money that he pays to support the nephew. The whole thing could blow up, but according to him his plan is just to keep in his hole in the basement.

Ha.

**What's good about him?** He does know a thing or two about carpentry. He has niche interests, some of which are interesting. He, thankfully, isn't into drugs and he got over his incel moment as far as I can tell. He also *has* been getting better over the last years. He is kind to animals. He's gone from being unable to do anything -at all- independently to taking the bus by himself and going to his gig on a regular basis. He is less off putting today than he was before. He has earned more money than her mother has in her life time (...but that's not saying much, since sis hasn't held a job since she was 17). Progress is happening, if slowly.

Unfortunately, at this rate he'll be a moderately well functioning adult when he is in his late thirties. He doesn't have that time. If things don't change, he is in for some very bad times when all of the support he has silently been getting crumbles. I've tried to drill it into him that everything he has could vanish in a terrible, horrible moment. I've tried to use gentle talk and optimistic supporting planning about the future. I've brutally laid waste to his asinine bullshit at other times. I've been the serious aunt and the friendly aunt over the years, but whatever approach I take doesn't seem to be effective.

**Why is this your problem to fix?** It's not, technically. He's his own adult, at least legally speaking. I could watch it all implode, but that seems more cruel.

If anything, it should be his mother that steps in and rights this. ...but that will never happen. So, I'm the only competent person in the room who *can* help and has the means to do so right now.

**What am I willing to do?** I am willing to help him figure his shit out. I had a shit late teens, but I managed to figure it out (with help). It's not like my experiences don't translate over, for the most part. I can teach him how to do his taxes or give him direction on a real career path. I can assist with a TAP card to help him get around town and I can help him figure out his finances. I have experience and my shit together and I am willing to lend that. Probably more, if it was part of a clear plan of action that leads to him being independent. 

**What I am not willing to do?** Allow the status quo to continue, entertain bullshit that isn't backed by action, or throw more money at the problem (I think the equivalent of a $1500 a month subsidy in rent/food/utility is plenty). I'm also not willing to take him on as a full time project to manage as my own kid. I've got a two year old already to take care of!

**What do I want?** I want my nephew to grow into a person who isn't entirely dependent on his grandfather for existence and who is ready to deal with the real world (tm). I want him to understand how damn *expensive* everything is and that these nonsense gigs he ends up in won't cut it. I want him to shit or get off the pot about his wild dreams and, in general, stop being so complacent. I'd like him **out** of the house or **significantly** contributing to the household there, but not this lazy mooch garbage that is happening today. 

**What's your relationship like with him?** About as bizarre as anything else. I'm unique in the family that some of his more manipulative streaks are completely ineffective. In at least one case, I have gone a little overboard in establishing that fact in our (rare) fights and that freaked him out about a year back. It's not exactly good, but it's completely ruined either. I've been trying to rebuild it, but I'm also running out of time.

His mother is a deadbeat and gone. My dad is starting to decline and too nice. My mother is dead. No other relatives in LA. I'm the most reliable person he has, even if he doesn't know it, but I don't know how to actually shake this up before it's too late.

What the heck do I do with this kid? Where do I even start?",22Mar2019,1
262,"Alright this is a really complex situation so bare with me here.
Backstory: my sister (31) started dating this guy (31) about 10 years ago after her marriage failed. Ever since they started dating, she started doing drugs for the first time in her life and became addicted, he has physically and emotionally abused her and has even gone to jail for 8 months for domestic violence. He has also made numerous sexual comments about my mom and I to my sister. He had an obsessive crush on my mom when he was 17(my sister and him were friends in high school before they started dating), and has made comments about me since I was 13 and he was 23. He has made jokes about my sister and I having sex with him right in front of both of us, and my sister did nothing.
Per my sister’s request, I have been civil towards him and bit my tongue, up until now. 
So. He sent me the following message a few days ago: “hey sexy girl. so help me out, how do i talk xxx into a group play with her and ur mom? (i’m sure she has told u about how i had a huge crush on ur mom and no disrespect but i know ur mom felt the same, at least used to) and i have ALWAYS wanted to have “experienced” mom and daughter(s) cuz of course your more than welcome to join in if u would be interested! and i am not being a smart ass i am for real and this is not  another notch i’m the old belt. i have always been had a thing for older women, example: with a 42year old when i was 17years old!”
I’m really unsure of what to do, or if there’s anything I can do. I want to tell my sister, but I fear that if I do, she will confront him and it will escalate, resulting in him hurting her. They both live 7 hours away, so I’m not concerned for my safety at all, I’m concerned for her life. I also have a feeling that if I tell her this, she won’t leave. He’s caused her so much harm, and if that hasn’t made her leave, I’m not sure this will either.

265," was in high school as a younger boy. She was an older girl. She inserted herself into my life slowly like laughing at my jokes butting into conversations responding to stuff to talk to me or laughing. Asking me to repeat stuff to her then wait for me after class to scare me after we talk. I met her because she laughed long and hard at a bad joke I made then asked me to repeat it to her then after I talked to her waited after class for me to pop out say boo.She began finding any way to talk to me. While talking got red made no eye contact and smiled while hiding her face. Blushed around me. We’d joke around and tease each other a game between us. Her friends acted funny. Her friend pushed me to her. Her friend would ask me to be around them and find any excuse for me to, when her friend sat between us and talked to me and flirted with me she didn't seem to happy had an attitude. She wanted to be next to me and didn't want her friend between us in pictures. We started taking selfies and she'd want me to get close to her for all. She sent me the picture so I could post she would like it then tell me in person. She would approach me with her friend and her friend would just push me to her, if I ignored them or walked away they would follow me and just continue trying to talk to me. She got dressed up and her friend came and got me for a selfie with her. She found any way to talk to me and compliment me. Hover around me and try to talk to me, approaching me with her friends help.When I was minding my own business she would giggle say my name. Do it when I looked at her. Blush when I say hi. She liked a picture with my dad tagged in it to then tell me she likes it, so she can show up on both our notifications. While talking held never ending eye contact and smiled not stopping in silence. I'd break eye contact and she continues standing in front of me staring at me. She found out info about me to tell me. When I talked to her tried to scare me or take a selfie with me. Stare at me every chance. She showered me with so much flattery and attention. But the thing is, she never left me alone. She began butting in intensely when I talk to other people, especially girls and she would just start laughing loudly, butt in respond ask questions. I made a joke about moving out of town and she had some issue with me she stopped talking to me. Her friend told me I hurt her feelings. She continued staring at me and stuff but not anywhere near as happy. Then when I was talking to another guy she started screaming at me out of nowhere and calling me names attacking me. Her best friend would look at her and say her name when I enter a room. The thing is she never stopped, when I ignored her she would continue giggle and say my name when I said something bad. Say my name when I talked about something bad. Continue trying to butt into my conversations. She just never left me alone and didnt stop flirting with me. Say my name like bossing me around when I talk about something bad. I would just talk about height and weight to someone else and she said ""Nobody else is as big as you"". Her Friend would go around finding information about me then tell her and she told me everything she heard. She just never stops flirting and just so aggressive and when I ignore or just don't do anything she continues. Its like she would reward me if I talk to her by flirting with me, waiting for me after class to scare me or selfies and all her compliments. As I got older and saw her around she went to a place with a clear view staring at me. I saw her at her work and she did that. I went to her work once and she saw me said hi, was in one spot then moved to another that was a clear view she could see me in and I could see her and she stayed there the whole time and stared. Then I saw her in a car. I stared at her not knowing it was her because she was laughing loudly. She looked over at me she held eye contact and stared back at me, when I broke eye contact didn't stop and watched me leave. She did this when my mom was right next to me. I broke eye contact and didn't look back. She didn't like that. Months later her and her mom go back on my fb to remove their likes on a pic dedicated to my dads death. Her mom liked my dad and she obviously talked about me to them because she found out that my dad bought a motorcycle from hers. After that she had an attitude, I worked with her, she stared at me while putting on a jacket and didn't stop when caught and the supervisor said something and she was shocked. Well now we go to the same college she saw me when shes walking into her class and I was leaving that class she was showing up on time and sat down stared at me when I wasn't looking for a few seconds. Now after seeing me shows up 30 minutes early walks by looking in at me then walks by many times like 4+ times stands in the doorway then waits outside.

I've tried to make plans with her again but she never replies to my messages despite saying we should do it again and so we carry on at work like nothing happened. I also work with her mom who's poked me about when I plan to see her daughter again. Am I doing something wrong? If her mom's resorted to talking me into trying more does that mean she's interested? My biggest dilemma is that I never date in the work place. that ""don't shit where you eat"" mentality has saved me a lot of trouble I don't know why I'm straying away from it now for this girl but considering I haven't wanted to be intimate with anyone in the two years since my terrible break up I'd say I'm pretty interested in her.

267,"Sorry in advance for the long post/shitty formatting I’m very sleep deprived right now. 
In October I got what could eventually lead to my “dream job”, I was hired as a seasonal beauty advisor for a large retailer. It was so fun and everyone ended up loving me! I was officially hired for the position I wanted with a high end brand in late January. The thing about this brand is that they immediately send you to a “school” for 4 days. They flew me across the country and paid for everything, including sending me home with some expensive products from the brand. It probably amounted to at least $2000. At school I learned how to do everything a very specific way, and now I have to get “certified” next month, which means that my boss’s boss will be coming in for one of my shifts and watching me the entire time, critiquing everything I do. The thing is, after going to this school I feel like I’m not right for this brand. I’m going through some depression and severe anxiety right now and I really don’t think I’ll be able to go through the motions and actually pass the certification. I want to quit but I feel like total garbage for wasting their time and money, especially after they sent me on this fancy trip.

Didn't want to respond to that. Still don't, but since I am I'll try to be comprehensive. I'm not going to excuse or defend my self. I'm angry and I'm hurt.

I don't think its fair to continue to be angry with or to start resent you if you're not aware of why; if I've not told you, so here we go. You've said and done alot to anger or irritate me but other day marks one of those times where you also hurt me. This is not my new ""family unit"". YOU are my mother. No one will ever replace you. If you had some crazy notion that was possible let me first dispel it by with ""I'm fuckin 20"", and continue with I love you. 

Its been some years since this all kicked off, its been shit and it always seems like there's another shoe to drop. I've tried to be there for you because I care for you and want to be apart of your life and you apart of mine not that its been easy. Nearly every time we've talked  there's been vitriol. Some times to me directly or for association. I tried to listen for your sake I think, so you could vent, but its been years now. I'm done hearing it.

Maybe as a parent you think its only your domain to be upset or angry at how you're talked to or treated. Its not. I've tried to set some boundaries. Simple ones I'd like to think; Not set as many should have, and not as hard as I'd have liked. What few I had made, you've given little consideration. I've felt anxiety at the prospect of talking to you for a while. Its been unpleasant. You start to be hostile and I start to feel hostile that's just how it is. Than I'm feel like I'm getting the double standard applied. That i've got to just be a sound, board and if I get upset or angry than it just compounds and its best I don't want to participate. 

If we want a civil or even pleasant relationship some things have got to change.To reiterate some and add some others.
If you're hostile towards me probably going to feel hostile because of course. Don't hold me to standards of communication you don't hold your self. People are emotional its not cause for condemption, but predictably if you want more pleasant exchanges be more pleasant.
Do not tell me what I think or feel. Do not insinuate what I think or feel. Its always been hostile and or self victimizing. If you'd actually like to know what I think or feel I'd be happy (or what ever the fuck) to tell you.
I know you know children of divorce don't like hear a parent talk bad of the other. Maybe you thought since I'm and adult it wouldn't matter or I expect you didn't care. I've never enjoyed it and I'm not hearing it any more.

Maybe you feel too ""righteous"" to care think or feel, but I spent a long while writing this, and longer still to send it. I had to think whether it was some I wanted to say and if it was worth saying. I think it is. I ask that you give the similar consideration before you respond. I don't expect you will and so to give my self some time to wind down after writing this and optimistically time for you to have a measured a response, I'll be blocking you til the 25th.

I love you and I want to be there for you. I want you to be apart of my life and to be apart of yours. I do not have the desire or the fortitude to be an emotional punching bag and I don't want to spend my time in anxiety at the prospect of talking to you. If we don't set and maintain some healthy boundaries than our relationship is going to rather stilted and laborious.",22Mar2019,1
270,"Okay, so here goes. 

This all started when I started dating my current bf of 1.5 years. When we started dating, he introduced me to his friend group, made up of 2 other couples. We are all between the ages of 22-28. Originally, they were really nice and cool, so we started hanging out with them pretty regularly. Everything was going really good with our friendships up until a month ago. 

Basically, one night, one of the girls in the friend group singled me out and basically insulted me. I had not insulted her prior to this, so I had no idea where this was coming from. After the incident, I decided to be non-confrontational because I didn’t want to 1) Rock the boat and 2) make my bf feel upset that me and his friends were not getting along. 

This week, they all came over, we had a great time playing cards, drinking and talking. However, tonight, I asked on our group chat if they wanted to hang out, and the same girl responded very curtly. I guess one could say I’m a more “sensitive” person, but given the past incident, I decided not to be quiet about this. Long story short, an argument between the 5 of us broke out and the girl left the chat. After all of the drama, I asked my bf how he felt and he agreed with me that I was being singled out and basically got ganged up on in the group chat. 

Now I’m concerned about what the next step is in the friendship and how I should navigate trying to patch it up. The complication lies in the fact that I don’t particularly care for this person (we are just different people) but if I don’t patch it up, I feel that our friend group will be forever splintered. Also, I don’t want my bf to feel alienated from his friends. Please help. ",22Mar2019,1

Recently, I bought a new car. I kept my old one as well to drive it to work and not put so many miles in the new car. This has caused so many issues with parking at my house. My brother confronted my mom the day I bought the car and told her I had to park one of the cars on the other street since there is no room for his work truck(his boss’ truck, my brother does not own a vehicle) my car and my old car. There is room for all three cars in front of the house because we have done it before, but in order to not cause any problems, I decided to park my older car on the other street. 
Today, I get home from work (already in a bad mood) and I see my brother parked so that no other car could fit and also had his friend’s truck blocking the driveway. I was already fed up at this point because he has been pulling this shit since I bought the damn car and just sat in the car and cried out of frustration and anger. I still didn’t tell him anything but I was visibly upset and he told me he would move his friend’s truck, which he did not and instead put out the trash cans on that spot. I ended up having to park both cars on the other street. What pisses me off is that he does not contribute to anything in the house. I pay my parents rent every month and help them with any favors they might. After all, it is their house and I am grateful that I don’t have to pay a huge amount of rent. My brother doesn’t worry about paying my parents rent money. Whenever he feels like it, he will pay $100 at most. I dont feel entitled to those parking spaces in any way, but come on, does he really have to take up every fucking spot. At this point I feel like he is being petty especially since he hasn’t said ONE word to me since I got it.

I worked at a hotel this past year as a front desk rep and the first 3 or 4 months were cool. The more I started working there, the more I noticed some things that completely disgusted me.

 The problem is bed bugs. Management has had about 10 rooms out of order for months, but haven't done anything to treat the infestation. The maintenance guy who knows how to run the machines, is paid under the table and is the least reliable person I have met. Management refused an offer from the payrolled maintenance guy to take the training to deal with the issue. I asked my boss why they weren't taken care of and he gave me the run-around saying that under the table maintenance guy was dealing with family issues, supposedly his dad has cancer. If that's the case why didn't they hire an outside entity to take care of the issue when it arose? It would've been cheaper to pay for the training for payroll employee, seeing as I've done the math and they lost on average 28,000 dollars/month with those 10 rooms being out of order. 

And if anyone knows anything about bed bugs, the only way to treat is high heat. They're also likely to spread to other rooms through electrical sockets, walls, etc. At this point the entire hotel should be shut down and treated. Not only does this affect our guests, but every single employee in the hotel.

299,"TLDR: I found out 3 months ago that my mom is having an affair. I confronted her about it, we agreed not to tell anyone for the sake of my father and sister, as my father deeply loves my mother and is the sole source of income for our family. He would be wrecked by the news. I’m tired of holding this secret, I hate being around my mother at home, and I need to get away. 

I’m in a tough spot here, I’m the most unhappy and depressed I’ve ever been. I’ve contemplated suicide. 
To provide some context:


About 3 months ago, I was lying awake in bed at about 2 AM surfing the internet as I wind down for sleepy time. I’ve got my headphones in, but I can hear a voice having a conversation in he living room. This is not unusual considering my mother will regularly sleep in the living room and (like me) stay up late watching TV. So, I figured the voice was just my mom keeping the TV semi loud in an intense scene. The conversation goes on for awhile, so I take off my headphones to tune in, realizing immediately it’s my mother on the phone with someone. I came to the conclusion that she was talking to someone named, let’s say Alex, (a childhood friend of hers) about her torn feelings over their relationship. Basically my mom was/is in love with Alex, but he didn’t love her back. She was upset about it all, eventually the conversation ended, and I was left in silence and shock to think through what I just listened to. 


After several hours of shaking my head in disbelief and building up rage and anger, I finally fell asleep because I had to get some rest for a class I had he next day. The following morning I told my mom I knew she was a liar and there was no way I would ever be able to trust her again, and then I went to school. Needless to say, that was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. Of course I couldn’t focus in class and told my professor I would need to leave early, so I did. On my way home, my mom texted me saying that “we need to talk, and away from home so your sister doesn’t hear”. So I get home, take my mom and to a church parking lot where no one is around, and I unleash every ounce of anger and hatred I thought possible upon her. She had been telling me, the one person in our family who she shares any secrets with, lies for who knows how long. After hours of screaming at her at the top of my lungs, I eventually calmed my self down enough to hold a conversation. We concluded that, because my father is the sole provider for my family, and he loves her deeply, we couldn’t tell him because the lie would destroy him mentally/emotionally. My sister and I rely on him too much for that to happen and have no back up support (financially) in place. 

3 months pass today, I’m about to start my next term of college and I’m miserable. Anytime my mother is at home, I feel enormous anxiety and stress just by being around her. She, at this point, believes everything is “Okiedokie” as far as I’m concerned. More than anything in the world right now I want to get away from her. I know I have to tell my dad at some point but I just don’t have the foresight to know when a good time is.

301,"So basically I’m not really sure if this college friend of mine is really a genuine friend or just simply being friendly.


I want to start off by saying that I feel like I might be overthinking this thing way too much. I tend to have a issue of being in my head a lot and it causes me to worry a lot as I’m mostly a quiet and shy/introvert kind of person but I’m not really sure what’s going on here.

So for starters. I’m 20 and she is 33, we are both currently going to college, which is where we first met and we have known each other since 2017.

So far when we interact in person she seems to come off as very good and genuine, for example she has taken me to places with her and has taken me out to eat and stuff and has payed for me every single time (Every time I make sure to mention I have money and can pay for myself and she still pays for me anyway).



When we see each other we can talk to each other for forever about any and everything, she talks about her issues and troubles with me that I never hear her talk about around anyone else so I figure we must be in pretty good standing. 
She always discloses information about her and I do the same. 

For example she mentions that she has been in several abusive relationships, both emotional and physical in the past.
She is currently single and she says she still suffers from depression and PTSD from her past relationships, so I try to be as supportive and helpful as I can.

I’ve been over her place a couple of times and she does a lot of nice stuff for me which I don’t ask for (I always try to reciprocate when and where I can)

However when it comes me to trying initiate stuff or anything with her usually through text (again trying to reciprocate) it always feels like a lost cause. Either I get flat out ignored, or she comes off as very random and kind of wishy washy.

For example I have had times where I figure “okay I guess she is not interested anymore, time to move on” like everyone does.

Because usually if someone stops talking to you or whatever after a while it’s usually because they’ve lost interest, especially if they are ignoring texts.

But then out of nowhere she will randomly hit me up or if we bump into each other at school it’s back to where we left off.
It’s been like this throughout our friendship.

I figured if she was not interested in being friends with me she would have been ghosted me a long time ago, but yet clearly...

if she is making an effort to go out of her way to do stuff that most people wouldn’t do for someone that they didn’t at least had some type of interest for. obviously she is interested in having some type of friendship with me.

Especially considering most women are probably not going to spend their money on some random college guy acquaintance that they have no interest in being friends with.

However if she was interested in being friends with me then why is it so difficult to initiate anything with her as far as when it comes to hanging out or trying to do anything?

If most people are not interested in being friends with someone, they cut off communication and move on.

For example We managed to text all day Wednesday
(She saw about me getting a job on Facebook and she hit me up to congratulate me and we started talking like that)
On Thursday she invited me to come over to her place.
I come over, we hung out, she took me out to eat (again she payed and offered to take me to dinner out of her own generosity) We had great conversation. we came back to her place and we hung out for a couple more hours before I left and went home. Overall seemed to go pretty well.

Then the next day(yesterday) “boom”. Hardly any communication from her. I sent a text or 2 just to try and take the initiative and be friendly.

And
I either got flat out ignored or she sends a one “2 to 3” word text. Almost as if she lost interest so naturally I’ll stop talking.
but usually after 3 weeks or up to a month she’ll randomly hit me up and suddenly we become best buds again. 


I’m usually good at discerning if people are genuine or not but with her she seems inconsistent and it’s hard to tell exactly what’s going on.

I’m not sure if I should keep being friends with her or at least bring this up and let her know how I feel to find out whats up before I let it go, if that’s even what I should do.",22Mar2019,1

306,"So the other day my boss approached me to provide “constructive feedback” about some very minor issues which had been reported to her. I’m not too concerned about the feedback; it was minor and caused by a misunderstanding not any real issues. It should not have been a problem. However I am not happy that she decided to bring them up as if they are a big deal, and in front of my colleagues. It was really embarrassing and totally inappropriate. 

I work for a big organisation, and we often get training on bullying etc. So I can make a formal or an informal complaint about this. But I could also be branded a trouble maker and people could say I’m blowing it out of proportion.

308,"Hey, folks-

A few months ago I moved into my dream apartment. It’s a 200-year old brownstone that overlooks a famous lake in the heart of wine-country. When I moved in, the landlords informed me that the downstairs neighbors “yell at each other”. It was said in a joking way so I didn’t think much of it. 

Well, I’m not laughing anymore. They apparently own the unit they live in and have lived there for several years. 

They SCREAM. At every hour of the day. I don’t mean they yell at each other because they can’t hear, I mean they literally scream, like how you would if you saw a dead body. I’ve seen them outside and it looks like they do this for no apparent reason. It’s unbelievably loud. It goes on all day- this week I’ve been waking up to it at 2-4AM, and no fan or white noise drowns it out. Unfortunately, they do not speak any english (they are from Serbia) and I have no context of what they’re saying. I have contacted the landlord and my complaints keep falling on deaf ears. Now they won’t even respond to me or return my calls. Apparently this has been a large issue with every previous tenant and there is nothing they can do since they own their unit (which is directly below mine). A part of me wants to call adult protective because clearly they need help, but I also don’t want to ruin any lives. I’m feeling stuck. I cannot reiterate enough that the screaming literally takes place all day. It seemingly never ends. 

What are my options here? 

TL:DR- Senile, elderly neighbors scream bloody murder every hour of the day for no apparent reason and landlord can’t do anything about it. ",22Mar2019,5

311,"Hello! Thanks for showing interest in the title, I am deciding between the two app ideas to work on for a project but am stumped. No expertise needed, just choose whichever one you like better.  


**prompt: we are designing for a future where telecommuting (working remotely from home) becomes the norm**  


idea 1: lunchbox subscription   
\- you sign up to receive weekly/biweekly pre-made lunchboxes paired with an app  
\- when it's your lunch break, you sign into the app using your company ID  
\- app links you to other people in the industry currently taking their lunch breaks, sets up a video call, and you share your lunch break together  


overall it helps mitigate the loneliness people can often feel when working from home, added bonus is networking opportunities  


idea 2 - elderly teaching native language  


this concept is based on the idea that my nieces/nephews (ages 5-11) have no understanding of their native language, so their parents' solution is to ship them off to their grandparents' home and they pick up the language from there  


what if grandparents could have a broader reach than just their immediate grandchildren?  
the app enables seniors to teach children how to read/write their native language through fun learning exercises over video calling.   


this also helps mitigate loneliness, boredom, etc that seniors often feel in retirement. it also gives them a way to earn income.

So I (20F) just entered last year as a freshman in college. I didn't go to highschool because of a financial problem situation but I did take an exam equivalent to a highschool diploma. It's been so hard to keep up in school, I feel so stupid. My classmates are younger than me and it's really eating me up knowing that I'm the only one that doesn't understand the lessons. I just took my last quiz in Differential Calculus hours ago and I I'm not sure if I will pass this subject. Our final exam will be next week. 

Other than the fact that I'm struggling with my studies, it's been so hard hanging out with my friends because some of them do not accept me. I mean they'll hang out with me but when the subject about me being gay comes up they'll either just keep quiet about it or joke about it. You see I'm not straight, and I've been struggling with it since I was 14. I haven't told my mom about it because I have a feeling she'll be sad about it. My mom is the best person that I know but I dropped a few hints about it and even jokingly said that I was gay but she said ""No you're not"" and it hurt. I don't want to hurt her because she already has enough on her plate right now. She is the only provider in our family right now because my father left us last December, I don't know why I said that last part.

- I feel like my long distance bf of 5 months is slowly losing interest in me.

I mean, is it too much to ask for support? I don’t feel like I ask too much. I don’t even tell him of half the times when I get a meltdown and I’ve been there a lot for him as well. Yet, he still wants me to tell him every single problem I have? We’ve had a sort of “break” to reignite the flame because we didn’t really had anything to talk about anymore and I was being too clingy apparently except that it didn’t work in a good way because he kept sending messages about how much he misses me so I don’t know what to think.

His family are big mourners and every year on his birthday in January they all meet up and celebrate his death at his gravesite and talk for hours about him and grieve together. They also do this on his death date (March 22).

Excepting that my daughter was born last year on his death date. Today It is her first birthday... on his death date. 

My in-laws OFTEN talk about my baby's birthday and my BIL's death in the same sentence, and it makes me uncomfortable. I don't think she should be lumped in with such grief just because she was born on the particular date he happened to die.... she didnt choose the day she was born!

This year, I don't know why, but I naively expected that my husband would be happy to celebrate our daughter's first birthday... but instead he was too busy grieving, and was in a foul mood as she and her sibling opened presents. He was grumpy, withdrawn and not really present. So I asked him why. He wanted to focus on the death of his brother. I asked him if he thought it would be more helpful to focus on the living... (ie. His daughter! and our other kids) so he got angry and drove away to his mothers house! I called to talk to him, but ended up having an argument with MIL. They're both still not talking to me.

I am worried that my daughter will grow up with the shadow of her uncle's death, and that being over her head every year because she was born on that day... 

Is it fair to ask my in-laws to put aside their grief when celebrating my daughters birthday in order to honor her with joy? 

Especially seeing as they already grieve his death on his own birthday in January - why do they need to make a big thing out of it on both days??

335,"So, a little about me: I’m 15, living right now with my mom and older brother in a nice, cozy house. We’re okay financially. My dad has been out of the picture for a while now. He and my mom got divorced over five years ago when he left her for another woman who turned out to be an abusive bitch that smashed his phone and clawed him like a feral animal. They adopted a dog together we named Percillus (was supposed to be Percious because I was obsessed with Percy Jackson at the time. Just goes to show how goofy my dad was). Shortly after he and his girlfriend parted (she took Percillus) he got a blood clot. He was hospitalized for two weeks. At the time I didn’t know the gravity of the situation, to me not much had changed other than “dad has a cool new apartment” and “he and mom aren’t together anymore but that’s okay, they still love each other. They still love me too!”

After that was when everything went downhill drastically. He had a terrible stroke and to this day still cant feel the affected side or talk. Or think. Or do anything properly. That was around the general time my brain tells me he died. I know he’s still my dad but is he really? He doesn’t remember me, the things I liked, or all the things we did together, all the love we shared. He’s now just some bumbling idiot wearing the same skin. Even worse, to get the proper care and therapy he needs, he had to move with his parents on the other side of the country. He used to drive us up there in one long road trip so we could visit before the stroke. But a couple years ago my brother and I flew there to visit him and our grandparents. It was one of the first times we’ve ever traveled without our mom. 

Long story short, my grandfather got in a racist fit about my mom’s side of the family (we’re half Mexican) and tried to fist fight my brother. My grandmother added fuel to the fire, my uncles were no help and refused to let my mom talk to us, and my dad was getting so angry at my grandpa for threatening his children that a vein popped in his eye. I had never seen my grandfather angry until that day and it was terrifying to see what nearly 6” of ‘nam veteran looks like when he’s about to literally beat your ass for no good reason. My mom had to buy us emergency tickets back home. It was then I knew how fucking awful my family was. To this day I have had no contact with my grandparents or my uncles. I’ve blocked phone numbers, torn up mail, and refuse their insincere apologies. 

Flash-forward to the beginning of high school, almost two years ago: everything hit me like a truck. I had grown up a lot since everything unfolded and there have been constant what-ifs and “how could I have been so stupid?” I spiraled into depression and my anxiety worsened (I’ve always been an anxious kid). I got diagnosed February of last year. I despised school and moved through my day feeling like a ghost. My biology teacher got fired at the end of the year for sexually assaulting a girl my age which shook me to my core. All throughout summer while my anxiety improved somewhat, my depression worsened. I started my sophomore year and attended school before throwing in the towel at the end of October. 

I was so exhausted. Mentally and physically. I always made A’s and B’s, never had to work hard for good grades, was always on task and respectful to others so it was so confusing to me as to why I was becoming a burnout. I had had multiple crazy anxiety attacks before my mom pulled me out that included uncontrollable sobbing and screaming. I started homeschool at the end of November and for some reason... nothing has changed. 

I have mood swings, I think about killing myself, I sleep all the time (or not enough), I eat too little (and sometimes too much) and I’m always in a state of either perpetual nausea, pain, fatigue, or hunger. I’ve asked my mom to increase my dose of Lexapro, she doesn’t want to because it makes me sleepy. Whenever I’m bad or get into one of my bitchy, uncontrollable moods, she threatens to take away my therapy. She attributes it to hormones which, sure, may hold a part in it but I think she’s overall in denial. And you know what the worst part about it is? I know when I’m being mean and terrible but I can’t stop myself. I’ve ruined so many good nights just because I suddenly feel like locking myself in my room violently and there’s not darn thing I can do to stop it. 

While homeschool is great, every other aspect of my life sucks ass. It’s SO HARD living without my dad now. I love my mom and my brother and they do their best to support me but our whole family dynamic feels like a three legged stool without my dad. I honestly think that if he weren’t a selfish jerk leaving my wonderful mom for a homewrecking whore then my life wouldn’t be like this. 

I want to die. I have dreams and a future not too terribly out of reach but every time I think about affording it or going to college I get that black hole feeling in my stomach and eventually become so frustrated that I want to cry. I’m a smart kid, I’m creative and I feel like I have a lot to offer the world but I may never reach my full potential. Ever. 

I don’t know how to fix this. I don’t know what to do. ",22Mar2019,0

I feel like this because I have an immune disorder that I was born with that makes me feel like, “if a guy could be with someone who doesn’t have health problems, why would he choose to be with me?”

338,"I'm 20, I'm studying physics at university and it sucks. I chose the course for childish reasons, which basically boil down to 18 year old me thinking he was way smarter than he actually was. ""I'm not too interested in physics and I don't like maths, but physics is a really good degree. I've always been a top student in my small town, I can coast."" LMFAO. Big fish in a small pond and all that.

So I've come out to the big city, been humbled a lot, grown up in a lot of ways, but my head is still under an enormous amount of pressure. I've realised that my dream is to write music for video games, which conflicts an awful lot with the amount of mental energy I have to devote to my course.

Dropping out is probably a bad idea. I've nearly done it a bunch of times, but it's hard to justify when as of now I'm so unskilled in my craft. Plus, I'm already halfway through my degree. The way forward is probably to complete the degree as a safety net, maybe even pick up a cushy part time data analysis job or something. Then I could explore my relationship with art *without* becoming a starving artist.

The problem is that I'm constantly doing this weird emotional balancing act to keep me from feeling miserable. I'm stressed out all of the time and I can never fully be on top of my course, my social life and my want to make music. There's a not-insignificant amount of substance abuse going on, my self-image is really low, etc. etc.

My finals for 2nd year are in less than 10 weeks, and I have a **LOT** of work to do. My quantum physics exam has the lowest pass rate in the entire uni. All the while, I have this voice in my head reminding me that I'm not getting any better at music because I have no time for it. I feel guilty complaining, because I'm from a middle-class family and my physiological/safety needs are met. But it sucks so fucking much. I feel so strongly that I'm not reaching my potential as an individual.

To do well in my exams, it's looking like I'll have to devote myself entirely to physics for the next 10 weeks. Honestly, I don't know if I can do it without burning out. I don't know how hard it is compared to other things, but studying physics at university level when you don't enjoy it is fucking hard.

This kind of just turned into a rant, but... What kind of advice would you give a person like me?",22Mar2019,2
339," Hey ya'll, I'm a 21 year old male on the autism spectrum and have been out of work since the end of 2017. I have been applying to work for a few airlines as a flight attendant (with the encouragement of a family friend). United Airlines contacted me about doing a video interview. The thing is, my family doesn't want me to pursue this job and think it is a bad idea because they don't want me in another state by myself (the job would have me relocate).

In terms of work experience, my experience is very limited. I didn't work for most of high school because I wanted to focus on school. I worked two jobs during 2017 for a couple months at a time (was laid off from both) and had a very brief stint at a UPS distribution center last year (I didn't last there because it was too fast paced for me). Right now, I feel as if I am backed into a corner. I was on my father's military health insurance plan, but was dropped when I turned 21. My depression/anxiety medication costs an ungodly amount for a 90 day supply. If I were to get back on my father's plan, he would have to pay an extra $300 a month. This job would pay me $18 an hour and offers benefits, taking care of my health insurance issues. Plus, I get to travel which is something I love to do. To be entirely honest, I think my family (even though they mean well) are being way too overprotective and worrying too much and I want to go through with this regardless of what they think.",22Mar2019,1
340,"So I'm 20 years old and I quit smoking 7 months ago. I miss the romance of it a lot sometimes, like the nostalgia of lighting one up at the canal beside my work in the beating sun.

The thing is, I want to start smoking again for my younger years, maybe until I'm 23. But I've made it 7 months and my willpower won't let me smoke again, whenever I'm presented with the opportunity (which is often because a lot of my friends smoke), I can't do it.

I know it sounds like a good thing because I'd feel like I let myself down big time now if I smoke, but I don't want to never smoke again just yet.

It was never serious for me and as friends and lovers we sort of drifted apart. He wouldn’t return calls for weeks and I didn’t mind; I recognized he was working on his career. In early September I met a guy (Zach) online and we started dating. By the time the holidays came around we were very heavily invested in each other and very much in love. I had been dealing with a lot of health issues and he was so supportive of me and would accompany me to doctors appointments. I found out in February that I was pregnant, and pretty far along (27 weeks). This being said, I knew immediately it was Shane’s. Initially I was afraid to tell Zach but eventually I did and his reaction was very surprising. He doesn’t care it’s not his child since we love each other he wants to remain together. I ended up reaching out to Shane and letting him know about the pregnancy but not Zach. He has been the type of guy in the past to be very jealous and spiteful and I didn’t want any drama. Few weeks go by and now Shane has been invited as a plus one to the shower. Is it wrong to say he can’t come?

345,"I’m going to try to give some background without blabbering on too much about irrelevant shit. So, I’ve been hospitalised three times for suicide attempts, all impulsive ODs, but I’ve got suicide on my mind a lot (which I am receiving help for from medical professionals) and I’ve been experimenting with razor blades and looked into other methods in the past.

I met this guy on a night out in December with my partner and his friends (some of whom I was friends with before getting together with my partner, but mostly his friends). He came back to our place with the rest of the group, and I had a long, somewhat intoxicated and deep conversation about mental health struggles and life with him. He told me about his bipolar, and he said if he was going to kill himself he would have done it by now. He also said he would take his dog with him if he were to commit suicide. We hugged after our long chat and we learnt a lot about each other.

A few weeks ago this guy hanged himself. My partner and I have talked about it a few times briefly, and I’ve explained to him that this guy’s suicide has had an effect on me even though I barely knew him. I wonder about his dog, and I can’t stop thinking about him hanging himself. It’s got me thinking about suicide a lot more, and I feel like going to his funeral next week might help me to remember him as a person instead of just how he died.

I’ve spoken to my GP (doctor) about it and she agreed that it might help for me to go to the funeral. I’m worried though that I might seem out of place there. All of my partner’s friends will be there, and my partner of course, and I’m sure they’ll all know that I hardly knew him, and they might think I shouldn’t be there. My partner hasn’t explicitly said whether or not he thinks I should go.

She comes in and tells me all this and I watch him through the window approach the house he came to visit which is across the road and one house down.

He could have easily parked in front of that house but we quickly figured out why he didn't. The school aged girl that lives in that house snuck him inside since her parents were asleep, he didn't want to risk them seeing his car outside.

348,"I work at a school. A situation happened where when I told a a few students to not say the inappropriate things they were talking about in the front office area, they talked back with no respect to me at all and gave me attitude.

352,"Someone I know has at times invited me to things she was doing and I have said yes and thanked for invite and expressed I was excited or looking forward to it. Then as the event drew closer my friend sort went missing in action. I hadn't initially gotten the specific details; location time...whatever i'd need to simply put on my calendar and feel assured this was a definite. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then as it got even closer and I hadn't heard I had this weird sinking feeling that my friend changed their mind and perhaps did not actually want me to go and I was sort of being friend ghosted (just for this event). I know what you're thinking. Why don't I just call, email or text and say ""hey is this still happening? Can I please have the details""? But since this has happened more than a few times I just feel really weird about doing that. I am not dumb. I can take a hint and never like being places if I think I'm not welcome or wanted. I should point out that this person has a tendency to be indecisive and I'm well aware of this. I once actually confronted my friend about this exact issue and asked as directly as possible that if they invite me to go somewhere and do something I may just say yes and that she please be sure before inviting me.

Truth be told; If I were to just call, text or email and say ""hey is this still happening""? I know my friend would say ""Yeah of course"" and then provide the specific details, but I sense only because I forced their hand. This feels extremly foolish and not a position I prefer to be in. I never want to feel like I invited myself (and I hadn't).

Going to the police in my country does nothing. This guy has been working harder than Kris Jenner to turn people against me but isn't succeeding as well as he thought. Right now, the bullying has ramped up to incredible levels. He stalks my public Instagram page, he texts mutual friends about me (I have proof) and tells people that I'm the one obsessed with him. Who knows what else he does that I don't know about yet.

I've tried to confront him (which he told everyone I was crazy), ignore him (he lashes out), or lay low (which doesn't help). I grey rock, avoid, and if I have to see him, I only exchange greetings. I've cut out a lot of mutual friends that used to tell him things about me.

I just don't know what else I can do. I am mentally exhausted. I broke down last night sobbing because I'm scared about being stalked and him being obsessed with him. It is truly terrifying.

355,"So I am in Michigan. My last employer terminated me a month ago and has texted me on several occasions saying they are basically holding my personal belongings hostage until I drop a class the owner paid for me to take and give them the textbook for the class. 

Here’s some backstory though:
The owner pressured me into taking this class so he could save money and make me do the job of medical billing/coding and fire the company he goes through now since they are too much money for his taste. He wanted to pay me less than that and do my old job on top of that. He’s a pretty sketchy dude when it comes to how he runs his businesses tbh. He’s always trying to save every dollar and scheme to save money and rip others off in process. 

So it came time to sign up and everything was put into my name, but the payment was put on his credit card. The class was non-refundable and came with a free textbook. Neither of us signed any contract (though he tried to get one written up saying I had to work under him for x amount of time no matter what since he paid for the class). The contract never came about, thankfully. I wasn’t even looking to stay for too long as he was a doctor who is highly against paying for staff health insurance (he tried to get everyone on board with using him, a hand doctor, as our primary care/specialist doctor for everything we needed, even for gynecological issues....) I have serious health issues that require specific doctors so I knew I had to get out of Dodge before I get kicked off my parents insurance. He grew tired of my argument for insurance since he just wanted to save all his money and have no extra expenses.

So anyway they fired me and called me on my lunch break saying I shouldn’t have taken a lunch when I did because now I’m no longer needed. They took the weekend to apparently gather my belongings and keep them away from any other staff. They threatened to not pay me my last paycheck since I didn’t drop the class or return the book. So now they wisened up and realized I was legally entitled to my wages, but my paycheck came in the mail today saying my belongings are waiting there in exchange for my textbook and proof the class has been dropped.

So what can I do? I don’t want them to 1. Be able to bully who ever they want and just make power plays to win satisfaction. It’s not fair to anyone else they encounter, as I feel is just encourages this behavior with him. He is ALL about intimidating his patients who can’t pay and anyone who offers their services to him. And 2. Be able to take an opportunity away from me that, as I see it, was gifted to me. 

They claim it is written in the employee handbook, but I’ve never been given access to that, and they also claimed it was in there that they can withhold a paycheck for that reason too. 

I’m so upset with all this because I not only feel like a failure for being terminated, but my anxiety is through the roof trying to not get walked all over by them.

So how can I legally get my stuff back? Should I take an officer with me to get it? Is it theft on their part? Do I have any legal rights here to this class?

PS Sorry if I rambled a lot. I have been so stressed out and can’t get my mind to settle for two seconds it seems because of all this. I even had to block the manager’s cell phone because she kept texting me threatening texts about my belongings and check.",22Mar2019,1
357,"Hi guy !  I am new here so I hope there is no error while making this thread. First of, I know this is an embarrassing question but I am too embarrassed to tell people around me in real life. 

I watched this random old movie the other day titled 'The Ron Clark Story' where this guy named Matthew Perry casted as a genuine, dedicated and charismatic teacher, Mr. Clark who struggled to make his critically delinquent students to be successful at school.

It's probably one of the best movies I've ever watched. The problem is throughout the movie, I had this accidental crush on Matthew to the point of me fantasizing myself being one of his student and getting his teacherly love. 

I find the personality of the character he played as to be very compelling with addition to his big bonus on gorgeousness factor being my worst nightmare right now. I can't escape from his sexiness ! 

Now, it keeps distracting me occasionally and the thought of being his student and gaining his affection and attention keep popping up randomly while I am doing something totally unrelated to the movie. I also lose appetite right now, not kidding. I just can't get this demon outta my mind right now. 

So, if you guys ever have this problem before and overcame it by whatever means or just know how to solve this, I implore you to share some advice to help this 'desperate imaginary student' here. Thanks !

I really love her, but i feel more and more like this relationship is a lie. i want to date boys and girls, not just girls, but opening up our relationship is no option. i´ve told her that i was bi about two years ago, but she didnt know how to handle it so after a few weeks we never talked about it again. this has somehow really killed my trust and confidence. And while ageing helped me to accept that beein bisexual is totaly ok, the only place where i feel ashamed of it is at home with her. 

We talk way less than we did before i told her now, and while i still love her and really enjoy her company, i always feel kinda sad too.. We live together (we always have been living together, we jumped into this relationship head first), and i started going to uni last year. We have been through some rough shit together (i was heavily addicted to amphetamines as we first met and through the first two years of the relationship) and i feel like leaving her after all this would be wrong. She really helped me become the best person i´ve ever been and supported me as much as she could.

she is really into the thought of marrying and having kids, but i cant. it would be a lie, especially since i never wanted kids or a marriage. even more so because i would cut out a part of who i am, and lets be honest, that wouldnt work out very well.

364,"So this guy (M,23) and myself (F,22) hooked up back in January multiple times. He’s a mutual friend of my best friend. I’ve said to my best friend before that I think this guy is cute, etc. I’ve met him a handful of times before. The guy back in November even messaged me off GroupMe since we were all going on a ski trip together and said on that on the trip he was trying to get to know me better yet never really made an effort after that.

So I go on the ski trip and this guy and I were instantly vibing off one another - flirting, making each other laugh, I was getting along with all of his friends and making them laugh, etc. every little thing I did this guy laughed at as if he was smitten by me. So Friday him and I stayed up until around 4AM talking, he then proceeded to carry my bag to my room in the house we rented just being the nice guy he is. The next day/night we all had SO much fun and we were indeed drunk and I knew I at least just wanted to go to his bed and sleep next to him. We were flirting all night before this and we ended up hooking up. In the morning he made me breakfast in front of all of his friends and was normal and nice to me all day like before.

The following night we hooked up again. I was going to my room and he said to me, “where are you going?” And I said, “bed” and he goes, “my bed?” And I said, “sure.” Like casual in passing conversation. We talked for awhile and hooked up again the following night and it was good like before. We cuddled all night after that too same as before.

The next day we had to leave the ski trip and go home, we were busy cleaning up the house so we didn’t say bye.

I added him on Snapchat Friday night and he added me back so I don’t know.

His friends think this is weird though because he’s not a one night stand kind of guy. He never takes girls home and usually has sex with girls he’s into which we obviously were/are into each other. He’s actually a really nice guy but this behavior seems weird. He has low self confidence and you can tell. His foreplay game was through the roof and I was into that. I made sure he got off too, the sex wasn’t bad by any means.

One of his friends asked what he was doing and what his intentions were with me and he said, “she’s just too much of a woman for me” insinuating that I’m too good for him? Weird. I feel like guys if they have something good they want to keep it ya know?

2 months have gone by now and I’ve finally confronted the issue.

He said and I quote directly from him, “I don’t date after hooking up. I think it’s a bad idea, and a bad start to a relationship, just my personal opinion. The other thing I feel like we really only talked when we were drunk. I didn’t really feel a connection.”

Which is fine but I guess what I’m hearing is that he’s put me in this file in his head that because I had sex with him that I’m not dateable or worth the time. 

It’s not the fact he won’t date me it’s that fact that in his head he’s just put me in a lower category to the point where I’m not dateable or good enough for him.

It’s that he said from the jump that I wasn’t good enough for him to date and for that reason he had sex with me. 

Am I in the wrong here? I am so hurt that someone would even make this assumption about me. 

He then 2 weeks later made it a point to go around and tell his friends what happened between us and exclude me from weekend activities. I’m hurt but also confused. 

I feel like he’s seeking some sort of validation? Or trying to not seem like the bad guy? ",22Mar2019,1

Now, I had agreed in the past to have a threesome at some point down the road, but I refused right then and there because all of us were too drunk, and I told him already that I don’t want it to be a person we know. 
I will admit, I freaked out pretty hard, I asked him how he’d feel if I wanted to have a threesome with one of his friends that he’s clearly jealous of to hurt him, and he told me that I also sexually abuse him.

He won’t touch me intimately unless I put his hands there myself, and he doesn’t react to anything new I try to do in the bedroom. 
I know the easiest solution to my problems would be to break up with him and try someone else, but he’s the only man I’ve ever been with, and I love him more than anything. Our sex life is the only downside to the relationship, we share most of the same interest, get along with one another’s family, we love our pets together, and he can always make me laugh, no matter how much time I spend with him. 
He left our house last night to get away from me and I spent the entire night in fits of panic. As I’m typing this my hearts beating a mile a minute, I miss him so bad but I’ll never be able to forget the words he said to me. 
I don’t know what to do. He gave me until this evening to decide if I still want to be with him or not. 
Are these issues that we can get through?

368,Ok so I’ve been best friends with this girl for over a year and sorta recently I got feelings for her but wanted to keep it to myself because I was ok with being friends. Today she told me she likes me but she doesn’t want a relationship and wants everything to stay the same because she doesn’t like internet relationships. I basically thanked her for telling me and nothing would change. But it made me not want to tell her I liked her back and I have so many emotions right now and I don’t know what to do. I’m like on the border of crying but I’m also happy at the same time. I just need advice on what to do ,22Mar2019,2
369,"So on instagram I was friends with a guy and some drama broke out and his account got deleted. I found his new account and I requested to follow him on my personal account and another one of my accounts but he didn't know it was me on my other one so he messaged me asking if I was going to delete him and I obviously said no and I told him who I am so he let me follow him. 

A couple of days later his account gets deleted again but I never noticed until he followed me on a new account and he gave me his snap because he said he won't be active on instagram anymore (he's still active) and he told me on my snap that he thinks I'm the one deleting him because when I followed him that's when he got deleted. I was confused so I screen recorded my Instagram and showed the notifications on all of the accounts I own and my blocked list to show that I didn't delete him (when u report someones account instagram gives u a notification) so then he asked me to not delete him and I said I'm not going to and I told him to block me so I can prove it isn't me reporting him and he did. 

So I went on a group chat we are both in and he told his friends I'm the one reporting him when I showed him that I didn't report him. I have no reason to report him anyway when we were friends. We started to have a heated discussion and he said as soon a I followed him one of his posts got deleted so I said I'd deactivate all of my accounts to prove it wasn't me and if another one of his posts got deleted then message me on my snap. He said if it turns out to be me he's going to tell everyone to report me 🤷🏻so all of my accounts are deactivated now. It's just upsetting to be accused of something u didn't do.

Anyway what can I do to convince him it wasn't me? If I don't get replies it's understandable it's kind of a weird situation😂thanks ",22Mar2019,4

373,"As the title says, I'm struggling with my perception of my sex organ. Some history:
I am happily married. 
My wife has been with approximately 35 other men. 
I have a 7.5"" x 6"" penis when erect (bone pressed)
I know my wife has been with at least one person with a bigger penis than me. Not a big deal, really. She can't get off from sex and says she never has. Also not a big deal because I LOVE going down on her which does the trick. The issue is, I have told her that I fantasize about having a big dick and she's not the type of person to really talk openly about it. I asked her from her experience if it's big, and her response is that it's ""maybe a bit more"" than most. Or she'll say that it's ""not small"". I should be OK with being average, but I've grown fond of thinking I'm pretty damn big. If she would just tell me that one time, I would feel great, but I can't unhear the things she has already said about it. I have this notion that my wife thinks my dick is... Meh. It is affecting my performance at work because I'm obsessing over it and she doesn't like talking about it because she thinks I'm guilting her for not being able to cum from PiV sex. I just don't know what to do...

tl;dr my wife sees my penis as average and I want to feel like a stud.",22Mar2019,1

376,"Warning: this is lengthy. Does anyone else feel like their appearance causes them trouble in a professional environment? I am a 30F and I am a nurse. I have had an extremely long, and surprisingly difficult life journey up until this point (although I understand completely that that’s all relative, so I’m not complaining) I’ve been working as an RN for about 6 years, but because I have moved around a lot, I am perpetually new. I’ve moved because my hometown is riddled with heroin, and a poor economy. My goal was to meet someone and have children, but no such luck, and I feel very strongly that my home state isn’t a good place for that. There are a bunch of valid reasons I left, but let’s just say it is not easy when you have almost no support system and are fairly new in your profession.

The thing is, I sometimes feel like there is something fundamental about me as a person that makes people not trust me in my role. I’m sure counseling would help more with this, but I’m terribly discouraged. I am always told that I look very young. I was in line for a complimentary (alcoholic) drink the other day at a hotel and the man pouring them pointed over to where the kids can get their pineapple juice instead...if that helps paint a picture. I often....and I mean often....get trouble from coworkers and patients and family members that I am doing a poor job, with very little understanding on my part thus far as to what specifically I am doing poorly. Part of me thinks it might be because I have the appearance of inexperience, but I work with other women who also look young...so I’m really at a loss.

I know moving around a lot has definitely caused me to be slower and less in tune with the work environments I’m in. Right now, I am working through an agency and I’ve only worked at one hospital, but almost each time I work,  I am sent to a new unit. This is a big hospital and there are tons of people. I have barely met or worked with the same ones at all. Every unit has a different layout and different passwords and a different flow. The nursing staff has a culture of not including or trusting the agency nurses and speaking of them behind their backs and it can be a pretty uncomfortable and rude environment. 

I feel like I’m a nice person though and I don’t sit down or take breaks and I work hard. I try to joke and have conversations with the other nurses but I have only had one job where people were nice and friendly. It may also be worth mentioning that this isn’t my first rodeo with bullying, I had trouble with it in middle school as well. I’ve caught nurses writing notes about me at work (at this current job) and the list goes on. Without sounding conceited (because I have terribly low self esteem) I am a normal looking, some may say attractive, girl. 5 ft tall, long brown hair, 110lbs. I feel like looks shouldn’t matter, but I’m just trying to figure out what’s wrong with me and it’s such an embarrassing thing to ask. 

Nursing is infamously a bullying and non-inclusive type of profession...but I see other nurses who don’t seem to have the same struggles as me, and literally for years, I have tried to understand why. It’s a mostly female profession, and damn, can we women be mean to each other. I guess it’s worth mentioning that I have moved around in jobs a lot because I had a terrible start as a new grad on a poorly staffed unit and I was bullied there pretty badly. But I stuck with it for almost 2 years while other newbies who became targets ended up quitting! So there’s that. I find it to be a really really hard job and I’m never measuring up. I have low confidence, and I’m sure that shows. I graduated with honors and I’m not a stupid person. But there’s a problem with my professional presence and I cannot figure out what it is :( 

TLDR : Having trouble feeling respected and liked in my professional (nursing) environment, wondering if anyone else has had the same trouble, and why. Looking for advice.",22Mar2019,1

378,"Okay, so I got stuck in some deep snow a few weeks back and needed to push my car out. While I was pushing, I didn’t notice that my hand was on my reverse light and the light shattered very easily under the -30 Celsius weather and the force of my hand. Basically my hand went through the light and when I pulled it out, the snaps that keep it in place broke too so it’s kind of dangling on one side now. Fast forward another week or so I put red lense tape over the light and it was fine for about two days until it got really cold again and was very windy. The tape didn’t like the cold I’m assuming. Now here I am with the light still hanging and this morning a cop was sitting on the side of the road in his car just looking at it and I’m assuming he was taking notes or whatever. Now I ask myself the question, do I order a brand new reverse light for about 60$ Canadian or try tape again? It’s a 2005 Mazda 3 if that makes any difference.

381,"I left a job I loved after I had a baby. My husband and I weren’t able to find affordable or adequate childcare, and it made more sense financially for me to stay home. He works full time, my parents don’t live here, my sister is a full time student and works full time, and his parents weren’t living here when I had the baby. I left on good terms, and I’ve kept in touch with my supervisor and former coworkers. My supervisor told me when I resigned that my job would be available whenever I decided to return. It seemed too good to be true, even though I have a great track record and was good at my job. 

About 6 months after my daughter was born, my husband’s parents returned to the area. But before we even considered asking them about providing childcare, we wanted them to watch her frequently so everyone could get to know each other. Also, I wanted to breastfeed for 18 months or longer, so before I’d go back to work, I planned to wean from nursing and sleep train my daughter, just to make it easier on whoever would end up caring for her. Anytime I saw or talked to my supervisor, I made mention of my plans and how long I expected to be unemployed. She seemed to understand and yet still always extended the offer of returning to work to me. 

I met up with my supervisor and some other coworkers in January, and she brought up the idea of me coming back to work. She sounded completely serious. She literally said “the job is yours, whenever you’re ready.” I said I wasn’t quite ready yet, but I would be very soon. There were just some things I needed to arrange first - weaning and sleep training. 

Well, that day has officially come. I weaned my daughter a month later, and sleep trained her a few weeks after that. I wanted to first speak with my in laws about watching her before I reached out to my supervisor. They were so happy I even asked, so I reached out to my supervisor about returning to work. 

I shared the good news and explained the situation to her and asked if the option was still available for me to come back to work, but she didn’t respond. From speaking with my former coworker, I know they’ve been particularly busy lately, so I gave her the benefit of the doubt. I waited for her to respond, and by this time it had been about a week. I reached out again to make sure my message had been received, but she still didn’t respond. The next day, she finally replied that she was bad at responding and that she’d send me a well deserved response after she got off work. Well, that never happened. I was getting pretty frustrated and uneasy about it all. I just wanted either a yes or a no. So the next day, I texted her to see if we could meet up for lunch next week. She responded immediately (I should say, she’s usually terrible at texting too) and we have plans to meet. 

I’m getting myself psyched out of this whole ordeal. I know coming back would technically be her doing me a favor, as I need a job for financial and mental health reasons. But I can’t help but feel like I’m just being strung along. That whatever promise she made me was false, and I can’t actually return. She’s just too afraid to tell me. Her responses or lack thereof indicate that she’s about to turn me down, but just doesn’t know how. I just think it would be nice to know yes or no, otherwise, don’t promise someone something like that. Am I overreacting? Should I just try not to think about it, and wait to have lunch?",22Mar2019,0

She stayed with my husband and me for about a month last year. She called us scared for her life, because her boyfriend was beating her. We drove two hours away to her town to pick her up. We helped her file a police report, with her busted lip and broken cheek bone as evidence. She only had the clothes on her back, so I spent about $300 letting her buy clothes and things she needed. She told me she would pay me back no matter what I said, but I did say I wasn't worried about it.

We drove her back to her hometown because she wanted to live with her dad. A few weeks later, she was back with douche supreme, and changed her relationship status on Facebook to engaged.

I really want to help, and she claims she'll pay me back in a few weeks when she gets paid. But she doesn't even drive. I am thinking it will be basically her boyfriend's car, and she's just trying to help pay for a new one because he ran their last one into a ditch.

386,"I feel like I'm screwed no matter what. I was told I should get an associate's degree in dental hygiene because of 3 reasons. 1. Great salary. 2. Off on every holidays with only a 9:00-5:00 weekday job and 3. It only takes 2 years to complete the program. But then, when it says 2 years, it meant I can't even get a part time job while studying for that degree. All my time should be dedicated to the program, the campus is 45mins away from my house, the pre reqs are hard (such as pharmacology, anatomy, chemistry, physiology etc..), the course schedule is required to be taken from 4:00pm to 10:00pm from Monday through Friday and then an additional course on Saturdays. So I decided to look for any other degrees, I researched digital media, communications and interior design, these are degrees that I can somewhat handle but none of them are actually in demand for the job market. It feels like, it's not even worth it. If I stay with dental hygiene, would it be possible to take the courses for more than 2 years?

392,"I am going to be making a video game, although I am not sure if I am ready to do it yet. I started to collaborate with someone on the story and they're and author and I have a good feeling about finding a good story for a game. And they invited some people to the discord server and they can serve roles that I need, however, I have no way of knowing of when we will get started and if we will even finish. Games take a while to make and I don't even know how long people are willing to stick around and I worry that I will eventually have no say in stuff or any control. I have no evidence to support this and I am naturally suspicious of people. The original story idea was one I liked quite a bit and the person helping me with writing pointed out that it is too similar to Portal and it wasn't very original. I agree with them on that one. 

That person came up with a story idea, but I feel like it puts the protagonist's sexuality in the spot light rather than a good story. I am worried about many other aspects such as whether the story will become too much like Fallout or something or if I am unable to keep up with the pace of progress on the game or whether the story will come out well and be original. 

Although the story premise is really vague since we are just starting and I don't know where it's going. I don't know what to say to the others about this or whether I should tell them we should make the concept now and start designing the game later on. I have stuff going on in my life and I worry I won't be able to do enough of it. The team is fairly small too. It attracted attention from these people because I want to represent a minority (sexual orientation) in the game and I worry that they will make the whole thing just a demonstration of what the sexual orientation is or put it too much in the spotlight to the point there isn't a story.

The people seem pretty kind and cooperative, although I am still worried about how this is organized and how this will work. I am mostly just worried about the story since it is very vague for now. So what should I do? ",22Mar2019,1
393,"I work for a small business. My employer has a tendency to (knowingly and without apology) cross the lines of what is appropriate, delving deep into the personal lives of his employees. 

He has an innate need to actively seek ANYTHING that he can use to bring unwanted attention and scrutiny on his employees. As a victim of sexual assault, his actions make me feel like I am being stalked by a predator.

He hears me (and others) when he is asked to back away, but I truly believe he is CONVINCED giving people this kind of over-the-top, manipulative, and frightening attention is what they need. It feels like he only knows how to upload his own perspective into others without considering anyone else but himself. He becomes ferocious and demonstrative, breaking things and shouting, if you don't subscribe to his often irrational beliefs.

When people leave this company, he stalks them, running a dedicated smear campaign against that individual, contacting mutual professional acquaintances to poison their impression of the ex-employee, scouring the internet and social networks for something he can use to shame/embarrass then, until they're no longer interesting to him as a victim OR (and I'm not joking about this) the ex-employee changes their mind and COMES BACK.

He's like an abusive boyfriend who exhausts every resource to convince everyone around him he is strong and doesn't need anyone to be successful, all while clearly demonstrating that the opposite is true.

394,"I've hit every roadblock I think there is now. 

I'm a graphic designer with over 10 years experience in industry, a fairly broad portfolio working with a wealth of clients. I have a wide range of hobbies and interests, and I would hope that I am fairly fun to talk to.

My anxiety disorder is not me, but it's doing it's best to control and ruin my life. 

I want to see the people I love and am friends with. My anxiety disorder wants me to cancel every plan, to throw up, to not sleep, to cover me with bruises.

I want to keep the job that I had for 5 years, not because the subject matter is incredible, but because I'm good at it, and have devoted years of my life to growing the company. That company fired me because of my anxiety disorder. I repeatedly asked for support, understanding or time to help me. For the occupational health visas and suggestions to be honoured. Terminated.

I want to pay rent and go to the shops for food as and when it’s needed. Rent is late, food has to wait. I receive support to help me pay bills but it doesn’t cover them, and so I have to borrow money.

The support I do receive is based on the idea that I look for work whilst i receive it, but I receive no actual support to help me look for work. That’s fine, not everyone who looks for work has their hand held. I get that. But the job I need doesn’t exist.

I’m told that mental health isn’t a thing to be ashamed of, or something I need to hide, yet it’s lost me a job and is the only thing preventing me from finding a new one.

I’ve been in touch with employment advice organisations, nothing. I’ve spoken to charities who ‘specialise in putting people with disabilities’ in contact with employers. My first phone call with them today, resulted in them telling me my anxiety disorder is a huge barrier, and that I need to fix that before they can help.

So what is the suggestion? I have to remain unemployed despite being able to do my previous jobs solely at a computer with an internet connection? What is the reason that can’t be done in my home office?

At this point I don’t even care what job I do as long as it’s home based. The dreams I had of being a graphic designer can die if it means I can just work from home.

Yet every work from home site I find wants me to buy something. Buy a PC and our software so you can take phone calls. Buy credits so you can bid on someones fucking pitch. Out bid someone who is willing to work for £10 for a 100 page booklet and countless hours of work. Accept non-contract, un-secure jobs like that, when the design packages you need to work alone, cost £30 a month. Forego food some weeks because you need to keep those packages paid for, on the off-chance it could result in freelance work.

I have tried free-lancing, I’ve tried reviewing things, I’ve tried a you-tube channel, I’ve tried word processing, I’ve tried translation, I’ve tried subtitling, I’ve tried music services, I’ve tried logo design, book design, tee shirt design, brochure design. I have messaged every design studio I know offering my services. I have tried. And that’s just the employment side of my life. I’ve tried IAPT, CBT and anti-depressants. If you can believe it, they made things worse.

There is literally no support at all for someone with a mental health issue, who wants to work from home. Even the charities set up to literally connect me with potential employers tell me they can’t, and that I need to change in order for there to be a chance for me. (Spoiler: If i could change to the point where my anxiety is no longer an issue for me, then I literally do not need support or help).

So, what in the flying fuck do I try now? Is there anyone you know, have heard of or read about, overheard in a bar, have a second-removed cousin that can give me SOME advice on just what I can do to land myself that work-from-home job?

And I’m aware of how self-pitying and downbeat I’m currently coming across, and I’m also aware, as I am frequently reminded, that people have it far worse than I. So apologies for that, and to anyone who read this whole thing.

TL;DR: I’m unemployed and have seemingly exhausted all possibilities of me finding a job. What’s next?",22Mar2019,1

When we first “came out” a few years ago my best friends husband pulled my bff away from me. I didn’t realize what was happening at the time, but when she started to come back around she was very open regarding the reasoning -she “wasn’t allowed over”.  She would make plans and cancel. Only stop over for short periods of time (like 5 minutes, where we used to hang out for hours just doing nothing) 

Her husband was convinced I am going to steal her from him. That when she comes to my house we just have “big ole gangbangs in the living room.” (NOT TRUE) so the best plan of action was just to cut us out. Eventually E made it clear that there was nothing happening, and that he was being crazy and insecure. Things seemed fine for a few years.

Now I am aware this isn’t a ME problem, it’s a him problem- but my best friend needs help now because its starting again. 

W was at my house this week, and he mentioned that E was coming over tomorrow (last night) to get out of their house and chill for a bit. He told me that he may have to work late and I said “That’s fine, we will be around all weekend if another day works better”. 
I found out last night that for whatever insane reason, he hung on the word “We”.  He freaked out. Accused her of cheating again with both my husband and I because I said “we”. 
We, meaning my husband and CHILDREN will be home vs. out of the house running errands, attending the kids sports etc. 
WE meaning my family. 

I cant keep doing this and I don’t know how E tolerates it. 
Its starting to hurt my friendship because I don’t want to be close to her for fear that her husband will pull her away again. 

When he talks to her, its always about how “were poly and overly sexual people and were going to steal her from him”.- Ive literally never changed. Ive always been this raunchy outgoing person. And E is NOT a bisexual or lesbian. W should know this. 

I know this is his own insecurities that he is projecting, but I need to find a way to make it clearer that this isn’t OK and I don’t appreciate being accused of something like that, nor losing a friendship. 

The last time this happened I had this conversation with him. I don’t feel calm enough now to do so, plus E wasn’t supposed to tell me about their recent fight. 


TLDR; My bffs husband is insecure and thinks because my husband and I are non-monogamous that were going to steal my bff from her husband. It’s a reoccurring issue.

407,"So, 16M here. Also, disclaimer: of course, I still love my parents, so don't call me 'ungrateful' or sh*t.

Half an year ago, we've moved to a house roughly 10 km outside of the main city. This has proved to be an issue especially because my highschool IS in the main city. We do have however a regional bus that comes once or twice per hour and that goes in the main city.

Ever since we've moved here, I feel like my parents have been imposing more and more rules on me.

On one hand, whenever I wanna go out with my friends I have to ask them to drive me into the main city and I need to tell them when I will be back so they can pick me up again. For some reason, they don't want me to take the regional bus. They also never let me stay out after the sun goes down.

On the other hand, everyday after school I have to take a bus to the periphery of the main town where one of my parents would pick me up with the car, and I am never allowed to hang out with friends after school, nor to be late to where we meet to drive me home(and I often do not have time to get there, so instead of a bus, I usually get  a taxi). I assume I don't have to mention parties, I am not allowed there.

Plus, my parents want to read all of my text messages with my friends, and I feel uncomfortable showing them, because they'd judge me for everything I say. They don't let me have a password to the phone, so I often hide my phone in my room so they can't find it.

Also, my dad always picks and pops my pimples, even though I ask him not to, and he imposes me to cut my hair very short 'because longer hair doesn't fit me'.


I have tried to talk to them about these issues, and the response I got was ""you do it because we say so. After you're 18 you can do what you want"".

This was the last surgery she should ever need, she was going to have the hairs growing into her eyes cryogenically removed.

418,"I don’t even know where to begin and there is really just too much to go into detail about. I’m just going to lay out some of the major issues and hopefully someone could give some good advice. 

Please don’t be too harsh as I know I’m young and I have a lot to personally work on, it’s not an easy journey. 

My boyfriend and I moved halfway across the country about 10 months ago, he is doing grad school and we didn’t want to deal with the distance again. There are things that I know aren’t helping....we have made no friends, we go to class but besides that spend all of our time around each other in our rather small apartment, and I can be pretty dependent on him sometimes as he is my only friend to talk to besides my parents. 

We have issues around the house (or at least I think so) where I’m doing all the dishes (no dishwasher) , laundry, cleaning etc. if I ask him to do the dishes he gets annoyed, says he will do it that day then never does. So basically I come home from class (way too often) to find him playing video games and the house a mess and I get enraged. This is where the problem comes in, I am battling how to deal with my emotions which come so strong. Because coming home and immediately being pissed doesn’t help anything and it makes the day go to shit for the both of us. 

Another issue, I have been having a very low sex drive the past year, I don’t have an explanation and he gets really upset by it. It’s something that has been getting better but it sucks that when I don’t want to he gets really upset by it. 

So this all seems a bit all over the place, there is just so much that is wrong that I can’t even begin to elaborate. I love him so much and he loves me, we can usually get over things quick and go back to our fun ways but things will not last if he and I continue to be miserable at times. I know I can be hard on him sometimes but when he says we can’t go out all weekend or hang out because he has work for school but then games until 8pm and THEN starts on work I just get so angry and annoyed then I pester him to start on his work all day and he gets annoyed (understandably).

I need advice on how to control my emotions, how to come to terms with him wanting to play video games all day sometimes, and that he isn’t the kind of person who cares about having the dishes done every day or the bed washed every week. He thinks these things are so minor while it really bothers me that I feel unappreciated for what I put in to make our home feel cozy. But that’s probably just superficial in accordance to the real issues.


Like I said sorry this seems so all over the place I just don’t know what to say. He is a positive person but likes to not be bitched at (who would). ",22Mar2019,2

422,"For the record, I’ve been through a lot in the last year. 

I almost died last March from a bacterial disease that secretes toxins that eats holes in your intestinal tract (c diff). I was only 22 and they didn’t catch it right away so the damage was done. Know I have a modified diet that prevents me from drinking alcohol, having dairy, greasy foods, raw veggies and excess sugar. I went from 115 to 83 lbs as a 22 year old female. 
I lost my job because I missed work (the disease was contagious and I literally slept in a bathroom for a month cause I didn’t have the strength to walk from room to room. 
I got a new job last summer as I started slowly getting better, that alone was hard, but I’m doing better. However this job is not bettering me or teaching me anything. I’m overqualified but I don’t have the confidence that I can find something better right now. I also started smoking medical marijuana to gain weight back, so I do that every day after work in order to have at least one meal a day (I’m always too nauseated to eat, it’s a lingering effect). 
I have no hobbies. I have no friends. I can’t work out or really better myself very much right now. I just feel numb. 

I also have an amazing boyfriend who just recently proposed. He’s been super supportive and understanding, but this weight is bearing down on him. I’m unhappy but not because of our relationship. I love him more than I’ll ever love myself. Which is why I think I need to work on me so I can be a happier and healthier person for him (and hopefully a family someday).  I just don’t know where to start. 

We are not wealthy people, but I have a lot of love to spread. I just have super bad health anxiety and I feel like I’m so lame that people don’t want to hang with me. The other ladies at work are so into materialistic things and I cannot afford nor did I grow up exposed to nice brands and events so I rarely know what they are talking about. 

How do I rediscover myself? Find a purpose or a hobby, or even make friends? ",22Mar2019,3
423,"Ok so first off, I just want to preface this by saying that I AM NOT INTO HIM. 

I am a 19 year old female and he is at least on his late 30s/40s and the thought of pursuing someone that much older makes me sick. He is an overweight smoker, and obviously every body deserves love, but I am not attracted to him physically. I have had he aside thought that if he was someone who had an athletic shape and didn’t smoke, I would find him attractive, but the thought of even entertaining a relationship with an older man makes me so fucking sick to my stomach. Especially a professor. That is a gross power imbalance. 

My professor is a man who struggles with severe anxiety, and as someone else who can definitely relate to that struggle, I decided to talk to him after class the other day to give him some encouragement, as he is someone who really struggles to keep it together during class time, and the other students are really rude to him about it. 

He seemed to be really cheered up by me telling him that I think he’s doing a good job despite having anxiety. He asked me how I manage it, and I gave him some tips. I also really encouraged him to seek professional help because his level of anxiety is not something that will just go away by itself. I was happy to help him, but I still worry about his well being because he’s a fellow individual who is suffering and my heart goes out to people like him. Clearly there’s something wrong if a teacher is going to a student for advice, but I knew that he needed someone to be kind to him, and I don’t think anyone else was going to do it if it wasn’t me. 

Fast forward to last night and I have this crazy graphic sex dream about him. And it was retaliating and LONG. It started with him asking me for life advice after class and then later on we were really getting into it. Keep in mind I’m a virgin who’s never even has her first kiss who struggled with sexual assault-related PTSD, so this dream is extra jarring for me. I just went on my first date ever a few months ago, and it was a huge milestone for me. And now I have this vivid image of my professor fucking me in the bathroom and it’s the most realistic sex dream I have ever had. I woke up and I began to feel sick to my stomach. 

And now, in 3 hours, I’m meeting with him via video chat to go over an assignment. The video call is going to last a very long time. I planned this meeting with him a few days ago before this dream happened. I’m honestly so embarrassed to face him. Does anyone know how I can get through this? ",22Mar2019,2

426,"To begin with I am a young guy with a little more knowledge in graphic designing and editing than most people at my age. (Highschool age to be more specific)

For the past months I've had a lot of free time to waste and instead of being on my phone all day laying on my bed scrolling through the net, I decided to look for small YouTubers to help with on their YouTube banners, logos and thumbnails for free. (Mainly gaming channels)

A week ago I found a quite popular player on a game I play who made a YouTube channel (he's still starting on the platform) and offered him help. I made him a banner and a thumbnail and he asked if I could work for him for a little longer.

I agreed, and followed him on his upload schedule making him thumbnails every upload FOR FREE and lately he's been kind of pissing me off. First, he promised to give credit and for the time I've worked for him there was absolutely none.

I'm fine with that, I don't really need his fans to know who I am anyway but the more I worked for him the more he became demanding as if I was paid to work for him. He sounds super arrogant and possessive.

He would email me at midnight disturbing my sleep demanding for a thumbnail because he was going to upload. He returned a banner I worked hours for because he wanted me to emulate another one, basically wanting me to rip off of another designers work because he knew I did digital art and wanted more.

Mind you, I work 3 hours minimum for each thumbnail and confident enough to say that I do good work and could get paid for it if I wanted to. Sorry for taking too long and ranting about this situation but my question is:

429,"So I’m not sure if posting in advice is where I should be asking about this, but I’m fairly new to Reddit, so I’m still learning. Basically, the background behind this is that I’ve had a handful of jobs. One I had left and went back to, one I had to leave suddenly (which I actually went to the HR manager at that job and explained that I had to go ahead and quit and not put in my two weeks due to family medical issues and needing a job closer to home), one  I was at for around 4 months and unfortunately was fired from (which the backstory behind being fired is a little complicated, and sometimes I choose to not put it on my resume. But that’s probably bad.) And then like two odd jobs that I was at for less than a month.

430,"My boyfriend and I are a long distance relationship. He lives in Michigan and I'm in Pennsylvania. We've been dating for about a year now and I love him with my whole heart. But I'm concerned.

Here's some back story. He is 26 and throughout his life, he went through a lot of severe trauma. He watched his grandmother die. He watched his best friend get shot in the head. He watched his mother battle breast cancer, have seizures and a heart attack, and watched her ""go down"" as he calls it. She's been in a coma for 4 years. Now I say that to say this:

A few weeks ago, we had a pretty nasty argument. We hung up the phone and stopped talking for about half an hour. He calls me back and starts talking to me like NOTHING just happened. That's not like him at all. Usually if we have a heated disagreement, we both apologize after giving each other a little space and move on. This time was different. He insisted he didn't know what I was talking about. I told him every detail about the fight and he said he doesn't remember. He even got irritated because he thought I was playing with him. But it really happened, y'all! This was a few weeks ago. I let it go because I assumed it was him pretending it didn't happen because he wanted it to be over.

Well it happened again today. But this time was worse. He's coming to see me again in the beginning of April, and the argument was so heated that I told him not to come. I told him that we don't have to be together if that's what he wants and he goes on to say that after his mother went down, nothing hurts him that bad anymore and he wouldn't care if I left. That was the end of the conversation because we hung up. Not even 20 minutes later, he texts me and asks me if I'm picking him up from the train station or not. Again, I'm confused AF so I'm asking him why he is pretending we didn't just argue. Same thing happens where he tells me he really doesn't remember. I told him everything he said and he said that he would never say stuff like that to me. He got offended when I kept implying we should get him help if he truly doesn't remember.

 I'm so confused. Is something wrong with him that we need to get him help for?? I'm worried about him. Or should I just ignore it? I love him, and I want him to get help if he needs it! But I need to know if y'all believe he's just pretending or he genuinely doesn't remember. This isn't like him!",22Mar2019,11
431,"Met a popular girl in class early February. Signs of interest: 
* Told me she was about to ask for my number after I asked for hers in case I need help in class 
* Engaged in conversations asking questions about me via text 
* Asked for my Instagram
* Asked if I was trying to study together when I simply asked if she started studying yet 
* Told me we should grab coffee to celebrate taking our exam 
* Also asked if I want to get lunch with her. The day comes and she’s wearing makeup and dressed up when she normally isn’t 
* Told me to meet up if I attend the concert she’s going to
* Said she wants to drive me to her city for food 
* Double texted me an hour later to make sure I like sweets before telling me she’d bring me some whenever she bakes since she has extra 
* Mentioned that she would cook for me to try some time 
* Brought me a dessert I never tried before and offered me food
* Has been including me in her list of nonpersonal snaps since I commented on a story 
* Told me I should take a summer class with her 
* Said we can get macaroons some time since I haven’t tried them. I set up a day but it didn’t work for her. However she put in effort to work around it
* Double texted asking if I still want boba when we hang out and said she gets excited for food dates 
* Flirts back and sometimes flirts first
* Got dressed up and had makeup on again for our second lunch 
* Both hangouts mainly consisted of asking questions to get to know each other better and a lot of the ones she asked was to find commonality 
* Second hangout: asked questions about the type of girls I like, who I would date, what age range, if I would meet them first, if I’ve been in a relationship, etc for 10 mins

Signs of uninterest: 
* Doesn’t really make comments about my stories or snaps 
* Even though she hints about how we should do this or that, she doesn’t set up the day or time herself 
* Hasn’t broken the touch barrier even though I have 
* During second hangout where she asked me about my type for 10 mins and flirted back and/or first, she later mentioned wanting to be single to grow as a person (she’s studying abroad next semester) and she hasn’t replied to my text even though she looked at my Snapchat stories

Is she not interested or does she like me but just doesn’t want a relationship? She says she wants to be single yet acts like this. Does she want to date casually or is she trying to get me to not try to pursue her? 

TLDR: girl in class seems interested (hinting to hang out, wearing makeup for hangouts, flirting first/back, asking questions about my type for 10 mins, saying she gets excited for food dates, bringing me food, etc (see above highly doubt I’m misinterpreting friendliness). however she mentioned wanting to be single to grow (she’s studying abroad next semester) 10 minutes after questioning me about my type and ignored my text but looked at my story.

It turned out that this 17 year old was living in a campervan at the time as the auntie had kicked her out of her home and she had nowhere else to be.

&amp;#x200B;

Now upon hearing this my parents instantly let her move in with us. I was moving out very soon to start a phd and my brother was at university. We had no problems with this the girl needed a roof over her head and my parents are fortunate enough to own a house big enough to accommodate her. I moved out almost before she moved in so I never really got to know her. Not long after this my parents decided to let her stay so she can be supported through college and into university and asked what my brother and I thought and we both responded saying that she was like a sister and of course (I regret this). 

&amp;#x200B;

Since then other shit has come out like she had broken feet because her mum broke them and she has had to get them all re-broken and set in the correct position. She also has a whole host of other issues and obvious mental issues. However she is also a liar. She will lie to my parents about the severity of her pain as she will tell them she can't walk and then there have been times they have left the house not knowing my brother or I is home and we will see her walking around fine. I have also attempted a lot of times to make conversation with her in the living room and she almost completely ignores me and is messaging friends etc. When my mum then says 'she just wants to get to know you' I tell her she doesn't and that she is incredibly rude and tell me mum what actually happens but my mum says 'she is just nervous'. I was a nervous and socially retarded kid I know how people behave in those situations and it isn't like that.

&amp;#x200B;

Now considering her life before my parents I can understand the development of compulsively lying etc but my parents are just so ready to go along with it and I am so close to blowing up at them. We will be having a nice conversation and suddenly she enters the room and my parents are like dogs they instantly ignore me and my partner and start saying 'are you ok' 'how can i help' (because of her feet but she can walk it is painful and there isn't anything my parents can do to reduce it she has painkillers and she can move around the house fine). 

&amp;#x200B;

As far as I am concerned I hate what this girl has done to my parents. I also believe that this isn't all her fault and that my parents are enabling her. However I have no idea how to deal with this as when I have told them in the past that there are certain behaviours that annoy me they just kind of say 'ok'. 

&amp;#x200B;

She is now at university but is home basically every weekend that I also think is awful as my parents kind of treat her like she is their new daughter rather than a now 19 year old woman that need to learn and learn quickly how to be sociable and behave int he real world.

434,"I have a new assistant.  She started end of last year and is fantastic.  She is competent and conscientious and I have no issues with the quality of her work.

The problem is that she is working too hard.  She consistently logs into emails after hours and stays in the office late.  We have a busy job so there is always work to do but she’s regularly hitting deadlines early and being overly meticulous.

Our organization has a rigid structure so I can’t offer her financial remuneration or a promotion or even flexible hours any time in the near future and she knows that.  Bluntly, I get paid the big bucks to be “online” 24/7, she does not.  She should be working a 9-5 and that’s it.

She’s early in her career and ambitious and likes the work.  The problem is that our field can be very high stress.  We work on difficult topics in difficult parts of the world.  I feel she needs to understand the value in having down time otherwise she’ll be heading for a self-induced burnout.

I have obviously already told her repeatedly to go home and (gently/jokingly) reprimanded her for being online after hours.  I have also explained the importance of maintaining a work-life balance in our stressful industry. 

But I have not been harsh about it because how do you reprimand someone for over-performing?!

Any ideas as to how I might best handle this?  Or should I just be glad for the extra support and milk it for all it’s worth?

P.S. She’s very much like I was at that age and I went through some serious breakdowns before I learned to chill and draw proper boundaries between my work and personal lives.

435,"I want to ask my parents' permission to allow me to start smoking marijuana, with limitations of course. I'm 18 and am going to graduate high school in 2 months, which is why I'm choosing to ask them this summer since I'll be out of school and going to community college. 

I'm suffering from anxiety and depression. Even though marijuana has a reputation of making you dumb and ""leads to harder drugs"" which I believe it doesn't, I am strictly going to say that I need to smoke to manage my anxiety. My mother has told me to do breathing exercises (which do not help in the slightest...for me anyway), and I used to abuse valium for a couple months when I was 17 until October 2018. I haven't taken a pill since then. 

Marijuana is so much better than anxiety pills like Valium and Xanax, they eventually lead to getting into Opium. It's also a lot better than moping around the house and suffering with that overwhelming feeling in your chest.

My mom used to smoke weed for a very long time when she was younger and has a semi-hard time being around it. So I will smoke in the backyard or even at the park if they want me to. 

I will pay for my own medical marijuana card.

I graduate in a couple of months and I’m realizing that this might not be what I want to do with my life. I originally went into music because I was talented and was able to get a very good scholarship to go to school. The up side is that I will be graduating without any debt, however I am completely unsure of what I want to do. I want to keep my options open so I was wondering if anyone could give me suggestions of fields I could get into with a music degree. One thought I had was perusing law enforcement as a police officer, however this would require more training. I would love to do something meaningful and that I can make a good living with.

I can’t tell him the full extent of this because he’ll feel guilty and stop reaching out for help, which would be self destructive.

441,"My boyfriend and I just graduated college last year, and he applied all over the country for jobs in his field. He happened to get a good offer back in our hometown. Now, when we were in college, his parents bought a condo to use as a rental property and rented it to us because rental prices are ridiculously high in our college town. They decided to sell that rental and wanted to get one closer to them, and offered to do the same in our hometown and have us be the first tenants. Which is great because rental prices are kind of high in our hometown as well. We got a great deal with a 3 bedroom 2 bath that came with most the furniture, which we sold most of our when we moved. 

They had mentioned before while looking for houses they might offer to my boyfriend's older brother if he wanted to be roommates, because where he lives now is kind of high rent. I have no issue with having a roommate, or it being his brother. But, the way they are going about it is ridiculous in my opinion. 


The house is like a split layout with the master bed/bath on one side, and a hall with the two beds and one bath on the other. They want to install a door in the hall to block it off and give the entire side to his brother. However, it sounds to me like he doesnt even have much stuff where he even needs the space- when he came to see the house their mom even made a joke of ""heres the spare room, for your laundry"". Because the rest of the house is furnished, theres really no room for any large items my boyfriend and I have. I'm okay selling most of it, but the problem is he has a desktop computer and I am in the process of looking for one. I want to go back to school for graphic design and may need a designated workplace for my career. I would like the spare room as an office space. But when my boyfriend mentioned this to his mom, she just said ""move stuff around or get rid of some stuff and put a desk in the living room or your room"". There is no space for a good desk anywhere, and I also dont find it fair that it would be set up either in the living room where it can be loud and distracting, or our bedroom where my boyfriend could be sleeping. 


On top of taking the room he probably doesnt need, they are considering getting him his own fridge for his room. We have a full size fridge already that would fit all our food fine. Then, he said if we wont keep the AC at 72° F all the time, he wants a personal AC unit for his room. Which both of those are going to make our electric bill unnecessarily higher.


I am furious over it all, especially because they seem to be catering to his brothers every need without caring at all what we think. I understand it is their rental, but we had no place to stay and needed it because we can't afford the higher priced rentals here. And the amount of privacy his brother seems to want, I think he wants to make it as close to not having roommates as possible. Like i think he wants to block off the hall because he thinks it will block out the sound from us in the living room. 


Does it seem unreasonable that I'm so annoyed by all this? I really appreciate his parents helping us like this, but I wish they would consider our opinions as much as they are his brother's. And I'm really not opposed to a roommate at all, but it sounds like he doesnt really even want a roommate situation to begin with. It's mostly the wasted space of the second room that gets me- my boyfriend and I would actually need it to comfortably fit our things while it seems like his brother just wants it to have that whole hall blocked off to himself. 

I've asked my boyfriend to say something from the start of this, before his brother even saw the place. He first insisted his brother wouldn't be interested so he didnt say anything, and now his brother is. And he is doing a ""trial stay"" with us this weekend. I have bad anxiety and am afraid to speak up to his parent myself about it. Plus, I'm not sure they will weigh what I say as much and their son. And I believe my boyfriend would know how to navigate a conversation with them better than I would. But he keeps putting it off and then insisting ""well it's not going to change anything, it's just what we have to deal with since it's their house"". ",22Mar2019,1

444,"Hello All!

Me and some friends have been dealing with an issue for the past week that has put a heavy toll on our minds and hearts. I came to this subreddit hoping to get advice on how to help my friend. Though I’m posting this from my account, it will also be viewed by 12 of my friends that are also trying to help him. Both our friend and everyone else in our group is male and between 13-15. 

Our friend, who I’ll call J, has been dealing with some issues for the last year. His sister was shot and killed by her wife in an argument, and he has been dealing with serious depression for as long as I’ve known him, which has been around 2 years. 

J has always been the forgotten child. He had 3 siblings, 2 older, 1 younger; all girls. His sister who was killed was his parents’ favorite, and they noticeably shut down after her death, causing his older sister, who is just 16, to provide emotional support for her siblings. 

J has been noticeably sad for a while, but usually he’ll just come crash with one of us and we’ll talk to him about whatever he wants to, and he always seems to leave happier than he was when he arrived. However, a week ago, he found out that he had bone cancer that started in his fibula. They caught it quickly, and it was easily preventable. 

However, to prevent it from spreading, they would have to amputate his lower leg.

We all told him that he should do it. Living without a leg today is easier than it’s ever been, and leg prosthetics are so efficient that it would hardly affect his life in any major way. It certainly isn’t a life ruiner. Despite knowing this, he refused to do it. He says that he hates living and that he’d rather live a short life than a miserable long one. He is estimated to live 6 years, and we know that by the time he will want to live, it’ll be too late, and the cancer will have spread. He thinks that his last years will be great, but in reality, they will be pain filled and difficult. We’ve tried saying this to him in every way possible, but he won’t budge. He’s sure about this. Unbelievably, his parents said that if that’s what he wanted, than they won’t fight him on it.

So we need advice. How do we convince our friend that he doesn’t want this, and that a missing leg isn’t something to die over? No one else seems to care about him but us, and I’m worried that this will be his final mistake unless his mindset changes. I know that it’s his decision, but HES 14! There’s no way that he’ll feel the same in 2 years, and frankly, we don’t want to lose a friend to preventable cancer. ",22Mar2019,8
445,"So first off: I'm 19. This has been going on on and off (mostly off) since I was maybe 14 but definitelty 15.

Before you ask: Yes I have been to a doctor. I also weren't satisfied with the ""its *probably* fissure or hemorrhoids"" so I went to a special clinic with a camera thingy they stick up yo butt. He also gave the unfulfilling answer of: ""I can't see anything, and if the blood is light red, it's not from higher up. Probably just small hemorhoids.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean doctors say it's what it is... but I just feel like the answer is not good enough. I was worried i got cancer, but if it's been there for at least 4 years, it'd be more apparent now i guess. Especially since i went to the doctor like 3 years in of it coming on/off. And they said I could be sure it wasn't cancer... BUT THEY DIDNT GIVE ME A DEFINITIVE ANSWER.

It sometimes (once every 2 months) comes randomly for one or 2 days and then goes away again.

I started taking creatine monohydrate and got a bit of stomach problems because of it, which seemed to trigger it.

449,"I have had feelings for a good female friend for a while now, but it has recently grown into a full on crush and I constantly think about her. The thing I don't know whether or not I want a relationship or not. We are both about it graduate high school, and she is planning on taking some college classes over the summer, and she will be gone right after school gets out. We are both going to different colleges about an hour away. part of my friend group is split between the two, and we plan on visiting each other often. After a year I have plans to transfer to the college she is attending, and this is unrelated to her. I have had plans to do so for longer than I have had feelings for her. This isn't the only question a relationship though. Overall I feel like she is a little out of my league, despite being friends with her. She is much smarter and athletic than me, and she seems to keep her life at a faster pace than me. I am also leaving a porn addiction right now (assuming I am successful)  and I dont really know that a relationship would be helpful right now. I know that this is just a regular crush, but I really dont want these thoughts in my head. I dont want to tell her about it, because I think that it would make things awkward between us, and I dont want to risk losing a friend. My feelings for her feel overwhelming though, and I have no idea how to control them. They are a major distraction, and they make it hard to focus on other things.

I've always wanted to be with people who share interests but unfortunately haven't met one yet :(

Added to that, I'm from a part of society(not western-I love westerns) where I'm obligated to people I don't really love and wanna be with--which partly contributes to my subconscious making bad decisions :(

I had a list of items and I wanted to know if everything one there was necessary and if there wasn't anything missing. I asked him.

But instead of answering my question (is everything necessary and is there something missing) he kept talking about what the list was for and if I worded everything right.

I kept explaining that it was just a check-list, the final document would look totally different, no, i won't show you that document, since it's not finished, ofcoure I'll sit with you and look at it, but not yet (I even told him I appreciated his help several times), but please let's get back to the list.

For some background, I'm 25, still living at home with my mother because getting a high enough paying job to get a place of my own is near impossible in my area. When I was 6 my father passed away due to heart failure. It was at that point my mother had her first bout of depression, people urged her to get help but she said she could manage by herself. Fast forward 15 years, she starts dating again, her drinking habits aren't particularly heavy, just a couple here and there to chill after work. She meets this one guy. The guy was a huge detriment to her life, he spent money like it was going out of style, used to run restaurants and clubs nearby, he was a scumbag who had been to jail before and is probably involved in some messed up shit (especially considering his random ""trips"" to other countries).
It was him who started getting her to drink more, they would both often be completely toasted during the day and near blackout drunk by the evenings, this continued for some time until the 2 of them had one too many arguments (which both of them spent time trying to coerce me into joining their side dragging me into their personal lives) and they split up. 
It was at this point mum went over the edge, drinking all day, not eating, making a fool of herself at christmas dinner, locking herself in her room. I tried so hard to get her to seek some kind of medical help but she refused saying ""it's just a dark patch, I can get over it.""

The last person I can count on is a family friend whose son I used to go to school with, he has been trying to help all this time, pushed the NHS to getting mum a place in rehab and in December last year it finally happened, she spent 2 weeks there and came back clean. I kept no alcohol in the house so she wouldn't be tempted (though I've never been much of a drinker so that wasn't too hard) and for 3 months her recovery was going fine.
until that is her boss started texting her constantly, she is currently off work through extended illness leave and so money is still coming into the house but her boss keeps pestering her on when she is coming back, it was shortly after mum had her first relapse.
A month has gone by and the drinking has got worse and worse to the point where it might actually be worse than before she went in to rehab, a liter to a liter and a half of vodka over the course of 24 hours, each day. We've tried preventing it (hiding the house keys, hiding her purse etc) but she still keeps getting it somehow.
The NHS won't put her back into rehab
she is threatening self harm and suicide but when I call the ambulance on her she refuses to go with them so the ambulance crew just pack up and leave without doing anything or even putting in a recommendation
she's trying to push everyone away saying we're all out to ruin her, the bottle is the only thing she trusts anymore
she has stopped taking her medication, when I bring that up with the NHS hotline, they don't care.
I'm not getting any sleep anymore, I'm getting constantly sick and shaking with a mixture of frustration and constant anxiety
I'm getting to my wits end, I think I'm about to see my mother kill herself with alcohol meanwhile desperately trying to get anyone to do something about it... and nobody will.",22Mar2019,1
463,My identical twin bother was recently skiing in Utah and had to be evacuated via helicopter because he collapsed from altitude sickness. This was very embarrassing for me as my friends are big skiers and it reflects poorly upon myself.   Basically he ruined everyone’s day skiing since we all had to go to the hospital to make sure he was ok which he was since he was no longer at high altitude.  Now my friends are afraid to ski with me since we have the same genes and they are concerned the same thing will happen.  Not sure what I can do at this point.

467,"Hi,

I'm a male teen in middle school and I'm having some issues.

Background: I'm in the school drama club, I have a few extremely good friends, but this isn't about them.

I'm stuck between a couple of friend groups that are a mix of my good friends and the drama kids. I have one great person that I hang out with a lot, yet the people that he likes to spend time with seem to kind of either pretend to not notice me or sometimes just kind of include-yet-not-include me in things like parties and ""hangouts"".

On the other hand there's the drama kids, that seem to like me sometimes, and I can hitch a ride with some of them, sometimes do something fun together occasionally, but yet I feel unappreciated. People won't talk to me voluntarily. They engage in conversation if I speak first, since I am a very social person and so are they. But since they are social people, I feel a little hurt when I'm not considered for conversation amongst the other drama kids.

The one friend I mentioned earlier comes to my house a lot, and I go to his often, and we play video games and generally just have fun. But I feel like sometimes when it comes to his other friends (which I also know very well at this point and we get along,) don't think of me first for invitations etc.

Now I'm not trying to get attention or get invited to every party or be the self-conscious teenager with anxiety that literally every body else is, because I'm not. I have lots of self-confidence and I get along with people. Yet I feel like it's not that I'm being pushed away, but sometimes I just need to insert myself into something in order to be thought of.

On social media, people post pictures of drama club rehearsal and backstage fun, but I'm not included, not even in my fellow stage managers, although I know that they do have pictures of me.

I'm an artist, and I design the drama club's poster. Today, the producer of the play passed out posters. It was great. Everyone congratulated me, they said the poster was amazing and thanked me. But I didn't feel like I was present, I was just that one guy that created the poster, and people look for me when they absolutely need me.

I'm not that one guy that everyone avoids at school for being weird, or someone that wants the spotlight all the time. I just want to be considered.

I feel invisible, yet I'm not invisible. I can't become completely invisible even if I wanted to, but I can't really be always seen.

473,"To start out - I don't judge people for their personal beliefs, and I firmly feel everyone is entitled to their own viewpoint on the world. The issue here is the fact that some... controversial (?) opinions have been forced on people in a way that's affecting my livelihood and the livelihood of others, and I do take issue with that. 

One of my business partners has some, frankly, ignorant beliefs that he's been trying to push on everyone (customers, coworkers, and myself included). It's gotten to the point that it's all he can talk about, and it's affecting the business - employees are afraid to speak their opinions, they're nervous because of the infighting between the management (my business partner and myself), and customers are visibly alienated. 

The business partner in question believes that a) the earth is 6000 years old, b) carbon dating is meaningless because the half-life of carbon has ""grown longer"" since the universe was ""created"", c) fossils are deceptive rocks planted in the ground to fool people into straying from Jesus, d) the earth is flat, e) climate change isn't real, f) the moon landings were faked, g) Egyptians were a hyper-advanced civilization with interplanetary travel capabilities, and h) (no exaggeration here, I swear) Trump is the actual second coming of Christ. There's a lot more as well, but that's a decent sampling. 

At this point, I get screamed at for even suggesting not talking about such devisive topics. I'm seriously considering just selling my stake in the company and walking, but I don't want to forsake the employees (there are three) or the company I started from scratch three years ago without a fight.

Is there any way I can get the workplace hostility to go away? I seriously don't know how to talk some sense into my business partner - his actions are clearly hurting productivity, morale and sales, and he's totally blind to it. ",22Mar2019,1

It’s a super easy task, would take less than 30 minutes. But on the other hand, she could do it herself, it’s not something only I could do. Additionally it’s something my coworkers who are in today could also help with; she just happened to single me out for assistance.

One supervisor at our location is a stuck up, sarcastic, passive aggressive little bitch. I absolutely hate this awful little smart ass c***t with every ounce of my being. Now, this is not a matter of complaining simply because I don’t  like someone, others have had issues with her attitude as well but they just brush it off and she continues to get no consequences. There was also a time when I got injured and all the bitch did was raise her voice and get attitude with me. She shows NO concern for the wellbeing of the staff. 

I’m a very easy person to work with and I get along well with most people. I also believe this god awful little gremlin is only a supervisor because her mom has worked at the company for a long time as a manager and somehow got her the position despite her being unqualified with little to no people skills. 

I’ve brought this up to other staff and they’ve said they’ve had similar issues, but they have an attitude of “oh just let it go, that’s just how she is, don’t let it get to you when she talks that way” etc. 

But I’ve been doing that and I am at the point in my life where I really won’t take stank attitude from people like this anymore. It’s affecting my ability to be comfortable and do my job (which I do just fine). I’m not going to “brush it off” and let this little bitch talk to me or anyone else in the condescending way she does, but since this is a professional environment I can’t punch her ugly smug bitch gremlin face and tell her off like I truly want to. 

TL;DR   I want to know the best way to approach my managers and supervisors with my issues regarding this awful bitch while remaining classy and professional about it so that they take my complaints seriously without brushing me off.

But it still wasn't working and there were things he did that pushed my boundaries in ways he knew made me uncomfortable. He'd apologize and then never change. I know I did a lot to contribute to the problems in the relationship, but I got to a point where I couldn't handle it anymore. Maybe it would  have gotten better when he moved, but I doubt it.

A couple of us got together to play some basketball then head back to tony's house to drink and watch the game. when he went over to the beer store and I went to get some food.

He walks over to the store I'm at they're arguing over the phone (I'm pretty sure it was about her wanting to come over, but i never asked) they finally end the phone call after several minutes and we head over to his house to watch the game. She calls him at the house saying she gonna leave now, he tells her don't come I told you earlier I said no I don't want you to come over today. She gets really upsets and starts calling him a liar saying he said for her to come over and she got her friend to side with her and confirm that story and just to let her come over. He keeps telling her that there is no room because I'm going to sleep in his bed because I gotta wake up early for college. she says she'll stay at a friends house as late as possible then shell sleep over (trying to compromise). he tells her another time I said no don't come over there is no room. She starts saying he acts so different around his friends then starts to disrespect me saying that I'm trash and no one likes me at the house and I can sleep on the floor. He tells her no several more times, I took the phone to defend myself at this point saying she has no right to call me trash and if I wasn't like I wouldn't be at the house, I furthered the conversation with ""even if he did say yes you never left the house and hes saying no right now."" She gets upset and stats ""I am your girlfriend! I deserve to be at your house more than him!"" I've been best friends with tony for nearly half my life and they've been together for nearly a year. (Keep in mind this literally isn't even tony's house its his grandmothers) so we finally tell her no one last time and then just hang up and leave it at that. Now she lives a 30 minute drive away and decided that she was going to force herself over. She drove all the way down to Cambridge to stay at a ""friends house"" who eventually said shes not allowed to stay over. She called tony saying she has no gas to get come and shes gonna have to sleep in her car if he doesn't let her sleep in the house. Tony fully annoyed told her she can stay, but hes not staying at the house with her he then leave the house to go to our other friends house.

I told the person who owns the car, and asked if they wanted to move their car, and also if they wanted me to find out who did it; being the IT guy, looked on the surveillance system and saw that a lady did it, and she had a witness (a friend of hers... another co-worker).  They knew the door hit, looked at the damage, and did nothing.  They've had all day to report it, and have done nothing.

The owner of the vehicle now has the video - but I guess my question is... what do we do with this?  Insurance most likely won't cover the damages, because another vehicle wasn't involved.  The damage is minimal, but the paint is down to bare metal.  Thoughts?   I say confront them, and ask them to pay for the body shop to paint the panel... but she most likely doesn't want any tension at work - we're a small company  ~50 people.

I've tried therapists, but 100% of the time, they just kind of suck and I can tell they're just there to give out vague, cliche advice and get paid. They don't really care at all, as you might hope they would. Just my opinion, you don't gotta agree.

So yeah. Both times I was with a cat, they made me feel safe enough that my body sort of released the trauma on it's own, and I pretty much cried involuntarily and released some of the stuff I need to release.

For starters, English is not my native language however please do correct me if I make mistakes. I will try to make this as structured as possible but no promises.

I'm a guy aged 18 in 2 months, I was diagnosed with ASD when is was 13, I also have ADD. Now before you start making a picture of me, I have high functioning ASD, in other words, I go to a normal school, get no special treatment, get good grades, have a social live, have a strong relationship for 2 years. I don't stand out, nobody expect my friends and my gf knows this. So no problems, however I have read a lot of stuff about people with ASD on the other side of the spectrum. ASD runs in my family, so my kids will probably have it too. 

Now here come my fear, if I have kids there is a chance that they will have low functioning ASD.
Is it ethical to have children knowing this.
I have talked about this with my gf, with whom I plan to stay as it keeps going well of course. She said that she doesn't mind if they do, she says that she never had a problem with my ASD. And if they are heavily disabled she doesn't care, she will still love them as if they weren't.
But I wonder if she realises what that would mean.

I have talked about this with my parents, and they say is should have children if I want to, that there always could go something wrong.

I know I'm too young to worry about this but this keeps me up at night .

My apologies if this is a strange post or something but I just wanted to talk about this with someone who isn't afraid to hurt my feelings.

501,"So, I've been friends with this non-binary person who I'll call Lin for a long time now. We were really close in 6th and 7th grade, and we figured out we liked each other earlier this year. So we decided to start dating, and it didn't go very well. They became suicidal daily (which led to me being afraid to do just about anything around them, especially when it comes to disagreeing), which fortunately stopped after a while, but then they completely disregarded my problems and always one-uped me whenever I went to them for help, complained all of the time, tried to cheat on me a lot (fortunately the guy who they were trying to cheat with wouldn't let them), either not telling me when something's wrong or telling me too much, and eventually I told them I was having problems with how they treated me because it was really toxic. They tried their whole ""don't worry about me"" talk (they always tell me to not worry about them when they're visually suicidal as if I'm supposed to just not worry), and I got mad at them since it never worked. They proceeded to break up with me (which I'm really glad about) and call *me* toxic.

I was kinda mad at this, since I knew it would do literally nothing, but after a little while of arguing Lin and I somehow agreed to still be friends. For the last month and a half, though, it's only been getting worse. Lin's thankfully not very suicidal anymore, at least not from what I can tell, but they've been having more home related problems. They use that as an excuse to treat me like shit, still not caring about me or really helping, one-uping me, yelling at me or worse over petty or small things or to get away with hurting me or others, insulting one of my friends who's ""too childish and immature"" a lot, not listening to me when I give them advice on how to be better despite them asking for said advice, and if I say one thing they don't like, they either yell at more or just completely ditch me. And they've gotten mad at me over some things that they shouldn't even be mad about (ex.: they considered ending our friendship because I said I didn't want them to stand up for me if I could stand up for myself, despite me always standing up for them. The difference is they're indifferent about me standing up for them, but I want to learn how to stand up for myself and I feel like they can get way too overly protective of me when they do stand up for me). And Lin's made it feel like a lot of this was my fault, and honestly, I feel kinda guilty for writing all of this about them, but I know I need help. (I know Lin's been very toxic and stuff, but I dunno if I'd call them abusive.)

So, what should I do? Should I completely cut them off or keep trying to help them? I'm really not sure, especially because they haven't been as bad during the week before spring break, but I'm really afraid it's going to get worse again.",22Mar2019,1
503,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. English is not my first language so please excuse my writing.

My gf‘s mom has depression in „waves“ which means that once or twice every year she behaves weird and her mood completely changes. 

2 days ago her latest „wave“ began and it‘s way stronger than the last times. 
A few hours ago I drove her home while her husband and my gf were still at work. This was the first time that I was alone with her while she had one of her „phases“. 

She was behaving very weird and it was like I was talking to a stranger. 
While we were waiting for my gf and her dad to come home (did not want to leave her alone) we didn‘t really talk much, she was just staring at the wall and said nothing.
After about 10 minutes she told me that she has serious feelings for one of her colleagues. Out of the blue. Without a warning. 
She also said that she loves him just as much as her daughter, her son and me. She did not mention her husband at all.
I am 100% sure that she told the truth and did not make this up.

What do I do now? Should I tell my gf? Should I tell anyone?

504,"So before I start I should probably give a little context. I'm a 20 y/o male, grew up in a pretty shitty household until about 17.  I'm an only child and it has always just been me and my parents. My father was (and perhaps still is) an alcoholic and would abuse us mentally, emotionally, and physically until one day my mother and I left and never came back.

Despite all this, my mother still pressured me to have some form of contact with him. Her logic was that he was still my father and I shouldn't push him out completely for everything he's done. I kept up messages with him, talking off and on until one day I received a message I wasn't supposed to see. He basically sent me a message talking about ME (claimed I was always a weird kid or something like that) that was clearly intended for someone else. When I asked about it he tried to lie and cover it up by telling me not to worry about it. This was the point where I stopped speaking to him and haven't until this day.

Honestly, I'm not sure why I want anything to do with him after all the years of his abuse and empty apologies. I've hit a rough patch in my life where my job isn't working out, I can't pay my bills, no vehicle, and I live somewhere pretty rural so getting to work relies heavily on whether someone I know can hook me a ride (taxi to town $40 one way). I've been forced to rethink my career path and recently have been interested in Long-haul trucking, which is something my father has done his entire life. 

I think somewhere I still care about my father but it's incredibly difficult to forgive what he put me and my mother through. I'm just at a whole new low and I don't know where to go for help. I want to check up on him, put aside everything, and fix things but from past experience that doesn't work. Although we had a shit relationship, we also shared a lot of hobbies and interests that I miss. 

I guess what I'm trying to ask is should I give him another chance and contact him? I feel like he probably doesn't want anything to do with me after I wanted nothing to do with him and ignored his existence for 2 years. Even if I do contact him, I'm not sure what to say. I know things aren't the same as they were. I don't know how to form a relationship with him that isn't the same either.

506,"TL;DR at the end

My (30F) husband (38M) and I are having some problems in our marriage and I need advice.

Here's background info on us and a chronological order of the events that lead to the current situation:

BACKGROUND INFO

I am from Turkey, come from a highly academical and semi-wealthy family.

I am an English-Turkish translator and interpreter that made a badass degree while getting into university, as well as at the graduation. 

I have bipolar 2 and anxiety. 

I've experienced a trauma 10 years ago that had made me fear men, got over it for the most part, and then experienced something similar, but at a much milder degree last September, that made my fear come back to life. I fear stranger males only, not my husband father, brother, or friends.

I have lived in many cities in my country and abroad, and changed many schools. I have a global culture, if you will.

My husband is from Switzerland, comes from a middle class family, none of the family members have a university degree. 

He is an accountant, and was a cash register worker before that. 

He has had burnout twice and is currently in depression. 

He has lived in the same village all his life,but travelled to places.

EVENTS

I met my husband at the sommer break of the second year at the university, while I was visiting a family friend in Switzerland. We flirted for 2 years, were engaged for 1 year and then got married after school ended. We've been married for 3 years now. 

We were very happy at the beginning, but have always had cultural differences, mostly on his side. I have always been the one to make sacrifices, like leaving my life and coming to a completely different country to start over, and swallowing cultural demands that made me uncomfortable, for the sake of our marriage. 

He has also been very supportive of my mental illnesses, and loving and caring, but I expressed my anger towards Switzerland often times, because I looked for a job for a very long time, to be finally recruited to a cleaning crew at first (that caused me to have a tennis elbow, from which I still suffer), and then at a retail store. 

I've been admitted to a hospital because of a mental breakdown, because my coworker left for a long period of time, handing in a doctor's note with no warning, that led me to work 10 hours standing, with no break, and hardly be able to go to the bathroom, and being told to put on diapers instead, jokingly, and that for 3 months!

We soon moved houses, and my family came to help with the moving. This is the only time I forced a cultural difference upon him, and even though he said he didn't want my parents to come, because the moving company was going to do all the work and it was stressful for us to have guests over, I simply could not tell my parents not to come. 

After this he started being impatient and angry with me all the time, as well as distancing himself from me. We fought almost everyday for the smallest things. One day I told him I want either for things to get better between us or divorce. The next day he went to his parents and came back to tell me that he wants to divorce. He said he needs to take care of himself now, and he can't tolerate my illness anymore. 

I begged him the next morning not to divorce, and he told me he does want to try again. Things were getting better when he went to his parents yet again, and came back to tell me he wants to take a break. I told him I needed to call a moving company, and prepare myself, but that he is in depression and needs help, with or without me. 

He decided he doesn't want to take a break, but now every time he goes to his parents, I'm on edge. Things are going better for now but it's no guarantee, I know that now. 

I have to go back to Turkey for 2 weeks in June for my grandmother's anniversary and I am not sure if I'll have a home to come back to. I actually love my husband, but I want for things to go back to normal. He doesn't want to seek help. I also want ro hace kids soon but that's out of the question with this much going on. I'm at a loss. 

I appreciate any advice. 

TL;DR

My (30F) husband (38M) and I are having some problems in our marriage and I need advice.

We come from different backgrounds and countries and both have mental health issues. 

I moved to his country and have been unhappy about my social status, which I've told him. I've had a nervous breakdown due to work. My parents came to help us when we were moving houses, even though my husband didn't want to. I couldn't tell them not to come. These things have caused him to go into depression, for which he doesn't seek help. We talked about divorce and taking a break as options, but decided not to. 

Every time he goes to his parents' he talks about breaking it with me. I will have to go to my country in sommer for 2 weeks, and I'm not sure if I'll have a home to come to then. I love my husband and want things to go back to normal. Any advice? ",22Mar2019,1

508,"I'm 32M been working behind the scenes in news broadcasting for about 4 years. I'm just tired of my current job and never had the intent of staying in TV news but instead wanted to get into radio (our company has radio stations that I did some work for but nothing full time. Then they sold the stations and my opportunity was gone).

I've been offered a job at a small company to do purchasing, inventory management, run their QuickBooks, and basically learn to become their Operations Manager. Since it's a small company there are no benefits, but they are offering me a few dollars more an hour then what I'm getting now and I will work a more traditional schedule (8-5 instead of nights so I'll be able to spend more time with my wife).

511,"I’m going to be living in another state for work for about 10 months starting this summer, with absolutely zero possibility of bringing my cat with me. I have an 11 year old cat, she’s been with me since she was a kitten when I got her when I was 12 years old. She has spent most of her life at my parent’s house, with me, that is where she’s most comfortable and happy. She has a lot of anxiety issues that aren’t the easiest to handle, since she’s a cat, and I have a great vet finally, we have different medication options, she’s on a consistent schedule, etc. Occasionally though, she can lash out at whoever is around her when she gets scared, usually a loud or very sudden noise is what makes her really panic, but sometimes she freaks out for seemingly no reason. She loves my parents and is happy to snuggle and hang out with them, but I’m definitely her mom, her favorite. I’m the only person she hasn’t attacked during a panic before, she lets me hold her and cuddle her in ways she’d never let anyone else, she follows me around the house most of the time, we sleep together every night. As a kitten, we think she was weaned way too early, because she used to suckle on my ear lobes, and she is extremely attached to me, as I am to her. I’m worried that when I leave this summer, she’s going to be confused and very sad, and I don’t want her to feel abandoned. Is there anything I can start doing now to prepare her for this long absence? We have gone on vacation before for a week or two at a time, and she’s of course always fine when we come back, and my parents will be there with her the whole time except when they are at work, but my heart is breaking thinking about her being lonely and sad with no way to explain the situation to her. I plan on leaving a pillow or two with pillowcases I’ve slept on for awhile for her to sleep on, also maybe a t shirt that I’ve slept in, and I’m hoping to Skype with my parents occasionally so I can see her. Physically, not much will change for her, she will still get the run of the house and a queen sized bed to herself, with my parents as an option for sleeping with, if they let her. Should I add any extra toys or cat trees around the house so she can get some extra fun treats and mental stimulation while she’s alone all day? 

What else can I do to help her transition for this change? How can I make sure she doesn’t think I’ve abandoned her, or died? ",22Mar2019,1

513,"I'm ""manager"" at my place of work. I get treated like a slave. I get into trouble for absolutely everything all the time. We've been short staffed for a little more than a month now because my boss refuses to hire anyone. I've put in 109 hours in the last 2 weeks. More than that actually but whatever. I only make .90 more than minimum wage and I'm scheduled at 32 hours a week. I'm being punished for some reason. Anyway, technically, i should be making $16.50 for all the overtime. He pays my overtime in cash though at my usual rate of pay. He refuses to do it any other way and if i try to talk to him about it he always says he doesnt have service or, and I quote, ""if you dont like it you can leave"". I'm not exempt because I hardly make enough money, I have no power that usually comes with this title. All I do is work when no one else will. I do handle our vendors and such but I did that before the ""title"" was given to me. Every time I try to quit, he brings up a contract that I signed forever ago. I have no clue what's actually in it and he refuses to let me see it. No, I didnt read it. I trusted him and he had told me it was the same one I had, we all just had to resign it. Turns out, I'm the only one with a contract. He has 7 stores, lots of employees and I'm the only one who gets treated like shit. Half the time he ignores me. Avoids me. Throws me under the bus to his boss (his uncle) so i get into trouble. He was a dear friend, now hes hateful. I feel stuck here. And I'm not even getting paid correctly. He thinks I'm stupid, but I'm not. 4 years busting my butt. I even pay the bills to our building..... my title is fake. Hes controlling as hell and looks like he owes me so much money. He owes my coworker lots of money too. I live in Maryland. What should I do? My contract apparently says I have to give a 30 day notice and I cant work in any retail or food services.

518,"Im new to reddit, and i'm not the best at english. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for this post being so long, but this really changed my life a lot and i don't want to talk about this to no-one, that's the reason i'm asking for advice anonymously here.

So, i'm in college and the chocking thing is that my ex-girlfriend (from 9th grade!) chose the same college as me. We never had a serious relationship and we ended it because of some reasons I won't go in to (nothing I did nor she did to end it)

So in college, we never really talked for a year and a half. We just ignored each other. But I always had feelings for her. We take the same bus to school/home 2-3 times a week. Nope, never talked there either. 

But my feeling grew and I got depressed, because I couldn't get my feelings off of her. Even tho I wanted to get them off because I always thought I had no chances with her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some weeks after me being sad and down, I sat on the bus and I saw her. This time I said to my self that I have to go her and talk, even if she thinks i'm being weird it will be worth it.

At the last stop, I walked to her and she got really scared first but we had a good talk and she laughed much. I took her phone number and asked if she wanted to hang out some time, she said yes.

&amp;#x200B;

So a week later we met, took a walk and talked about everything. What's changed and what's not since we hadn't met for some years. When I walked home I had a real smile, and sounds dramatic but it felt awesome since I have been sad for a time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I then talked to her on the phone and asked if she wanted to come to my place and study, so she did. I met her and we walked to my house. We actually did study but then we drank some coffee and talked about some deep stuff and so.

She was here for maybe four hours and then I walked her home.

I were so happy, and as stupid as I am. I talked to my friend about the girl over discord. My friend said that he's happy for me and that he hadn't ""seen"" me so happy for a long time, which was true. BUUUUUUT when we were talking, I got a text and it said: 

""hey, it was an awesome day for me and not that this will change or not that this will mean anything, but I do have a boyfriend just letting you know"". 

I felt really empty and simply replied with: ""ok, thanks for letting me know"". 

And she replied with ""yeah not that it will really change anything or so"". The thing is, now i'm being an asshole, and said in text that I had feelings for her. (Which was really stupid I know).

She just replied with it's okay.

I felt like my life turned and I got sad again. But I got over the depression with starting running, so I ran everyday, 7-9 times a week. Sometimes even in the night because running always felt good. Still running today, not as much.

But I still kept meeting her on the bus and now we always talk. We talk on the bus and we have one lesson with each other every week where we study together. 

It's now almost been a month after she said that she had a boyfriend, we're are starting to get closer friends ever week. 

Bu here is where things start getting complicated for me.

&amp;#x200B;

She said that only her friends and now me knows about her boyfriend. I don't know who her boyfriend is but I assume it's a boy from the same lesson (where i meet her once a week) and me and she studies there. Every week, like her boyfriend isn't there. 

I also get some signals that she might have some feelings for me, she never talks about her boyfriend anymore and i'm too big of an pussy to ask her about her boyfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't ask her out anymore after I got to know about her boyfriend and I don't know if I should. I really have strong feelings for her and even tho she isn't my girlfriend she is right now the only person besides my family that makes me happy and keeps me motivated. I always wait for the days that i'll see her again.

&amp;#x200B;

If you read this far, what do you think? What should i ask? What should i talk about with her? And no, i'm not giving up on her. Might be stupid not to give up, but she really is so different from other girls. I assume that she and her boyfriend does not have a serious relationship yet.

And thank you so much for reading this, I hope I will get some answers since I really don't know what to do.

He said he had a moment of weakness and was so upset and thought what we had was really over.

Recently he played with the dog a little too hard and broke out in a bad rash on his arm (it went away eventually). Now he's hellbent on rehoming the dog, and he's really offended/butthurt that my sisters/mom seem to ""care more about the dog than him"" because they want to keep it even though he's allergic. It's  not true they don't care about dad- they just ADORE their dog too!! I know the obvious answer is to find some kind of compromise bc his allergic reactions could easily be avoided if he just stayed away, but ""he's not going to continue living like this,"" where he has to avoid it.

This is really taking a toll on the girls because they love the dog, even though we've only had him for a year, but my dad can only see that as everyone siding with the dog over him.

me: Why did you block me?

her: &gt;_&gt; bc I thought the claims were true then
but I didn't ask you first so I felt pretty bad
Like I was thinking ""does this guy know why I blocked him?

me: Who told you these things

her: ma fwiends

me: Which ones?

her: I don't really want to name
Man and here i was thinking I made a cool friend?

me: Wym?
I just don't like people gossiping about me

her: I actually thought someone was cool enough to personally like me individually. Not like....... one of many girls friended yk?

me: one of many girlfriends? What? I've never had a girlfriend.

her: girls friended
not girlfriends

me: I mean I think you're really cool tbh

her: But yeah thats whats in the air about you
BC if its a miss understanding [sic], I think you should really explain to people

me: explain what to people?

her: That you're not creepy or stalkerish like people say you are. Bc everyone misunderstands something :) so it should be cleared.

535," So I hooked up with a girl on Cupid after a few messages. I was blunt with her and asked what she was looking for and she said she wanted to hookup. Later that night I go to her place. We talked for like 20 minutes just general stuff about ourselves to break the ice. During that initial talk I really felt like I was vibing with her and instantly felt a connection. So fast forward after the sex part and we're just sitting there talking for well over an hour. She was sharing how she just got out of a 6 year relationship and how she felt about the whole thing. She was asking me advice about the whole thing and how I felt about it. After that we started getting into some personal things and that really solidified the fact that I might actually have feelings for this girl. I enjoyed listening to her personal issues cause it helped me not feel as alone in my own. I personally felt like we really connected that night apart from the sex. We're the same in a lot of ways. I've never really been able to open with someone like that. I'm honestly lost here. I sent her a message afterwards saying it was nice talking to you and if you ever want to talk I'm open to it, and also if she ever wanted to hang out again to let me know. Since we're using Cupid I can see whenever she's online so I don't know if she's looking for other dudes to hook up with. I sound like an idiot lmao. Idk what to do.

539,"Background info: I am a 17 M. There is a group I've known for ages. There is a certain ""friend"" D who is quite an ass tbh. He does run his mouth alot and this led to conflict last year. A few days earlier, I was talking to another friend about guitar, as I've recently been learning. He later makes a joke about how acoustic can get people laid and I laugh. D interjects and states I'm too ugly to get laid, if memory serves me right. (He has made this remark before which is ironic since he himself has yet to achieve intimacy) I get slightly irritated and throw a insult at him. Eventually, I let it go and continue my conversation. 

He still starts shit and I get so mad I curse him out and he resorts to calling me retard genes because I have a brother with minor autism. At this point, I tane a deep breath, try not to look mad and walk to a table group consisting of my other friends. Rest of lunch goes well and they're nice people. At home, I decide I've had enough and block D. I also left the SC groupchat.

Today,  drama broke out with another member however, I'm unaware of the details. ""P"", another member/a friend I'm normally on good terms with invites me to this chat where d tells me to stay out and says he only insults me when i insult him (Blatant lie) and some other wall of text. Apparently, they wanted to talk it out with me but at that point, I wanted nothing to do with D. I leave the groupchat. P simply types in insults such as r*tard.

I later see P and tell him I could care less for the drama, and that I do not wish to talk to D, no matter his intentions. P states I have zero thick skin and I need to talk it out. I repeat myself and state that no, I have burned bridges for good. He calls me a r*tard again so I point out the fact that despite taking all common core classes, hes failing them miserably. Anyways he later shows me a wall of text D sent him which I skimmed over. I remember it saying ""If we all were really friends, you'd talk this out"" and ""we were just joking"" even though D seemed genuinely mad and even cheered as I walked away from the table. It also stated ""Cant believe you have the audacity to....."" anyways I told P IDC and he said we're no longer friends. 

I could care less about D but it hurt losing P. He was a good friend and we did lots of stupid shit together. Now its all gone.",22Mar2019,2

544,"(tldr at bottom) My (17F) best friend (18F) has been with her boyfriend (17M) for over a year (around 15 months I believe) and I think I’m slowly going insane because of it. 

I helped set them up, and at the time I was all for it, because he is a really great guy and of course my best friend deserves the best. But then fast forward to a few months ago, and suddenly I start getting the worst feeling of jealousy whenever I’m around them. 

Our friendship hasn’t been quite the same since they started dating (she and I have known each other since 7th grade, we’re seniors now), but a few months ago it just really got to the point where I can’t stand the thought of them being together. 

I can’t really explain why. I don’t know if it’s because I’m lonely (never dated anyone in my life) or if it’s because I have a crush on her? I’m bi but I haven’t come out, and she’s not the type of girl I would usually crush on, but I guess there’s a first for everything.

If I see them kiss, hold hands, lean on each other (AKA all normal couple things) it kills me inside. I have told her it makes me uncomfortable when she mentions their sexual encounters, but she still talks about it sometimes. The thought of him getting to kiss her and make love to her makes me want to curl up and cry. Today when she mentioned it, I had to leave class and go to the bathroom, and I cried for five minutes. 

I know I can’t just TELL her about this, because what would I say? “I hate that you’re in a normal loving relationship, please stop it right now.” It would sound delusional! She can tell when something is up with me, but she already has family issues in her life, and I know any drama with me would just kill her even more. 

So I guess what I’m asking is... should I mention to her that I just don’t want to hear about the intimate details of her relationship? Should I not say anything at all? And if not, how can I continue to deal with these feelings? I really think the way I feel about this is ridiculous - the only explanation must be that I’m in love with her (it must be her, her bf is my friend but I couldn’t ever like-like him) or I’m lonely as hell. If you guys could offer any guidance at all, I would so appreciate it. Thank you for reading all this!

tldr; seeing and hearing about my best friend’s relationship bothers me, but she is in a normal, loving relationship. I’m not sure if I am crushing on her, or if I am just lonely and feeling the effects of being single. How can I handle these feelings in a healthy way?",22Mar2019,1

553,"For as far back as I can remember, my sisters would joke with me that I was adopted. I didn't look like them so I think that is where their 5 &amp; 8 year old imaginations contrived the story.  This has given me a life long complex. Not in the sense that it disrupted my daily life but there were '*things*'. Signs. We would always jokingly ask my mom and she would laugh and deny it. It was lighthearted since we were just kids. It could all be in my head but, they are both artistic and I was the athlete. I really don't look like them at all. There is a typo on my birth certificate and my fathers suffix is left off.  When I was born my dad was working out-of-state. The perfect scenario to run with this tale. Until now.

&amp;#x200B;

My family (parents are now divorced) recently started doing the ancestry DNA testing. My mom had gotten one for my oldest sister and she declined and so she offered it to me and I enthusiatically said 'Yes! We got you now!' and she just laughed as per usual. We knew my moms lineage since her ancestors all started, stayed and moved to the same areas...got it.  My Dads we knew pretty well on his paternal side but his maternal side is what we were after. Irish, Swedish, English and Native is what we thought. One of my sisters took another company's test and got the same results as my dad who took his through the same company as I did. Turns out its mostly Swedish and English. I got Irish.  A lot of it. 45% more than them.  I asked my mom 10 days ago when I got the results to fess up. She denied it. I got a message from a DNA match 4 days later and she was DETERMINED to figure out the connection since we are 2nd cousins and I came out of literally nowhere. I should be at their holidays and reunions. It's THAT close. She gave me her number and email. I called my mom again 2 days ago (Wed) and asked her at least 3 times but she just kept saying, ""Your dad is your dad. It's on your birth certificate.""  Mmmkay we all know the signature is what matters and just played it off as a joke again so I knew that conversation was done. I called my dad right after and we went over his tree and he was baffled. He even suggested I call the company to re-run my results. I start to panic and call my sister and she says she actually has a kit for the same company my dad and I used and she is sending hers in the next day (yesterday). She did. I saw the snap story.

&amp;#x200B;

During dinner Wed night I couldn't breath, focus or eat. I got up from the middle of dinner and called my DNA match. She basically knew that this was a situation. She said she was going to make a quick phone call and call me *right back* and please answer. I called my mom immediately and begged her to please just tell me the truth. Apparently for 30+ years I HADN'T BEEN ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTION. She dodged all this BS on a technicality. I asked her if she had an affair or one night stand and she said yes. Twice. I asked her if she knew his name and she said yes. I asked her what his name was and she told me. She said your dad doesn't know. I said ok and hung up. My DNA match called me back and she already knew too.  I told her his name and she goes 'Oh my God. My cousin \*\*\*\*\*.' She conveyed that this would ruin his life and the extended family cannot find out either. She was very kind and felt sorry but at the same time was nervous since there was a possibility of this going very sideways. That was a rough night. Yesterday was a rough day. Processing all of my feelings. My mom texted me yesterday and asked me how I was doing. I didn't answer. She texted again and said 'I am sorry for all of this.' I didn't answer.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone been through this? Is it absurd to never want to speak to her again? I have questions that I want answers to but am curious of what you would be asking if you found out.

&amp;#x200B;

My main concern is my relationship with my dad. When I was little I yearned for his approval. I was such an over-the-top tomboy to impress him with my athleticism so we could have something in common and he would think I was cool. He unquestionably loved me but he is a stoic and no-nonsense type person and I always wanted the 'open arms running to each other in a field' moment but settled for a 'Your defense was alright in your game today.' During my teenage years I really hated him. My grades were shit and he didn't let me play soccer so I blamed him for everything. I feel terrible. He didn't deserve that. Some bastard blaming him for her self-inflicted angst. I made his life hell. I didn't speak to him for a year. I couldn't even be in the same room as him. Awful. After high school we still didn't really talk a lot. We always text on holidays and birthdays but I hadn't been home to see anyone for almost 10 years. He hadn't come out to visit either.  I am just now building a relationship with him. I didn't have a relationship with his dad since he lived across the county and my dad is sort of an at-a-distance type grandfather too since its the same situation. Well once he finds out the truth, there is literally nothing for him to stay for. He was married before he married my mom and had a son that he didn't fight for so why would he fight for me? I am terrified that he will abandon me and then I will have no dads. I wouldn't blame him or be surprised. An already strained relationship and then this. He will always be my dad I know that but just when things were getting better damnit.

&amp;#x200B;

I am really upset with how my mom is handling this. I haven't gotten a single phone call. No offers of explanations or answers. Just 2 texts. I guess I am being overdramatic in wishing my mom would call until I answered begging for my forgiveness. Foolish. I don't even know what I would say if I answered. I could honestly go the rest of my life without speaking to her. The only reason I need to talk to her is to get the answers to my questions and tell her that she has to fess up to everyone. Is it my place to tell my dad and family? I don't think it is and I am scared for when she tells him. It won't be in person and can't be there.  Do I call him after and beg not to be thrown out like his son? Is he supposed to call me? Do I ask him if he still wants to be my dad even though they are divorced now and we barely see each other as is? My sisters new results will be back in 4-6 weeks and I will not live this lie that long. They **will** find out. Do I call my mom or wait for her to call? She seems to be over it already since she is back to posting on facebook after one whole day.

I'm 21 years old and I have never finished my high school. In my country you can take a test to enroll in college but I'm not certain if I want to enroll. 

Currently having a gap year but in September the plan is to enroll but every day it's getting closer and I'm less and less interested. 

The main reasons I do not want to go is that I like to do things my way, I'm very stubborn and I don't like being told how to do certain things. Another main reason is the massive student debt (over 50K euros) which I'm not fond of at all. I don't like to loan money or be in debt at all. 

My main focus is to start my own company which you do not need college for but I'm afraid of not making it. On one side I will pressure myself to work my hardest on my own company but if in the end it does fail, I will be screwed.

558,"For as long as I can remember I’ve always heard the dreaded questions that embarrass me to no end:

“Why do you look so mad?”

“Why do you never smile?”

“You look like a b***h.”

“What pissed you off?”

“Can I get a smile, sweetie?”

Nothing upsets me more than when people say these things to me, because I know that they’re just the ones brave enough to say it to my face. I suffer from a major resting bitch face, I constantly look like something crawled up my butt and died. Even children have pointed out to me that I look like a freaking frowning emoji. I literally can’t help it, but it doesn’t stop people from assuming I’m the meanest person to walk the earth just because I happen to naturally curve my lips down. If someone comes up to me by some miracle I will give them a nice smile and greet them but they always seem surprised by it. 90% of people I’ve managed to make friends with tell me they’re surprised I turned out to be a nice person. So to cut it short I’m pretty painfully shy and this whole resting bitch face thing has destroyed my self esteem for the better half of my life. Are there any tips on how to make myself seem more approachable? Other than the obvious “smile more” what can I do so that people in public places don’t seem to avoid me like the plague?

559,"So, first of all, this is serious. [Here's some background info](https://link.medium.com/6Uds1cmR8U) about the reasoning behind it, and I even [wrote a book](https://www.amazon.com/Juggling-Trash-Can-Satan-Tell-All-ebook/dp/B07MYFCB55) about my early steps towards making my dream a reality.

Our core goal is to awaken people to their full agency by actualizing their authentic self regardless of what the world wants them to be. This is my plan to counteract the Christian Matrix which the Illuminati is using to control the population for their own ends. 

This became my divine mission after I stepped out of a life of denial and accepted that there is a huge part of myself that identifies as a nine year old girl. I've always been afraid to express that, because people are retarded, but through a self-created philosophy, I've been able to step away from that fear of what people think of me and express my true self.

Ultimately, we're going to adapt and evolve around our members, but a major element I want to manifest is a safe space where anyone with rape or molestation fetishes can explore them without judgment and so that no one actually gets hurt. **There is nothing wrong with rape and child molestation,** provided that everyone involved is a consenting adult.

As proof, one of my major fantasies is to have my daddy tell me he's magic and can bring my mommy back, but only if I don't resist and don't tell anyone.

So, if you've made it this far, you see the problem I face. I want to respect the boundaries of everyone, and am fully aware of how triggering a project like this could be. At the same time, how do I attract the members who would be totally onboard to what our mission is?

I'm looking for suggestions as to how to get the word out in an appropriate manner that still radiates our undiluted perverted essence to the world. Thoughts?",22Mar2019,0

562,"Hey guys.

I’m currently in my third-year university student. I spent the first year as a biology major before being forced to switch due to poor grades. I then dropped out due to anxiety and took a bunch of random, useless classes for a liberal studies path in community college. I then decided to return to my original university since I wanted to make up for my poor marks and re-adjust back to being independent. However, I didn’t realize at the time that those CC courses (which I aced) would be counted toward my degree even though they don’t count toward my overall GPA.

Since returning to uni, I’m still struggling with my academic performance even though my new major is comparatively less rigorous than my former one. I also haven’t fully adjusted to being independent. 

At this point, my resume is barren since high school guven that the past couple of years have been riddled with severe anxiety and crippling episodes of depression. My new major is also for job-hunting basically useless without grad school or internship experience prior to graduation. Unfortunately my GPA is abysmal at the moment for both internship opportunities, research opportunities, and a future in grad school. It’s too late for me to switch to a more “employable” major as well given how many credits I’ve accumulated. 

Even so, I’m still a bit lost as to what I wanna do for the rest of my life but know that I wanna be financially comfortable by my thirties. One major upside is that I having a loving, supportive family who can financially assist me until they feel that I’m in a comfortable place in my life. I also have a loving, caring boyfriend who is academically successful and has great career prospects. I just wish that I wasn’t disappointing them like I am now. I also plan on staying in school for another year so I’m more like a sophomore without much going on than a junior without much going on.

I’ve recently applied for a volunterring position and am considering getting a part-time retail job. What else can I do from this point forward? I feel super lost I severely regret past decisions since attending as well worry about working in a hopeless, dead-end job for the rest of my life. I can also clarify further/provide more details on my situation if needed.

566,"This is going to be a somewhat long one. Tl;dr at the end.

I work as an editor for my student newspaper (which has become infamous for censorship) and it’s hiring season. I applied for editor in chief and was the only applicant. However, because of issues in the past, our faculty advisor is no longer allowed to control hiring. Instead we have two higher up administrators who control the hiring. I still interviewed for the position.
Long story short, my assistant editor got the position, despite the fact that he a) never applied for it, b) is only here for one semester next year and c) is nowhere near qualified for it. While my assistant is a great guy, he’s a bit of an airhead and does not possess the editing, writing or design capabilities of an editor in chief. 
According to the faculty advisor, I was the best choice. This selection has shocked everyone, including my assistant.
The reason for his selection ultimately came down to the fact that one of the two administrators was closer to him than he was to me. This favoritism has showed before when my assistant was selected for an interview with a celebrity when I was never informed that the interview was a thing. 
It’s also possible this is a gender thing. I’m a female and, as far as I can remember our paper has never had a female editor in chief. (Thanks, traditional religious school.) These administrators are both male and generally only interact with the male staff members.
The unreasonable part of his hiring is mostly the fact that he did not apply and is only here for half of the next year, even though the paper staff is year-long. 
Because of this, I am staying in my position and another head section editor is getting demoted to be my assistant. 
Understandably, I’m upset. I was never given the chance, despite the fact that I was the only applicant and the best qualified for the position. Instead, the administrators hired someone who they were buddy-buddy with and who will always say yes to what they want.

What I’m looking for advice for is handling the situation. One of these administrators is somewhat involved with the paper and now, obviously, my assistant is my boss and very happy about it. 
I can’t stand to be around him at this point and have lost a lot of trust in people who I will have to deal with quite a lot. 
Is there anything I can do about the situation? I’m kind of looking into hiring rules and the like because he did not apply for the position and it was obvious favoritism from the admins. 
And, also, just general advice about dealing with people who I no longer trust and still have to obey. 
I hope this all makes sense. I’m still pretty shell-shocked.

I’m a 22 y/o female. I never really had close friends my entire life which I think is why I’ve held on to my “friendship” with this girl. In the beginning we talked day and night. We started hanging out too but then I realized she was just using me to get rides to see her then-boyfriend. (Our then-boyfriends were friends.) I called her out on it and we stopped talking for a while. It wasn’t till I broke up with my then-boyfriend that we talked and hung out a lot again. She was there for me a lot. We couldn’t do anything that involved money because she didn’t work and I couldn’t afford to constantly pay for her. She started dating a guy I went to school with. (We went to different schools.) Before him, she had a job, car, stable living situation and was taking college classes. As their relationship went on, that all went away. They are constantly couch hopping, stealing stuff from the people who let them stay on their couches, spending every penny they get and just hanging out with the wrong people. She constantly tells people he cheats on her and says he’s emotionally and physically abusive. She lies A L OT so I don’t really think he does hit her. I’m very upfront and tell people how I feel. I told her multiple times how I feel about her relationship and the negative impact it made on her life. One day she says “it will never change.” Then the next she tells me he’s “changed.” She doesn’t want to hear what I have to say and it’s gotten to the point where I told her I don’t want to hear anything about her boyfriend because it’s a constant back and forth with them. She acts like he’s a king when he’s a POS. She only talks to me when it benefits her and I’m just so over it. Honestly, I’m so over anything involving her. Should I just delete her on all social media without saying anything? I just don’t know what to do anymore and I feel like I should just remove her out of my life. I just feel like the relationships she has with people aren’t healthy ones. I could try and stay in contact with her but she never keeps it up unless she needs or wants something.

(Yeah, my neighbor’s are assholes) They don’t feed the cat either, obviously, because every time I pour my dogs a bowl of food, she comes and eats the entire thing, leaving them with nothing. She’s eating like four bowls a day and she’s fat as hell. She’s not pregnant either, which was my initial thought, because my neighbor said they got her from a shelter and she is spayed. She also hangs out in my yard when she’s not inside, and kills the birds that try to eat at my bird feeder. She also doesn’t bother grooming herself until she’s on my couch or bed, and leaves a dust pile behind, which has been seriously grossing me out.

I'm 21 year old female and I've been on the pill (cerelle) since I was 17 due to extremely heavy periods and painful cramping where I couldn't move. 

As you can see my uterus has never seemed to like me but lately it's been more of a nuisance for me and the doctors never seem to listen to me about anything so I want to make sure I have a solid reason to go before I do so asking for your input, help and experiences. 

I'm currently having horrible lower stabbing pains in two places one in the lower right side of my uterus and another right in the middle just under my belly. They're violent and sharp pains and they've come out of nowhere. I've also been experiencing pain during intercourse in what I'm assuming is my uterus too it's a sharp stabbing pain when my partner thrusts and I feel it most in missionary. 

This has been going on for a while but I tend to switch up positions and ignore it however, recently the different positions aren't helping anymore and I'm still experiencing it.  Does anyone have any advice or thoughts on what this could be? I'm kind of worried something's happening down there that I'm constantly putting off. 

About two year ago I think I miscarried while on the pill I never went to the doctors to find out so I'm just guessing it was because I had a heavy period flow even though my pill lightens it up and I get one once every 3 month now however that time it lasted for longer and was extremely heavy and my breasts were rock solid which I've never experienced before. I know taking the pill may have cause the potential miscarriage but part of me wonders if it wasn't that and something else caused it. ",22Mar2019,0

We're really poor, father died when I was 9 from ALS, single mother works for ~250 dollars a month, also have a sister 7 years younger than I am. Basically those 250 dollars a month are what we have.

Now if I do succeed in this dream of mine I've calculated that, from all relatives and such, I could get around 350$ sent to me monthly which is not enough for the average 25000$ a year college and university. Now I'm willing to work while attending classes and do as much as possible.

I don't care much about the place or if it's a university or a community college, if I truly had to choose one place I'd chose Chicago because it's quite literally the second city with most Serbs ( first being capital of my country, Belgrade, I live in Nis which is 3rd biggest with little over 150K while I saw somewhere that Chicago has ~400K )

I planned on taking TOEFL over the summer but it's quite a big gamble, taking TOEFL costs 180$ which I have saved but it's still a lot of money, compare it to our monthly income. Also I sadly can't apply to too many colleges / universities because applications cost a lot.

Just pulled an all nighter doing big hw. I go to a tough IB school, couldn't wait to sleep home.

I was driving home from school with mom in passenger seat. Near the end there was a car going 20 under in a 50 while swerving with 2 wheels on grass/dirt. Not pulling over either, just bad. I saw weird hand movements inside so I was kinda nervous. I checked blind spot and for traffic, and rose to the speed limit to pass him. It was perfectly legal and I had like 20 seconds before cars even start being too close to pass. I used turn signals. My mom who was listening to her audiobook not watching the road screamed at me for passing and tried to pull me to the right lane with the wheel again which was incredibly dangerous as his rim was near the front of my car while the cars behind my original position were catching up.  I sped up and got over. Aftermath was bad and she made me pull over and stop driving. Cursed at me a lot.

Now, she called my dad. My dad wasnt too happy and I couldn't get a word in on why I did this to either. I felt it was safer, I dont care if someone is going slower. Something was not right with this vehicle. 

When I got home my dad asked what happened. I said I'd tell him when my mom wasnt around since she would say no and interrupt me. Instead of trying to listen to me, he just said I won't be taking the drivers test tomorrow. (To get my license). They both criticized me without even listening, both upset.

I wanted to stand up for myself and said ""Fuck off, I didn't nothing wrong and you wont let me speak."" I go to my room. I know its harsh, but they were cursing at me and I felt like I did nothing wrong. 

A car leaves the house and I assume it's the rest of the family leaving. I go to my parents room to grab their gun as I was kinda suicidal, but to my suprise my dad was sitting there alone. Instead if killing myself, I started to explain to him about what happened. He sounded like he listened, but now he said that he wasnt there so he cant assume what happened so he is really just listening to my mom. I was unbelievably pissed and said I didn't want to take shit for something that I didn't do wrong. He didnt like me cursing around him. 

Well, as I was leaving, my dad starting sprinting down the hallway saying ""I'm the boss. I will fuck you up. This is my house."" I've seen him like this before. He is an alcoholic and trys to hide the fact that he drinks during the day with gum and stuff. He doesn't normally say stuff like that. I could tell he had something to drink today based on body language. I said ok because I was scared and starting going to my room. He said something like I'm still fucking talking to you. He's a retired soldier and pretty big compared to me. I'm short for being 16.

He thrashed me on the bed and leaned over me and starting violently shaking my head and slapping me back and forth from each side while my head was in between. It's never been this bad. I tried to use my feet and just said Ok Ok! so he would stop. He left as I convinced him, but I wasnt fine. I started crying and whimpering to myself.

Recently I’d been looking for jobs and found one that needed a rep to be able to speak the language I learned in this other country! I thought it would be a good way to continue learning and practicing everything that I’d learned, and I felt confident in my ability to speak the language well, so I applied. 

As I went through the interview process, I felt comfortable up until they had me test my language skills. I froze up and it’s like I instantly forgot everything I had learned, even though I was 1000% sure I could do it just moments before they had asked. 

Needless to say, I didn’t get the job. I was lucky enough to be able to get hired by a different company and I’m so grateful for that, but here is where I need advice. 

I was so happy and so proud that I had learned this other language, and now I’m afraid I’ll never want to speak it again because I got turned down for that job. I know a part of the reason I didn’t get the job was because my language skills weren’t what they were looking for, which is a massive confidence crusher. I’m not blaming anyone but myself, but I need help. I don’t want to even think in another language ever again, and I want to bury that knowledge deep deep deep inside of me to never face that embarrassment again. Any advice on getting over it?

598,"I don’t mean to sound parinod or stupid but I’m slightly afraid I’m having mini strokes. I would forget things like my own phone password that I use everyday and is super easy to remember. Plus for awhile now every time or most of the time when I stand up I would get dizzy my vision would go black, I would have to lean on something or I would collapse on my knees and it kinda hurts it happens multiple times a day every day. For about a few weeks maybe a month I’m not good with remembering. And I’m having some trouble talking and I would stutter or say the same thing over and over again or loss what I was saying my mind going blank but only sometimes. And when I was reading(I’m a book worm) I had trouble comprehending the words or understanding them it was like it was in another language. I can read fine most of the times. But my mom says that it’s my meds which are antidepressants and anti anxiety meds. I thought that too until one of my dizziness episodes happened and my head felt like it was gojng to explode and my eyes were going to pop out but once the dizziness stopped and I got my vision back I was fine. Then today it happened again and I remember my eyes went cross eyed and I had some of my vision but it was mostly black. I’m not sure if I went cross eyed the last time. And before you say to switch meds or lower dosage I’ve been on different antidepressants and anti anxiety meds before and they didn’t work and a dosage any lower I would go back into my depression anxiety state. But don’t worry because I’m getting better😁. Please help I’m afraid to tell my mom because the last time I told her that I thought it was something wrong she just brushed it off and I’m not sure if it is or not.",22Mar2019,1
599,"So I have moderately religious parents.. They know about my nose piercing, clavicle piercing, and lip piercing and its not really a problem (they're not stereo-typically religious). However, tattoos are a BIG no-no. 

I've wanted to get tatted for YEARS and I have a few ideas, and if I want to get them they need to be hidden. Do you think its possible to hide them for a couple of years?

What suggestions do you have for areas where I can get them without getting caught?

601,"I cannot seem to decide how to move forward with my life and I'm in quite a pickle.

I own a home and have a baby with my boyfriend of about 2 years. I got pregnant by surprise very early in the relationship and love my baby with all my heart. I have a beautiful house in a city I really like, and I have a good job. It sounds perfect, but my relationship is very rocky. My boyfriend and I argue often, and as much as we have both worked on it, it doesn't seem to get much better. There's a lot to that, but to save time, I'll say that the biggest concern for me is that we don't make good coparents, and I'd like to make more children, but the first few months raising the baby with him were awful. He says he loves me and would do anything to make me happy, but when I bring up needing help with chores, he turns the conversation around and blames me for taking all this responsibility on myself.

Enter my amazing, supportive family who live 1000 miles away and have offered for me to come and live with them every time I think things are especially bad here. Well, not only do they love the baby, they love helping, babysitting, etc, which would make it easier for me to work and get my masters finished. My boyfriend does not get along with them well at all either, which is a shame because I've always dreamed of having my house be a winter home for my mother when she's retired, which is now.

Do I stay where things are often tense, unpleasant and stressful, but where I don't upset the way things are and can keep my job and my lifestyle? Or do I go home and be with my family and have the love and support I need to move on and grow my family, while  sacrificing my boyfriend's (minimal) relationship with the baby?

P.S. boyfriend does not help pay for medical care, buy diapers, does not help make baby food, doesn't feed baby, clean or fold baby clothes or change diapers regularly, and only holds/plays with baby when I ask him to so that I can make food, usually for said boyfriend. Has spent entire days without holding/playing with baby. However, he insists that he loves baby and would be heartbroken if I left with baby.",22Mar2019,1
602,"A few months back I planned a trip to go visit a friend and a few weeks before the trip started, she told me that she started dating some dude. Because of being in said relationship,this dude felt it was ok for him to alter my plans (ie make me stay at his house instead of her place and also try to limit what we do together simply because he doesn't like her having male friends). Although I was super pissed, I ended up compromising: I spent half the time at his place and the other half at a hostel to explore a nearby big city with her as we originally planned since my trip could not be cancelled.

During this period I noticed a lot of warning signs about this guy she was seeing:

1. He's 12 years older than her(27 vs 39)
2. Tries to control what she wants to do and where she is
3. Constantly degrades her(from what I saw and what she told me)
4. He was very cold towards me and had a ""I don't give a shit attitude"" even though he ""welcomed me"" to stay at his place(as most likely to ""monitor my actions"")
5. Subjected her to verbal abuse
6. Overly jealous at the fact that myself and her other friends have made plans to visit.

His behavior was rather alarming and even after I warned my friend to leave him, she kept defending his behavior and insisted he's a nice person(although she did acknowledge some bad things she noticed, she kept back tracking later on). She insisted she would be careful but still seemed to back track again. Last night I hung out with her and he called her cell. after she told him that she was hanging out with me, he became extremely aggressive and kept yelling at her (ex. ""YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER, YOU SHOULD BEHAVE"") and kept attacking her for being unfaithful and said a lot of shitty things about me too(even though we are just friends). She almost had a breakdown, so I left to give her some space after she told me she needed time alone and said she wanted advice the next day. (But at the same time she kept insisting he was kidding around despite me hearing the entire conversation). 

Fast forward to today, I told her how all these signs are warnings(AGAIN) and this shit she was dealing with was a super obvious sign that this guy is a toxic and psychotic creep who is trying to control her. Despite acknowledging some of my concerns, she tried to insist I was being too mean to him and that he is a caring person. Supposedly the ""issues"" he has was related to a series of crisis in his life that affected the way he engages with people. She still insisted being with him is a good thing for her and claimed that she would end the relationship once she realizes he goes too far and that I shouldn't be too worried, it wasn't right for me to judge since since it's her choice and not mine.

I've reached out to both friends and family for advice.

1. My friends said this is a crap situation but said I should do my best to support her
2. My family is pissed she caused so much trouble for me due to her obliviousness and told me to cut off contact with her. 

In regards to these 2 views, I'm split on what to do and want to see how everyone would respond to this situation 

TLDR: Planned a trip to visit a friend. She started dating a older guy before I arrived that exhibits extreme jealousy and paranoia. Despite my repeated attempts to warn her about his behavior, my friend still tries to insist nothing is wrong and won't fully value my view.  Friends tell me to support her if things go south, family wants me to cut her outta my life and idk which option is best",22Mar2019,1
604,"Background-I'm a white, queer trans person. I'm poly and live with my two long term partners, both of whom are trans as well. My sister is 23, I'm 28.

&amp;#x200B;

My sister used to be a great ally. She used my pronouns and chosen name and advocated for me to my (racist, transphobic, homophobic) family. She cared about racism, feminism, the climate, etc. I was so excited she was turning out to be such an upstanding person and felt like she was a close friend after a rough childhood that damaged our relationship p severely.

&amp;#x200B;

About a year and a half ago, we were on a road trip. I wanted to get some snacks. Without my knowledge, a large payment had been taken out of my account that day. The snacks came to $17, my card was denied, and I asked her to cover it for me until I got home a few hours later. I would do that for anyone-esp my sister. I called my mom and asked her to send the money to my sister right away (which was extremely embarrassing), bc I didn't have it and know she's sensitive about her money. My sister proceeded to call me, lecture me on how irresponsible I was, and then not speak to me...for a year. Over $17 that she got back within hours.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, we've begun talking again. I broke the silence, bc I didn't think it was worth losing my sister over what hadn't even been an argument. It really hurt me having my sister treat me like I was less than for being in a rough financial situation, but I sucked it up bc I knew she wouldn't-she's never been good at apologizing or admitting when she's wrong. I was just happy we were talking again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Until we started talking about politics. Her views have done a complete 180. She now thinks that everyone is brainwashed, we aren't allowed to talk about ""anything"" without being called racist/homo/transphobic, that ""identity politics are dangerous,"" that Planned Parenthood forces abortions on people and leaves babies to die in closets (she was also appalled that New York City caught up their laws to correspond with Roe vs. Wade bc she doesn't do ANY of her research and thought this was brand new policy), that Muslim women are oppressed no matter how they feel about it and white people need to forcibly intervene (despite having female Muslim friends tell her that isn't how they feel and they take offence to the belief), that white ppl respect the opinions of POC too much when they're ""doing things wrong"", that immigrants are dangerous and violent, that we should close our borders, that we should have more military and stop providing assistance to disadvantaged ppl. She says the news is against the right wing, that they're lying and making up false stories. She believes that no one but her is able to to look at things without bias (despite her extremely evident biases). She feels she is the only person who is able to do her research. During one conversation, she seemed to think she was going to get a checkpoint by asking me, ""If Obama wanted to build a wall, I bet you'd agree."" It's a bit hurtful that she thinks that I would be that stupid, honestly. I was the one who taught her about politics, who introduced her to human and civil rights, and I've spent years and years deeply involved in my personal research of this. I've also suffered violence due to my gender and sexuality.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I mentioned to her that I was excited about top surgery, and she started talking about studies she'd seen saying that being trans is just a side effect of mental illnesses like schizophrenia. She claims that she ""always sees"" trans people trying to deny that there's biological differences between men and women (who is denying that??), that HRT is dangerous, that doctors are only publishing positive things about trans ppl bc they're scared of being called transphobic, and when I mentioned she was sounding a bit transphobic and mentioned that the medical establishment doesn't have the most trans-friendly track record, she accused me (yelling) of being upset (I was speaking in a completely level tone and just pointing out that perhaps this was going down a bad road) and being just like everyone else who can't see the real truth. She thinks that any research about trans people that's funded by trans-positive organizations is false and that ""politics should never be a part of science"". She doesn't seem to grasp even basic hypocrisy or simple facts like we wouldn't have social data if politics didn't enter science, but I'm so tired of being the black sheep and accused of starting problems when I stand up for myself that I don't want to say much to her. I never yell at her, I never tell her she's flat out wrong. Whenever she's being bigoted and I tentatively mention that she may want to check that fact, she has a, ""See, EVERYONE IS ALWAYS ACCUSING EVERYONE OF BEING BIGOTED AND THIS IS THE PROBLEM W SOCIETY"" reaction. It does not cross her mind that perhaps ppl are saying that bc she IS being bigoted. I feel a responsibility to not let her run around spewing hate and misinformation. It's dangerous to oppressed people and I care about this. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel really depressed about the situation. I feel like I've lost my wonderful sister. She's obviously getting her news and info from very biased sources but can't admit that there's any bias except from the left. She claims to have no leaning and to not agree w any party or political view, but all of her issues seem to be with policies and opinions of a leftist leaning. I don't know how to be close with someone who I don't feel has any interest in my safety or rights, let alone other people's. When I question her about high profile news stories surrounding oppressed groups, she's never ever heard of them, but claims to be far more informed than anyone else in ""our generation"". I try to avoid politics with her, but she forcibly brings them up and won't drop them when I ask. Today, for example, I said that maybe a trans person isn't the best person to debate trans rights with, and she couldn't accept that and kept hammering the ""point"" she was making. I just wanted to share something exciting about my life with my sister.

&amp;#x200B;

Has this ever happened to anyone else? How should I handle this?  I don't want to lose her, but I can't stop a bad taste forming in my mouth every time we talk. I do nothing but answer her questions calmly, let her explain her point of view, and support her whenever she's anxious or upset about something. I don't know how much longer I can do that, though. I don't want to just write her off and be like ah well, not my job, bc no one else is going to correct her either. Help?

605,"My mom knew I dated this guy for a couple weeks in sophomore year in high school. Then we broke up. We dated off and on for years and I never told my mom because I didn’t see the point if we kept breaking up. Summer before I went to college was the best our relationship had ever been. It seemed to be like it will actually last. We actually hung and weren’t dating through the phone. 

The bad part is that in order to hang out with him I lied to my mom about where I was going and who I was with. I was angry all the time because I was hiding it from her. I wanted to tell her so badly but I thought I would get in trouble(even though I was 19) and I was ashamed I was still in love with a guy I can’t even have a stable relationship with. 

We ended up breaking up before I left for college and I’m really having a difficult time. My friends ignore me when I try talk to them about it. Neither of us wanted to break up but we figured it was the best decision. And he was really my only true friend. I haven’t talked to him in months.

606,I feel as though I struggle with depression (I’ve never been professionally diagnosed only self diagnosed) but my whole life has been a train wreck. My father was abusive for most of my childhood and was the reason my mother lost two of her children due to a miscarriage(they were twins). He is emotionally and mentally abusive now but has Stopped physically. All of this drove me to the edge last year where I almost committed suicide. No one in my family knew and no one in my family knows till this day. From my culture mental illness is not a thing. It’s just “the devil” or being overdramatic. I started self harming this year because my parents marriage is so shitty and they both use me as a therapist and I have to bare all of the what’s going on with them. They refuse to talk to each other. It’s even gotten to the point where I started taking large doses of pain killers to try to numb my self even if I’m not in pain. What kills me more is that my mom is trying to buy a house and move me and my sister illegally away from my father. But now I really can’t handle it anymore. Truly. I’m so stressed and emotionally broken over trying to do well academically ( I’m in advanced classes) while trying to be there for my parents. It’s ripping my whole family apart but every day I go to school with a smile on my face and I laugh and all that shit but inwardly I just want to cry. I’m so tired and so broken and done with life. I can’t deal with all the drama and hate my parents spew at eachother. And now my friends left me. Not all of them but some of my close ones left me and it kills me to know that the relationships I have are just as crappy. I know I shouldn’t blame it on my parents but I feel as though their relationship and my dads abuse have taken a toll on me mentally and it kills me knowing I’m this messed up. Idk my boyfriend is great but I don’t like venting to him everytime I break down or telling him I cut myself ( which I’ve stopped doing). I don’t want to be a burden to anyone. He has his own problems and I just seem so stupid every time I complain.  I just don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m going crazy and I know my life is falling apart.

608,"Before I start, I want to clarify : I am almost 20 years old, and I am the youngest child. All of my siblings and myself have been vaccinated, and I only recently found out that my parents are against vaccinations. I live in the US btw if that makes the situation different. Also this is a touchy subject, I know I shouldn't try to control how people feel, but this situation makes me really uncomfortable with my parents. Please refrain from comments that don't provide some sort of discussion or advice.

&amp;#x200B;

So last night I made a joke in front of them about anti-vaxxers and what not, because I find humor in a lot of the memes and stuff. They didn't laugh, and instead were just confused. ""People really need to be aware of the dangers in vaccinating, it's not funny to joke about."" is what one of them said. I was really shocked. My parents have always been pretty old school but I never thought they would be so ridiculous as to be part of the anti-vax group. I kind of brushed it off, and was about to change the subject, but then my mom blurted out ""You know vaccines cause autism right?"". I couldn't believe that she was actually being serious. I asked her and my dad if they actually thought that, and they were very serious about their beliefs. They went on about how it's all government controlled and the rise in vaccinations is scaring them. They also mentioned how every ingredient in the vaccines are a danger to your health, and how all the studies online are full of bs because it's all government regulated and stuff. I looked up several studies and experiments to argue with them and they wouldn't have any of it. ""Check the source, it's probably connected to the government."" My dad said that if I want a reliable source, to go talk to his chiropractor's office. (I guess that place is all about herbal healing and anti-chemical which is great, but I don't consider one random chiropractor's office as a credible source). I kept on about how ridiculous they were being and that they have 0 proof. 

&amp;#x200B;

But here's the best part. They said ""When we were kids, autism wasn't a common thing to come across, and neither were vaccines. Nowadays, as vaccines have become practically required, autism is on the rise."" It was so infuriating for me to hear them say this, because that's not enough evidence to create a reliable correlation between a cause and effect. I tried explaining that to them, I even gave them an example. I said ""Video games weren't very common when you were kids, but as they've become more common, so has autism, so you would think video games also cause autism?"" (I know it's not the same thing, video games aren't a medical thing and they aren't given in the early years of life, but I was just trying to get them to understand how silly they were being, but oh boy, they were even worse than I thought). They replied ""That's a good point, maybe that could be connected some how."" That was pretty much the last straw for me, I gave up trying to convince them, and my mom concluded that we would agree to disagree. This is honestly the first time in my life that I've been so against something that my parents believe, and I don't know if I can change them. It's really demoralizing for me because I've looked up to them my whole life and now they seem like very stubborn and ignorant people. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know, people think what they want to think, and if anyone out there is against vaccination, yay you, however I'd do some more research. But this is my family, the people that raised me, I am really concerned about them and what other things they believe with this anti-government thought process. I've consulted with all my other siblings and they all agree that our parents are being kinda ridiculous. Any tips on how I/we could help them?",22Mar2019,7

Despite this, I have been facing an issue for the past year-or-so, and I am.. just quite sexist against women. I dont want to go into detail because I understand my prejudices are awful, but I've come to a point where I won't listen to women content creators (musicians, youtubers, artists etc) purely based on the fact that they are girls. 
It's a very confusing position. When I express my views to my friends (of whom are all girls) they are disgusted and appauled - understandably. But I can't help feel that I can't subscribe to feminism, and I have no idea why, or what's wrong with me!

614,"Background info: I am a 17 M. There is a group I've known for ages. There is a certain ""friend"" D who is quite an ass tbh. He does run his mouth alot and this led to conflict last year. A few days earlier, I was talking to another friend about guitar, as I've recently been learning. He later makes a joke about how acoustic can get people laid and I laugh. D interjects and states I'm too ugly to get laid, if memory serves me right. (He has made this remark before which is ironic since he himself has yet to achieve intimacy) I get slightly irritated and throw a insult at him. Eventually, I let it go and continue my conversation. 

He still starts shit and I get so mad I curse him out and he resorts to calling me retard genes because I have a brother with minor autism. At this point, I tane a deep breath, try not to look mad and walk to a table group consisting of my other friends. Rest of lunch goes well and they're nice people. At home, I decide I've had enough and block D. I also left the SC groupchat.

Today,  drama broke out with another member however, I'm unaware of the details. ""P"", another member/a friend I'm normally on good terms with invites me to this chat where d tells me to stay out and says he only insults me when i insult him (Blatant lie) and some other wall of text. Apparently, they wanted to talk it out with me but at that point, I wanted nothing to do with D. I leave the groupchat. P simply types in insults such as r*tard.

I later see P and tell him I could care less for the drama, and that I do not wish to talk to D, no matter his intentions. P states I have zero thick skin and I need to talk it out. I repeat myself and state that no, I have burned bridges for good. He calls me a r*tard again so I point out the fact that despite taking all common core classes, hes failing them miserably. Anyways he later shows me a wall of text D sent him which I skimmed over. I remember it saying ""If we all were really friends, you'd talk this out"" and ""we were just joking"" even though D seemed genuinely mad and even cheered as I walked away from the table. It also stated ""Cant believe you have the audacity to....."" anyways I told P IDC and he said we're no longer friends. There goes our 3 year old friendship.

617,"I feel really terrible about this and I need some advice...
I was at a small drink up at my friends house with around 9 or 10 people at night, boys and girls, and before we all started drinking we were just chilling. Everyone else knew each other there but I was only really close 2 or 3 people there and I tried my best to make conversation with the other people I wasn’t familiar with. 
When we finally brought drinks out everyone began to take shots and sips and in general have fun.

It was a few hours later when it happened and now all of us were drunk. One of the girls that I wasn’t close with was sitting by herself so I went up to her and chatted with her. A minute later I started kissing her and I honestly don’t remember how I got off her. I didn’t ask if she wanted to kiss, but I went in. I didn’t feel any pushing away or hear her telling me to stop but that still isn’t an excuse. 
It was a bit after that during the drink up when I found out from her friend that she was crying in the bathroom because of this. I immediately went up to the girl and kept apologising. I told her that I honestly would have backed off if she didn’t want it; she said it was ok, it was fine and she understood that I was drunk. 

Even though she sort of ‘accepted’ my apology I still feel incredibly guilty, I’ve never done anything bad like this before and I didn’t know what I was doing. I messaged her the day after the drink up to apologise and she said its ok, but I felt like she only said ‘its ok’ as to not make things awkward or worse, rather than her being fine with it.

I just want to know your thoughts on this and if I should be doing anything because I feel really bad. I made her and possibly her friends upset too and I want to do what I can to make up for my wrongdoing. Thanks.

I met a guy a year ago through a group of close friends. 

He was really friendly and seemed really chatty, and asked for my number at the end of the outing. I gave it to him and we literally talked non-stop through Whatsapp months and months. 

He often talked about his life and family, how he loved his niece and sisters, University, but couldn't dedicate much time to it, since his father has paralysis and he's very ill; even until today he's taking care of him and going to hospital with him on a daily basis. He even had to give up college for a semester because of this.

He invited me for a coffee after some time and I agreed. 

We met and had an amazing chemistry, we laughed tons and I felt I had known him since forever. At the end of that date, he kissed me and we started dating. 

Fast forward to a month and some dates after that first one, he sits me down and tells me he has to tell me something important. He had a pale face and looked as if he was about to cry. 

He told me his sister had falsely accused him of rape two years ago; his sister has BPD (she's currently under treatment), and his whole family defended him. 

The whole case lasted six months in which he suffered a lot and the whole family faced a trial. The case closed when she finally regretted it and dropped the charges.

It left me shocked and I couldn't eat or sleep for days. My mother noticed it and asked me what was going on. As I have a huge relationship with her and in my family, a mother's voice matters, (I'm from a Spanish-speaking country and my mother is Armenian so it's cultural) I told her. I think now that was a huge mistake. I also told my best friend, and she expressed concern as well.

She (obviously) told me to leave him and my father almost prohibited me to date him or see him again. And, I, scared, didn't thought twice. I was heartbroken, but I did it.

Some time after, I decided, out of curiosity, to ask his sister if he was indeed dangerous (politely). She only confirmed what he had told me before, that he wasn't at all dangerous and that she made a mistake. But I decided to leave things there.

Fast forward to some months (March 2019) he messages me out of the blue and I message him too. We started talking casually again and after some days things turned kind of romantic and now I'm ""in a relationship"" with him...in secret. And I'm really falling for him.

Thing is, I know this won't last. My parents would completely SHUN it because they think he's a potential rapist. It isn't ethical. Besides, that's not the only problem, his father is sick; he and his family in general have many problems and I don't know how can that stuff affect me. 

I know I have to break with him, but I really have strong feelings for him.

What should I do, r/Advice?

tl:DR: I am in love with a guy who's family is full of problems and who was falsely (and proven falsely) accused of rape. My parents shun him.

619,"I have no idea if this is where my post belongs, if it doesn’t belong here please redirect me.  
I have a long term boyfriend and we have kids, but sometimes I get urges to sleep/experiment with other women, I’ve never followed through with these urges because it’s morally wrong to cheat but sometimes I really just can’t shake the feeling for a while, I often wonder if I would actually do it and enjoy it or if it’s just a fantasy?  
I have had sexual encounters with girls before but not actually full blown 👀.  
The urges hit a peak every now and again, and sometimes (without coming across as homophobic) the thought repulses me.  So confused because I don’t actually know if I’m bisexual or not, or as I said earlier, is it just a fantasy?

Also, there is no one in whom I really trust to talk about my problems. I guess that's mostly my problem, because it's kinda complicated for me to open up to people, and connect with them.

So, my question here is, where/how can I find new people and make new friends? I'm shy and introvert, and a little awkward with new people, which makes it complicated... What can I do and what can I (try) to change?

622,"I have given this lots of thought since I recently turned 21.
One of my biggest fears in life is me being in my 50s thinking back to my youth and being filled with regret or remorse because things “could’ve went differently” or “could’ve been better”.
I just wanna clarify that being 50 is by no means too late. Change can happen at any age and in any measures and it can always lead to good.

I know that having regrets is inevitable. Of course not everything will go the way you want or expect. But talking to multiple adults about this, there seems to be a trend in what they regret. A big one is not exercising/eating healthy. Another one is not having the courage to ask some person they knew on a date, etc.

I’m really interested in what the Reddit community has to say too. What are some things that you wish you did in your youth. What are things you started doing and it dramatically improved your quality of life? What are things that you stopped doing which also improved your quality of life?

I would also love to hear general life advice, as cliche as they might be. Cliche lessons are almost always very wise in my opinion.

I didn't get much attention on it. But a lot has happened.

My co-worker's creepiness lessened a lot, but it would come out here and there. One time he touched my leg and I yelled ""don't touch me!"" which before I probably wouldn't do it. But I told my boss because I discussed it with two office ladies who work for my department and one of them mentioned how she was getting crept on by my co-worker as well. Another co-worker of mine who recently got hired got creepy treatment too.

So I took everything I heard and my own testimony to my boss. I don't understand why I didn't tell him earlier, since he has two young daughters of his own. He understood me and sympathized with me. I told him that I didn't want my co-worker fired, but I just wanted to keep him in the loop and let him know how I and other people were being treated. He said he would be on the lookout and that he was glad that I told him.

During so, I go from the back of house to the front of house a lot to re-up on shots and organize my money ETC—so everybody sees me in my get up. For the most part people are respectful and they’ll tell me I look nice.

I (F23) have never been close with my sister. We had a rough child hood and were forced to grow up a little more quickly than other kids our age. To go into little detail; we were both raped by our neighbor for 3 years when I was 8 and she was 6. We both grew up with different ways to move past it. We both did self harm for a while, she much longer than me. But I went into sports to get my mind off of things and moved out as soon as I turned 18 to get away from my problems. Where as my sister; she spiraled. She dropped out of high school, and has the mentality of a 14 year old. She has bi polar disorder, ADD, ADHD, Depression, PTSD, Anxiety, and Schizophrenia.

About 5 months before I moved out, my sister became very homicidal towards me, telling me that I ruined her life. I ask her how and what part I played in it and she never gives me a reason. She just says "" It doesn't matter how, you just have"". From that point on she has threaten to kill me, to slit my throat in the middle of the night to be sure no one hears. At the most recent Christmas dinner, everyone was laughing, having a great time and someone had mentioned how my Anatomy teacher in high school was also my Fast-pitch coach and how that's when I decided I wanted to be in the medical field and suddenly my sister goes "" yeah, I had him as a teacher too and you told him everything bad about me. I hated my life because everyone knew my mental problems because of you"". Which was not true, her teachers all had me in their class before and when my sister entered high school, my mother sent a group email to the teachers making them aware of her problems so they know what to do when she has a panic attack.

We suspect she has multiple personality disorder because she can switch in a blink of an eye to a totally different person. Today, I texted her asking about the new dog my family got ( I do not live with them so I wanted the scoop on whats goin on) and she got snappy with me and out of no where sends me a voice message saying "" Leave me the fuck alone. You are such a child"" I being a little petty responded with "" Okay, hows the job search going?"" via text. She has never had a job longer than 3 days. I admit, I should have not responded, but her response back was crazy. "" I know where you live now. I will drive out there and slit your fucking throat. I will kill you. I have made a promise to myself for years to kill you. I hate you and want you dead""

I am terrified she would harm my mom. She has a past of getting in my moms face and cornering her and screaming. She breaks glass and goes crazy, she has threatened to kill my mom as well. The future I see for her is either her being murdered, or her murdering someone. I am scared. I try not to think about it. But she needs help, and she knows it. She says she wants it, but will never get it.

I guess I just wanted to get this off my chest somewhere. I cant talk to anyone in my family or life about it. Everyone who has met her, thinks she is sweet. But I know what she really is, and it is evil. People think I am crazy, my boyfriend always pushes me to mend our relationship, but he does not understand. No one understands. I do not know what to do.",22Mar2019,1
632,"A few years ago, if anyone asked me about my sexuality, I would have said I was undeniably straight. As a child, I was taught by my mom that being gay was wrong and God would have looked down on anyone who was. I had never even thought about liking girls until I moved to an all girls school. They were more accepting of different sexualities, and my friends had come out as bi, pan, etc. I was still extremely uncomfortable, I didn't think being gay was wrong at all (and I don't now), because I despised being told it was wrong. I always knew I wasn't straight, so I defended everyone who wasn't too. My best friend told me she was pan, and so I copied her, and said I was too, to fit in. She then said she was bi, and again, I changed. But I never really found my own sexuality. This was a few years ago. 

I'm in high school, for context.

Now, I'm having a crisis about who I really am. Nearly a year ago, I became extremely close with someone who was basically my better half at the time. I genuinely think I was in love. I had never been happier, but also kicking myself every single day for liking a girl. It had never happened, and I didn't think it would. I'd never liked anyone at all before this. 

The last few months have been a downward spiral. We stopped hanging out, or just really talking at all. That connection slowly faded but I told myself I needed to find out who I was. I was constantly stressed about liking a girl, because I repressed it and pushed it away. I genuinely hated myself for liking a girl. I'm an atheist but if there is a God, I know he would hate me as I do myself. 

I started going to bed later at night so I could stay up longer to recite ""God hates faggots"" while everyone was asleep and I punched myself, to hurt. I've been doing this for a few months, because I was convinced it would make me stop liking girls. I would masturbate to straight porn only, but here's where I really fucked myself over.

Now, instead of just being lesbian and accepting that, I see guys as sexual objects. I don't like them romantically, and I find them extremely unattractive, but I constantly think about sex while at school, and view all of my male teachers in a sexual way. I absolutely fucking hate it. I started thinking about riding them, or being pinned against a wall, how I want one of them to shove their dick inside of me, and I really fucking don't want them to. I don't know what I've done to myself but it hurts. I'm a fucking pervert who is so internally homophobic that I'm making myself think of every guy sexually. How do I stop?

TL;DR: Didn't accept that I was lesbian, trained myself to only be attracted to guys, which backfired and now I think of them sexually. How do I accept myself/How can I stop thinking about guys like this?",22Mar2019,1
633,"Hey guys, I’m a 21 year old student. So basically I’ve been unhappy living at home for about the last two years. Two years ago my older brother and his family lived with us, that had its own issues but fortunately he moved out and that hasn’t been a problem since. But my mother has been driving me through the roof during this time as well. Last year, I was enrolled in university in a different city that I had lived in for 10 years, was happy with my friends and general life. We had a nice house in the suburbs and generally lived a nice life. So my mother, inexplicably, on a whim (whatever you want to call it) decides that she wanted us to move out to a different province for no particular reason. She never asked or cared about my opinion (it was just me and my little sister). She didn’t ask what my thoughts were on this whole idea; she simply said we’re moving to a different province and didn’t specify what city we would be living in, just to prepare yourself. This was in the spring. She finally told me in June which city we would be moving to within said,  this subsequently screwed up my university transfer applications; I had to wait until January to re enter school cause my mother didn’t communicate with me as to where we were going to live, and I missed the fall deadlines. We transition to the summer, and my older brothers (dad isn’t in our lives) and mother move out to said new city. I decide to stay for an extra 3 weeks to say bye to friends. I get my first taste of living alone (albeit at a friends house) and I really enjoyed the process of doing your own work and not having this negative, controlling presence on your back all the time (my mom). Since August of this year, my mother has moved us out to three different houses in the new city; every time I picked up a job to help me pay off school, I would have to quit as we move to another side of the city. &amp; now, lo and behold my mother, after about 7 months and 3 different places in this new city, has decided she wants to move back to our original city. She planned absolutely nothing properly and has now realized she can’t enter the same line of work she had in our original city. I want to step out of my comfort zone and stay here. I’m sick of my mother, she’s a control freak and doesn’t care about what I think. She never asks how I’m feeling or what my thoughts are on anything. She’s self centred, selfish, and has taken me with her on her wild ride and I’m sick of it. I love her unconditionally but I feel like our relationship would be better served from a distance.

643,"I hope this post isn't too ramble-y or anything like that, but I have a lot on my mind. There's some serious topics, in case someone doesn't want to read that kind of thing.  
Also, things you should know: I have Dysthymia (Persistent Depressive Disorder)

It's honestly hard to know where to start. For my entire life, I've been going through some kind of horrible stress. I didn't have a good childhood at all, and everything after that, middle school and above, was me dealing with even more emotional abuse in school, to the point where I couldn't even handle being in the classroom with other students.   
I had horrible, toxic relationships on the internet when I was young, and have been sexually assaulted multiple times. 

I've had one job, and that was dishwashing. I saved up to build my computer that I'm on now, and that's probably the proudest moment I have. Otherwise, any other attempts of getting a job has left me having breakdowns and crumbling from the stress. I'll admit, I've had a few times where I pussied out and just left my job, crying and looking super weak. Literally most of what I was comfortable with doing was unhealthily staying on social media, and I made a lot of posts saying horrible things about myself. 

I spent a lot of time on the internet, in an endless cycle of hating myself and the people who wouldn't help me. (Obviously I don't blame them anymore!)  
The internet was my life and I think I legitimately believed that I didn't belong anywhere else. Eventually, I started to hate being this furry dude who tried so hard to make other people's day because almost every relationship I got into was either toxic/ridiculously childish, or one-sided. I left social media entirely, but every once in a while, I get that urge to go back. I still convince myself that those people who don't talk to me *at all* are ""my best friends,"" and it's just sad. I'm too self-aware now to even give it credence. 

I went to a crisis center because I was talking a lot about killing myself. I spent a few nights there and became a different person. I think for the first time in a while, I was actually confident in myself? And now I'm back home in my hermit hole, surrounded by art supplies, and just frustrated that I can't create or vent the shitty depressive feelings I get. Recently, been thinking things like, ""does this mean I don't want to be an artist?"" 

I have no problems with talking to people, but I'm so boring and I feel like I don't even know how to talk or be fun to be around. I watch videos, *maybe* draw, *maybe* make a small beat that doesn't go anywhere.   
My mom will occasionally bug me to have someone over, and most of my ""hang-outs"" are literally me having an anxiety attack, scrolling around YouTube, completely silent, while the other guy finds something else to do. I know in my mind I could do something about it, but I don't even think I know how to have fun, to be completely honest. There are a lot of times where I just feel like watching videos all day and just relaxing, and my mom has arguments with me about how I should be hanging out with people and getting out of the house. 

My sis helped me apply for jobs, and the whole time, I was never confident that I wanted the job. I don't feel mentally prepared for anything. It basically feels impossible to be nice to myself, because my entire life has been people making fun of me and treating me like shit. I feel simultaneously completely fine socially, but completely unable to handle any stressful situation. 

There's more to this story, but just talking about this is hard for me. There's a lot I'm missing for sure, which I'm sure people will ask things. 

Am I just a pussy? Should I give up on art? What should I do to get out of this fucked up cycle? How do I stop hating myself and stop being so unconfident? Anything you can tell me, I'd appreciate it, because my ultimate goal here is to help myself. I'm tired of wanting to die, blaming everyone else, harming myself, everything.

644,"I’m going to be vague in case she’s on reddit. I started being friends with this really cool girl (we’ll call her Y) before I started dating another girl. When that relationship ended she was there to kind of talk me through it and genuinely made things better. Months went by of sporadically texting each other and somehow we started talking one night about who we each like. I had a good guess as everybody loves this guy (plus she is kind of unintentionally obvious about it.) I then asked her if she thought the person that I liked would date me and she was completely honest and said probably not as she has been hung up on someone for years (we’re all in the same friend group which further complicates things) a couple of weeks later I was having a lunch with “the guys” when someone brought up that they’re pretty confident that Y likes him and they were wondering if he was interested in dating her... his response which was a little surprising was “I’m aware, but no.” 

My thing is I want to tell her because she was honest with me, but at the same time I don’t want to because there’s no need to just crush her. Like I kind of hope she snaps out of it but I also feel like maybe I should tell her...

What should I do?",22Mar2019,1

647,"My 10 year old son has been fighting depression for a while a now.  He is being treated for it.  My wife and Mom always tell me he needs to spend more time with me.  So just an hour ago my wife and I are talking and she says you need to take him golfing with you. I have no problem taking him with me, but  I stopped golfing 3 years ago when our 3rd child was born because she would throw a fit if I went.  Always took him  with me if he wanted to go.  I told her that I want her to stop saying that because that is not the reason he is depressed.  I have 2 other children that like to spend time with their dad too.  She then says that for the past 5 years or so he hasn't got to see me for more than 30 min a day.  A wild exaggeration.  Until last year I did work a lot of overtime because she is a stay at home mom and we needed the money.  But I was home by 7 every night and didn't work weekends so I could see my family.  I got a promotion and do not have to work that much anymore.  So I reminded her if that was true how was i the one that usually helped with homework and was at every single practice and game.  Me and him do do stuff just me and him, I do with all my kids.  I'm really tired of them insinuating and right out saying his depression is my fault somehow.  I told her she's dead wrong and I'm not apologizing for providing for my family.  I don't know what to do this, but it's getting really really old.",22Mar2019,1
648,"Hello, and thank you for reading and offering to help.

&amp;#x200B;

For some quick background, I am a 25-year-old college-educated male.  I would like to think of myself as intelligent, professional, and fairly personable.  If you were to meet me in person, I probably wouldn't strike you as a bum or a loser in any way.  However, I can't seem to find steady (much less fulfilling) work for the life of me, and I just feel like I'm going in a downward spiral.

&amp;#x200B;

As it says in the headline, I got fired today, just a few hours ago.  I can't say I'm shocked, just numb more than anything else.  It was a fairly new job for me, having been just three weeks into it.  It was a position as a project estimator for a mom and pop manufacturing company, and there is a fairly significant learning curve to it.  They took a chance on me, but early on I could tell I wasn't going to like it all that much (although it got the bills paid).  It was a desk job that simply entailed looking at blueprints all day, measuring with a ruler, and estimating the final cost to the company.  I'm sure some would like it, but I found it mundane and, as a result, it was difficult for me to focus on the job, and I spent a lot of the time just waiting for the time to finally get off for the day.  Anyway, the boss apparently recognizes this, calls me into his office, and gracefully lets me go, saying that I was struggling and that I wasn't a good fit.  I didn't take it personally, and understand from his view.  

&amp;#x200B;

In any case, though, I once again find myself without work, and without any real passion to pursue.  While I certainly have my interests (I would consider myself a pretty worldly and interesting person), I'm extremely discouraged right now and not sure what to do.  For over a year now, I've been considering being screened for depression/anxiety (this may be playing a role).  It seems that the only way I can get myself going in any way, shape, or form is through pursuing a passion of some sort, but I know that this isn't the way responsible adults behave.  

&amp;#x200B;

So, with all of this considered, is there any advice anyone could share with me?  Please feel free to be brutally honest, as I'm genuinely trying to improve my life before it's too late.  I only resorted to Reddit because I'm currently too embarrassed and ashamed to talk to friends or family about it.  Thanks again in advance.",22Mar2019,1

650,"Okay, so basically I'm working on creating a video game, and have run into a brick wall. I wanted to add some extra game mechanics that are interesting (and preferably unique) to liven up my game. So here's some context to work off of. It's an RPG mixed with Visual Novel set on a  fantasy world I created. To summarize the story, a necromancer sets off on a quest towards the hidden lair of an evil, immortal dracolich to slay it.

These are the game mechanics I have come up with so far:

* Karma (It's unrelated to Reddit) - Whenever you interact with a character, your Karma changes relative to how nice or rude you were to them. Your Karma score determines the outcome of the story.
* Multiple endings - Depending on a few things (Karma included), the story can end abruptly or the conclusion will change.
* Negotiation - Bandits, outlaws, etc. will attempt to talk to you before they attack you. You can avoid attacking them, give them their demands, or attack them depending on your interaction.

Most of these mechanics are based on giving the player actual choice (rather than the illusion of choice that most games nowadays give).

I'd appreciate some feedback on what mechanics I should add to the game to make it better or more enjoyable. So if you have any ideas, please comment them.",22Mar2019,4
651,"Yea so this is kind of embarassing, but it's becoming a problem. I only started to cut recently and it was originally because I wasn't happy with my body, but these past few nights or so I've gotten horny from it. I like to taste the blood sometimes and it makes me feel relaxed, I seem to shake a lot too. The pain isn't really that bad, it's just a little concerning to me because I don't want to keep harming my body like this. I get the urge too, and things go from there. I wouldn't say I am addicted, but I like my cuts. I've already cut deep a few times but I don't want them to scar and stay there forever. Is this a problem or do I only need to worry if I end up cutting too deep or if they get infected? I've applied some antiseptic cream to them and so far none of them have got infected. I'm only writing this because I've noticed how the cuts are starting to add up, they're almost all over my entire two thighs and lower torso. I was hesitant at first but now I'm starting to do longer cuts across my body, I try not to press too hard.

I mean this is kind of embarassing, I'm not writing this post because I want to sound 'edgy' or I'm emo or anything. I'm writing this out of concern and I haven't told anybody.

652,"Hello boys and girls of reddit! I dont drink often but last night I drank way too much and said things I regret to  a friend.

Short Version:

I'm a straight guy and my lesbian friend brought a tinder date to our hangout. One shot lead to 20 and I ended up insulting my friend and calling her stupid infront of her date. I feel horrible about this and even though I talked it out with my friend I can't shake the smell of asshole on me. How do I find peace with myself since super drunk me is still me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Detailed Version:

Lesbian friend recently broke up and started hunting for a girl on tinder. She found this girl, lets call her Kate, and they hit it off pretty quick. My friend invites her over to a hang out we were having for another friends birthday. I see her tinder date in person and jesus christ I already knew we were going to have trouble if I got too drunk. I was planning on taking 4 shots max to be chill but Kate kept singling me out to take shots with her. After a couple of shots my ego was starting to get louder so I took her up on those shots but no one else was drinking more shots it was just me and this chick. We eventually all go outside for some smokes and somehow (I forgot how) I end up inside alone with Kate. She starts talking to me about her personal life and how her being lesbian was linked to parental abuse like shit was getting deep. I was just listening then she started hugging me a lot. This girl was also hot af so by this point i was all in that im banging this chick tonight but then my lesbian friends comes back and kind of cockblocks. Sober me would understand boundaries but drunk me said fuck that and I started ripping her a new one infront of Kate. Bringing up how she's unemployed and that I'm the one that paid for everything (alcohol/food) also that I take her tests but yet she flaunts on snapchat that she's the one that gets the grades like just a bunch of shit that I had bottled up that I never wanted to get out but everything came out after the shots. Mind you I'm completely blacked out at this point because i dont remember saying any of this so my other friend (birthday boy) had to fill me in. So I feel super shitty about this because honestly I degraded her infront of her date and now my lesbian friend thinks that everything that I said is how i really view her. This is eating at my soul like I already talked with her over the phone and she said we were good but I can't be at peace with myself knowing that there is an evil twin lurking in my mind that under the right circumstances will come out and fuck up my friendships. I'm also thinking about the way Kate views me now too since this was like a first impression type deal.

655,"Throwaway for obvious reasons, and tw: sexual assault and some graphic details


Two years ago, when I was 17 and naïve, my coworkers (including a supervisor and two male managers) made a bet over who took my virginity, which I was unaware. About a dozen of them placed money on this bet.

One of them was particularly determined to “win”, and asked to “walk me home” one night after we both closed work. Since we lived only a couple blocks away and it was about a 10-15 minute walk, I agreed.

He mentioned taking a shortcut in the nearby park, where he raped me. I walked home in shock and cried for hours in the shower, wiping off blood. It was traumatizing, and I spent many hours crying, and flinching noticeably when any man came near me. I became more reclusive and started crying in class and was more quiet. My dad and I were fighting at the time, so I didn’t tell him, and he refused to let me quit, so I worked there for another six months. Rumours spread that me and the coworker had sex, and I was called names and became a mockery. 

Because of this, I’ve steered mostly away from from dating, and developed some serious self-esteem issues. This, plus another few childhood events (eg. abusive mother) caused me to develop BPD, anxiety, and depression. While i’ve mostly got them under control due to therapy and CBD oil and support from friends, I still suffer some lingering PTSD and doubt. 

I want to tell my father, but I have no idea how to, especially after two years. My stepmom and I are somewhat close but i’m not sure how they would react. My dad and I are now much closer, but he’s more rational than emotional, and I honestly don’t know how he’d react. And I don’t want to cause him more stress in his life. But it hurts, and I don’t know what to do.",22Mar2019,6

So I had my first love at 20 and he being a little older than me by 4 years.

Anyway about a year and a half ago I bumped into him being at one of my friends leaving dos and I cried (embarrassing and being drunk) and we ended up talking and before I left he ran after me and went to kiss me but stopped. He does have a girlfriend who he lives with. Also he cried aswell.

TLDR: I have a new born and CDC recommends everyone getting flu shot. Family isn’t against flu shots but won’t get one. They conspire against me as being “overly”. What should I do?

I recently had a baby girl (9 Feb 2019). My doctor suggested that everyone that interacts with my baby have their flu shots. I “kind of” agreed but I wanted to make sure so I read the following article: 
“Some children are at especially high risk

Children at greatest risk of serious flu-related complications include the following:

Children younger than 6 months old
These children are too young to be vaccinated. The best way to protect them is to make sure people around them are vaccinated”
https://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/children.htm

After reading that from the CDC, not some google website... The CDC.. I said fine. 

My family requested to come see my child. I let them come and visit the first time. After that visit I requested that they get the flu shot. They flat out said no. I asked why and they said “because we just don’t get them”. I pressured them more and more on why and they admitted that they had no good reason but that they just won’t get one. 

I told them that they would have to wait until she is 6 months to see her again then. They said fine. They are now conspiring behind my back saying how over protective I am.

Me: Have you ever drunk alcohol before? You need to learn your limit.  
Friend: So your pressuring me to drink?  
Me: No, I just think it's good if you drink at least once. My older cousin taught me how much I should drink over the summer, for example.

670,"My mom met this guy, married him so fast (they only dated for two months before getting married), and he moved in. Before he moved in it was just me and my mom for nine years. We were close. We were more like friends than a mother/daughter relationship. 

But ever since he moved in I never see her anymore because she just wants to be with him. They work the same job so their schedule is the same. They stay in their room until they leave for week and when they get home from work they go straight back to their room. They would even eat meals in their room. My mom would cook and give me my food in the living room and then take their food to their room. When they were off, they would go somewhere fun and leave me home alone even if I asked to go. Sometimes they would leave for 2/3 nights and go on mini vacations together. 

It made me so lonely and depressed. I felt like my mom didn’t care about me anymore. After three months of that I tried to kill myself and ended up in the hospital for two weeks. After I got out, they were nice and would stay out here with me for like two weeks before everything went back to how it was. The only difference was they started eating in the living room with me. I still felt lonely. I talked to my mom about it but she didn’t care and basically just told me to shut up because apparently seeing me ten minutes a day should be enough for me to not feel lonely. 

There was this movie that came out that I wanted to see. I saw it with my mom while he was at work. My mom said she was seeing it again with him so I asked if I could come because I wanted to see it again. She told me she wanted to go just with him as a date. I later found out that he texted my mom and told her not to let me go and to leave me at home. That was a really shitty thing for him to say and it made me even more depressed. I didn’t forgive him for saying that, but my mom did and she acts like everything is normal. I’m mad at her for forgiving him for saying that. He doesn’t care how I feel and as long as my mom forgives him he’ll think it’s fine and do it again. 

I tried to kill myself again a few days after that. My mom was saying “it’s just a movie” and that I shouldn’t get that upset over it. It wasn’t even about the movie. It’s the fact that he would say that and that my mom clearly doesn’t care about me if she let him get away with it. After I took the pills the second time and after my mom found out, she went into her room and I heard her tell him, and then she got mad at him and accused him of being happy that I took the pills. So that makes me feel so much better knowing he wants me gone. Apparently the little amount of time that I spend with my mom is taking her away from him too much. 

My life sucks and this is just making it worse. I’m 18 and I have no friends. I can’t even get a job because I have a severe speech disability so I never get past the interview. I don’t drive because I can’t afford a car or car insurance. I stay in the house all day almost everyday. Before my mom got married she would take me some places, but now she only does if she happens to be off when he is working. I can’t go anywhere with them both because apparently I would be infringing on their time together, even though they see each other more than I see my mom.  

My mom tries to defend all of this and say parents get married to new people all the time. Yeah, but I highly doubt any of them completely forget to spend time/talk to their children just because they got married. She’s making me feel like I’m asking too much by wanting her to spend time with me or asking her to take me somewhere. 

I would like to move out. I know I would be alone, but it’s better to be alone then to be constantly reminded that your family doesn’t care about you. It makes me feel like shit. ",22Mar2019,1
671,"So this is a weird long one.

I work for a UK company.  Our Office Manager was until recently our HR Manager, at the same time, doing both roles. (Already this raises eyebrows) 

In short, she is not impartial. She has always acted as HR but had favourites, which is just fucking awful. This hasn't really been a secret. (I used to be one of her favourites, which I hated as it made me feel like I had special treatment but I could do nothing to stop her acting like that)

Over the past three years, I had issues with stress at work that made me short tempered. This was a known issue she commented on, but was never a disciplinary against me. It probably should have been.

Over the last six months, we went from full on work to no work.(also, this HR manager transitioned to an Office Manager role full time. This is important to note) My mood shifted from stressed and negative due to too much work to being depressed and negative as I had nothing to do and felt useless at work.

Today, she said openly to me and within the presence of other employees that ""I need to stop being negative, it's been six months and I have no reason to be negative, you need to change, (to paraphrase). This greatly upset me as she was essentially slandering me and putting me down in front of other employees. I went home feeling like shit and still feel like shit now.

How do I act on this? We recently hired an actual HR person but she's only been with us a month. 

I want to report the old HR manager/now office manager as what she said was fucking awful and made me feel like shit. But I feel like it won't go anywhere. I guess I should report her to the new HR, but it will be odd to so out of the blue (to the new HR manager who is already being put in the pocket of the old HR manager...) and I fear it will just make things worse since it's obvious the complaint will have come from me. 

I'd speak to my direct manager, but I am unsure he would act on it correctly. Should I report it to the company director?

Also key to note!

I sit literally next to the old HR Manager/now office manager. So that'll be awkward.

The old HR Manager/now office manager is married to one of our companies  higher ups. (Yay, nepotism...)

What the fuck do I do in this situation? I feel like any report I make will not affect things beyond her becoming stubborn holding a grudge and treating me like shit. She won't get fired for the above mentioned reasons. 

My work life would become worse after I make the complaint.

I feel like my long option is to make the complaint then hand in my notice, so that I do not have to deal with the Fallout, while hopefully making things better for current and future employees. 

I look forward to what advice people can provide. ",22Mar2019,1

675,"posted on an anonymous account because idk who uses reddit in my life

So my brother got sent away to a boarding school 2 years ago for drug and substance abuse. He returned just 3 weeks ago and was doing great. This morning i was taking a shower right after him when i noticed his phone on a shelf, and me being the good brother that i am decided to go give it back to him. But when i lifted it up i saw a juul and it startled me for a second because it’s not what you expect after your brother got sent away

Now I don’t know what to do because i don’t want to tell my parents because i don’t know how mad they will get and what they will do. I also told myself that if he did anything abuse then i would tell my parents. I just want some help in deciding what i should do and please help me out here",22Mar2019,1
676,"I’m finishing up grad school for social work. I have a job I love. I’m in a long term relationship. But I have a hard time forging long term friendships. 

Growing up I was really lost. I hated other girls my age. They were competition and therefore the enemy. I’m about a year into eating disorder recovery, so sometimes I still feel that way on an instinctual level. 

I have only one close female friend. I made one more but she moved across the country halfway through grad school. I do try to make more friends, but it doesn’t seem to pan out. I just want to finally forge a close bond with other women and I’m really struggling. 

Any tips on how to start making more friends? ",22Mar2019,2
