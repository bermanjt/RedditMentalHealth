1,"Simply put:

I was not too successful in Highschool. I barely even graduated, and I was overweight. Since graduating high school, it's been one success after another, I traveled the world, had an incredible military career, made amazing friends, and just recently got accepted into my absolute dream college. I've still got three years of college to go (I'm transfering in). And yet... despite having been a star-chaser after high school, and despite the fact that I'm still in my early twenties, I can't help but be aware of the fact that I used to smile a lot, and be genuinely happy for long periods of time. Sure, there weren't that many victories or incredible life-changing events, but I miss it nonetheless. I've had many accomplishments since graduating, but I haven't smiled or laughed much, or been genuinely happy for any extended period of time. Is this normal? Am I going to end up an old person who never stopped wishing he was back in Highschool? Elders of Reddit, hear my prayers! Has anyone any thoughts on this? Or similar experience, that they did or didn't get over?",17May2019,1
3," Hi ya'll. I'm a high school student who was offered the chance to work for a political candidate running for the 2020 presidency through family connections. It's a wonderful opportunity, I know I'm blessed, and this will do SO much for my college applications.

The problem is that I live in Virginia, and the campaign manager expects me to work/receive training in South Carolina for 9 weeks over the summer before I start working directly in the government, in the DC area.

South Carolina is far; I don't have transportation (My parents will be working in DC throughout the ENTIRE summer, and I still can't drive yet), and I have other major activities planned for the summer (a job and 2 other internships). Although this opportunity will probably be my peak, I have other activities going on in my life. What should I do? This job starts in June; I basically have 2 weeks left to decide what to do.",17May2019,3
4,"I got screened for depression and my counselor gave me a list of therapists in the area to checkout and they said they would leave my mom a voicemail and I asked to leave the room because I didn’t wanna hear what her response was because I knew she’d be mad. Afterschool I text her and ask if she’s mad and she starts flipping out and I find out that the school never even called her or left a voicemail so I ratted myself out. She called me and I said that they just gave me a list and she started screaming at me saying that it’s bullshit and that I just stay up late at night and that’s it and just completely belittled me. Now I regret even going to get help because I knew this would happen, I ended up three steps behind where I was. I told her to just forget about it and now not only will I not get help but she’s gonna mock me for months about it and make fun of me. Idk what to do, Ive been trying to get help for years and it’s affecting every aspect of my life but she won’t even have an open mind, I don’t know why she’s so mad about it.",17May2019,3
5,"So lately my boyfriend has been extra stressed with work lately. His business partner recently got diagnosed with cancer so he's had to pick up the slack since his partner just had surgery etc. 

Today I was on the phone with him and he sounded so stressed out with everything that was piling on his plate, it sounded like he wanted to cry. I felt so bad. (I've tried to help him out with his work before, running errands for him and whatnot but since I'm not an employee, I can only do so much).

Thing is, my bf is fairly well off so he has material things if that makes sense. And anything he would want, I probably couldn't afford it. I just want to give him a little gift to show my appreciation or do something for him to help him relax and de-stress. He does so much for me, I want to be able to return the favor.",17May2019,2
6,"So I don't have many boundaries. Currently, if my 5yo son sees me naked (I'm a lady), I don't treat it as a big deal. He's not giving me that weird look where you KNOW he realizes I'm a woman and I'm naked. So yeah, whatever. However, my husband grew up with massive amounts of siblings, and privacy is big with him. So every time child is around him and he's anywhere close to being unclothed, he asks (demands?) for privacy. I want my kid to grow up comfortable in his body, but also with respect for boundaries. So what should I do?",17May2019,0
7,"Yes yes, I'm a snowflake.

The constant barrage of negative news stories on social media take their toll on me - I'm a highly empathetic person so even if it has no direct impact on me it still leaves me hurt, sad, angry, frustrated, scared, etc. but obviously stories that reflect attitudes against people like me hurt too.

Then there's the comments section...I sometimes can't help but get tied up reading and replying to all the hateful or ignorant comments.

The solution people give is just to get off of social media...but like most people I want to interact with friends online, frankly I've not much to do with my time or local friends to spend time with. I've tried unfollowing some news sources but I want to stay informed, I've tried adding more positive pages but they're few and politics still gets dragged into it...or I find I get irritated by faux positivity of the likes of inspirational quotes.

How do I counteract some of this negativity?",17May2019,1
8,"In 2017 i was chaptered from the military due to mine own laziness. I was diagnosed with severe anxiety stemming from depression. At first i though hey cool more money, but then i started feeling what anxiety truly is. My latest experience with it was due to a jump scare in the game The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. Now i cant load that game up without getting all shaky and loose from anxiety.
I cant wear other peoples hats, i cant wear their shoes and if they wear mine then i need new ones, i cant call people-even close friends. If any person with even a hair of authority over me (a crosswalk guard at an elementary school for example) starts talking to me then i cant even talk back because my voice just cracks and shakes and if i keep trying then i start crying.
In 2018 my best friend hit 2 trees going 70 because he had 1 beer too much and wanted to listen to some fucking dudes new album. This kid was my connection to the world. Being in the military made my friends for the habit of not including me in any plans, which of course makes sense. But when i came back, that didnt change no matter how hard ive tried. Other than my buddy. He always made sure to throw me a word, and him doing that made a couple of my other buddies remember me too. But now hes gone so if i dont say anything, then nothing happens and ill literally sit at home. Sometimes thats what i want. Most of the time i dont want that at fucking all but i cant reach out because of my anxiety. 
Now i feel lost. I have no one to talk to. I cant get new medication because my doc says that what im on is my best bet or something. Ive tried therapists but i dont have the money. Ive tried friends but ""drink more beer bro"" and ""smoke more weed buddy, youll be great"" arent helping all that much. Ive tried family but i can only ""pull myself up by my bootstraps"" so much before anxiety pushes me back down. I dont know where to go and i dont know what to do. I do know that i dont want to kill myself.
I hope the right person out there sees this because i feel like this is all i got left to try.",17May2019,1
9,"I’ve known my friend for about two years, really only a little over a year as friend.  So I do like my friend a lot but I’ve stepped back from my feeling for her because it was just too much. We’re still friends, but I avoid doing the semi romantic things we used to do together.

The other day she texted me saying there was a club that was accepting applications and I should join. I said thanks, and went back to work.  Then she said we should go together, and we texted for 45 minutes for no other reason than what she was saying made me smile and I didn’t want it to end.  That happens a lot.

I know, whenever someone, particularly if it’s a girl suggests something it’s because they want to go with you.  Regardless of what feeling I may have left for her, why don’t I notice these things? So now we’re joining a club together....I mean I’m happy about it, but why not just ask me since we’re friends and have known each other for a long time.

The other day it came up that I’m the only other person, aside from her other sexual partners, she spends “quality one on one time with’ and things got awkward for five minutes.

TL;DR: I thought I was done with the games between me and my friend, but lately it’s been getting tense....but fun.  She turns me on so much, but it’s always at the wrong time.  Why is she deciding to starting playing games again?  I thought things were finally setting out, I’ve been dating and generally she isn’t on my mind that much.",17May2019,1
10,"Hi, This is coming from a person getting into 20's from India(maybe just for getting some background).

Recently out of college, 
I wanted this to share with someone, but we really do get a lot less people to share this out in the real world.
I am kind of confused about my career, personality etc. etc.,,, coming to the career aspect, i see a lot of options ahead me from finance, to engineering(my original background) or maybe try something new which excites me, then there comes a inner me which tends me to think about my family and future, like how will i cope up if i fail at something and not able to make anything out of my life...,and for a fact i know if i don't take up a stand to go into 1 field i might totally ruin my career, so maybe people here can advice me the way to go...

Coming to the personality aspect, being raised in india in a competitive environment, on top of that being introvert, has made me think how will i ever change myself, 
I tend to overthink a lot about how people perceive me after meeting them,
Also i have mindset to like totally ignore people whom i dont get along much, even if they share same workplace, which becomes quite difficult, 
Being introvert and in this socially active world nowadays also kind of keeps you apart, like i dont use insta, or snap or even fb for showing to the world what i do.
I dont get along with girls much as well maybe due to this reason, 
The thing with me is i don't get along with other people's perception much, so is that bad for me? I just start ignoring that person from then......

I might sound a lot confusing in my post, but maybe if someone gets what i am trying to seek, please do advice..., if you want to ask any specific detail to get better idea please do",17May2019,1
11,"Hey everyone, I'm fairly new to reddit so this will be one of my first posts.
 So there's this girl I've been texting and talking to nonstop for about a two weeks now. I'll just call her ""Crush"" to make things simple.She and I met back and forth grade, reunited senior year of high school, and finally went our separate ways after graduation. One of my main friends at college had a boyfriend that I eventually met and it turned out he was Crush's older brother. I thought that was near but didn't really care. Flash forward Crush's brother and I become become best friends after he hooks me up with a well paying job. Recently I had reconnected with Crush on Instagram asking her for help applying to a new college, what gym to go to, etc. Out of no where we just start texting each other nonstop (when I'm so used to be left on read) and running into each other at the gym.

14,"Our relationship has been somewhat strained for the last year and a half. We have not had sex more than twice in the last 18 months, and it felt forced and not intimate. We never fight, argue, yet are completely different people. We have built a nice little life together over the last 10 years, and all the comforts and familiarities of a home, but without the passion, desire and nurturing that a relationship needs, and it has become an empty shell, and we have become nothing more than roommates. We have no kids together, and we are both each other’s second marriage.

I recently found myself in a relationship with another woman, which at first we both knew it was just sex. We have known each other for 6 months, and fell for each other right away, and it feels as strong as day 1, again, 6 months later. But, it has grown to much more, and I am in love with this other woman, and I left my wife for two months. After missing the familiarity of my home, and the quiet and serene nature of my home, I went back. I have been back for one week, and it now feels like it did before, isolated, lonely and again, roommates. My wife was under the impression I stayed with a friend of mine, as this is what I told her, but I was not. Now that I am back, she has clearly made herself much more independent without me, as I would’ve expected. I am riddled with guilt, and tormented between someone I truly love, and the one that has been patient, and stood by me while she saw me struggle, and all the memories we had built. I have already secretly packed some of my items again, and want to tell her, that I want to leave again, and this time for good. I can financially stabilize her for about 3 months as we make the adjustments. She has always been my best friend, and I do not want to hurt her in any way. The other woman (also has 3 kids) is giving me pressure to leave my wife. Asking me to choose, because she doesn’t want to be stung along any longer either.

I am completely torn, and realize that I may be considered a huge piece of shit. I can’t imagine this is a rare occurrence amongst married couples. I am looking for reasonable advice that can help guide me.",17May2019,1

16,"Let me just start off by saying that I am not for or against guns. I don't own any, but I don't have a problem with them as long as they are used responsibly. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years and have had very few issues. He's a great guy and he's wonderful with my kids. Before he moved in with me, I knew he had guns, but didn't know that he carried as he didn't have an active permit when he first moved in. When he renewed it and I found out, I didn't really care because he told me he had the proper paperwork and assured me that he is very responsible. But I did mention that my mom does not like guns and nothing is going to change her mind, so to please just don't have them around her. Since then, he's had four strikes, so now I do not feel comfortable with him carrying.

Also, let me add that he recently developed a very bad panic disorder. He had a traumatic incident in September 2018 and now he has serious issues in crowds. To the point where he HAS to take his prescribed Ativan (like Xanax) otherwise he will start throwing up from the anxiety. And because now he panics so much in certain situations, it's actually fueled his adamancy to carry all the time. He even wanted to bring a knife with him into Disney World last week...

So, the first incident, was when my mom gave him a ride to Publix (his car was in the shop). She was going to wait in the car so before he went in, he took his gun out, says to my mom ""Hold this for me while I go in"" and hands her the gun. My mom was in shock and not expecting him to do that. And I was really mad at him for handing my mom the gun, after I already told him that my mom does feel comfortable with them and nothing will change her mind. When I told him that what he did was not ok and to please keep the guns away from my mom, he got annoyed because he just couldn't understand why someone would be so against guns. Like his opinion was the only one. So what does he do? He goes over to my mom's house (without telling me) and tried to convince her to be ok with them. And also, that he thinks the whole family should take a gun safety classes and they should all be board. AND (this is the icing on the cake) he asked her if she's ever been raped..... thinking that she would confide in him if she had been..... And his reasoning to why he thought she might have been raped? Because ""The only people he's ever known to be *this* afraid of guns are people that have been sexually assaulted with a gun."" So, after that my mom was super uncomfortable, but I let it go.

Then, I noticed he left the gun out on the nightstand one night. He said it wasn't loaded, but in my opinion a gun should not just being sitting out on a nightstand when it's not in use. ESPECIALLY WITH KIDS LIVING IN MY HOUSE. But the kids were not there that night, so again I let it go.

The third time was last week when my parents asked to borrow my car to take to Georgia. Shortly after they left, my boyfriend says to me ""I wish I would have known your parents were taking your car, my gun is in your glovebox."" So I got pretty annoyed because to me, that is very careless and he could have gotten my parents in a lot of trouble had they gotten pulled over. But he didn't seem to think it was a big deal. He said ""I already called your dad and explained the situation and he is ok with it"". But I know for a fact that my parents were not ok with it and they also thought it was very careless. They just didn't say it to his face.

Then finally, the other day my dad called me asked ""Is Kevin\* missing a knife?""  I asked my boyfriend and he said ""Yeah, my knife is in the back of seat of your dad's truck."" That's when my dad said to me ""No it was actually laying in our driveway."" So first of all, he didn't even realize that he had dropped it, which is again very careless. Second, him intending to leave it in the back seat of the truck doesn't make the scenario any better because MY KIDS are in the back seat of my dad's truck all the time. And third, he did not see why this was a big deal AT ALL. He got agitated and tried justifying it because ""It was in a case"" and ""It's not just going to jump up and bite anyone.""

I don't know what to do now. He's one of those people that wouldn't give up his guns/knives unless someone pried them from his dead fingers. I want to tell him that I'm not ok with him carrying anymore - knives or guns - but that he can keep them to use at the shooting range, as long as they're in a locked safe. I think it's fair, but I don't know how to bring it up. I'm kind of panicking because if he says no, then I'm going to end it. Does anyone have any advice? Am I being unreasonable?",17May2019,10

21,"I just got a job about 2 weeks ago and am still doing (technically) training. I say technically because they trained me for about an hour on my first training shift and have since just left me to do it myself the last few days. The job is working in a grocery store, but its really just stocking. The job description was slightly deceptive, and I have now been told by my trainer that the stocking im doing is pretty much all the job is.

&amp;#x200B;

 The problem is this job KILLS me. I have only had 4-5 hour shifts of this, but every day I come home exhausted and mentally checked out. I have A.D.D. and anxiety pretty bad (diagnosed) and the specifics of the job are so taxing on me, because not only do i have to focus on where things are, where they go, how much is needed, etc. but its also a lot of just physical labor to go along with it, so I end up in a position where my non--focused mind gets checked out 2 hours in from having to memorize everything AND the sheer amount of labor I do tires me out even faster. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then there's the anxiety aspect of it where Im doing this job every day, stacking boxes, putting them away, stacking boxes, putting them away every day for hours on end. This job feels like Im in a tunnel with no end to it, and im just walking and walking with no end in sight. And then when I get home, I feel miserable and I cant stop thinking about the fact that I have to do it again the next day and the next day and the next day. It pains me to say that I have to work tomorrow. I cant stop thinking about it and how awful it makes me feel emotionally and physically.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to do delivery full time but my parents told me its not making enough money, and so i decided to get this job. The delivery job was perfect for me because I worked at my own pace in an environment im comfortable in, and I know my area pretty well so i was efficient at it. Sure, I wasnt making huge numbers, but I was making a living wage with what I put in. The only bad part was the car expenses that go with it but Im not looking for big bucks right now. Im looking for a job that doesn't make me miserable. My parents dont even care about the money, they only care about me having a ""real"" job. But im miserable in this ""real"" job and I don't know what to tell them because this is a kind of habit of mine. I used to work 2 years at a place and quit because of how miserable and washed up I was because of it, and i dont want that to happen again because it took a long time to recover.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I hate my new job to the point where I feel absolutely miserable and depressed, and it consumes my thoughts every day to the point where its affecting my every day life. I used to have a job that made me happy, but wasn't as lucrative, but my parents don't want me to do that. I don't want to go to work tomorrow at all. What do I do?",17May2019,1

31,"A long time ago my mom had a back injury at work as a nurse. She worked for the next 10 years as a nurse and her back pain just continued to get worse and worse. in 2011 she finally decided that she needed back surgery. She went and had back surgery and there was a lot more damage to her spine then expected. Her surgery was expected to last 2.5 hours it lasted 6. She did not have a good recovery period from that surgery, she was in a lot of pain and none of the doctors were able to do anything about it. When going into that surgery the hospital that she worked at expected her back to work 2 weeks after her back surgery. She was not able to heal in 2 weeks enough to work so they laid her off.

&amp;#x200B;

It took her about 2 years to fully recover from the back surgery, but even though she had the back surgery her back still hurt a lot. Since 2012 my mom has not moved around a lot and has just trying to do the best she can. She can walk and do stuff, but can not do it for long periods of time.  One of the best ways that she found to help her pain is laying in bed and laying on a heating pad. So that means that she has not had a lot of interaction with people and does not talk to a lot of people. So that means that she has been doing that a lot of the last couple of years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently in March of this year, my mom had a T.I.A or a mini-stroke. They did all of the necessary tests in the hospital and they concluded that she did not have any damage to her brain or any other type of lasting effects from the stroke.  About 2 weeks after she came home from the hospital she started having some memory issue, where she did not know what day it was or it did not know what time it is, and if my family told her she would forget it after a couple of hours and ask us again. Also, she sometimes has trouble concentrating on things. For example, she likes to knit, but she seems to not be able to concentrate long enough to do the knitting or concentrate on a certain pattern. These things do not always happen, it seems like there is no pattern to why she is forgetting things and having trouble concentrating. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure exactly the best way to help my mom. I am wondering if this is just her brain healing or something more is going on. One of the things that I think may help her, but not sure is by her getting out more and talking to people and interacting with more people. Like some type of adult care during the day or something where she can go during the day to meet with new people and talk to people other than just me and my family.",17May2019,2

My dad buys him technology pretty often, and imo he doesn’t really deserve since he doesn’t do much around the house and stuff like that. 

He’s told to do something, doesn’t do it and just messes with his phone that he got from our dad, gets phone taken away cause he doesn’t do anything, gets grumpy cause he doesn’t get what he wants, tells dad about it eventually dad’s like “She’s taking away your phone just so that you can’t talk to me”.

That last bit? Yeah I couldn’t ever prove it (but it was really obvious). Until today, I was walking by my dad, since he was picking up my brother and I heard him say exactly that. He doesn’t live with us, he doesn’t know what my brother does and he makes claims like this. He says stuff like this all the time, but that is the first I’ve directly heard where he has made a clear “your mom doesn’t want you to know me” type of thing. 

This has been going on for a while but what I heard today, that line right there, sold it for me. I need help. I thought about telling my brother, but from what I see anything you say to him he turns around and says straight to dad. I might tell my mom, but I don’t think I should make these decisions without a bit of advice from you guys. If you need anymore info just let me know and I’ll tell you what I feel comfortable with telling.",17May2019,1

37,"I have a friend from high school who I used to really like and they liked me too but nothing ever came out of it. I've been on a few dates since then, but never actually dated anybody. We finally got back into contact after a couple years of falling out of touch, and we've been determined to hang out again during summer and have met up a couple times already and had a blast.

Not being more direct about my feelings for them in high school is easily one of my biggest regrets in my life so far and I feel like this might be my last chance to ever put myself out there, even if it doesn't turn out the way I hope, because otherwise I might feel that same regret for the rest of my life. I'm trying to build up the courage to casually ask them out to dinner next time I see them, but I also wanna make it clear that even if they don't really have those feelings anymore, I'm completely fine with us just remaining friends as well and continuing to do what we're already doing (I see this as an absolute win).

So, how do I do this without it being awkward? Do I throw in the friendship thing right alongside the asking them out? Do I wait for their answer first? When's the best time to even ask them in the first place and what can I say that won't make them feel pressured to respond in any specific way?",17May2019,1

He's given me unfair punishments for doing things that other people was doing. Ex: Got in trouble for saying cum or come while my friend repeatedly cusses less than two metres away from him, got my phone taken away for taking photos of my friend while my friend is allowed to take videos of presentations even with flash on, said something a little bit louder than usual while my other friends were literally screaming, etc. Just last week, he called me out for standing up. (just came back from the washroom since my French teacher doesn't allow you to use it unless it's an emergency) I told him I was then at he shouted me that, ""I'm making an even bigger problem by being there,"" (the problem was occuring at the door and I was walking back to my seat which was at the opposite side of the class) and he told me I wasn't. I followed up with, ""I was,"" and we just started yelling back and forth. I got tired of it so I just stopped and went back to my desk. He was still shouting at me with my friends backing me up. He then made me sit outside of the class for half of the day, and let everyone else have freetime while I had to do science. He also used to hit me from time to time while I'm doing work and always says, ""Like my magic?"" (he uses the metal end of a pencil, I know it may not sounds like much but it actually hurts)

40," I went to a 4 year college for 2 years I was doing poorly there but I still enjoyed it to an extent. I also wasn't in major I wanted to be in and I was miserable because of it. in the middle of my second year I figured the only way to fix this was to transfer. I found a college that looked interesting near my hometown, it offered the major I wanted plus the possibility to get an MBA without having to take the GMAT. it was pretty much the perfect opportunity. The program that I got accepted in is a work study program. I was so happy that I got accepted. Now that I am here I realized or at least feel like I made a huge mistake. All the students are at least 10 years older, I am not making any friends, the curriculum isn't that great, I live at home which isn't the greatest, and its nothing compared to the college town college I was previously at.  you get the point. I basically feel like I am missing out on a life opportunity that I had and I no longer have. (You don't know whats good until its gone). I have been thinking about going back to my previous college the only problem would be that I would be in school for an extra year and I would have to work a lot harder to get my GPA where I would like it to be. As of now I graduate in the summer of 2020 with a higher GPA and a feeling of missing out on my college experience.

&amp;#x200B;

pit-lab mix

 12 years old

 neutered

maybe 75 pounds as he has lost a lot of weight since the start of the decline

 cant do basic functions without being in intense pain such as poo/pee, walking, standing or laying down. 

He has a high pain tolerance, but he has been crying every time he goes to the bathroom, this coming from a dog that i never really heard a sound from other than farts for at least 6-8 years.

the vets in our area of northern California, USA are super expensive, like 110-400$ just for the euthanasia not including the disposal of the body afterwards. It is a smidge cheaper for the euthanasia if I am not with him, but this would be horrible for his last moments to be spent in fear and anger or even worse locked in a cold metal cage for hours while waiting for his time.

Im in 9th grade and i have high grades from my first year hs until now... but after a while during our 3rd quarter, i discovered really addicting games to the point i play them during class and even midnight. My grades stoop low to line of sevens, I absent a lot in my classes... my honors are gone and my parents kept scolding me when i touch my phone. I also avoided hanging out with my friends just so i could stay home and play.

I play games to avoid thoughts from my parents saying im dumb asf now. I’m not motivated to study as much anymore and i didn’t even get a single line of 9 on my recent cards. Now my parents are mad, im sad as hell and addicted to games... it’s more of my fault for letting games consume me

One of my brothers, J, is smarter and has an easier time making friends. My other brother, M, has a much harder time socializing, but is incredibly loving and just a fantastic kid. I love both of them to death and want to see them both succeed. 

I asked them both how their day at school was, and unsurprisingly both said ""boring."" When I kept asking M about his day, the topic of recess was brought up. I asked who he plays with, and he responded ""I just play on the monkey bars. I don't play with anyone else."" The way in which he said it indicated that this probably wasn't because he just wanted to play by himself. It honestly broke my heart hearing that. I haven't been able to stop thinking about it, and want him to feel happy and socially accepted. 

As a much older brother (19) I'm not sure how I can help him. He already has some confidence issues from his other brother, J. J tends to win every card game, Mario Kart race, read faster and understand more words, etc. Both me and my parents always try to make him feel loved and special in spite of that because he is truly a loving and kind kid.

48,"I’ve always wanted a dog and I finally got a corgi puppy almost a year ago behind my parents back. I had the money for him and knew I could afford anything extra he may have needed, so I felt like why not just do it. My parents were extremely upset at first, but within the first week they both fell in love with him. My parents now say he’s their grandson and make a big deal on how my corgi pup is now part of the family. I got lucky, because I figured they were going to make me get rid of him, especially since I knew corgis are herding dogs and are hard to keep still and also they shed like crazy all over the house. (Lots of cleaning needs to be done for this reason.) Me and my boyfriend have been dating for 3 and a half years and he graduated and found a good paying job. We have been talking about moving in together for a year now and his lease is up this summer. We figured why not move in now into an apartment once August comes around. I always wanted to move out ever since the age of 18 and now that I’m almost 24, I still had allowed my parents to keep me in here since I’m still in college. But I’d love to start being independent and learn how to do things on my own. I feel like I’ve let my parents do everything for me (I’m an only child), so I feel like this adult baby who’s just rotting in their parents home as time goes on. Plus I won’t have a curfew anymore and a time limit on how long I get to spend time with my 31 year old boyfriend since we’d be living together. The problem and huge guilt of moving out isn’t so much about how this will totally break my parent’s heart anymore, but the thought of leaving my sweet corgi behind. I brought him in and even though I know my parents would take care of him like a literal human baby, I feel like I had placed extra responsibility on them. I can’t take him with me because he barks constantly and needs a bigger space to run around to release all that energy. I’ve taken him to my boyfriend’s apartment to see how he behaved and with any little noise outside, he would bark nonstop, disturbing all the neighbors. I feel as though I’d postpone moving out because of how bad I’d feel leaving him. My parents aren’t happy for me to move out. They’d keep me here for as long as they could to be honest with you. I’ve mentioned how if anything, I’d try to find a nice home for him so they won’t feel the need to take care of him when I move out, but they didn’t like that idea. I guess I feel like a mother dumping their kid at the grandparents house and I’m just out living my life. I wouldn’t be moving far and I know I’d be able to visit whenever I can, but I can’t explain in further detail what this guilt feels like. I hope I explained it to where it makes sense.

49,"I struggle to get interested in TV shows. 

I've always had this problem, ever since I was a small child. I would watch stuff if someone else put a channel on or told me to watch it, but rarely would I ever willingly go out of my way to watch something.

This has obvious repercussions. I'm in high school, and I'm considered a freak for never watching an episode of the office or friends or black mirror or anything else popular these days. I don't watch popular anime.

I think my biggest problem is that I have a very vivid internal imagination. When I do watch something, I instinctively go, ""This isn't good. I would've done ________."" Or ,""This character should've done _________ instead of __________."" I have a difficult time following characters. I don't associate names to faces very easily, and in a large cast of characters I usually only know one or two. On top of all of this, I have a difficult time following plots and action scenes. This leaves me extremely unmotivated to even look for shows, but watching Tetris videos on YouTube can only get me so far when I'm painting a realistic portrait for 6 hours.

So far I have 34.5 hours logged, these particular 3 have about 8 each

I'm not going to lie, i want an incredibly petty way to get back at them

It's seems like it's their tool to dominate and control others. And it's never an equal exchange and it's just never ending. Dealing with these people is draining.

I work in an industry where we deal with the general public. I've had a handful of occasions where a repeat customer is just a never ending obnoxious ball breaker. It never felt harmless and innocent. And I never felt like I could respond in kind. The person always seemed to be a very weak and insecure person who was using this persona to project strength and keep people on the defensive. It seemed super passive aggressive.

These people always seem to get worse and worse or maybe they just aggravate me more and more with every subsequent interaction. Finally when I can't take it I look at them and say something like ""do you ever stop talking"" or ""how come all you do is try to push people buttons and make fun of others?"" I always confront them directly and bluntly. I don't yell or scream.

It's always the same response ""I'm just having fun lighten up."" Then it turns into a back and forth whether I'm being sensitive or they are being an asshole. I've always won that exchange. 

After that the customer usually doesn't return or if they do they will not hassle me or my staff anymore.

71,"Recently, I've hit the jackpot when it comes to internet friends. We met each other about three weeks ago on the text chat section of Omegle (big yikes there, I'm aware but hear me out). So basically we've both discovered that we're into the same genres of music, and we've both got similar backgrounds as well as similar stories when it comes to struggling with issues with mental health, and we make each other feel warm every single day. I don't know where else to throw this in, but she is homeschooled, and that's a fairly important detail. In fact, there are some people I've talked to via the internet much longer than three years, and this person has managed to make me feel better than the majority of those people in just three weeks. This isn't a cat-fishing problem because we both send genuine photos to each other on instagram dm's and we've video called on there once in which we talked for a minute or two, which gets us into the problem.

Her parents are SUPER Christian, and are really protective of her, and our entire friendship has been carried through in absolute secrecy from her parents. They are church regulars, she is in her youth group, she teaches young kids at her church, etc. Anyway, literally the only contact I have with her is an instagram account that her parents are unaware of her having. She is a sophomore in high school (though idk how homeschooling works too much), and her parents make her feel insecure and every bit of social life is carried through either her youth group at her church, or her part-time job at a grocery store.

Before we started talking, she told me that her parents found the account that she currently talks to me on, and she was grounded for 4 months (since December) before she could pick up the phone again. This was just the first time as well. Her parents still monitor her very closely, and her sister (who is 19) is also still monitored very closely and isn't even allowed to date. Basically it's an extreme form of helicopter parenting that is something she does not seem happy with and something that she's told me she wishes would change. She's even gone to the extents of saying (and even to the point where I don't even know if it's a joke) that she literally wants me to pick her up where she lives and take her to live with my family (yes, she wants me to basically kidnap her).

Now obviously, this is illegal, so I can't do any of this sorts but I still think some change should happen. I've told her to talk to her parents about it, but she's said that she did that back when she was caught talking to people online, and she was still grounded, so she wouldn't initiate conversation. There's nothing going on at her house that would constitute a call to child services, but she doesn't feel happy in her home, she is restricted from making and learning from her own mistakes, having a social life she wants, and she just feels really alone whenever she can't talk to me and I feel really bad, and I want change to happen for her so she is happy, while at the same time having her not get grounded for talking with a stranger on the internet again. Which is why I am asking for your advice to see what I can do to help this situation or what I can tell her to help her situation.

**TL;DR: You won't get the full story without reading it all, but basically my homeschooled internet friend has extreme Christian helicopter parents who won't let her have the social life she wants, are fairly controlling, and she feels really insecure and feels like it is ultimately hurting her and isolating her and I want to help the situation but because we're internet friends I can't really do much. Any mention of her having internet friends will get her grounded for months, which is something neither of us want. I just want to see what I can do and what I can tell her to do to try to help this situation.**",17May2019,1
72,"So I made a post on r/teenagers and though the response was positive, I still wanted input from you all. Basically a copy paste but here you go.

I'm 17, in high school. I'm a guy and pretty nerdy ig, like into Star Wars, comic books, etc. I love art and movies, super into psychology. I love to swim, and helping people a passion(check post history for specifics). 

The thing is, I don't know why I feel the way I do. I've got a few really fantastic friends, both irl and online. My parents are (usually) pretty nice, I get along with most my classmates and teachers. Yet, I always find myself so lonely, and idk why. And it feels wrong to complain about it, because I see so many of y'all talking about other issues that feel so much more real, like no friends and stuff, and who am I to bitch about being lonely. The friends I have are in school friends basically, because the minute school ends, we never meet up irl or do anything fun together. At most we have a discord chat, and as nice as it is, because like I said, really great dudes, but nothing could replace just hanging out and doing wacky stuff. Doesn't help that I basically have no control on my life rn. I can't drive by myself(started late), I'm in tough classes that I really couldn't care less about because college, and I feel so trapped. It's like my entire life is stuck between school and home and that's it. Nothing more than that. It used to be nice during swim season, but that ended too.

I feel like it's this lack of contact that made me value romantic relationships way more than I probably should, but just seeing people around me having someone who always shows affection and care and support, and I don't have that, it makes the loneliness thing worse. I mean if the only relationships( only 2) I've had are an online ones, that says something, because I'd most likely never meet those people. I mean, I see people around me driving, having sex, and moving on to bigger things in life and I am stuck here, alone, never even had a first kiss. This also leads to a ton of self esteem issues, like I find my self really unlovable at times, and wonder why tf anyone would waste their time with someone as pathetic as me, when she could go for someone way better(not like anyone confesses their love for me anyways but still). I actually call myself unlovable and undeserving of love because I figured that maybe it would stick one day and I can move on. \*\*UPDATE\*\*: Now I just gave up trying completely, like I don't have a crush, nor do I find any girls interesting in that regard, and the ones I find attractive I don't approach for reasons above or make excuses with myself that she's ""not my type"" and shit.

But like, I feel like I have no real goals or future. I'm going to college because people keep telling me that I need to go to get a good job and get money. I take hard classes and join internships because they will look good on college apps. And this also has led to me being an anxious mess a lot. It's a vicious cycle of not seeing any purpose or path in life, so that leads to no motivation, no motivation leads to bad grades, bad grades leads to anxiety, and anxiety leads to being more clueless in what to do with my life and so on. And even though I have like friends and stuff, I feel like I'm the one that reaches out to talk and stuff, like they only talk to me when they either think I'm depressed or if they want to know if an assignment is due the next day. The only time I feel nice and good, is when I am helping people online with their issues, because if I can't help myself at least I can help someone else.

Like, honestly sometimes I feel like I would be really content just dying, like if I somehow died, I'd be really okay with that. I'm pretty sure if it wasnt for my friends and family, I would have ended it all like a thousand times over by now.

I might be depressed, who knows. But rn, I have this stress on me with classes, and ACT, and internships and honestly, I just want to go. Sometimes it feels like even friends don't really care and the love from family is conditionally based on how I do in school. I can't help not feel sad.  


So my question is, what can I do to make myself not feel like shit all the time?  Thanks",17May2019,4
73,"Earlier today, I was going to take some goofy pictures on my boyfriend’s phone because he left it in the room with me. I took literally one, and I didn’t particularly like it, so I went to delete it and saw some other pictures. Specifically, a few screenshots from another girl’s facebook. One of her sitting on the counter, angles so you could see her ass. Another of a different girl’s bare boobs. I didn’t see anymore because he started walking towards the room. I know he’d never cheat on me, and they’re probably just porn stars or something of that nature – something he’d categorize as “beat material”. But its been bothering me all day and I’d like some advice as to how to bring that up. Please, and thank you in advance. :-)",17May2019,1

Yesterday someone told me that they were actually drugged and raped, and I’m not exactly sure what to do. They haven’t directly told me what happened to them, and I’m not sure if they ever will. I don’t want them to know that I know, because obviously they should only have to share this information with me when they’re ready. So I don’t want to seem like I know but I also want them to know that I’m there for them and love them dearly. I don’t want them to push me away, but I also don’t want to pry or overcrowd. Is there anything I should be doing? I’m not exactly sure how to handle this situation and need help.",17May2019,5

76,"I couldn’t figure out what to put this under so lmk if I should put it under something else. I’m also on mobile so formatting may be different. 

I’m 19 F and for as long as I can remember I’ve always struggled with getting myself to eat. Whenever I’m alone I just don’t have the drive to eat and I don’t feel hungry. I tend to only eat when I start to get dizzy, but even then it’s just a small amount to get the dizziness to go away. If I’m hanging out with family or my BF I do eat but as soon as I’m left alone I just don’t. 
It’s not that I don’t like food, I love food. I love cooking and baking. I’ve been told that I’m a fantastic cook and I’m always able to create something that makes others happy. I just don’t have the drive to do that for myself. 
I’ve tried setting reminders, meal planning, and hanging out with people more to help battle whatever this is. But as soon as I’m alone I always slip right back into this state of mind. I’ve considered seeking  professional help but I don’t even know who to go to for this.

77,"Without getting myself into a pickle...? Backstory, I used to work at a small dental office and the owner was pleased with my work ethic and we parted ways amicably, handwritten 2 weeks notice and all. 

I have been at my current job for almost 2 years working in logistics for a very sought-after cooler company. My department consists of 3 people and a supervisor. 1 of my associates (my lead) is on a leave of absence for medical reasons and my other associate is working with an injured hand (he can’t type and we work on computers all day) so I am captain of the boat. 

My job is overwhelming Monday’s, Tuesday’s and Wednesday’s and then Thursdays and Friday’s are manageable. I like the challenge but I want something more stable and less erratic. 

The doctor at this office called me and offered me a position in billing paying more than what I am currently being paid. Money doesn’t fix all problems, but the ratio of bs to what I’m getting paid isn’t matching up and I am feeling frazzled, but I’m on the fence about starting over at a new place of work.

78,"I just found an exercise I really, really enjoy at a studio near me, but I also found out that my former employer also attends the same exercise class at the studio.

This wouldn’t be a problem, except for the last year I’ve dreaded running into her somewhere. She was extremely manipulative, emotionally abusive, and significantly contributed to the deterioration of my mental health for 2 years. It is not a stretch to say she is the reason towards the end of my employment with her, there was a lot of suicidal thoughts I was dealing with.

I don’t want her to be the reason I drop this, as there is a lot of potential for me to grow as a person, but the nature of the class is that it’s rather up close and personal, and you spend a lot of time sparring. This is the only studio in my area that holds this class.

So what do I do? Do I remove myself from the situation? Do I continue to take classes there? How do I handle seeing her for the first time in ~ a year.",17May2019,1
79,"I play games regularly with my irl friends online and use discord etc. When they are online and invite me to stuff I just can't say no and will play games with them all day, and I like the time spent but often feel bad about it. I become content just playing the games though and forget about my other goals.

Whenever my friends are gone for a day and I've had to spent the day alone, I become 'disconnected' from the distraction of them and start to remember all the things I want to do and my goals, and I often then work on them. Problem is the next day they are back online and inviting me and I can't say no. 

I have ASD and often find myself going too 'all in' on 1 thing at a time instead of finding a balance between them. This causes me to lose progress on one thing whilst burning out on the other as I'll spend 18h day thinking/doing it for a few weeks straight.

80,"Ok so a little bit of back story....my thoughts are really unorganized right now because of how pissed off I am so please don’t come for me... this is my first post ever😅

I’m a 25 years old female and my friend is a 30-31ish male. I’ve known him since I was 15 years old. That’s a pretty long time in my opinion. He’s been there for me through a lot of hard shit. I obviously felt extremely grateful for his help at the time. Anyway he has this problem where he insults every guy I’ve ever dated. Like not just me though pretty much every girl friend he has isn’t supposed to talk to him because he’s pissed off their boyfriends that bad. He thinks college is stupid which is fine ... but I’m in school for nursing...it just seems like every life choice I make is the wrong one in his opinion. I just don’t feel supported by him in any area of my life.  He’s made rude comments about how women who are on welfare are basically all moochers I’ve WORKED at DHR and I’ve been on welfare before. He tries to tell me how the system works and who these women really are. I’m like ok but I was one of those women. Without their help I would have never went to school or found a place to live. We aren’t all blessed with good parents and nice upbringings. I just don’t know why he would rant to me about something that he knows hits close to home. Another thing that really sets me off about him is that he doesn’t respect my boundaries. I don’t like to be touched all the time... without going into detail I was abused by my dad and my son’s father...this has made me really consider who I want to be touched by and who I really don’t want to be touched by. I don’t want to be hugged and He KNOWS this. Idc if that sounds ridiculous I should be able to make a simple decision on who touches my body. He even told me last time before he hugged me “I know you don’t like to be hugged but come here.” And then leaned in and hugged me anyway. I just don’t understand why he would do that after I’ve told him on so may occasions that I don’t like it. I should also add he puts his hands right on the beginning of my ass every time he hugs me which is even more uncomfortable. Some times he will even pick me up and spin me🤮. I realized that I don’t like to be touched by him because when I was younger he offered to give me a back massage and he got a boner which was extremely uncomfortable....I get that boners happen sometimes but did you really have to dig it into my back???  You may be thinking ok but why haven’t you went off on him yet.... and I don’t really have an answer for that. I have severe anxiety and ptsd I don’t handle confrontation well. I thought maybe it would just get better over the years but it just never did. I mean this is the same person that bought me shoes for school because my parents were dope heads. Like it feels terrible to be mad at him after some of the nice things he’s done. I also feel like he is extremely disrespectful to my boyfriend because he will send me texts and be like “your tits look really nice in that picture on your boyfriend’s Facebook I know that’s why you bought that top.” He thinks that these comments are flattering I guess I don’t really know why he would think that’s appropriate. It seems like he just has no respect for women period. Every conversation we have is about who’s a hoe and how people should have picked him over other guys. I low key think he’s talking about me...its all really condescending. Everyone has always told me he was in love with me. For some reason that never registered to me when I was younger. He’s also mentioned that he thinks I’m not attracted to him because he’s “fat”. His words not mine. I don’t even find him unattractive physically. I’m not a superficial person which is also really insulting that he would think that’s the reason I don’t like him. Do I find him unattractive for other reasons? absolutely😂 I’m not denying that.  We live two completely different lifestyles. I’m just sitting here trying to take care of my son in peace. He requires so much attention and I just don’t have the energy to give it to him ....especially when every conversation we have makes me want to never talk to him again. I don’t know what to say to him because he doesn’t take criticism well at all. I really just want to break off our friendship. I guess what I’m asking is how do I tell him I’m done while respecting our past? I hope I don’t sound like a whiny brat. I’m just work so hard to make my life worth living. I don’t understand why some people try so hard to make me feel like shit.",17May2019,1

I say we should have then since we will be far away from our family, and planning to have a family of our own.

92,"Disclaimer:  Please do not upvote this.  I think she browses reddit and I really do not want her to see this, also I would like to keep this as low key as possible.

Buckle in.  This is a long story.

So, I am in my senior year of high school, graduating next week.  Most of high school has been eh, but this school year has been the best in my entire life.  This is because this year, I met an amazing person that made me excited to learn again, and also has been a great support to me.  This person is my teacher, a 20-something a few years into teaching.

In November, this teacher invited me to go to a club where they go out and eat and do some fun stuff after.  I obliged, and in doing so, I felt a real connection with this teacher; at that point it might have just been a stupid feeling, but after this meeting I tried looking for other clubs she hosted and stuff like that.  I joined like 2 other clubs, and eventually started hanging out after school every day, usually until about 5, on occasion, 7 or 8.  This is me, the teacher, and my friend, mind you.

I'm pretty much addicted to her at this point in time, I pretty much am waiting all day for her class and after school.  To indulge this addiction, I go on a strenuous battle with her help to drop one of my electives and pick up one of her classes in the morning.  After about a month of back and forth, I switch classes.

As for our relationship at this point, we were definitely good friends.  I wouldn't go insofar as close friends, though.

So, fast-forward about a month or two of staying after, getting to know each other better, becoming a little closer.  There is a competition that I signed up to do with this teacher and some other students that takes place over the weekend.  We go and have a lot of fun at this competition, then go back to school where me, my friend, and the teacher hang out in her classroom.  My friend airplays porn to the smart board without much resistance from me and she gets mad and kicks us out, making up a lie that she has something to do that day.

Immediately after, we sat in the cafeteria.  I felt really bad about it and decided that my friend and I would apologize on Monday.  No.  Screw that.  We were going to apologize now.  I dragged my friend back to her door to apologize and after insisting, she opens the door.

She sort of hid behind the door, but I could tell she was crying.  This broke my heart; she had just done a lot to organize the competition and this was how we repay her?  She told us that she felt like we didn't care about her and that she could've been fired for what was played on the board if somebody saw.  I apologized a million times, but I still felt bad, even though we left the school that day on good terms.

That night, I wrote a 4 or 5 paragraph email to her telling her that I was really sorry, and that she meant a lot to me, also that she was the reason I've enjoyed this year so much.  She responded with a lighthearted joke and a promise to discuss things on Monday.

On Monday, she sort of pulled me back into class as I was trying to walk out to tell me she really forgived me, that she wasn't just saying that.  I told her that what she said about us not caring really dug at me, and I reassured her that's absolutely not the case.  We then shared a hug and a smile.

After this, things started to pick up a little bit.  She recommended to play final fantasy 7; it took me along time because I'm not a big jrpg guy but I finished it and liked it a lot.  I wanted to play more and she lent me her PSP to play the final fantasies she had downloaded there.

I should have also mentioned that at the competition, she gave me and a lot of other students her number, as we were walking around on a big campus.  We started texting, kind of professional/serious at first, but the mood lightened quickly.  We started texting casually almost every day.

There were a couple of bumps in the road after that, nothing too big, it always ended in a hug and a smile.

So this leaves us at about 2-3 months ago.  One day, we are left alone after school, just her and I.  She starts talking about some issues she's been having with her family, pretty serious stuff.  I sympathize with her and converse with her until we realize it's 9 PM and it's time to go.  This happens a few more times.

Around this time, she tells me I'm her favorite student.  She also discloses to me that she's trying to get a job at the university I'm attending next year, to my delight.

A little later, she starts having lunch away from other teachers, too much drama apparently.  She kind of dances the idea of me coming to her lunch around, and I oblige.  At first, I went to my normal lunch for a couple minutes, then went to her room, but after a few days I just went to her room.  Since then we make food and eat lunch together every day.

This leaves us at around a month ago, we are very close friends, both of us know things about the other that we don't share with just anybody.  There is definitely a flirtatious air between us sometimes.

Around this time, she starts touching me playfully.  I was doing work in her room before school started, and she kind of just stood next to me and started touching her fists to my arm repeatedly, softly.  I asked her what she was doing and she said something to the tune of, ""punching you"".  I enjoyed it, so I let it be.

Then I turned 18, and touching turned into caressing.

She began running her fingers along my arm, my hands.  One time she told me my hand felt cold and enclosed it in her own before we were interrupted by a phone call.  Sometimes if I was sitting on a table, she would run her finger along the edge of my knee.  None of this makes me uncomfortable in a bad way, in fact, I get high off of it.

Once she began touching me like this, I reciprocated somewhat.  I'm kind of awkward with my hands, but I did the playful punch thing with her, leaned on her, and played with her hair.

We arrive at the present.

Yesterday she was having a rough day and I could tell.  She was scheduled to have a talk with her possible future employers and students were being extra rowdy because it's the last days of school for seniors.  She told me I'm the best part of my school for her, and that she's glad she didn't take another job the year previous because she would have never met me.

I told her that I was really happy to have met her too, and that she is the best part for me.

Today is my last true day of school, there are a couple extra ceremony and blow off days, but this is the last day I follow my class schedule.  I'm not too concerned or anxious though, I will still be seeing the people I care about after school is over, including this teacher.

In the morning we shared small talk and then a really meaningful hug.  The kind where the person you're hugging hugs you tighter after a couple seconds.  Pure bliss.

Right before lunch, she gets a date for her interview and we hug again in lunch because hell yeah things are going good.  After school there was a club scheduled, and then the members would go out to eat at a restaurant afterwards.

Well everyone but me and the teacher ended up leaving early, and we had silently agreed earlier to still go get food even though nobody else was going.

I sit on the table next to her, sitting on a chair, and she touches my arm.  I have this head massager thingy, it's nothing special, just like a metal rod with a bunch of little feelers coming off it, and I use it on her because I think it's funny how she cringes.  It tangles her hair up and I help her untangle it and fix it.  All the while we're having a pretty good conversation.

Eventually we leave in our cars to the restaurant and have a pretty normal dinner, I tell her",17May2019,1
93,"So I’ve been depressed , scared, sad for some time now because of several problems that are out of my hands. Some of them aren’t my problems but they affect me a lot and the potential consequences can hit me hard. And some are in a bigger scale ( culture, laws, religion) that i cant change no matter what. my only escape is the internet. Im in the internet from the moment i wake up till i sleep. I cant get out of my house nether can i meet my friends ( totally out of my hand ). School is over so im going stay at my house for 4 months.


I cant do anything productive, when i try my mind gets overwhelmed by the problems and its so emotionally draining to the point that i cant continue, i tried to work out the other day I couldn’t go over 5 minutes and i was in the edge of crying. I cant watch movies because they aren’t as attention grabbing enough to distract  me from thinking about the problems. I cant talk about the problems to anyone irl (because of personal reasons ) .i can start a productive activity but i cant complete it.

When I think about doing something productive my heart starts to beat quickly , I’m scared of leaving my distractions. Im pretty sure some people went through things that are harder then what I’m going through, but all of this is new to me. I’ve never felt like this before and I don’t know how to deal with it, i feel like I’m wasting my youth.

how do i stop my mind from thinking about these problems? How do I become productive and continue my productive activities without getting overwhelmed by my problems?

94,"I’ve been with my boyfriend for over 5 years now and have been living in his parents house for 2 years. When I moved in we all agreed that I wouldn’t have to pay any rent and they were completely fine with that, I just had to have a job. I knew my boyfriends dad (let’s call him Ted), I knew Ted had anxiety problems when I moved in but his problems weren’t that bad. I also knew they drank every night. His dad was an amazing person and still is but his anxiety got BAD last year. He was getting drunk every night not eating in the day so he’d get more drunk. He’d black out and yell at my boyfriends mom and one night he choked her. He really should’ve got help during that time because he was on suicide watch with his wife but he didn’t go to therapy or to a mental help hospital. He went to the doctor and got his pills regulated. Things were ok at first but during October he started to get worse. 

It started with Ted getting upset whenever my boyfriend and I would have our friends over which wasn’t new at all. For years we had a routine of our friends coming over every weekend or every other week. For some reason Ted didn’t like this anymore so when we’d tell him our friends were coming over and he’d sigh and then get really upset with us. The thing is there’s nothing to be getting upset about, when they come over we play board games, video games, talk and watch movies. We’re not loud at all, we don’t break anything, so we started cutting back on our friends coming over which lead to us not hanging out with them for months because we got busy and he’d get upset anytime we’d ask if they could come over. 

And then it came to the house, my boyfriend, his mom, and I are the only ones who clean the house. It’s been probably 4 months since he’s done any cleaning and when he sees 4 cans in our room he’d have a 30 minute talk with us about how we’re dirty and need to start taking responsibilities around here and clean more. Or if there were no forks because we loaded the dish washer and didn’t start it because he told us not to start it, Ted would go on another 30 minute tangent about how all of the dishes are downstairs when there were no dishes in our room. 

This lead to him complaining about the electricity bill and how were wasting money by keeping lights on in rooms were in, or if he went outside and left the porch light on, he’d come down the next day and yell at me to turn the damn light off and how irresponsible we are and how we don’t know anything about money and how wasteful I am with my money and I need to quit buying things I “want” (I buy things when I need them) and how I can’t quit my job and get a new one because he likes where I work. He also threatens to kick my boyfriend out because he didn’t want to continue going to college for the time being. He’ll pick unwanted fights with his wife and corner her and start telling her to shut the f up and how she doesn’t know anything and when she tries to calm him down he gets more upset with her. It’s been going on for way to long and we don’t say anything because we don’t know what to say, if we say anything that’s not in his head he gets upset. We never get to stand up for ourselves when he gets upset at us for something we didn’t do and it’s making us not want to be around him anymore, any conversation we have with him now he’s upset with us. I honestly feel like I’m back at home with my narcissistic parents. I’m starting to feel trapped, my boyfriends getting upset with him always having to try to stick up with us when his dad gets upset, and his mom just turns the music up louder and drowns him out. We have no idea what to do and if my boyfriend and I have a conversation with his mom without Ted about him he gets upset and also wants to know what we’re talking about. 

I’m at a loss, everyone is. How do we go about sticking up with ourselves and getting him the help he needs? We don’t know how to fix this issue.",17May2019,2

99,"TL;DR My parents had a fall out and I sided with my mom due to the situation, and ever since have cut my dad out of my life due to his choices and actions. I messed up and didn't take my things with me when I moved out due to not having room for the stuff, and now I'm trying to get things out. However the last interaction I had with him wasn't even from him...it was from his lawyer saying he wanted to take me to court for $15,000 over some pretty petty things. How would you suggest going about getting my things from his place?  


  
Okay, here's the story. I'll try to keep it as short as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

So about 7 years ago (when I was 19) my parents had a fall out. My mom found that my dad was cheating on her with his girlfriend from over 30 years ago...who (unknown to my mom or myself) he had a kid with. They were married for 30+ years and she never had a single clue. Turns out when he was in his early 20's he had a girlfriend who he got pregnant and when she informed him of this, he ditched her and never returned. She raised him with the help of three husbands over the course of time until he was able to live on his own. I think he's in his late 30's maybe early 40's...IDK

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, obviously that was a HUGE shocker to my mom and I...so it threw a big kink in the life I knew. With my mom being a mess from almost her entire life being a lie and her nearing 60, I knew I had to be there for her. Obviously I was also pretty pissed at my dad too, so I just left him and let him have some time alone in order to collect his thoughts and figure his sh\*t out while I was there for my mom helping her move and recoup. 

&amp;#x200B;

After about a month and a half not talking to or seeing my dad, I finally decided that I'd go and see him and sit down man to man for a talk...THIS is where things took a HUGE turn......

&amp;#x200B;

So I show up to his house unannounced because, well...I figured that was something I should still be able to do. So I unlock the door and walk in, greeted by the dog and cat at the door happy as can be to see me. While I'm at the door I see some shoes I didn't recognize...women's shoes... So I walk upstairs because with his night shift schedule I figured he'd be asleep, but he wasn't. Turns out he had his new (but old) girlfriend there...and they were f\*cking.....IN MY BED!

&amp;#x200B;

I obviously flipped the F\*CK out...rightfully so too (at least IMHO) considering it had only been about 6 weeks since my mom moved out, the divorce process hadn't even begun, AND IT'S IN MY BED! Harsh words were exchanged (mostly from me) and I left. Now one thing that still bugs me to this day is the fact that I never told my mom what happened...I knew that would just crush her and I couldn't stand to see my mom like that.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a couple weeks...

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to go to my dads again to try and reconcile with him regarding what happened, and when I arrive I get greeted with yet...ANOTHER great surprise. A U-Haul truck parked in the driveway with my dad and his woman unloading things from it into the house. As messed up as it was to see and with how furious I was, I remained calm and handled it as grown up as possible. After a few hours of talking my dad and I decided we would plan a day to go out and sit down to eat and talk, just the two of us. Well that day came around and when I went to go meet up with him, I was greeted by him and his woman...obviously NOT what we planned. I told him what a load of sh\*t that was, got back in my car and left.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that situation I just described...him promising that we would talk, just the two of us went on about a dozen times...each time resulting in him bringing his woman along. Eventually I caved and sat down to hear them out. However each time it always turned into her and him trying to act like nothing was wrong, them talking about their future, and her specifically calling me her ""son""...Just typing that gives me an uncomfortable feeling still...

&amp;#x200B;

After the last time we went out things got hostile due to me being tired of him not facing the issues (and I specifically related it being like him abandoning her when she was pregnant with his kid), and I told him I was done talking to him or trying to re-build the relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward about a year, I call him and tell him I got my own place and want to grab some of my things. I go there (he's looking REALLY rough, mentally drained, physically distraught, etc.) and get some stuff, get ready to leave, and he walks up to the car as I'm backing out of the driveway. He starts spilling his guts...tearing up...the whole nine yards. To sum it up as best as I can, he basically said his new woman was driving him crazy and turning him into a totally different person. He needed to move her out of his life, get things straight between him and I, and apologize to my mom. He also said he wanted to sit down with me (like many failed previous attempts) and have a talk. Just him and I...he promised. Told me to pick a day that worked and let him know.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did just that. I told him what date, day of the week, time, place, etc. We're talking specific as hell...for example.  
Monday 7/6, July 6th, at 7:30PM at ""Example Chain Restaurant"" on ""Insert Specific Address"", and he confirmed that date and time would work for him and that he'd see me then. Well lo and behold I showed up (15 minutes early as I normally do for occasions) and proceeded to sit at a table for almost 2 hours waiting for him. 25 calls and 10 texts later, still no answer...still no show. I leave.

&amp;#x200B;

TWO WEEKS LATER!!! This guy has the audacity to text me and say ""Sorry I missed our date to sit and talk, I was sleeping.""

I decided I'd do something slightly hasty and unreasonable, but at the time I was fuming. I drove to his house 100% unannounced and give him a piece of my mind. I get there...and what's there? Another U-Haul truck with them moving more of her sh\*t in... All I did was get out, stand and stare at them shaking my head and say to him ""You're f\*cked, this whole thing is f\*cked especially whatever the hell is going on inside your head. Good luck and have a nice life because I'm done trying with you.""

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a couple years...Parents divorce is in process, my dads dragging his feet in the entire thing (missing court dates, claiming ""bankruptcy"", saying he's being treated unfair, failing to provide documents, etc.) Out of the blue I receive a letter from his lawyer...

&amp;#x200B;

This guy has the audacity to try taking me to court over a vehicle HE BOUGHT as a project car for us (when I was 16), saying that I owe him money for the cars cost plus all the parts bought. He has the audacity to say I owe him $1,000 for a towing fee to get a truck out of his driveway that I bought, and he totaled (hence why it was in the driveway). He has the audacity to say that because I failed to pay on the car (that he co-signed for) for a few months (I got laid off and couldn't find a new job) that I owe him that money too. All in all, he was trying to get me to pay about $15,000...coincidentally enough, the approximate cost of his lawyer for the divorce... Well ironically enough, the project cars title was in his name, the trucks titled I signed over to him since he totaled it (I told him it was his responsibility now), and the car that I missed payments on was in his name too. So I wrote a letter back to the lawyer informing her of all that as well as sending her the title of the co-owned car, and informing her ""If you check the titles they're all in his name as well as all in his possession with this one. Good luck taking me to court with this.""

&amp;#x200B;

I called him a few dozen times over the course of a few weeks to have him come get the car (that I was paying on again, as well as sent him money to pay him back) but he never answered or returned my calls. Eventually my moms landlord threatened to have the car towed in a month (since at this point it wasn't really mine to drive). Those weeks were FILLED with calls (that went to voicemail) and emails to him AND his lawyer. No answers... The landlord had that car towed to the nearest lot, I called and e-mailed his lawyer and him informing them of such things, but they never answered. Long story short it racked up about $1,000 in lot fees over a few weeks and numerous calls and emails informing the lawyer and him about it, but I guess the lawyer failed to inform him of such things and he didn't care enough to answer or return the calls. I always called the lot to see if it got picked up, and obviously once it did I called and got his lawyers and his voicemail (again) and left them a message. I can't remember exactly what I said but it was along the lines of ""Had he/you just talked to me this could have been easier. Dozens of calls and emails to you without answers it seems as though neither of you are taking this seriously. However now the balls in your guys court and we can go from here.""

I never heard anything more after that.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to now...I still haven't heard anything from him, his lawyer, his (now) wife...

I want to go get my valuables but I have no clue on how to go about do it...

&amp;#x200B;

Do I be THAT petty of a guy and have the cops go with me? That seems like a shit show because it's HIS house after all. 

Do I just nut up and call/text him and be straight to the point with ""Hey, I want to come get my things"".?

Do I just show up and be civil and say ""I'm taking my things.""?

100,"[Sorry I posted this in r/offmychest, but I really feel stuck) I'm 22 and I feel like I buried myself in my own laziness and depression that I've hurt everyone around me in the past 4 years as I went to college.

When I was growing up, I was raised to be an all-star student. Pretty much studying was all I did - I did not play instruments, play sports, had a job, or drove. Eventually I got to leave my homestate of Arizona to go to Vanderbilt University. It really wasn't my dream school; the biggest reason why I went was because they gave me the most financial aid. At first going in, I studied hard, got pretty good grades, and was on the premed track I thought I wanted to be on. Then my dad was diagnosed with cancer, and my grades began to slip.

Sophomore year I dropped premed track when I didn't go to a Bio test worth 30% of my grade. Junior year (second sem) I was put on academic probation cause I didn't go to some of my classes. I had the major issue that I was afraid to go to my classes after I missed a class, especially in smaller settings. I was also lazy, and kept telling myself I'd just show up the next class, but that quickly turned to the next week, and then the next month. But I made the same mistakes that second semester, really going to only 2 classes by the end of the year. I just sank in my room, not going out, not talking to anybody; I was just either sleeping or playing video games. I was told by the school they'd have me apply for next year with other students, but I knew my GPA wouldn't be competitive, so I applied for a semester long medical leave and keep my standing.

During the semester break I was glad that I could spend time with my family. I worked a min wage job at a bowling place to earn money to pay for school. For the first time in years, I was proud of myself since I was putting in work for something. But whenever someone asked me about college I could only barely lie through my teeth that it was going fine or cringe at my failure. It was two days before Thanksgiving that my father passed away. I remember his vacant stare towards the ceiling as liquid filled his lungs. I remembered how he looked at me the night before and told me he loved me.

And yet, I'm still a failure. I went back to school and still found myself in my room or just waiting vacantly for friends to show up so I could eagerly talk to them. I didn't show up to classes, take my meds, or go to psychologist for 1-2 months and failed all my classes. I watched all my friends graduate as I think how I'm either A) Going to be kicked out of the school or B) Be allowed to finish with one semester uncovered by financial aid, which results in me being thousands of dollars more in debt with only a degree in Psych/Medicine, Health and Society.

There are two things in life keeping me from killing myself - the fear of eternal hellfire and the consequences of leaving my family behind. I'd feel like a selfish coward. When my dad died, he was still going to work. When he was my age, he provided for my mother and I by working two jobs. And here I am blowing my opportunities and family's money so I can just mope around in my room and take a 4 month long break away from them. I feel like a burden and failure and don't know what to do with my life now. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't have a wife or kids - but I still feel stuck.",17May2019,1
101,"What does it mean if a girl calls you bruh?

102,"Background: I broke up with my girlfriend last summer and we decided to remain friends...In the fall, her new boyfriend got jealous (despite the fact that I know I'm not a threat...I broke up with her for a reason...) and to make him happy she decides we shouldn't hang out anymore.  I'm pretty sure I'm on the spectrum and it's enormously difficult for me to make friends so this was a huge loss for me.  I never connected so well with someone before.  She also was heavily involved in the local community so I felt that she was also my best connection for making more friends.  

I never told her any of this.  Never said what her friendship meant to me...I just said ""no hard feelings"" and that was that.  This all happened over text messages so I really don't have much sense of closure.

I feel like talking through these things with her would at worst give me a better sense of closure, and at best give us a shot a reconciling in some way.  But it's been 8 months and I have no idea what her current situation is or how to start...or if I should.  And if I do get the chance to talk to her, how do I express myself honestly without making her uncomfortable?  The last thing I want to do is manipulate her in some way...I just wanted to know for sure whether this is something that we could work through, or heck, if she's even still seeing the same guy.  I feel like if I wait any longer I'll just be a distant memory to her.

On the other hand, knowing her, I don't think she would have told me that the friendship would not work unless she was sure, so maybe I should just find a way to move on without having this conversation.  I just don't know.

Side question...she works at a local food co-op which I'd really like to shop at, but I've been avoiding it because I don't want to run into her given the current state of things between us.  How should I handle that?",17May2019,0

Something along those lines. Now it was fine until she said she didn't deserve it. That really kinda hit me when she said that. I want to talk to her about it but don't know how to.

Buckle in.  This is a long story.

So, I am in my senior year of high school, graduating next week.  Most of high school has been eh, but this school year has been the best in my entire life.  This is because this year, I met an amazing person that made me excited to learn again, and also has been a great support to me.  This person is my teacher, a 20-something a few years into teaching.

In November, this teacher invited me to go to a club where they go out and eat and do some fun stuff after.  I obliged, and in doing so, I felt a real connection with this teacher; at that point it might have just been a stupid feeling, but after this meeting I tried looking for other clubs she hosted and stuff like that.  I joined like 2 other clubs, and eventually started hanging out after school every day, usually until about 5, on occasion, 7 or 8.  This is me, the teacher, and my friend, mind you.

I'm pretty much addicted to her at this point in time, I pretty much am waiting all day for her class and after school.  To indulge this addiction, I go on a strenuous battle with her help to drop one of my electives and pick up one of her classes in the morning.  After about a month of back and forth, I switch classes.

As for our relationship at this point, we were definitely good friends.  I wouldn't go insofar as close friends, though.

So, fast-forward about a month or two of staying after, getting to know each other better, becoming a little closer.  There is a competition that I signed up to do with this teacher and some other students that takes place over the weekend.  We go and have a lot of fun at this competition, then go back to school where me, my friend, and the teacher hang out in her classroom.  My friend airplays porn to the smart board without much resistance from me and she gets mad and kicks us out, making up a lie that she has something to do that day.

Immediately after, we sat in the cafeteria.  I felt really bad about it and decided that my friend and I would apologize on Monday.  No.  Screw that.  We were going to apologize now.  I dragged my friend back to her door to apologize and after insisting, she opens the door.

She sort of hid behind the door, but I could tell she was crying.  This broke my heart; she had just done a lot to organize the competition and this was how we repay her?  She told us that she felt like we didn't care about her and that she could've been fired for what was played on the board if somebody saw.  I apologized a million times, but I still felt bad, even though we left the school that day on good terms.

That night, I wrote a 4 or 5 paragraph email to her telling her that I was really sorry, and that she meant a lot to me, also that she was the reason I've enjoyed this year so much.  She responded with a lighthearted joke and a promise to discuss things on Monday.

On Monday, she sort of pulled me back into class as I was trying to walk out to tell me she really forgived me, that she wasn't just saying that.  I told her that what she said about us not caring really dug at me, and I reassured her that's absolutely not the case.  We then shared a hug and a smile.

After this, things started to pick up a little bit.  She recommended to play final fantasy 7; it took me along time because I'm not a big jrpg guy but I finished it and liked it a lot.  I wanted to play more and she lent me her PSP to play the final fantasies she had downloaded there.

I should have also mentioned that at the competition, she gave me and a lot of other students her number, as we were walking around on a big campus.  We started texting, kind of professional/serious at first, but the mood lightened quickly.  We started texting casually almost every day.

There were a couple of bumps in the road after that, nothing too big, it always ended in a hug and a smile.

So this leaves us at about 2-3 months ago.  One day, we are left alone after school, just her and I.  She starts talking about some issues she's been having with her family, pretty serious stuff.  I sympathize with her and converse with her until we realize it's 9 PM and it's time to go.  This happens a few more times.

Around this time, she tells me I'm her favorite student.  She also discloses to me that she's trying to get a job at the university I'm attending next year, to my delight.

A little later, she starts having lunch away from other teachers, too much drama apparently.  She kind of dances the idea of me coming to her lunch around, and I oblige.  At first, I went to my normal lunch for a couple minutes, then went to her room, but after a few days I just went to her room.  Since then we make food and eat lunch together every day.

This leaves us at around a month ago, we are very close friends, both of us know things about the other that we don't share with just anybody.  There is definitely a flirtatious air between us sometimes.

Around this time, she starts touching me playfully.  I was doing work in her room before school started, and she kind of just stood next to me and started touching her fists to my arm repeatedly, softly.  I asked her what she was doing and she said something to the tune of, ""punching you"".  I enjoyed it, so I let it be.

Then I turned 18, and touching turned into caressing.

She began running her fingers along my arm, my hands.  One time she told me my hand felt cold and enclosed it in her own before we were interrupted by a phone call.  Sometimes if I was sitting on a table, she would run her finger along the edge of my knee.  None of this makes me uncomfortable in a bad way, in fact, I get high off of it.

Once she began touching me like this, I reciprocated somewhat.  I'm kind of awkward with my hands, but I did the playful punch thing with her, leaned on her, and played with her hair.

We arrive at the present.

Yesterday she was having a rough day and I could tell.  She was scheduled to have a talk with her possible future employers and students were being extra rowdy because it's the last days of school for seniors.  She told me I'm the best part of my school for her, and that she's glad she didn't take another job the year previous because she would have never met me.

I told her that I was really happy to have met her too, and that she is the best part for me.

Today is my last true day of school, there are a couple extra ceremony and blow off days, but this is the last day I follow my class schedule.  I'm not too concerned or anxious though, I will still be seeing the people I care about after school is over, including this teacher.

In the morning we shared small talk and then a really meaningful hug.  The kind where the person you're hugging hugs you tighter after a couple seconds.  Pure bliss.

Right before lunch, she gets a date for her interview and we hug again in lunch because hell yeah things are going good.  After school there was a club scheduled, and then the members would go out to eat at a restaurant afterwards.

Well everyone but me and the teacher ended up leaving early, and we had silently agreed earlier to still go get food even though nobody else was going.

I sit on the table next to her, sitting on a chair, and she touches my arm.  I have this head massager thingy, it's nothing special, just like a metal rod with a bunch of little feelers coming off it, and I use it on her because I think it's funny how she cringes.  It tangles her hair up and I help her untangle it and fix it.  All the while we're having a pretty good conversation.

Eventually we leave in our cars to the restaurant and have a pretty normal dinner, I tell her about a dream earlier in the week where she insulted me pretty bad, nbd.  This isn't the first time we've eaten dinner out together so it wasn't that weird.

After dinner, we walk outside and she asks me a kind of odd question.  ""Do you mind if I talk to you in your car for a second?"".  It kind of took me by surprise, but I said, ""of course, no problem"".  She was acknowledging the awkwardness and saying like, ""sorry for being weird, are you sure?"".  Which is a normal statement for her, not suggestive at all, and I reassured her that it was no problem.

She sat in the passenger's seat and told me, ""I hope you know the dream didn't mean anything, and I wanted to say that I'm really glad that I met you"".  I told her that I'm really glad that I met her too, and we hugged.  She started holding my hand, hers under mine, and we just kind of stared at each other. We've done this before, just not like this.  It felt like a minute we were just looking at each other and I broke the stare by looking away and blushing.  It really felt like in this moment by the way she was sitting kind of over the center console, holding my hand, looking into my eyes like she wanted me to kiss her.  I saw her part her hair back while I looked away from my peripheral vision.  I hugged her again and said while hugging her, ""Sorry if this is too much or anything..."", I stopped for about 5 or 6 seconds, ""but I love you"".  She told me that she loved me too and when we sat back again she was still holding my hand.  I repeated, ""I love you"" and she responded just like she did the last time.  We looked at each other again and I don't remember how exactly but we said goodbye and she left to her own car.

This was probably about 2 hours ago.  My heart is still pounding and I'm still getting a rush thinking about it.  I wonder if I should have just leaned in, we're both consenting adults.  But I'm still not graduated.  I think if I was graduated I would have gone for it.

A note: We commonly look at each other when in relative privacy and touching is either nonexistent or very light within the presence of others.

I just don't know what to think really, I want to hear other people's thoughts.  I just keep asking myself why she couldn't have just told me what she wanted to tell me outside of the car like other times, and if she wasn't expecting anything, why wait so long after saying what you have to say.  I've kept all of this bottled up for so long that I can not hold it in any longer.  I'm sorry I'm not a very good writer, or an efficient one, I just need a little guidance here.

What do you think she is feeling?

What should I do/not do about it?

108,"I work at a place where we sell pavement tiles for driveways, walkways and such. My job is to prepare orders for clients by gathering all they paid for on a pallet / directly in their car. It’s my second summer there and I just changed bosses because the other one quit. It’s also my first job, so all the experience I ever had was with him, and he was, kind, caring and didn’t expect too much out of my coworkers. Now the new boss expects much more out of everyone and you better always have something to do. As all the working experience I’ve ever had before is with a boss that was very smooth, it’s kind of a shock and I need to adapt. I am fully willing to change according to expectations and even beyond, I just need help to do it. The new boss confronted me about the fact that I work rather slow and sometimes I walk around and do “nothing”. Now, I know some of that is just a misunderstanding. Anyway, he said we would talk about it this Saturday. I really want this job as I enjoy it and the people are nice there, but I need advice on good things to know prove myself worthy of this job and generally good things to know when dealing with bosses like that.

Thanks for taking the time to read through everything, I am just worried I won’t meet expectations.",17May2019,2
110,"I'm a finance major at a large state school that is pretty average (or below) by most measures, except that the business school is amazing and well-respected. I'm not from this state, so the business school is the only thing keeping me here. I just completed my sophomore year, and everything is going pretty okay. I have a good but unremarkable GPA. I'm in a selective career-track program which sends people to Wall Street, and I'm lucky to be where I am, all things considered. My planned career track will involve the sacrifice of a couple years of my personal life, although I believe I can deal with that. I’ll make good money and build a standout resume to boot.

&amp;#x200B;

In recent months, I've been doubting my major and my planned career. That doubt turned into a nagging voice into an obsession. Finals ended, I came home for the summer, saw what my friends were up to, and sank into a crisis. Most people I know from home are in engineering or computer science. They go to big research-powerhouse public schools. The all know why they’re in their respective majors and they know what they can do with it. I don’t. Seeing them makes me seriously consider switching my major to engineering and transferring schools, despite the hardships that may create. I'm posting this so someone can help give me impartial advice.

&amp;#x200B;

As a high schooler, I was sure I wanted to go into finance and completely blew off STEM, more out of insolence than anything. I had a pretty terrible attitude in HS, which translated into bad grades, which in turn limited my choice of college and my choice of major at each. Over the last week -- as I realized what I did to myself -- I've been paralyzed by my own regret, frustration, indecision, and FOMO.

&amp;#x200B;

Finance is a good, safe major. It’s hard to do badly in. But business is not a particularly challenging subject and in all honesty I feel like my ability to think  critically is diminishing because of it. My brain feels like it’s atrophying. Most worryingly, finance is pretty uninspired. The more I learn about potential careers, the clearer it is that the financial sector is unexciting at best and morally dubious at worst. You don't innovate, or research, or invent. There's no clear goal to any job the same way there would be in computer science or engineering, where your work contributes to humanity's knowledge, capability, or well-being. That stuff is bleeding edge, and it looks awesome. A finance major has plenty of merits, and frankly I like it, but it doesn't lead down a particularly alluring road.

&amp;#x200B;

Engineering majors famously get worked hard, but they learn a hell of a lot. More importantly, they learn serious, usable, marketable skills and learn to think/problem solve effectively. I don't know what engineering is truly like from the inside, but I have a hunch that it's a) a good fit for me, b) mentally challenging, and c) personally fulfilling. Also: if an engineer wanted to work at Goldman Sachs or McKinsey, he could, but a business major could never work at NASA or Boeing.

&amp;#x200B;

Were I to go into engineering, I would do either mechanical or electrical + computer science. The phrase running through my head for days has been this: ""I want to create"". Finding a solution may be as complicated as I've made it, or it may be as simple as remembering that phrase. I don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some of my main concerns:

1. Maybe this is wishful thinking that can't be trusted in my state of mind. Maybe engineering sucks, but I glorify it in my head. What if I transfer and hate engineering once I have to learn it?
2. If I switch to engineering, I would have to transfer schools because my current school doesn't have an engineering program. I'd leave my friends behind, which I can stomach. I've moved around a lot in my life, so I can handle it.
3. I would have to start from square one as a freshman. I have few applicable credits, only some AP scores from HS and perhaps statistics. I'd graduate just after turning 24 assuming I finish in 4 years. My current friends will be two years into their adult lives, and I'll be far behind.",17May2019,3
111,"P.S, im sorry for this being so long, I just wanted to write down as much as I know.

So basic information is that she’s seventeen and lives in Florida. She lives with her biological mother and father but her father is constantly “abusive” to the both of them. 

He has never physically laid a hand on either of them however constantly screams to an absurd level about the slightest thing or when he plays video games to the point that either of them or guests become jumpy and fidgety. Its become so awful that the second he starts, her dogs flinch if you touch them after or during his episodes and he throws and breaks things when he’s upset which seems to be everyday and occasionally causes my friend to break down in physical panic attacks where he claims that she is faking for attention and being a “brat”.

He has complete and utter control of money around their household, despite her mother working for him and not “being allowed” to get a job independently. He manages what money his wife is allowed to receive as well as his daughter with *both* of them needing permission from him to do the most basic things.

He constantly “jokes” about killing/hurting cats, kittens and in gruesomely specific ways and laughs it off as a joke. He has physically beaten (using a balled fist and leg) one of their dogs for peeing on the floor and he has kicked the family’s cats intentionally and harshly for being “in his way”

My friend has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety within the last few years to which he refuses to acknowledge either of those things. Her mother has written personal notes about suicide because she’s “afraid to live with him” that my friend has found over the years but never asked about. 

Finally despite her and her mother constantly talking about leaving, her mother acknowledges that she has no money, they have no family to help them and she’s “afraid of what he might do if they try to leave”

Shes called social services once where they physically came to the house in which he claimed that everything was a lie and that she was just trying to embarrass him. His wife actually tried to refute that statement but he quickly shot it down and told them there was nothing to worry about, in which they quickly claimed everything checks out and never came back where he proceeded to throw an adult tantrum after they left for the next several hours. 

Finally the cherry on the cake being that he is quite... off-putting towards daughter. He semi-frequently comments on her larger breast size, has made casual comments about “not feeling a bra strap” when they’ve hugged, called her pretty in a bikini swimsuit and pats her butt when she walks into the kitchen (to which he will scream about if she tells him to stop or tells him that she’s uncomfortable claiming that she’s “his daughter” and “he can do whatever he wants to her body”)

So over all I just needed some advice, would you consider this type of behavior abusive and if so what can my friend do to get her and her mom out without worrying about financial problems or him coming after them? Thank you very much!",17May2019,1

I basically quit everything i fucking start.

115,"So my prom was a couple of weeks ago. A couple of weeks prior to the event, we had to fill out a form that would determine what type of food we would get there. Now I’m not a vegetarian, but I do prefer vegetable dishes to meat dishes, so I went with the vegetable option. I also have a sesame allergy, so I requested for no sesame to be in the dish.

Come the night of the event, and we’re all sitting at our tables waiting for our food. The server comes to our table, and starts handing out dishes. I noticed that he only had one vegetable plate. I didn’t know what any of the people at my table ordered(considering half of them were strangers, I didn’t even know their names) so I assumed it was for me. The server asks who got the vegetable dish, and before I can speak, this girl says that she did. He hands it to her, and places a plate of salmon near me without giving me a chance to speak up(I’m kinda shy, so all I could say was a simple “um”) and leaves.

In other words, the place got my order wrong. Again, I’m not a vegetarian, but they didn’t know that. They could have very easily handed a vegetarian the same dish like that. Also, salmon is sometimes seasoned with sesame seeds, or cooked in sesame oil. This one wasn’t, but I didn’t know that at the time. If it did, I would have been screwed.

117,"I have 2 younger sisters (call them Lu and Jane) that both struggle with alcohol and drug addiction, while I am bipolar and have an anxiety disorder.

In my childhood and adult life, I was always the one taking care, protecting and rescuing my sisters (and mother) from our abusive father. I took the majority of the verbal, physical and sexual abuse. As a teen, I suffered from depression, anxiety and tried to kill myself several times resulting in forced institutionalization by my school leading to an ultimate diagnosis and treatment. Everyone always thought I was going to be the one to struggle as an adult and not do much with life (aunts and uncles have said thet never expected me to amount to anything because of what I faced). I have since stabilized, graduated college and university at the top of my class, got married and have a very good job. I consider myself lucky. My sisters however have both struggled. Lu has been clean for 2 years, gone on to attend school and found a job. She actively attends AA. She and I had not spoken for a couple years when she was in her spiral, but have since began working to rebuild and she continues to work on herself. 

Jane and I have always been close, she and I agonized over Lu's issues through Jane's teen years, would sneak out to try to find Lu at 3 in the morning hoping she was alive. Jane slept with me for 3 months when I returned home from hospital. When I went off to college, we talked everyday and I came home just to see her every weekend. Lu and I never had that kind of relationship, I was the one that got her best friend (our father) taken away because of what I finally told was happening. She hated me for a very long time. I tried to help her and faced my father to get her away from him, but she was already too far gone. I thank God everyday that she found a better path and we are now working to build a relationship. To my mothers credit, she has done as best she can and worked hard to provide for is on her own with little to no outside support. She relied on me a lot and I have come to realize that that reliance has turned to a feeling of like I always have to step in and help or I am a bad person.

 However in the last 2-3 years Jane has been on a downward spiral and I have tried to help her. I have paid her rent, car payments, had groceries delivered or would send her uber eats. I got her a job at a friends company, paid out a lease she had to break. My husband has driven 2 hours at 3 in the morning after she called in hysterics that her on/off boyfriend was beating her (which proved a lie). I've dealt with our mother when Jane abused her or tries to get more money from her. I finally realized Jane is an alcoholic and in the last couple months started doing cocaine and more. I have been starting to struggle with it and my anxieties have been coming back dealing with her if I had to say no or couldn't get her what she wanted. I started ignoring her calls or texts, but then she would call my husband and accuse him of keeping me hostage. I wake up screaming for her with dreams of finding her dead and my husband has had to sedate me a few times in the midst of an anxiety attack or manic episode (both of which usually come after interaction with Jane and sometimes mother).

Today, Jane asked to borrow our truck to move again (4th place since about september) and I agreed as she has no choice but to move and would be moving home to our mothers (something I have been trying to convince her of for months, along with therapy and an addiction program I found), but then she showed up at my work, the story about why had changed, where she was moving, that she had that morning gotten beat up and started ranting about Lu and my relationship, blaming me for everything between them and I couldn't deal with it. She started going off about our father and how I lied about everything he did to me (I figured out that she must have been speaking to him recently as this same thing happened when Lu got in touch with him). I asked her to leave, told her I loved her and walked back into my office. She left. I don't know if she was on something or coming off, I know she wasn't drunk because I can tell when she is. My mother texted me when my sister got to her home and said I should have just did what I had promised to my sister as I have caused enough problems for her now. I didn't reply.

I just could not do it today. I knew it was selfish to protect my own sanity and stability when she is clearly struggling, but I came to a point that I cannot keep enabling, rescuing and being everyone's punching bag. So I had to walk away. I truly feel like I may have ruined any hope of rebuilding my relationship with Jane and fear that this could be the last time I see her alive. But I could not keep putting myself in the line of fire anymore. I was starting to crack and feel like my own world was going to crumble. I have been stable for so long now and could not risk everything I have built for myself to crash around me. I could not risk my husbands happiness and safety anymore. I could not risk our financial freedom and future. I could not put myself through anymore of this without losing myself. I needed to walk away and I hope I don't regret this.",17May2019,1

With my mom being a control freak and being very adamite about us doing chores and cleaning up after our selves and others, we all are quite neat and responsible. As my brothers and I got older not needing as much nagging and we began getting busier with life (school, and work), my mom stopped being as tough. My little sister ( currently 13) wasn't given the same treatment she never had as much responsibility and was not getting as harsh punishments as my brothers and myself, she's not turning out so great. She has no manners, never cleans up after herself, doesn't do the two choirs she is given properly (deliberately, she defiantly knows how to do them) and is super cunty.

She doesn't carry her weight at all and it's all fallen on me, and whenever I ask her for help she does nothing (including those two choirs that she doesn't even do right) because she knows I can't make her do anything, nor punish her.

Ever since I moved away, she has taken to cussing me out and belittling me 24/7(which was pretty embarrassing on our farewell party)and it is not even fun banter anymore. I have tried to talk to her about it through texts, calls and even face to face but she just gives me really vague answers and tells me to forget about it.

My parents and brother are both moving back to FM, which is 12-13 hours driving from MH. This all came up very suddenly, my parents sold the house within 3 days of first listing it. Their reason for doing so is that my dad has been travelling for work for all these years and they don’t want to do it anymore. My brother is going just because he wants too, which is fine.

The party was yesterday. She didn’t loss weight so the dress didn’t fit her. I told her to put another dress but she didn’t want. She said it was fine. But once we arrived everyone was looking at her and making comments about her dress.

Telling me about who she’s with now, showing me pictures of her, stories, etc. Every time I tell him as nicely as I can that I don’t care and don’t want to hear about her, but he still continues to do it anyway. I know that’s his sister and all and it was my mistake of getting with her in the first place, but this almost feels deliberate to me at this point. I want to move on, I want to be happy but  absolutely cannot when he does this. (I’m around my friends a lot by the way). So what do I do? Would it be wrong to cut him off after all these years of friendship? Not to mention all my other friends are still gonna be around him, so it’d make hanging out them hard. I’m at a loss here and would very much appreciate some help.",17May2019,1
134,"Hey guys, 
I am a 22 year old Male and I just graduated from the university. I will be going to graduate school, so I wanted to get a car. My dad will help me pay for the car and stuff but the problem is that we were getting a quote from the insurance company and it's crazy expensive ( more than 450 a month).
Let me explain some more, I am an international student, thus I can't have my parents in the same insurance policy because they do not live on the US. I have not gotten a license just yet, thus I have 0 official driving experience. I had driven with the license from my country before but there is no way of proving that. Also I didn't get a license before because I had to have a non owner liabilities insurance, which is about 200 a month. 
Basically my question is what option do I have so that I don't pay as much for insurance ? I would appreciate any advice and thanks beforehand!",17May2019,1

138,"Hello, I’ve been conflicted to go through with something. I’m not sure if it’s necessary or not, I would love an un-biased opinion.

There’s this teacher at my school, I’ll call M. M is a widely hated teacher at my school, much past infamy. He has a reputation of being creepy, awkward and - just in general - rude. M isn’t hated because the school needed a scapegoat, M is hated for some very specific reasons that I’ll now report to you. M has been working at the school for a very long time, over 10 years. He had started off as a Social / English teacher and is now a gym teacher (an immediate red flag). He was and is a horrendous teacher. My friend’s brother and his friends, who I am fairly close too, have backed up all of these accusations. As a Social / English teacher, he wouldn’t teach. Not once did he teach the actual lessons. Instead, he had them watch movies and do “trust exorcises”. This has been confirmed by multiple people. He would genuinely take them out in the halls, tell them to fall backwards and he would catch them. 

It truly makes me queasy to type this next part.

He had a habit to call over girls who were wearing skirts over to his desk in class and he would proceed to drop a pencil, go to pick it up and look up their skirts. Sometimes multiple times in one conversation!! This, of course, has been confirmed by those sources. By the way, the students who have confirmed this have graduated from that school. They would have nothing to gain by talking about fake occurrences. On the last day of school, the children in that class all decided to mess with this creep. They had all bought soda and chips and some had brought speakers. They started partying when the teacher came in and HALF OF THE CLASS got sent down to the office. This teacher also had a reputation among other staff so the children who were sent to the office had no punishment. 

This is an important time to mention he teaches at a MIDDLE school. Ranging from grades 5 - 9!!

That year, after the incident of sending so many children to the office, he was demoted to a gym teacher. My friend’s brother and his class now had to be “taught” by this man in gym. Clearly, this doesn’t stop him from being creepy. In fact, it may have encouraged it. He was now in a position to make the class do exercises. He would, very commonly, make the class do squats and yoga. He would stand behind the class to “assess their form”. It’s truly cruel. 

To give a more recent example, a conversation he had with one of my female friends (I’ll call her F). It was physical education and their gym class was outside for gym. It was a chilly day out and my friend didn’t take her sweat shirt with her, she walked to M where this following conversation ensued.

F: “Hey, M? Could I please go inside to get a sweatshirt? It’s sort of cold out.@

M: “.......................... Oh, sorry, it’s just... you’re so well developed. I mean, other girls your age are still developing but you... I mean... wow.

F: “Umm, could I please get my sweatshirt?”

M: “Oh, yes. Please, go ahead.”

My friend then went inside to grab her sweatshirt. She was on her way back outside when she saw M JOGGING IN THE HALLWAY towards her. F tried to quickly duck into the women’s locker room to get away from him but he had caught up to her and started talking to her again. My friend was standing in the locker room doorway and the teacher was talking to her and holding the door open.

M: “Hey F... I meant what I said earlier.”

F: “Umm, okay.”

The then took the door handle and closed the door.

I’m so frightened for the tiny fifth graders who are put in the same facility and general vicinity of this man. I’m so afraid that his behaviour may escalate. Should I act on it? I would probably be able to obtain enough evidence while still keeping the children anonymous. Please help...",17May2019,1

I brought this up to my parents 2 weeks ago and they freaked out. Yelled at me and told me that I would become a failure and never go to college if I didn’t go in the fall this year. They assumed that it’s because I’m scared to go to college even after I told them it was specifically because I’m burnt out. I compromised by saying I would only take a semester, but they still disagreed with that.

I’ve since gone through the process of officially changing my enrollment term to spring 2020. I also haven’t told me parents I did that.

I have been doing some clerical work for them, a part time ( something on the side because I only “really” work on my field 4 days and need a little extra$ for my family) I get pay an additional small amount for that. 
Thing is, they asked me if they open an additional half day and I get paid for that ( in my field) if I will be willing to do it. I said yes.
I started working then 4 1/2 days plus still doing the part time office work. At 1st when I didn’t see an increase on my paycheck I thought “they are just taking care of this, is new...” but after a month I asked and the response was, work less hours on the “office work”.
No offense to anyone but the pay to do office work ( in my State is $11-12)  is not the same as to get pay as a health care provider ( $40+) . How can I let them know in a respectful way that I don’t think it is fair?

So I live in small apartment with 2 others. One of my housemates has been getting short term contracts lately and spending a lot of time out of town. Been pretty random but the last few weeks shes only been home at the weekends. She doesn't want to contribute as much to the bills as a result. I'm really unsure about whats fair because on the one hand obviously she is using less power and water than I and the other housemate are, but on the other hand we agreed to split bills equally when we moved in and it seems impossible to quantify how much she should pay.

But it's hard for me to leave.

I enjoy having control, I was the only moderator that did work, and I was well-known for getting stuff done and solving issues. My coworkers (as well as most of our members) are all emotional messes, who are hotheads the moment they are criticized. 

And I've been turning into them. My mental stability has been compromised this entire time and I didn't realize it. To cope with my issues, I turned into a vulgar, hotheaded brat. I want to honestly change. I want to stop this addiction I have. I had set my resolve a month ago, to change, to quit, to be needed elsewhere and move on.

I got back on with a plan (which was my first mess up). I was going to employ more people on our team to replace me. To replace all of the work I did.

But now, I've gotten so involved in that, that I started to think about it. I'm going to be replaced. They won't miss me. I put all of these ideas in my head and now, to think about leaving this ""legacy"" of mine hurts. It truly hurts. I won't be able to see behind the scenes in the private moderator chats, I won't have any of that. And it kills me to think about it. 

And today, while talking to the other moderators, I started to realize I was doing it again. Being argumentative. Bratty. Hotheaded. And I hate it.

Reasons he might be cheating:
-Very defensive around his phone and keeps lock on both phone and laptop (I only know phone password)
-He has a Tik Tok account that he logs off of after using on phone and gets notifications like “Yeah she kinda cute” 
-Has a close relationship with his two female employees who are related
-Has went over to one of the female employee’s house to help with her bed 
-They share stuff that is not work related over text. For example, “I’m going to the gym” (dad) and “I’m going on a group walk” (female employee)
-One female employee has downloaded snapchat on his phone. As soon as he said that his employee did it he got defensive and said I/someone downloaded it
-Here’s some weird texts the females and him have shared: “You better tan over the weekend”, “The coast is clear” (this text and the one before have been deleted by my father), “Are you ignoring me 👀”

174,"I just recently finished a sort of nursing program that my mom helped me get into (as she works at the hospital it was at). It was about a year and a half, and so now I’m working at the hospital until I get my license. In which, I have taken the test twice and I’m pretty sure I failed the second time. Anyways, I haven’t really had a “vacation” since May of last year, and even then it wasn’t a vacation, I was at home for the whole week sitting around waiting for my boyfriend to come home. And before that, I think my last vacation was in December of 2016. I have vacations planned out in September and November of this year, but I still feel down and beat up every day. 

Before in the program, we were working 10 hour days mon-fri as we were working at the hospital, going to class and doing clinical time. Now I’m working 8 hour shifts (schedule changes so I don’t have the same days off) and I work graveyard shift. It’s nice and easy going at night, but no matter what I just feel miserable. 

I want to start working during the day, but then it’s going to be a hassle because we have to drop our dog off at my parents as he can’t stay by himself for too long or he wrecks everything. I miss going to bed every night with my boyfriend. 

I want to quit my job to be completely honest. I never saw myself becoming a nurse, and the only reason I decided to apply to the program was because I didn’t know what else to do. But now as I’ve been doing it for so long, I’ve realized this isn’t really what I want to do. 

I can’t quit though because I need insurance and my boyfriend has some from his work, but it’s practically nothing. And even if I were to quit, his job couldn’t support both of us, I’m currently the bread winner. 

I’m currently enrolled in classes, but it’s supposed to help with my degree for this nursing thing, but as I’ve said before I don’t know if I want to keep doing this. 

My mom would probably be extremely upset with me if I quit, but I’m just not happy. I’m only 22 so it’s not like it’d be hard to start over, but I just don’t know where to start. I feel so miserable every day. I hate when it’s time for me to go work. I hate feeling like I’m wasting my time. But I don’t know what else to do. I just need some guidance, or even other people’s experiences. Anything will help.


TLDR: F(22) completely miserable with current nursing job/not dream job. Failed my licenseteat  twice from a nursing program I’ve been in for a year and a half. Boyfriend doesn’t make enough to support both of us if I were to quit. Heartbroken and confused on what to do.",17May2019,1
175,"I wake up in the morning waiting to go to bed at night, I live today waiting for whatever comes next in my future. I feel like I can’t enjoy the moment, I’m just waiting, but I dont know for what.

176,"So when I do something that can be bad, I always feel guilty. It’s nothing like hurting someone but sometimes it’s about even thinking about something or even making a joke with a friend. I feel like I always need to tell my mom (in middle school) and I’m always looking out to make sure I don’t do something that will make me feel guilty. I love my mom very much but I feel guilty if I don’t tell her something that sometimes I want to keep to myself. Thank you very much.",17May2019,1
177,"So my friend (M early 20’s) has been part of my friend group longer then I have and was kind of in and out in my early days. People always talk nice about him, but there’s always an undertone. I didn’t think anything of it so I when it came time for me to find a place to stay I moved in with him. 

I’d like to say for the most part I had a good time. Other times it was really hard. He would go threw intense mood swings where he would come home in a cloud of rage fuming about work. Then would sit down, smoke some weed and say “damn, sorry guess I just needed to get high” (note I smoke a lot of weed to so that’s not an uncommon phrase in our place.) Then he would get a text from a girl or something that wasn’t what he would want to hear and BANG right back into rage mode. When he’s up set he yells and blames everything and everyone for what’s happened to him. 

I guess the biggest thing is he doesn’t know how to deal with his own personal problems, problems that none of us can solve. We can help and we do to the best of our ability, but when it’s constant... It stains people and wears them thin. He’s hard to hang out with because people are always worried he’ll “go into one of his moods.” 

Sometimes he gets it and I’ve even brought up therapy witch he’s open too. But it comes down to the same thing, he can’t deal with his own problems to take those next steps to seek help. Short of me scheduling an appointment and dragging him to see a therapist it doesn’t seem like it will happen. Also I’m worried if I do that he’ll only yell at me and resent me for what I’m implying. 

Where we’re at is I’ve moved out (not because of this simply moving on in life, not to say I wasn’t a little relieved to leave that environment.) And he’s worried that he’ll never see me anymore... Which if he doesn’t change his attitude on life, might be the case. I’d rather not have that kind of toxicity in my life. 

So I turn to you reddit. For any and all advice.",17May2019,2

179,"Hi guys,

(I finally posted something on this site after having been a bystander since forever.)

A brief introduction about my background, I am Indonesian, I studied finance in a local business school and managed to get a job in a global financial advisory firm here for slightly more than a year.

Moving to Canada has been my dream since I was still in college. There is a ridiculous personal story behind why I fell in love with Montreal, but on the realistic side, I chose Montreal because of its culture, and especially its lower living cost compared to Toronto or Vancouver (yes I visited those three cities and not to forget Calgary). I am also preparing myself to be fluent in French in order to adapt well and to get a job there after graduation (and despite its complicated grammar, I fell in love with French too!).
So I applied to some masters programs in finance in Montreal, QC. However, I got rejected by the other two top universities and received an offer to JMSB’s MSc in Finance.

I am hesitant about getting a masters degree in JMSB. It’s large amount of money to be spent on a masters program without rank. I was like, I have to choose something with real ROI. I still have the time to take control of my future...so I applied to another universities.
Long story short, I am also offered an admission from one of the best local business schools in Singapore (SMU), whose MSc in Applied Finance program is ranked top 45th in the world.

Now that I am facing two options, should I take the better program, get some working experience in Singapore and then apply for Canada PR using Express Entry? (I’ll have no Canadian experience and I feel like this method would be really unreachable)
Or should I just take the rather mediocre program in Montreal but being able to apply for PR after 1 year of working experience in Montreal (using the given PGWP)?

On the side note. I am also working on my CFA. I hope it would help me to get a decent paying job in either landscape.

My goal to live in Canada also includes my forward-looking plan, which is better education, quality of life, and health assurance for my descendants. However, I also understand that I am still young and I am capable to compete in a fast-paced country like Singapore.

Any advice would be really helpful. Thanks guys!",17May2019,1
181,"  

Hello all, I’m new to posting even though I’ve been on reddit for a year now. I usually just lurk and made a few comments and made one other post but deleted it. I am feeling a little desperate now though and am posting in r/assistance, and r/multiplesclerosis. If there are any other suggestions, please let me know. I apologize for the length of my post in advance. TLDR at the bottom.

My mother was diagnosed with very aggressive Primary Progressive MS a few years ago. Within a year she was paralyzed and within two years it’s moved its way up to her diaphragm, arms, hands, and neck. It is so painful to watch because she was so strong, hardworking, and independent. Her mind is still fine, but she is trapped in her own body. She tried two different infusions (Rituxan/Ocrevus) until November last year, and neither stopped the progression or made any improvements. It was decided that she receive steroid infusions monthly as that helped give her a little strength once before.  She was able to get it in March 2019 through home health, but they will no longer provide this service as she was discharged, and they will not provide this infusion service once a month. She was also provided occupational therapy with that service but was eventually discharged because she is so far beyond help. The OT therapist was amazing though and gave her some things to work on. We are getting this same answer from other home health agencies or the other issue is that they do not contract with Medicare.  Her neurologist is in Houston and she lives near San Antonio. Right when she was retiring, she and my father downgraded to a house outside the SA area and she was diagnosed right as they were moving. Her neurologist is wonderful but is not familiar with the services in their area.

We’ve contacted so many other places that may do home infusions and finally found Coram which is a company within CVS Pharmacy that provides in home infusions. Once I found them I was so thankful, and we started to get the ball rolling. They asked my mother for a referral from her neurologist which was provided the next day. My mother asked if any other information was needed and they said no. Three days later they finally contact her and ask for her insurance info which in my opinion, why in the hell didn’t they ask for that in the first place? That was over a week ago. My mom has been calling every day, but no one will return her call. She was not rude or demanding, she just wants to know what is going on. She was finally told on Wednesday that someone would contact her by the end of the day and of course they did not. The customer service number provided when you go to the corporate site does not work. There is another number I located, but they just transferred me to the local branch and said I could leave a message with the person my mom was dealing with because they were on a conference call. I left a detailed message and just asked for a simple phone call back to either my mom or myself. 

No one called either one of us back and I found out my mom was talking with a different person than who I left the message with, so I called tonight and left a not so nice message. I hate confrontation and have never left a nasty message in my life, but I am trying to advocate for my mother and her health as I see her fade before my eyes. I said that their behavior and lack of professionalism was ridiculous, and my mother at least deserved a phone call back to see what was going on. I said that I would be calling corporate but I’m sure they’re laughing in my face because the damn number doesn’t work. At this point I don’t know if I’d even want their service, but I am having little luck at this point finding anyone else. I have reached out to the MS Society for assistance as well and received an email with some info, but it was pretty much what I had already looked up. Has anyone every dealt with Coram before and does anyone have any suggestions on where I can go from here? I’m just trying to get someone to go out to the house to give her this one-hour steroid infusion once a month. Home health I believe is required to go out there weekly, but I’ve been told there is not a reason to go out to see her weekly. If anything, where can I make a complaint about Coram? I can’t let their unjustified behavior go even if we do not use their services because I do not want anyone else to go through what we are going through especially if their case is time sensitive. I’m just lost, and very tired. Thank you.

TLDR: mom needs steroid infusions once a month but having no luck with resources. Also, how do I report Coram for ignoring our calls and delaying my mother’s treatment after they have taken her referral and insurance info?",17May2019,1
182,"I'm always very proactive on the project I'm consulting, but it feels like it creates more work for me and everyone involved. I'm not in a management role at all. I think people see it positively and hopefully don't think I'm a try hard. Or if they do, oh well. But is being proactive necessarily a good thing in every situation? The company has set a pretty low standard so should I just give up and let things go and take things as they come like everyone else? I'm trying to help keep the project on track but it's futile. Within the culture it is easier to be reactive and not fix things until they're really broken. Can't tell if I'm just jaded",17May2019,1

I’m a very *very* reserved person, as I’m sure a lot of people are. I’ve been this way basically since birth (even as a baby I never cried, or talked, just observed, but that’s besides the point), and I really really want to not be that way. I’m in college, I recently dumped the only friend group I really knew/talked to because i wasn’t satisfied with their level of commitment, and now I’m utterly alone. I’ve met a few people who I talk to and maybe one other person I’m closer with, but I’d just like to hear input from other introverts-turned-extro (or even extroverts) on how you managed to break out of that safe bubble, how to approach people, what to talk about after said fact, and whatevs. I can manage a conversation fairly decently, but my biggest problem is learning how to seem approachable and how to initiate conversations/discussions/whatever.

185,"So, two days ago a eviction notice was put on our door. My mother has always paid our rent on time and kept a decent relationship with our landlord but one thing she never did was pay a pet deposit for our 2 dogs. Since she never did that, for 49 months we have been living in this home with pets and not paying the fee for them. She believed that since the landlord knew we had dogs but never really asked for the deposit that it would be swept under the rug.... Now he was $3,940 for the deposits and the months we have basically skipped out on paying him. To be brutally honest I'm upset as fuck. We dont have 2 dogs we actually have 4 and have had more since my mother thinks she can foster animals and find them a new home which has been a 6 month process usually or the dog becomes ours. The house constantly smells, I clean up after them way to much, and their the reasons we/re losing our home..... Dogs... that I never asked for.

She doesn't have a set place to go and neither do I. I can couch surf for a few weeks sure but how long can I do that? I have summer school coming up and I graduate college in December. I can't get a full time job and get me a place it would take time. Staying at my dad is an option too but he lives 45 minutes away from my job and lives an hour and 30 minutes from my university (I commute from my mom's crib). My mom thinks she can stay somewhere for a month and find us somewhere but I don't want to live with her anymore. This could happen again and its just not good for my mind, body, and spirit lol. I only have one friend looking for a roommate once his lease is up but that is in November. That seems to be my only decent option for the long run. Or I ask my dad to help me get a place but then I feel a carrot is hanging over my head again by a parent. Idk what to do exactly, this is all still fresh but any suggestions would be great. I think I could couch surf for a month if not 2 months tops. Will it suck yes but it's what's got to be done

189,"I decided to post this on my throwaway account since i'm worried someone i know will see this.

I (20/F) have never been too big on social media, i only had gotten my first phone in my 10th grade year of high school. I had got my first Instagram account my 11th grade year then it hit me and it felt amazing, i loved seeing new things and keeping up with my favorite creators favorite friends and find girls on Instagram who i thought were absolutely beautiful, i didn't much of it at the time. I slowly started posting each time it got more and more addictive.. i saw the increase on my likes and saw very kind comments. I would love posting and getting validation from people i never spoken to or heard of.. i had people following me that had large followings like over 100k. It all felt new to me and felt good. BUT as time went on months after this i found it harder and harder to post, i found myself making sure i posted only stuff i knew my followers would like not stuff i liked, only stuff i knew would get me more and more followers/likes. I never got past 100 something followers because it got to the point where the people i once loved to look at who i thought were beautiful were suddenly now ugly to me purely out of jealousy. 

*''Why am i not like them?''*

*''Why can't i get likes like them?''*

*''Am i that ugly..?''*

*''If only i looked like her, then i'd be more loved.''* 

*''The boys would like me more if looked like her, spoke like her, had her body, or jaw line, etc''*

All of these are thoughts i'd have when on Instagram so i made the decision to get off Instagram since it got to the point i was crying at night and staying up wondering how i could change, what i could do to be JUST like these girls. I even blocked a lot of them before leaving out of jealously.  I never left mean comments though i only blocked them so i wouldn't have to see them. So i disable my account and never look back.. until midway into my 12th grade year my friend convinced me to get back on by giving me a motivational speech about how i shouldn't care. I being stupid agreed and said *''You're right!""* So onward i go back on Instagram but on a new account since i had been gone for so long i believe they deleted my account. So now here we are i've been using Instagram now for a long time now, i'm posting this because i'm currently back at square one. This time i'm completely additected to Instagram. I wake up get on, i spend half the day on it, and i always look at the same pretty girls i always saw before but now it's even MORE. I'm more insecure than i was before and now it's to the point where it's seeping into my real life and effecting my friendships. I still am obsessed with getting likes to the point where i rarely post in fear of not getting any and my friends seeing that. I'm also always talking about it and always whining about something i want that the other girls have. I don't do it on purse it just seeps out. Getting on now makes me feel like i'm old when i see girls who are like 15-19 having follower counts that only teenage me could've dreamed of, i feel old because i feel like i'm out of place now when i post a selfie since when i posted selfies it wasn't as advance as it is now.  Hell i feel old compared to other 20 years olds on Instagram, everyone is just so beautiful and living their best lives and looking amazing while doing it and here i am on here whining and when i try and do the same it never turns out like i want it. I don't know how to fix my obnoxious obsession with likes, and wanting followers since i can't see myself removing my Instagram again. I'd feel lost without it. I'm so annoyed with myself it's crazy. How can i fix this? does anyone have any advice on how i can move past this or how to force myself to delete Instagram?

Also if this has too many spelling errors i am very sorry about that, i'll fix it when i get the chance but right now i'm in a rush.",17May2019,2
190,"I ordered 12 custom made shades from a popular home improvement store. The total was close to $4,000.00. I had trouble getting in touch with the store when setting up an appointment for them to come out and measure of my windows. 

It took me close to a week to get in touch with the department that handles shades via the phone. I chose this store because it was in a really good neighborhood and was a lot cleaner and more presentable than the other locations in NYC. 

I was finally able to get in touch with the shades department after having to contact corporate and having them send an email to the store to have them call me back. The representative that helped me in the shades department, let’s call her Sam, was very helpful and was able to set up an appointment over the phone for them to come measure my windows and was able to take a deposit over the phone. She went above and beyond to accommodate me. She saved me a trip from going to the store and having the appointment as I have done in the past at another location. 

The day of the measurement comes and everything went well. I waited for the measurements to be sent over to the store and scheduled an appointment with Sam so I can pick out the shades I wanted before their huge promotion ends. I already knew what I was looking for and just wanted to make sure I got the right colors. 

I sat along with Sam and chose the shades I wanted, my mom came along. We confirmed with her that we wanted 8 of a certain color shade for the bedrooms and 4 of a different color for the living room. I initialed on one page where it stated the color of the shades for the living room. She told me she would give me my own copy and it was already close to 3 hours of us being in the store. I wanted to go through each page but she thought we waited enough. 

We sat with her while she confirmed our order and inputed everything into the computer. In the meantime an AM (assistant manager) came, I had requested to speak to a manager when I first entered the store because it takes forever for me to get in touch with someone at the store. The AM acknowledged they were having trouble with their lines and other customers have complained. I told him that if it was so difficult for me to get in touch with the store before making an order, god forbid if I had any issues after making the order and needed to reach the store what would happen? He provided me a business card with the direct number for the managers and the extension numbers upon my request. I told him that Sam is very helpful and a great employee. 

While I was speaking to the AM, Sam stepped away and went to help another customer. The AM gave me a courtesy credit of $100.00 for my inconvenience upon my request. After the AM left, Sam sat back down and completed the order and brought it to customer service so I could pay. I paid for everything on a credit card for a layer of protection. Sam informed me it would take 2 weeks for the order to arrive at my home before I could schedule an appointment for the window treatment installers to come out and install the shades. 

I received the shades on Wednesday and they all ended up being the same color. Sam, I come to find out inputed the same color for all 12 shades. 8 of the shades were incorrect. I had already taken down my old shades because I was informed if I didn’t prior to the install, I would be charged a surcharge. I had scheduled an install for this Friday upon receipt of the shades and assumed everything was there. 

I immediately called the store and wasn’t able to get in touch with anyone and their lines were messed up again. I called the numbers the managers provided me and the calls would drop. At this point I was extremely aggravated and upset with this whole ordeal and was beating myself over for even going with this store. I finally reach the department that Sam works in and they were trying to page her because she stepped away. Finally someone was able to get ahold of Sam, I told her what had happened. She didn’t remember who I was at first but it eventually came to her. She stated she wanted to correct my order and doesn’t know how it happened because she is always thorough. She informed me that this is her only job and it is very important to her, specially because she is an only parent to her son. 

I told her I just wanted a resolution that would cause me the least inconvenience, I informed her I would have 4 of the correct shades installed and the rest I want ASAP and I want to be compensated for this huge inconvenience. She said she would call me tomorrow afternoon (Friday) with a solution and to please give her a chance to rectify the issue. I told her my windows were bare. She informed me there really was no way to rush custom made shades and that I had to wait another 2 weeks. In the mean time I have bare windows and I can put up temporary shades. 

I already gave Sam amazing feedback after paying for the blinds, the question I have is what sort of resolution should I go for? What sort of compensation should I request? I don’t want Sam to get in trouble. I already feel like shit because while trying to get in touch with the store, I emailed a rep at corporate that was originally helping me get in touch with the store and informed her on how Sam completely messed up my order. I also vented to a rep at the Store when they were trying to reach Sam or a Manager and I informed them that it was urgent because Sam completely messed up my order. I was yelling and very angry when speaking to this rep about my order. 

TL;DR: Took forever to reach a sales rep to order custom shades for 12 windows. Finally meet the rep and spent over $4,000.00 on custom shades of two different colors, 8 of one and 4 of another. Took 2 weeks for the shades to arrive, and the day prior to their installation I open the boxes for the shades and they are all the same color. I try to reach the store again after many hours, I yelled to one rep about how another rep massively fucked up my order. When I spoke to the original sales rep she told me how important her job was and that I had to wait another 2 weeks for the correct shades. In the meantime my windows are bare because I removed the old shades pre install to avoid a surcharge during installation. What should I do as far as compensation?",17May2019,1

196,"One of my closest friends seems really depressed and i wanna help him but i just dont know how, so i resorted to you, the fine people of reddit. okay so I'll go from the beginning, my bestfriend (we'll refer to him as B) im pretty sure is depressed because he cant get a girlfriend and stress of his sixth form exams are getting to him and you can tell that he is changing, he used to be really nice and wouldnt wish anything bad upon most people (unless they genuinely deserved it), he occasionally had an outburst, around once every year where he would get into a fight with someone (not random people, he would just retaliate to people being cunts towards him and or other people), but now hes just not being as nice, getting angry over small things, and hes constantly tired and refuses to do his exercise (which he loved doing). hes still tries to be nice you can tell but he just bottles it up and eventually he will snap at someone at his sixth form and get into a fight, which will get him kicked out. So i need anyone that is willing to offer advice so that i can try help him out of this sad and loneliness in which he feels. thank you people of reddit, i appreciate any advice you offer.",17May2019,1

200,"My \[teen F\] friend \[teen F\] hasn't eaten since 4 days. While that may not be fatal, she's already underweight and gets shaky sometimes. She suffers from a long history of PTSD, Depression, Anxiety and Anorexia. She lives only with her mother, who's is verbally abusive towards her, which she doesn't go into details about but it is very apparent. From what I've asked her, she isn't doing it to ""be skinny"", but she just doesn't eat, and claims nothing will happen to her if she doesn't eat. She's also told me she's gone a month without eating before. While attempting to respect her wishes, I've tried making her eat, convincing her, and threatening to tell an adult. If I tell the authorities or call the police, she probably won't even be taken away from her mother, and her life will be even worse. I'm scared for her and I don't know what to do. Please help.

201,"Background story. Before I ever met my fiance, she started almost dating a boy three years ago during her freshman year of college. Before they could make anything official, they both parted ways to leave on an 18-month and 2-year religious mission. She came back almost a year before he did while being in constant contact with him over email during her mission. 6 months after she came back from her mission, she and I met last summer. Fast forward to now. She and I are getting married in 5 weeks. However, the boy that she talked to and has known for a really long time just got back from his mission. And she felt the need to text him. She really values friendship. This guy was part of their very nuclear friend group from three years ago. So as weird as it is for me, I thought that it would be a good idea to text him anyways to see how he's doing. Is it bad that I feel weird for saying that? She's her own person and I completely respect previous friendships she's made. Idk what to do, guys.",17May2019,1

Im a sophomore right now so all my friends are 16 and im watching all of them get jobs, so naturally I feel like im missing out on their freedom. I hate having to rely on my parents especially since I've never been the type to really be comfortable constantly asking them for money, and as a person in the lower middle class, my parents aren't the type to just hand me a $20 bill whenever. Anyways, summers starting and I really just want to have something to do. I know a few places hire at 15, but after months of trying I started applying to jobs and checking the little ""yes"" box when it asked me if I was 16. I felt rebellious. Miraculously, I ended up getting a job interview on the first job I applied to checking the ""I am 16 or older box"". I was in awe of how easy it had been. Anyways I'm scared all the days up until the interview, but the day comes, and I get the job on the spot. Im so so happy like you don't understand. However, this was short lived. About a week and a Half into working, I get a call from my manager. I assume its about next weeks scheduling... but its not. She tells me im 15, and I can't work there. I was heartbroken. I had submitted my real identification, SSN, permit, so I just assumed it had been overlooked. But nope. They fire me. Im depressed. I get paid $120 for what I worked and grieve the short lived freedom. Anyways, I took a break from applying to jobs until recently. I applied to this place today that didn't ask for my age or anything, and they gave me an interview for tomorrow. Upon researching the company, I found that just like most franchises, they hire at 16. I dont know if I can do this again. I feel guilty and ashamed for lying. Im frustrated at my age. But I want a job so incredibly bad. Should I try again? Is this just building a bad reputation for me? What if everything goes well and this ends up being an amazing summer job? Please help.

206,"Alright, the title is vague as hell, allow me to elaborate. I'm a high school senior who's in a relationship with a freshman. I asked her out in a depressed state of mind due to a major fuck-up while flirting with another girl. For the first couple of months, everything was awesome. I felt great, and truly loved her. But for a few months I was questioning my feelings towards her, whether or not I really wanted to be with her, especially with all of her talk of ""our future and marriage."" Idk why, but that kind of talk kind of scares me.

Within the last few weeks, I've decided that even though I care for her, I don't want to be locked in a relationship with her. She's pretty and nice, but her personality and the major maturity gap between us has driven a nail in my affection towards her. Now that I'm graduating next week, I'm planning on breaking up with her over the phone or over text.

Here comes my first problem and advice request: How do I do this? Recently a lot of guys have been getting fucked over after breakups (especially if they're older than their ex) due to the girls claiming they sexually assaulted them or raped them. This girl I'm currently with had a pretty sexually aggressive boyfriend before me, and her family came *this* close to filing charges. She and I haven't had sex or anything, but we've definitely fooled around a little, and I'm scared that if I break up with her, she might try to pin a sexual assault charge on me.

&amp;#x200B;

And now to my next problem. Less scary, no potential prison time, but a problem nonetheless.

&amp;#x200B;

There's a girl I've been talking to for about three years now online. I live in Texas, she lives in Canada. Unlike the girl I'm with now, this Canadian girl (We'll call her C), is only a week younger than me. We tried online dating over the summer months between my sophomore and junior year, but decided to cut it off and stay friends shortly after school started.

Recently, we have started talking again. Nothing serious, a couple messages a day or less. In a group chat of multi-year friends, we toss mock-threats of ""I swear I'm gonna drive over there and blow your house up."" or ""If you don't stop I'm gonna fuck you in the ass."" around like it's candy. And C and I do the same thing when we're private messaging each other.

But her messages get... suggestive... for lack of better word. I think at first ""Obviously this is a joke, we live over two thousand miles away."" But the more we chat and the more I think back to how I used to feel about her, the more I start to get the thoughts that perhaps she's still into me? **Advice question:** Is that just wishful thinking or could I possibly be onto something? And if by some miraculous reason we do find out we want each other, how would I make it work? I'm going to college in Oklahoma, and she lives in BC.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I have two problems. 1) I'm about to graduate, dating a freshman, and am worried about getting pinned for sexual assault. 2) I'm flirting with a friend online from Canada and want to know how I can make it work.",17May2019,1

210,"Sorry, but there's no tldr for this one. I'm already freaking out as it is and can't summarize

&amp;#x200B;

So at the beginning of the semester my dad allowed me to use the second car we have. I live on campus at my college so I would need it in case I wanted to go home, and the freedom was nice. Fast forward to now, my dad confronts me because the mileage, or something along those lines, like the number of miles driven, was way higher than it should be, even with me driving it. He thinks that I've been driving friends places and going to places that are far and stuff and not telling  him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not. I'm being completely honest here, I'm not. He doesn't believe me, and I don't know what to do. The only thing I can think of, and this is more than likely the answer, is the fact that, since it's my last year of college, and I really didn't like going to the cafeteria for food ,I went out to eat, like a lot. The farthest I ever went was about an 18 minute drive to a local mall for some food then back to campus. The problem is that I did it a lot, So that's my only theory as to why it's so high. I have driven friends around, but I've told my dad about it. And even then I've only driven them to a very close Walmart and back to campus.

&amp;#x200B;

 He doesn't believe me and I don't know what to do. He's tried giving me the chance to come clean, but I have been telling the truth the whole time. I don't know what to do now.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2nd part that is related  or will be:

&amp;#x200B;

It's my senior year of college, and I'm an animation major My thesis is to make a film for it. Right now, I've been lucky enough to be enrolled into the new ""master's"" program for the animation department. My only stipulation to stay is that I have to maintain good grades. This was only ever a problem my sophomore year, since I had a family tragedy that affected me severely.

&amp;#x200B;

This semester in particular has been an absolute trainwreck. I did my thesis, but was late on it, so the grade was lower than i wanted/may need. and thesis is like the name of the class itself. Then there character animation where the entire semester project was to make the 12 principles of animation. Done, but it was late. still waiting on that grade but im praying it's at least a B. the last 2 classes are giving me nightmares

&amp;#x200B;

Motion capture is one of them. Fast forward now, and I have an F and have no idea why. I'm emailing the professor frantically asking why and as of now haven't gotten a response. I did all the work, i know that. My only guess is that he's missing most of it since there's a folder on the school computers that keeps getting wiped by the IT  department at my school and I didn't realize he didn't have my work because of that. I missed the last day of class because i had to go home for an emergency. I emailed him that too. I'm about to zip a file with everything and send it to him.

&amp;#x200B;

My 2nd class is science. it's one of the last classes that i need to get out of the way for animation. my problem is that I'm just bad at test taking. I did really bad on the midterms and have no idea on what i got for the final. I did pretty well on my quizzes i mean we had a lot but I don't know if i passed or not. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem lies here. I'm supposed to graduate in less than a week, like next tuesday i'm supposed to go to my own graduation ceremony. I'm being absolutely serious--

&amp;#x200B;

*I don't think I can live with myself if I either, don't graduate/ get to walk because of my science, or i don't get to continue as a graduate during the fall*

&amp;#x200B;

It's one thing if i fail a course literally any other year, but i'm, a senior, and and at the endgame of all this. If i can't walk or continue in the fall, I have no clue on what will happen to me.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, my dad and I are really close, and he'd understand if I had failed or something. If it wasn't my senior year. I've been telling him I've been doing okay, and also mentioning I've been struggling with science. I mentioned how I've struggled with my science exam, and his undertone in his voice was upset. Like he's upset that I was struggling, like get over it you know? I'm terrified, I have no idea on what's going to happen

&amp;#x200B;

He's the kind of dad that will ground me at 21, and it will stick, you know?

Now I’ve debated to asking him out. We’re pretty close and even if he says no, he’s awesome to not make things awkward. However... there is this one reason that’s holding me back. There is this one girl who already likes him.

Now I wouldn’t say this girl and I are like best friends, but we’re definitely acquaintances. Here’s the problem though... whenever she gets a crush she gets quite frankly obsessed with them. She’s letting it define her whole self worth. Like everyone knows that she likes this person. And here’s the thing she’s asked him out before and he rejected her, but she keeps on pushing for dates and more. One time he asked out a different girl for prom and she got pissed.

I've done casual stuff for a year and was even ""talking"" to someone for 7 months until things broke off. (After our last date, I admitted that I loved him and asked him out the day to be my boyfriend. He said he wanted to be friends and gave a bunch of BS excuses such as, ""It's me and not you. Dating in college is hard. It will be tough with distance during school breaks."" He admitted a week ago that he was lying when he said he liked me in a romantic way during those 7 months. He had also admitted that during those two months after we stopped talking because I was really upset, that he didn't miss me at all. He's the type that moves on quickly and ""pushes things to the back of his mind and forgets about it""). I've done off and on casual stuff through tinder and hooked up with that same guy for a few months. Unfortunately, I was an idiot and fell for the same guy that screwed me off while we hooked up (and it was completely unintentional and I was unsure at first if I actually had feelings for him or not). The deal was when we were hooking up that there would be no feelings and I would tell him right away if I did. I had started having feelings for him a few weeks ago but had intentions of telling him in person. He got really upset that I didn't tell him right away and didn't believe me. Also admitted that he was currently searching around for girlfriend anyways and probably needed to stop seeing me. However, a few months prior he wouldn't date me because distance and dating in college is hard? But I wasn't the problem? I know I'm better off and I know that it wasn't healthy when we were ""talking"" because he never made time for me, was a poor communicator, and was emotionally distant. It's really hard to not take things personally and I know that I was dealing with a lot while I was ""talking"" to him and probably used him a lot as a therapist. (I had a really stressful job, a poor paying job, stressful semester, poor housing condition, and battling with my mental health while going to therapy). I'm scared that I'm going to end up alone because I'm afraid to get close to anyone anymore and I feel like there is something wrong with me because nothing keeps working out.

218,"Hi there. I work in an acute psychiatric facility. As we all probably know, the American mental heath system is a dumpster fire. The company recently sent out a survey asking if we felt we were adequately staffed/supported, would recommend the facility, how we could “increase employee engagement”(?), and improve the patient experience.

I found fundamental flaws in the question phraseology, and from what I gathered they are basically wanting to know what people are unhappy with, ok great, but in my opinion, they are looking for areas where there’s leeway to make budget cuts and go to bare bones. 

I get this. It’s a business. Whatever. BUT I feel compelled to humbly elaborate on my opinions and ideas, and would like to say (many things) but start off with something along the lines of “you’re asking what makes us unhappy and not what would make us more happy, you’re doing the right thing by seeking our input, but the data you’re gathering isn’t going to reap the results you appear to be aiming for”. I would also like to elaborate on ways I think treatment could be improved.

I am 25. I am not administration and am kind of the “newbie” in some ways. But, I am passionate about pulling people out of the abyss and I want to help as many people as possible. I am pretty sure I will follow through with this, but I need advice on how to do it humbly, professionally and stunningly. Right down to how I communicate it.

I was thinking: write a formal letter (formatting?), ask my boss to read it and give me his opinion, and send it as an attachment to whoever will be looking at the survey results.

I want any and all advice. What words or angles should I use to communicate no disrespect but that I really want to be heard. How do I communicate that I understand the survey may very well be to cut expenses, but in the case that it isn’t, I have something to say. How do I politely mention that I think their whole approach is in the right ballpark but not quite right.

I feel like this is my chance to make an impact on at least one mental health facility, no matter how big or small. I want to take the opportunity and grab it by the balls. Please, no advice is too big or small. Really needing support and encouragement here ❤️",17May2019,1

220,"Recently I've been having some concerns at work. I'm a marketing and events manager at a small local brewery and I think our new general manager has got it out for me. The brewery is pretty new about 2 years old. I'm a day 1 employee and have a good relationship with the business owners, they invite me out on occasion, email or call me regularly, they're even offering me wedding gifts as I'm getting married soon. I recently sat dawn and had a talk with the owner. (We'll refer to him as RF). Originally RF and I were just supposed to talk about this summer's event schedule. However RF blindsided me with a suprising question. RF asked where do you see yourself with our brewery? I replied honestly, ""I see myself in a business to business marketing position, building the brands image, handling sales, promoting events and spreading our product across the region"". RF liked that answer from what I could tell and asked how I would achieve this goal and benefit his brewery. After an few hours of talking and forming ideas and strategies I left for home feeling confidence in my opportunity and position. My hours had been shortened recentlybin anticipation of me transitioning into helping managing our new distribution plan. I'm supposed to be moving the majority of my time into this new department and my general manager (We'll call him BD) is very strict on over time. BD in the last 2 months has cut my hours, hired a graphic designer to produce in house marketing material and yelled at me for producing a quarterly report he thought was useless. He's only been with the brewery for 8 months and he's fired a bar manager and executive chef. Our new chef is a old friend of his. I really believe he's trying to drive me away from the company and here is the primary reason. 3 days ago he told me if I have anything to ask about my job I need to ask him not the owners. But it was RF who came to me asking questions about my future, not me asking RF. I think BD sees me as a threat to his professional growth and is trying to stunt my progress so he can make a case to have my position terminated. What can I do?",17May2019,1

225,"Hey Reddit, I (28M) have a particular situation that it would love to have your opinion about.

I just finished grad school, and I and some of my classmates went out to celebrate last Friday. We went first to a restaurant, then to a bar and then to one of my classmates' apartment. She (27F) is married and her husband (29M) works abroad, she invited us (the whole group) to keep drinking at her place.

We keep drinking until late and I guess I have too much and I fell asleep on the couch. It's not the first time that it happens to me. Everyone else left after or before that. I guess she or someone else took of my shoes and put a blanket over me and then she went to sleep as well.

I woke up the next morning listening to my classmate's husband screaming to her through her phone. She told him that I was there as something casual like there was nothing wrong with it. However, he took it really badly and screamed at her about ""why the fuck there is a guy sleeping in our apartment"". Again he sounded really upset and a bit aggressive.

I felt terrible and I apologized to her while she was still on the phone and I left. Then after a couple of minutes, he began sending me a lot of aggressive DM's saying that he was ""fucking furious"" about me sleeping on his couch and that he wanted to ""talk to me"" as soon as he returns to the city. The messages were not explicitly violent, but the tone of the whole thing seems really extreme to me.

I answered one of the DMs apologizing and explaining that I never decided to stay, that it was that I was too drunk to decide otherwise. He then began to ask me a lot of specific questions (how many people were there, why only you stayed) that I don't feel I should answer since I think its more about his mistrust on his wife or some other issue which has nothing to do with me.

I would block him and go on with my life but we have a bunch of events this weekend because of our graduation and he is going to be in all of those events. I hate confrontations and I don't want this thing ruining the happiness of graduation. Should I say something back now on the DM's? should I just wait if he tries to do something to me next weekend?

Would appreciate any advice or support

It was kinda toxic on my end for the year and a half(mostly cause i was bitter as hell) and in one episode where she contracted me after her boyfriend cheated on her and she just wanted a friend, I flew into a rage; telling her i never wanted to hear from her again and that she uses me as a crutch when her relationship she abandoned me for isnt working.

Thats pretty harsh...

227,"I just finished my sophomore year at a private college. The tuition is roughly 50k per year when you include housing/meal plans/etc. I’m also stupid so I didn’t get any scholarships. I talked to my parents about the decision to go there and they said they ultimately wanted me to be happy, but I still feel really guilty about not having some way to give them a break financially...

I have an interview for an internship in the city tomorrow afternoon, and the degree I’m going for is in film, so the internship would be very hands-on and a sort of “drop what you’re doing and help us if you can” type of situation. Because of this, I suggested to my dad that it may be best for me to just find a house and some roommates in the area and go from there rather than commute an hour from my hometown 3 times a week. My therapist is also in the city, as well as my psychologist and several friends of mine. 

Another option I have is to move in with my grandparents for the summer, but my grandfather is a stroke victim and my grandmother already has her hands full taking care of him. I definitely don’t want to overwhelm her with my unstable schedule, and since the internship would offer credit at the college, I have the possibility of moving off campus with no housing exemption fee. 

The problem goes in here. I told my dad about all this, and told him that I would obviously find the highest paying job I could find in the area to either foot some of the rent, pay the exemption fee if the school decides to slap it on, or to use the money from my job to foot all my other bills (groceries, Spotify, etc) and he said we would talk about it, but he seemed generally positive about the whole situation and emphasized that all he really wanted was to see me be successful in my industry and to enjoy the work that I do. 

I then talked to my mom about the same thing, and she immediately said that we couldn’t afford it, and that the three of us were working my dad to death, and that even if I got a job, it probably wouldn’t be enough.

Now I feel guilty about even going to college there, or even going into film at all. Part of me wants to transfer to a cheaper school for the good of my parents, but another part of me is so in love with my school and my major and I feel as though I’ve finally found a place where the people around me are encouraging and don’t push me in the back of their minds.

I didn’t take them out at any point in that class and it was the only time I was away from my backpack. 4 people sat at the table where my bag was. 2 are eliminated because they have AirPods and are friends.

235,"TLDR: I broke myself, am healing, but have no social outlets or stimulation. Help me from going crazy.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello all,

As the name implies, this is a throwaway account. 

Small background: Won't bore you too much,

I am Autistic, live in Miami, and have recently overcome the greatest obstacles with the disorder. Namely having a stable student and career life. For a long time I have had trouble socializing and making new friends. I did quite well with it in my first year of college, but had a girl falsely call me a rapist, and was quite traumatized. This caught me in a cycle of cannabis and kratom abuse (my only vices), which I quit recently. I also quit pornography consumption, and overcame the tough event. At the same time, I broke my leg and hand in a skateboarding accident. I haven't done much (if any) socializing during those lost years of substance abuse. I am limited to a scooter to get around, and will have to get quite a bit of physical therapy to get my leg in good shape. 

&amp;#x200B;

Naturally, I've been gruesomely lonely. All my roommates have been gone for a while, I can not drive, campus is empty, and my family lives a while away. I really want to make new friends again, and I would love to go on a date; but it just doesn't seem possible with my mobility. For the first time in a while, I am clear-headed, and am motivated to meet people. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question: How do I keep myself occupied, sane, and happy while I'm healing? I can't just walk outside and go to a bar (I don't even drink). I don't have any friends to take me anywhere. I've never been this alone in my life, and can't think of much to stimulate my mind without becoming repetitive. This is Mordor; this is hell. Any help would be extremely appreciated, and I will be grateful for any advice.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you.",17May2019,0
236,"I took a seasonal job with a reputable company in the Alaskan back country. I talked it up so much, posted about it on social media, everyone was super proud of me for taking this huge step. 

Well, it didn't work out. They didn't think I was cut out for it after a week of being there. Honestly I wasn't mentally prepared enough for it. 

Within two days I've already found another job (that's better pay) in a different part of the state and I am starting next week. This will be better for me all around. 

I feel shame. Like I let people down who were rooting for me. I know I don't owe anyone an explanation but I sort of do... I mean I gave people me address to write me and stuff.

Every time my bank statement comes in for the month and I see small purchases like McDonald's or coffee or really anything, even if it's a necessity (groceries) I cry. It feels like even if I had $1,000,000 saved, I would still feel equally crushed about spending money.

-been friends for 6 years. We were the type of friends that would have deep talks, share secrets, etc. 

-i started to notice that she'd only hang out with me when none of her other friends were available. Or would only talk to me when her other friends were busy. 

-would hit me up to hang out, but wouldn't even answer me ""yes"" or ""no"" when i was the one to initiate. Or would say we can hang out and pull a no-show last minute without warning (i.e doesnt say shes not coming). 

-when we both moved away from our hometown, i tried to keep in touch, put in some effort to show i still cared about our friendship, etc. she didn't reciprocate the effort. 

-continuing with the previous point; she would say she ""misses"" me, but would make no effort to contact/see me. I took these as empty words and as her attempt to manipulate me; she knows I'm a bit of a pushover. 

-my sister planned a surprise birthday party for me and invited her personally (not one of those generic facebook event mass invites). Didn't even respond. I was crushed. 

-i'd be the only person to call out her nonsense and tell her the truth. She'd get upset with me. 

-The worst offense: she's getting married soon and invited me to her bridal shower but not to her wedding. I didnt know i wasnt going to the wedding until weeks after the shower, when i heard some wedding talk from mutual aquaintances. This deeply offended me because i saw this as a gift grab. At the time of the shower, i was at university, 6 hours away from our hometown. I travelled all the way home (an expensive trip) specifically to honour a friend. I also bought an expensive gift. I feel like my friend used me for gifts and i regret having made the trip. I know if I was in her place, she would've just ignored the invitation. 

I've prepared an entire speech that I'll deliver the next time I have the opportunity. I can't keep hurting myself like this. But again, i'm posting this here because i want to make sure i'm not crazy and that these are valid reasons to officially end the friendship.

241,"Hello. I'll keep this short.

&amp;#x200B;

OPTIONAL description of me

* engineering student
* very good writer (sorry to seem vain. there may be grammatical errors in this post. This is what others have told me.)
* SAT around 1300, so IQ between 100 and 130
* ISTP
* has only ever read Ayn Rand. has other books like War &amp; Peace on bookshelf but has never read them

This year I entered university. Long-story-short, I failed to make any friends. My university is ending in a couple of weeks so it's pointless to try to make friends at this point. Truth be told, I don't think that I'm totally socially inept. It's just that I've gotten used to eating alone, so I don't have a will to eat with others. I'm also jealous that others have friends, while I go to the library and study alone, whilst others can go to parties, drink, etc. In short, i'm a sperg. I don't talk to people for days on end, so I randomly go up to someone and ask them ""do you know where i can get some LSD?"" for the sake of social interaction (I'm serious). I don't know how to talk. I want to be put into the position where I will have to talk. I just read rarely and browse 4chan/porn (It's bad. I know). As zizek said, ""sometimes we need a dictator to break the inertia"" (joke).

I tried joining a couple of clubs and I may have made some acquaintances but I heard that the true way to make friends is through sports. I joined the college republicans, model united nations, an engineering club, a club for my religion, etc. Nothing clicked. I also don't have a hobby, so this would be good. I heard that this is a good way to get a gf.

I know you guys will say: do what hobby you want but the truth is that I don't know which one I want. There are other benefits to a sport other than liking it. Here are the sports that I've been considering and some analysis. It would be nice if you guys could give some further analysis, not necessarily a blunt answer.

Tennis ($40 per year)

* Positives:
   * good diversity regarding men/women
   * people seem pretty cool, not too nerdy
   * price is cheap
   * a lot of exercise
* Negatives
   * tennis seems like a sport that you have to have some amount of skill at before in order to enter. it may be difficult to me as a beginner. they say that no experience is required but in reality some experience would be good

Fencing ($240 per year)

* Positives
   * looks fun, enjoyable
   * lot of exercise
* Negatives
   * number of members is small, so i wouldn't get to make too many friends. i have heard that they do have parties though
   * people in it look somewhat nerdy, mainly males with beards, few girls.
   * pretty expensive. I could probably finance it though by getting a job over the summer
   * does not seem too social (I'm looking for a club where people will invite me to parties afterwards)

Archery ($100 per year)

* Positives
   * looks somewhat fun, not sure exactly, might look boring
   * i once shot three arrows. i think it was fun but it would be embarrassing being bad, as i am
   * there are a lot of people in the club &amp; a lot of girls.
* Negatives
   * not sure how fun it would really be. i wouldn't be getting much exercise because i'd be standing still

Swim (idk the cost but probably not that expensive)

* Positives
   * club seems to be 1/3 men and 2/3rds women. this could be either good or bad. it would be good because i am forced to talk to women more often. it would be bad because i would have to talk to women
   * i took a beginners swimming class before and would say that i was ok but wasn't that good
   * would probably help me get muscles
* Negatives
   * I wear glasses. i would have to take off my glasses and put them on the side of the pool lane in a case. I could get prescription goggles but still, it would be a little bit awkward.
   * i'd also have to strip naked in order to put on my swimming suit
   * most of the guys have speedos. this would be awkward because i have a very hairy chest and legs and don't have that muscular of a chest. when i was working out frequently, i was healthier and slimmer. i still have 4 months to prepare

&amp;#x200B;

In short, this is what I've been thinking: 

If I join swim, I would be putting myself out there. I would have to get naked in order to put on my speedo in the changing room and girls would see me in this apparel. There are a lot of girls in swim. I would probably get used to talking to girls. I might not be able to really connect to the members because so many are girls, but maybe I could make friends and then eventually get a gf.

If I join fencing, I would mainly be talking to guys. There would be parties but they would mainly have guys. I'd probably be better able to relate to the guys because they have slight beards and look nerdy. I've haven't watched much star wars but I'm a nerd.

That is the main difference.",17May2019,1
242,"I'll list out my general circumstances without ranting too much. I'm almost 20 and still trying to find my direction in life. These days it's hard for me to find ways to avoid general burnout. I have a job making $16.50 USD an hour at a call center, but I'm so drained I had to drop down to 18 hours a week. I'm seeking medical help for depression and anxiety. I'm trying to truck through college but I just ended up failing a class. Overall, my circumstances seem pretty piss poor and I'm trying to keep a positive perspective. If I had to conclude, I'd say my job is the reason for my burnout.
So how do I deal with burnout like this? I want to get more hours at work and take more classes to find what I want to do, but I can't find a starting direction. I've thought about getting a new job, but I think I'd punch myself if I threw away a job paying as much as mine does. I don't think switching positions at my job is viable, as I just don't think this company and job format is for me.

Both brothers have mental breakdowns frequently and my younger brother \[YB\] breaks out into shrieking screaming and crying for hours on end over the smallest inconvenience to him (e.g. having to pour his own glass of milk instead of someone else doing it for him). 

Every single day, without fail, he screams an ear-piercing, wailing, sobbing cry. My dad is always at work, so he never is home to help my mom deal with YB.

245,"So I've planned my daily routine this summer and even added a few goals to reach---no problems with that, but my long term goals are always questioned by own self. My mind is just buzzing with questions &amp; what ifs whenever I hear about the schools I'm not going to choose (or for now at least). 

Here's what happened:

I applied for school B, free tuition, passed the exam, but they only aim a certain score (am a few points short) for Interior Design. To make it worse, the slots there are on a first-come-first-served basis, BUT arranged by score (technically not so much fcfs). So i probably won't get into that. I've also been previously denied (by my parents) to study multimedia arts in school C because I didn't reach the cut-off for the scholarship (100% tuition). If it isn't obvious yet, we're not really well-off, so getting a scholarship is always a must in my case. 

Now (for the third time *sighs*) I'm looking into school A, where I also qualified for. There's an IT degree there that specializes in digital art. Actually, the MMA degree in school C is similar (in skill &amp; opportunities) to the IT degree in school C, so I thought how could I go wrong?  I never considered the IT field before, but upon doing some research, it seems like a fairly lucrative field and has a wide range of job opportunities. I've planned to take some certifications every summer, so it'd be easier for me to stand out post grad. My dilemma is this:

I've applied for two scholarships (50% &amp; 100%), since school A said that they'll choose whichever is the ""highest"" option. I'm currently waiting for their fateful call. My friend had also applied for the same scholarships (different degree), but even when he was qualified for 100%, they gave him 50% instead. We came from the same school and suspected they're reserving 100% for ones with higher grades so now I'm kinda scared because I've already planned to use the stipend that comes with the 100% on my certifications. If I don't get it, I'll just have to work for 1-2 months this summer and save most of my allowances for my certifications.  

I want to know if I had done things correctly or if I made the best out of the options given to me. If I didn't, what do you think I should do differently? Also, is pursuing design-related IT worth it in the end given my background?

246,"I grew up with a very close friend, Grace; she was my #1 closest friend for almost as long as I can remember. We’ve gone to school together for a large majority of our lives (minus a few years. We are 18/19 yrs old.)  We “friend broke up” in December. She was a real shitty friend to me in the last two years. She would subtly insult me and act like I was stupid and less intelligent than her, she’d flirt with my crush literally in front of me. She gaslit me like no other and I felt like I was going insane thinking that she was doing these things. 

I have this thing where I forget memories that make me upset. Within the last few weeks, I remembered that from around 11 yrs old to 14/15ish, she sexually manipulated me. I was a super naive kid and I still believe the best intentions in people, and that was magnified x100 because I didn’t fucking know what sex really was when I was 11. 

Grace would have me give her massages, pet her hair, and spoon her at sleepovers. She came out to me as bi and then kissed me on NYE. She’d sit on my lap and hold my hand. The biggest thing was that she made me watch porn with her at her house and she would frequently talk about her masturbating habits. I forgot all of this until recently. It got more and more overtly sexual as we got older, which I can recognize now but couldn’t at the time. I don’t think she ever physically touched me but, again, I have trouble remembering. My mom remembers more events than I do. 

I am 100% sure that I identify as asexual because of her. I remember as a kid, experiencing what I now understand to be arousal, and feeling so disgusted with myself and not knowing why. I’d push these feelings down and down and down, but now I can’t feel them about anything or anyone. 

There’s no other way to describe my current state other than “soul crushingly depressed.” My room is a disaster, my hygiene isn’t exactly up to par, I actively avoid school because we have classes together. Plus we have a lot of the same friends. Grace, myself, and a boy named James used to be a trio of best friends. James knows everything that’s happened to me and I know he’s on my side, but he’s extremely conflict avoidant so he acts normal around her and it hurts so bad. I want him to socially reject her or put her on blast or something, anything, but that’s not a fight I want to/ have the emotional energy to have with him. 

I want her to suffer in some way, I want justice to be done somehow. I have such an urge to call up her extremely country, southern father and tell all her secrets (her sexuality and that she’s a witch, primarily.) The vindictive part of me wants to ruin her life and I know that I could. Obviously I’m not going to because I’m not a fucking awful human being. I feel horrible for wanting to do that. I want revenge and I hate myself for it. 

Primarily, I just want to stop. I don’t think I want to kill myself, I just want to stop, I want everything to stop happening. I want to sleep and don’t want to leave my bed. Every time I go outside, I just get hit with this overwhelming “I WANT TO GO HOME” feeling. But then I go home and I’m lonely. I’m so damn lonely, guys. I’ve lost her, I can’t look at James without thinking about her. I’m so angry and sad all the time. I’m on antidepressants and I’m going to weekly therapy, but it’s like all of my progress over the years with depression have just gone down the drain. 

I’m hesitant to even use the words “sexually abused/assaulted.” I don’t know if I’m damaged enough for those terms. My mom wants me to go to a recovery small group, but I can’t imagine sitting in a circle with a bunch of people who have been raped and truly abused and being like yeah I have capital T Trauma™ from a fellow fucking 11-14 yr old who never touched me. 

I broke up with my boyfriend because after realizing that this happened to me, I just don’t have any emotional vacancy left to care for him. I stopped answering his texts or wanting to hang out, not because I didn’t love him but because I was just so exhausted. I don’t have the emotional energy. He understood, but it still hurt him. He still cried, and that made my heart hurt worse. 

I hate her so much but I still love her, and I miss what we had. My therapist asked if I could wave a magic wand and change anything, what it would be, and without hesitation it would be this. What scares me is that if I had to choose, at this point I think I would still choose to fix the relationship over not being sexually manipulated. Idk what that says about me. I know in my head that her leaving my life is 100% the best thing for me but my heart doesn’t agree. We had so many good years and good memories together, and it’s not like it’s totally black and white. She has good qualities. I loved her for so long. Mom says that she never loved me, she just used me for her own sexual experimentation. In my head I get that but again, my heart doesn’t agree.

A few days ago I reached out to a girl named Julie, who had been friends with Grace and I during this time (11-15) because we did Girl Scouts together. She confirmed that I wasn’t going nuts and she remembered events that happened to me that I don’t even remember. I hate that I can’t trust my own account of what happened. It seems like everyone else remembers my abuse better than I do. 

The other day, a group of us went to an amusement park together to celebrate the end of the semester. I accidentally saw my name on Grace’s phone screen (Jesus why do we have to have the same friends and why did I agree to go on this trip?) and it was a text from her mom saying “Have a good time. Ditch (OP) 😂😂😂”

FUCKIN OUCH? Her mom was my second mom for almost my whole ass life! She was my Girl Scout troop leader! Why would she say that? 

I don’t know what to do, or how to move on. I have to see Grace regularly for two more weeks. I don’t know how to get un depressed. I miss her. I miss her family, I miss her dogs. I miss her and my and James’s group chat. I miss having stable mental health.",17May2019,1
247,"Hello, I need to get this off my chest and need advice cause I dont know what to do anymore honestly. So i have this friend who I've been best friends with for just over 7 years. To give some background we met through omegle and have been close friends for a long time(sadly never had met in person though). I love her, with all my will and heart. Because i love her I always want the best for her as she has had a very hard life and is clinically depressed and anxious. 

She has a tendency to want to deal with her problems alone and not fully airring them out to both me or her therapist and this worries me immensely. I worry so much because I'm so scared she do the regretful  things she's done before. I can't even bare the thought of losing her. But It is really starting to weigh on me. Even though I tell her it doesn't. 

The thing is, im a person who always wants to help people and I know how to deal with people with mental health issues as I have personal experience. But at times I feel so out of control with her, like I feel like no matter how hard i try to help her deal with the issue she has at hand it fails on deaf ears. She does try and has come along far from her past self but it still feels like there is no attempt from her to work on the issues she wants to overcome. 

While I understand its hard to do things when everything in your mind is against you, it becomes frustrating when she wont even open up to me so I can try and help her better. I think its because she has a very naive world view and has lived a more sheltered life so I feel like challenges are extra hard for her. I understand that but me and her therapist exist to help her on these things.

To add to that, she is a pretty hidden part of my life so I don't really have anyone to talk to air out my frustration about this so things have started to build up.  Causing me to be pretty cold to her today because I'm so frustrated, so overwhelmed and so powerless. Its starting to weigh on me, and that makes me feel so awful. Like a shitty friend you know? 

Anyways, sorry for my ramble on the situation. To put it bluntly, I need advice on how to deal with these frustrations and/or what tools could I use to help both her and me? What ways can i avoid feeling overwhelmed?

Sorry for the grammar and spelling mistakes, as I'm writing on my phone at 2 in the morning. If you have any questions, ill be happy to expand in the comments.

Thank you so much.",17May2019,1
248,"I'm going to a trial for breach of contract. I think the other company did something illegal (my lawyer and all other lawyers I spoke to agree) and I tried to back out of the contract. The other company refused a reasonable amount of money and sued me instead.. for four times as much as the contract is worth.

I'm thinking about bringing my disabled mom in a wheelchair, who I take care of full time, for potential sympathy from the judge during the trial. Is this just too obviously a ploy for sympathy? What did you think?

249,"So I’m just about to graduate high school and set to attend Emory in the fall and I’ve never felt more lost. I have absolutely no clue what to major in. For most of my friends, they picked that one subject they always got a good grade in. However I never felt good grades have any correlation with what one likes; ultimately merely the incentive of getting into a good college could be enough to study hard/get good grades. 

Now I know I could go to college, explore options and hopefully I would find something I like. However I cannot even narrow it down to what I want to explore? In addition, I need I don’t come from a high-income family and there’s the pressure of not letting my gpa fall in college so I can get a good job soon so idk how much exploring I can do. I feel like another issue I have is when I think about a major- let’s say something in Math- in my mind I can’t conceptualise what job opportunities look like. 

I don’t want to be whatever with this and go w anything. I know I want to make a difference in the world; I always dreamt of having enough influence when I’m nearing forties to solve at least one significant social issue. I know for a job I want something that has a creative side to it rather that being the same cycle. Those close to be think that I should pursue something leaning towards math/finance and/or writing. 

Now for an actual question: what are some kinda quirky but still more serious job opportunities towards either Math or economics or perhaps some completely unrelated major you feel might be a good option? I also like the idea of fashion so what are options towards the business side of that?

If you’ve read this far, I just want to say thank you for hearing me out. I know this entire thing could’ve probably be summed in 4 lines or so but my anxiety has been eating me up and I really can’t look for advice around me because all the adults around me take comfort in knowing that I’m well sorted and clear in my goals. I really don’t know what I even want out of this post but if you’re like me and struggling know that EVERYTHING ALWAYS PASSES. (I’m gonna leave now thank u for bearing w me)",17May2019,1

I could get straight and faster results from the computer but when I write the solutions down, I could take several minutes and I make careless mistakes. I really like this subject called operations research but the problem is I didnt get a good grade. I  really love that subject but the teacher likes everything handwritten and I get mistakes.

251,"Anytime I try to talk about how I feel, I immediately start crying and it lasts for a while. I feel so weak and annoying. I have quite a few things I need to work out. 

I tried to talk to my doctor about it a year or two ago but I didn’t know how to tell her so I told her that I feel super anxious sometimes. I left it at that because I got choked up and wanted to compose myself. She told me that everyone fees that way. I felt discouraged to tell her more.  I felt like she was just treating me as some kid that wants to get high off of whatever she would prescribe me. I was probably 18-19 at the time. 

It was really hard for me to muster up the courage to tell her just that small piece of information. I have a new doctor now and I want to see if I can muster up the strength to get some help. The problem is how do I even bring this up to my doctor? 

I feel uncomfortable telling people how I feel and why I feel the way I do but I really need help at this point. I just don’t know how to get it. 

I’m nervous about making an appointment because at my doctors office, you speak to a nurse about why you’re being seen and then you speak to your doctor. I know if I have to explain myself to the nurse, i’m going to be crying before I even meet with the doctor. that makes me nervous nervous because the nurses can be a little cold sometimes and i find it hard to open up to people. my doctor is very kind though.

252,"This is more so advice for my mother than me. I have a little sister, she turns 17 this month. She is...pretty crazy, to be blunt. She's selfish, very arrogant, egotistical and delusional on how reality is supposed to work. She's extremely rude to put it nicely. I can't quite go into full extent on her personality because I'm not qualified to do that. However, I can give an example from tonight.

My mom is a baker and she has a wedding session tomorrow and we were helping her straighten up the house. My sister had already decided that she was done helping and went to bed. My mom called her back down to remove her junk from the living room. My sister did, but not without screaming at my mom that she was tired and wanted to sleep. Our house has a carpeted staircase that is immediately visible from the front door and I was to vacuum the stairs. To do this, I obviously needed the hallway light on to see. My sister and I have had plenty of previous fights where she wants the light off but I temporarily need it on, so her coming to turn it off wasn't a surprise. There's a switch at the top and bottom of the stairs, and we had a back and forth. Her yelling and cursing at me, me yelling at her to go away so I can vacuum. Sister then walks into my room, and she's destroyed it in a fit of rage before, so I go up the stairs and tell her to get the hell out of my room. When I get upstairs, we have a short argument before she starts getting physical, and now its a fight. Mom is yelling at her to stop and for me to walk away, but I literally can't because at this point, I'm also yelling at her to stop. She has this blank look on her face, like she's not mentally there and my mom comes up to physically separate us. Mom is telling her to stop over and over again, but she's still clinging to and hitting me until Mom gets in between us. My sister then goes into hysterics about how she ""never gets respect in this fucking house"" and she wants to sleep. But it was over. She goes back to her room, screaming at us and I can vacuum in peace.

This is just one examples out of years of hysteria. My sister has been escorted by police out of our house twice and held for observations one time (to my knowledge, I go away for college). My mom has no idea what to do. She feels defeated because she isn't equipped to handle her. My sister has literally tried to kill me before with a hammer, but I shut my door before she could (hammer dents in the door) and i'm the only one she gets this violent with. Is there anything that my mom could do, or get help from somewhere? We live in South Carolina.",17May2019,1

Today my sister told us one of my nieces cousin that is so praised because of her dedication to school and good grades might be pregnant by accident because she took a pregnancy test and by the looks of it she seemed like she enjoyed hearing these news..Now that didn’t bother me ...what bothered me was that my niece told my sister about her cousin taking a pregnancy test, but her cousin trusted her on not to say anything on about taking a pregnancy test but my niece still told my sister about what happened now my sister is going around telling our family and even infront of my aunt who is well known to tell people’s gossip to other people. 


It really amazes because this seems so evil and disgusting, why is it even her business if she’s pregnant or not. And then they began to talk about the cousin on how ugly she was and that she had body of a woman that looked like she got pregnant 10 times because it’s deformed and fat. It literally disgusted me in the way she talked about her that I had to step out of the room because I never knew my sister held so much hate.

I have an older brother who is just getting his butt kicked by life. I feel absolutely horrible for him he's having relationship problems, he can't seem to locate a job even though he is very willing to work it's just circumstances.

He has very bad psoriasis and he's already gone to two different jobs and they could not hire him because of that. He is also diabetic and therefore for some reason that is beyond my knowledge from what he tells me.
He can't seem to be out in the sun too long or else he starts getting nauseous and dizzy and can even black out. And being in South Texas with more intense heat it's even worse.

For the last three to four months he has gone from job to job to job and absolutely no luck.
And I feel for him because the girl he was in a relationship with unfortunately kicked him out because he was not bringing any income and she was getting tired of it on top of I'm getting the devastating news that the girl may give up his and her baby up for adoption which totally devastated him which I totally understand and I feel for him.

So I don't know how to even begin to help him, he may bother me at times but he's my blood and I want to see him succeed just like I have. I would love to try and get him a job where I work but unfortunately they're not hiring for what I do. I have already lending him money and he even is staying back with my mom until he gets back on his feet.

261,"Hi guys. I’m living with my family. I recently have discovered 2 articles of clothing with clean cut holes in them. One is a pair of my underwear with a 1.5 inch hole cut right where my vagina is. The other is one of my shirts with a 4 inch hole cut in the front middle part. These are nearly perfect circles. 

There is a cat in the house who has pika, but she been ruled out as :

1: she isn’t allowed in my room 
2: the holes are cleanly cut, her bites are more jagged and uneven
3: both articles of clothing were tucked away in my drawers before I found them. 
4: she has never bit a hole 4 inches long  in her life, and she is almost 12. It’s too big for her to have made. 




The underwear was one of the pairs I use when I’m on my period, so the cat had no access to them since last time I wore them. The shirt was new and hadn’t been worn before, so it had been in my drawers the whole time.

My parents have been annoyingly strict my whole life. I used to be really scared of their rules but now at this age I find them so ridiculous that I just question/challenge their reasoning behind them. They’ve always been especially strict about me sleeping over anywhere to the point where they won’t let me sleep over at my best friend’s house, who I’ve known for more than a decade and who they consider a literal second daughter. Summer is nearing and I want to relax. This semester was so stressful (that’s what I get for taking 5 classes) to the point where my busy academic schedule didn’t allow me to talk/see my girlfriend many times and it caused a lot of problems between us. So once I’m done with this semester I want to go out with her whenever and sleep over at her house. I would also like to sleep over at my best friend’s house too bc I never got that slumber party experience once growing up. For reference, my gf’s house is a 15 minute drive from my house so I’m not going far (they know her address too). I don’t know how to convince them to let me sleep over at her house and let them know that I just want to sleep with her. Not sex.

I feel stunted maturity-wise in terms of being able to take care of myself without my parents always deciding things for me. What do I do? On many occasions where we’ve had arguments my dad has threatened to throw my cat out (if he does I will literally pack my shit and leave bc that cat means so much to me) and has even threatened to withhold his tax information so I can’t apply for FAFSA next year. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells all the time with them. Any advice or personal experiences with this matter? Also, please don’t tell me to move out. I can’t support myself, not here in LA.

What do I tell people who can’t know I smoke or own a bong? Specifically people at work. It’s a small business so I interact with the owner of the company daily so they’ll want to know and I can’t just dismiss it. It’s pretty specific and glass beakers don’t usuall go into silicone containers.

268,"It's my first time posting something on Reddit so I'm sorry if I do a terrible job at explaining.

My family consists of my parents (D58)(M48), two older siblings, our dog, and I(17). My siblings are much older yet still live at home at the ages of 27(sister) and 24(brother) so my parents have them help with bills. Sounds fine, however recently they've been stacking more and more bills at them to the point where they're having difficulty keeping up. They pay for all if not most of my parents bills including bills of their own meanwhile my parents go out every weekend and spend all their money. They'll go burn through money shopping and buying gifts for our relatives.

The reason why I'm starting to question my parents is that today my parents dropped the bills onto my siblings and my sister immediately started complaining as the electricity bill was way too high for her to pay and asked my mom if she could pay for another bill. They started arguing back and fourth and my mother must of said something to my sister cause I began to hear my sis crying and sobbing. I went to go see what's wrong and got wrapped in between a heated argument between my siblings and parents. My siblings calling her out on how she wastes her money and with my mother shouting at them telling them that they can leave if they don't like it since they dont pay rent  After some more back and forth my siblings yelled and went to their rooms and slammed the door. 

Furious mother began to March to their door to do the usual. Beat them for disrespecting her. As the only calm one I tried stopping my mother and calming her down while she kept trying to push through me and slam into me to move me while trying to clam that I was hitting her and pushing her. Eventually she got passed me and burst through my brother's door. Im still trying to stop her from reaching my brother when eventually she decided to chop down into my arm. I let go immeditatly as I felt her bite into my skin. After I let go she yelled and scolded me telling me how im a disrespectful son and how I deserve the bite mark for hitting her. She stormed right after back to her room with my dad. This isn't the first time there been any argument over the bills, a year ago I called my mom out on it. We argued for hours with her calling me a disrespectful abusive son and with me calling her out on her bullshit and extortion of my siblings. After of arguing came to an end where my dad hit me then threaten me to basically shut up, that I didn't know what I was talking about.

It's because those incidents, I began to look back at my childhood and it was nothing like my all friends .For example we weren't allowed outside at all growing up. We weren't allowed to leave the house whatsoever. We were badly beaten with a bull whip if we acted up or did bad in school. My earliest memories were of me justing sitting in the living room while my dad drank in his room and my mom either neglected me or at work. My parents refused to believe my sis was bi and constantly neglected my brother. My dad pushed me down to ground once when I tried helping him when he was drunk. A few days back my dad tried to kick my dog cause I was cuddling him and they already threaten us saying they get rid of him if he's not constantly locked up. I sawear Not a single day goes by where my parents don't yell or scream at us for something. I spend most nights crying myself to sleep cause I feel like I'm losing my mind with then. I don't even enjoy coming home most days cause I just don't feel safe at all. It's gotten so bad that Ive began to catch myself enjoying the thoughts of hurting them to get back at them for everything.

I'm confused if they are or aren't cause they're not all bad they've looked out for us before but half of the time it's feels like they don't give a shit about us. Like we're just like stock the be milked of money.",17May2019,1

My parents divorced about 6 years ago, my mother a few years ago went through a bout of thyroid cancer and did radiation treatments. She’s still dealing with new health problems, like newly diagnosed sleep apnea etc. Next, she was engaged to another man who she was supposed to marry next month, and she just called off the wedding for some reasons I don’t want to get into, although they were valid. So, things haven’t been peachy for Mom lately. 

My mom has not been stable financially since she divorced my Dad, as she has been with him since she was 16 and never lived on her own. I got her a full time job at my work (I work in a special care home). We have two homes, a front home and a back home. I made it a point to my employer I did not want to work in the same facility as my mom due to conflict of interest from the get go. Slowly, my mother has been coming to my building on her lunch, as she is making friends with some of the co-workers. Today, she called me at 2pm multiple times with urgency as well as texts (I work night shift and was still sleeping). Thinking she’s having a sad moment about her recent situation, I call her immediately. She proceeds to tell me that one of the girls at my facility was upset with something I had written in our communication book and starts the gossip charade. At this point, I am pissed off. At the situation, and because she woke me up to gossip about this. I listened as was kind and said I was going back to bed (I didn’t). With some thought throughout the day, it started to eat at me. It got worse when I came in and my co-worker told me “your mother thinks I am mad at you. She said to the new girl that’s my daughter you’re talking about you know”. My co-worker said she is not mad, and she maybe overreacted, and we together figured out a solution for care.

So later on, after some advice from someone who also knows my mother, and knowing what she has been going through, I approached her with what I needed to say lightly. I told her in a nutshell I would like to keep my personal and work life separate, and that I felt she overstepped a bit today and I don’t want it to interfere with my work life and relationships with my co-workers. Her response was highly emotional and to be honest, a bit insane. She basically told me she doesn’t need the stress right now, that me and her siblings like to prey on the weak, that I’m an uncaring daughter, and she should just quit her job and kill herself, among other things. When I explained to her I care about what she is going through and I have shown that multiple times, and that this has nothing to do with that, she would not listen. She went on so crazy and swearing and accusing so bad, that I ended up losing my cool a little bit. I told her I was tired of her playing the victim card and making everything about herself, and just because things aren’t easy for her right now, doesn’t mean I can’t address something I feel she did wrong to me, however unintended. The conversation never got anywhere, and she even ended up deleting me off of Facebook, which I found extremely childish. The whole reaction was over the top. 

I guess what I’m looking for is some confirmation I approached things correctly. My mother is infamous at playing victim, of always going through something, of not being able to take any “criticism” however small, and impossible to reason with. If she is approached with anything of this nature she reacts this way, whether going through something or not, and makes it about herself and her problems. She will guilt everyone and try to make them feel sorry for HER, or flip out and try to excuse her actions. She has lost close connection with her siblings also because of this. She has also not been financially stable, always asking to come live with me after her guy to guy home to home situation doesn’t work out, and I just feel like I am carrying all the weight of her burdens.

I’m only 29 with my own problems and life, and I can’t handle her dysfunction anymore. She can be a loving mother, and I do love her to bits, but the emotional and financial instability is becoming hard to handle, and the relationship is becoming toxic.",17May2019,1

Tl:Dr: long distance girlfriend wanted to hang out with another guy who was a friend  felt uncomfortable with it she called it off felt bad apologized and thought I was wrong come to find out he's 21 and was gonna hang with her at night also and I want to confront her about this and tell her to stop this ""friendship"" but dunno what to say 

So earlier today my long distance girlfriend who I love and trust asked me a question, would I be okay if she hung out with a guy. I say no I wouldn't becomes a big deal.
I end pushing  ""I'm uncomfortable with that"" and basically being wrong then and it ends with her being irritated with me and ending the date. 

I post on reddit get advice and I apologize that I was wrong and tried to make up with her and tell her how I feel. We talk about why I'm uncomfortable she tells me details about him like 
He works two jobs and can only hang at night
He doesn't have a gf because he doesn't do relationships
And then I go on to trying to be more understanding 

We're like an hour into our convo to when I joked ""oh I was gonna ask your mom for advice honestly"" (because I don't post on reddit and such)
She then replies ""omg good she would've been pissed at me""
I asked why
She says ""oh because I didn't tell her about meeting him and he's 21""
Which then I proceed to think ""wtf my dude"" and tell her why this shit is not okay and then she goes on to say that she knows plenty of girls who know and friends with older guys and  I'm like her parents and I'm lecturing her and she wants to end this convo and go to bed and then we do.

I still want to talk to her about this and tell her to end this relationship she has with him but I have no clue what to say to make this go smoothly. I also got advice to tell her parents for her safety and I want to but I'm a bit scared to as well.",17May2019,1

They were kinda sour and acidic too if this helps, trying to find where I might be able to get  them still or if they went out of production.

282,"First of all, I ""know"" what I said above is wrong. Of course, there's more to life than a partner, we're all whole, complete individuals within ourselves. And we don't need another person to be with to make us whole. But I can't help feeling like it. 

Before going to university, I had felt very lonely and life felt pointless without a partner for about an year. Soon after I started University I met my girlfriend and we stayed together for 1.5 years (lived together the past 8 months). A couple weeks ago we mutually broke up, because of incompatibilities and primarily because of different plans for the future. 

I know break ups hurt but I just keep feeling like there's nothing to life anymore. I'm trying to talk to people, family and trying to do things I enjoy like gaming. But this feeling just keeps creeping up on me. I often find myself wondering about my next partner and how it feels so scary thinking of making myself vulnerable again (I'm not planning on dating anytime soon, but the thought keeps coming to me). I am scared of being as miserable as I was before I met her (things haven't been as bad as that, but I feel like they're going to get there). I often wonder whether she is going through the same sadness I am.

Thing is, I've always hoped of finding a partner I can invest myself in. To really care for the other person without any hesitation, to give in to feeling everything for them. And life seems to be so perfect in that imagination that I end up realising how much this one sucks right now. 

My mind even slips sometimes and I find myself wondering getting back together, but I know that is not going to happen as either her or me isn't going to budge on our long term plans and things were often bad when we were together, with fights and all. So I don't think I really want that either, I think I'm just scared. 

I want to feel complete by myself, I don't want to feel like this anymore. I just want to be happy.

286," I'll try to keep this short and simple. P.S. our country's economy is pretty bad so everytime I talk about money just imagine a 5 to 1 ratio. 10 american dollars is the same buying power as 2 dollars here. also both of us are 16 and we are friends from church, so, we usually just met once a week, just to give some context

&amp;#x200B;

I have a friend (let's call him F), that loves to borrow money from me. not often enough that it annoys me, but enough of a large sum of money to be alarming. he borrows let's say once every 3 weeks or so, but the problem is he borrows close to 7 bucks (35 bucks) each time. for the first few times, I borrowed him the money and the next week he would returned it as promised, the other time he borrowed my money, he only returned half of it. Because he had returned my money before, I shrugged it of and just reminded him. The next week he brought the money, so, it was the end of it. the other other time he borrowed my money the next week he didn't pay me. The following week he still doesn't pay me back. He said along the lines of him needing time. so I gave him time and the day before sunday I texted him to not forget. of course he doesn't bring the money, he said along the lines of forgetting (again) even though I knew he was lying. The most outrageous thing is he had the audacity to say that he needed 3 bucks (15 bucks), are you insane? Of course I declined . but after some pushing, I gave in and handed him the money, only with the condition if he doesn't have my money by next week I would tell his father about this (he is scared of his father). So the following week he brought the money, but only half of it. F said ""look I took this money From my angpao\^look below so please accept this, I brought 10 bucks but I only WANT to give you 5. Is that ok?"". Look even though I could forced him to give me 10 bucks, I still have morals. So, I took 5 and pressured him to give me the remaining next week. Long story short 3 weeks has passed and he would still not give me the money. Anytime, I talked to him about this, he would change the subject. I would tell his father, but, I have no idea how to. If I said the truth I don't want to get him to trouble because frankly, his father didn't teach him how to manage his money properly and if I said it the wrong way, I'm kinda scared F would be in bigger trouble than F shoud've been. Now, He wants to borrow my money again (7 bucks), saying it was urgent. I said no, but, long story short I gave him again.  what should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

\^ = money that you get each year as tradition from the old to the non-married. You only get money from here once usually not more than 100 bucks (I think he only got no more than 40 bucks).

&amp;#x200B;

P.s. He used the money to buy some credit for his mobile carrier, so it is nothing illegal. He, also gets 3 dollars as allowance money every week. While I have to work to have that money. idk his families economic status, so yeah.",17May2019,1
287,"So I’m currently on a trip together with my mother and I in India. We were at a rather fancy restaurant in a mall where my mother asked for the WiFi where we were told that we needed to hand over an ID in order to gain access to their WiFi. My dumb ass decided to hand over my passport without secondary thought, and the server proceeded to take a photo of my passport together with the login details next to it with some random Android phone. 

After finally realizing how sketchy it seemed to hand over my European passport in a totally foreign country like India where they run scams all the time, I began to ask them follow up questions, and was told they need to “send the copies to their general manager” or something along those lines. I raised concern and prompted the server to delete those photos on the Android phone, to which she agreed. However, now I’m still super concerned with regards to identity theft and all that. Is there a “recently deleted” on Android phones, could the photo have been uploaded to the phone’s cloud and be recovered from there, and how concerned should I be with regards to identity theft?

I have tried to talk to her about it through texts, calls and even face to face but she just gives me really vague answers and tells me to forget about it. I suppose she only does this to me because I asked her friends and they thought I was lying or that she was joking because ""she could never do anything like that"".

Today, she spammed me with these texts and immediately blocked me after that. Following are some of her texts:

294,"Hey guys, I’m kind of stuck as to what I should do. I work for a hotel as the Front Office Manager. I have had issues there in the last with an employee that used to be my former boss until I got their position after a voluntary step down on their part. Things weren’t good between us as they tried to control me and had authority issues etc etc. however my superior wouldn’t let me terminate them as they had a lot of knowledge about the system we work on and have been with the company since it was found, so about two years. That isn’t the issue, the employee and I seem to be getting along well for now. The issue is that this employee constantly outshines me and most likely always will since they have been there since the beginning. I have done additional training to try and catch up, but haven’t been to the training the company pays and sends you to like this employee has. That and the general air around the hotel’s employees seems to have started to turn sour. One in regards to me specifically but in the staff towards each other as well.

The same company I work for has another hotel to a different brand. My brand specific training won’t transfer there but the experience has a manager and the experience of doing similar duties will. This hotel is brand new and has only been open for about two months. Coincidentally enough they need a Front Office Manager. There I most likely wouldn’t be outshined, maybe by the guy next door who I have heard crazy good things about but no one on that staff would considering it isn’t even fully staffed at all. 

If I put in a transfer request in it has to go through my manager first instead of the other locations manager. So I would lose out on the training that I have been waiting six months for, training which I could take to different companies as long as that hotel is of the same brand. 

So there are really three options.

1. I wait it out and try to go to the training in June. Hopefully when I come back I can apply to that other position. My boss wouldn’t be happy about it and I wouldn’t know how to explain it to him but whatever.

2. I put in the transfer request but I won’t be able to go to the training.

3. I apply externally without going through the transferring process and hope my resume is reviewed. And while that is taking time to process try to go to the training.

4. I have the manager’s email since we are in the same company, who is hiring for the other Front Office Manager. I could possibly email him, or visit him at the hotel location since it is nearby. I could try to speak with him but he may tell my manager and it might jeopardize the training I want to go to.

Btw the training is paid for by the company along with all the expenses since they have to fly you out for it.",17May2019,1
295,"TL;DR right here because this is long: **I have an apparent dental infection, a swollen face, and two more days to prepare for my kids' birthday party on Sunday. My dentist can't see me until Monday. Am I going to incapacitate myself or end up in the emergency room? What can I do to help myself and not ruin my kids' party?**

Here's what's going on: On Sunday, I got a toothache out of nowhere. It's in my upper jaw, up under my molars, which have crowns (and have undergone root canals, so they have no nerves inside). Every time my teeth made contact on that side, one of the molars felt like it was electrified. First thing on Monday I spent half the day on the phone updating our Medicaid application because for some reason our dental had lapsed. Got it reinstated, but it won't be active until June 1st. The dentist says fine, I can pay out of pocket, but couldn't give me an appointment until this following Monday.

As the days go on, I'm barely able to function, the pain is so bad. As the week progressed it spread and deepened to an overall throbbing on the whole lower left side of my face. My upper jaw, my lower jaw, the teeth, the gums, my cheek, all of it so painful I'm walking around with an ice pack and doing warm salt water rinses every few hours. I've been taking Advil and Tylenol, and some Benzocaine (an over-the-counter topical thing for mouth pain). You have to limit the amount of times you use these things per day, so yesterday I ended up also getting clove oil, diluting it with olive oil, and rubbing that on my gums. Amazingly, it really helped. I've also been hydrating like crazy, taking my multivitamin and a B complex (because apparently that's good for oral health?), and eating only soft foods.

So now it's 4am on Friday morning, and miraculously there's less pain - but my left cheek is visibly swollen. I also have a hoarse voice and cold symptoms, which could mean I finally caught the cold my daughter had last weekend, or could be something more sinister. Do I have a gum infection that led to an infection in my bone? Do I have an abscess hiding in there somewhere? Do I have like, cancer or something? I don't know but I'm wondering what in the hell I'm going to look/feel like on Sunday, because...

My two young kids' birthday party (their birthdays are near each other and they share roughly the same friend group, so we have a joint party for both of them) is on Sunday. My in-laws are coming later today to visit for the weekend. All of our family friends and the kids' schoolmates and their parents, and my family, and my wife's folks of course, are going to be here on Sunday.

As you might imagine, there's been a lot of preparation here. I had to cut the grass, pull up poison ivy (!!!), and clean the house. In the coming days I have to buy and prepare food, bake a cake, do more cleaning, decorate, and be hella social the whole time. I've had very little time to get my work done (I'm a freelancer), and could barely function earlier in the week when the pain was bad but I hadn't yet figured out how to get on top of it.

So now I'm sitting up at 4am wondering: Am I going to look like a monster by Sunday? Am I going to go into septic shock or something? Is the pain going to come back even worse? Will I be able to function or will I be in the ER? Or am I overreacting, and the swelling is going to go down, and everything is going to be fine, and I'll get through this and get some antibiotics on Monday?

Oh, and if anyone has seen my daughter's stuffed puppy toy, let me know where it's hiding. I've turned the house upside down looking for it and it's still missing in action.

Has anyone here experienced similar dental issues? How did it turn out?  Is there anything I can do that I haven't done to help make sure I don't utterly ruin my kids' birthday party that they've been looking forward to for so long?

299,"Obligatory sorry for formatting Im on mobile

I had a friend, ex-friend, if we could even call it that, who was for all intents and purposes, a straight up jerk and boderline abusive. I had given her plenty of chances in the two years we had known eachother, and constantly brushed off red flags because I really did believe we were friends.

I know better now though, and I’ve cut off all contact with her but I’m still bothered by a lot of things to this day. She didn’t start out horrible, in fact our friendship started out pretty great. She made these ‘You’re my least favorite’ sort of jokes and mentioned one way or another how she hated dealing with me but I brushed it off, because we had talked about it prior (I have real bad anxiety with people, she had been doing it for half a year and I finally managed to bring up the topic) and she said that if she didn’t care about me she wouldn’t have bothered me.

Months of being backhandedly insulted, being belittled for all the things that I had liked, and all the hypocrisy (being “punished” so to speak for actively gushing about characters in a series I’d liked wasn’t okay but if any one else - especially she - did it was fair game and even encouraged) made me snap multiple times and every time I was made out to be oversensitive and she was the reasonable authority figure.

Every interaction I’ve had with her has made me feel miserable and while a part of me had known it all this time, I still did try to be nice, until it was just too much, and she bitched at multiple people in our friend group and over time we all slowly broke it off with her.

She’s out of my life, but all the things she’s managed to plant in my mind, how inappropriate I am for showing my passions to others, for how ‘sensitive’ I am, for how I always stepped out of place, and for how desperately I wanted to please her to just be her friend is still there, and I know they’re not right, and that she’s a cunt who takes advantage of other people’s feelings, but it still hurts.

I want to be over her but sometimes I still catch myself stopping in conversation because I’m scared of being the inappropriate monster she painted me out to be. Sometimes I still catch myself wanting her approval. And almost every time I feel so angry, because I had let myself be taken advantage like this..

300,"Hey guys.  


So this isn't as serious as some other posts here but it's something really important to me.  


I turned 21 6 months ago. I always had this idea of 21 being the age of making friends and learning how to be a social adult, but instead it's just a lot of the same.  


  


A bit of context for my life situation. I've been with my now girlfriend for almost 5 years. I love her very very much, but I think the one thing that kind of bitters the punch for me sometimes is thinking of what life would be like if I had a bit more freedom.   


I spent most of last year on an internship on the other side of the country from my girlfriend. While there  I made a TON of friends and would go out all the time. I thought the experience changed me and I'd come back home and be able to do the same. Unfortunately that wasn't the case as I came back home and it was like my life away from here never even happened.  


So basically I'm looking to get back into that.   


My girlfriend has some nice friends and they hang out from time to time but I just want to find people I can party with and include my relationship in. People who I can go to bars and get drunk with.   


I just have a really hard time making friends. People generally like me, and I make good work friends, but I mean I'm here on reddit asking for social advice. Dorky white dude doesn't exactly fit in with that crowd all the time.  


How do you guys suggest I get into that kind of thing? I'm thinking of going to a local concert tomorrow night and trying to meet people. I just don't know how to approach people I guess.  


What do you talk to a stranger about? How do you introduce yourself? How do you approach someone at the bar for a conversation? I know drinking will help for sure.   


Let me know any suggestions!",17May2019,1
302,"I (18M) often received comments about my butt before, usually played as a joke like “Damn dude your pretty thicc”. I usually don’t mind since it’s just a joke, and I’m not actually thicc. I’m a skinny guy so my butt is just very round and prominent. But do people see guys with asses as attractive or at the very least acceptable? I personally don’t see it attractive, it feels very feminine to me, on top of my already slim body type.",17May2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

So, I am in a great, loving relationship. Me (m/31) and my SO (f/26) have been together for over two years now and we have a pretty great life together. We've been living together for a few months now and honestly it's been way easier than I thought it could be. We're easy each other, give each other the space we need and generally don't get into a lot of fights.

&amp;#x200B;

There is, however, one thing that is hard for me to shake, and I hate myself for it. It is a shallow and superficial issue, and I know it is. Still, it's something that has been bugging me for a while and I can't seem to rid myself of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

My gf, overall, has a nice style of clothing, but she really likes old, raggedy T-shirts, preferrably ones she's had for multiple years. I'm don't mean vintage, hip shirts. I'm talking t-shirts with paint and ink on them. T-shirts with multiple holes in them and frayed collars. T-shirts that are so washed out that the print is now an indistinguishable, vague smudge. 

&amp;#x200B;

She has a few of them and absolutely loves them. She'll wear them anywhere, including social gatherings, parties, work situations, etc. She says they make her feel sexy and she feels good wearing them. This is obviously the most important thing there is, clothing-wise, and OBVIOUSLY it's completely up to her what she wears. If her clothes make her feel good, that's fantastic! A lot of people never feel that way and it's a great feeling to have. 

&amp;#x200B;

You've probably guessed that I'm not a big fan of the shirts. Sometimes I even get a little bit embarassed when she wears a beat up t-shirt with a advertisement print on it and we're visiting friends of mine. I know it's a horrible thing to think. 

&amp;#x200B;

She does really care about her looks and I think we both try make an effort to look (and feel) good in what we're wearing, but I feel we have really different concepts of what looks nice. She does tend to care what I think about what she wears and I'm having an increasingly hard time with the question 'How do you think I look?'. Slowly I'm hinting that something a little more 'groomed' would be nice for my taste, but I feel the only result of it is currently that she keeps wearing the t-shirts but feels less good in them. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do, guys? Do I bring it up any further? And if so, how do I approach a conversation like this? I know it's NEVER up to me what she wears and I don't want to make her feel less sexy in clothes she loves, but I also feel that this is something that will keep bugging me, especially if we're having conversations about it?",17May2019,1

Sorry in advance for formatting (I'm on mobile) and for being rambly. This is one of my first few posts and by far my most serious. 


My mom has wanted a dog for about two years now. She was always on our local university's webpage looking through adoption listings because the Animal Health Technology program regularly treated surrendered animals and set them up for adoption after they are rehabilitated and/or recover. The problem is, she would always be looking for big hearding dogs. 
I told her firmly that because we live in a townhouse (in our case: a rented property that is a house split into units with no fenced yard) that if she really wanted a dog that bad, we should be looking for a lazier breed that will be happy being home alone since not only does she work, but she doesn't stay home on weekends, she goes away to her boyfriend's property.

Well, after waiting two years, she finally got a new puppy after a friend of a friend's dog gave birth. The puppy is lovely and sweet, but my problem is this:

Instead of being patient and finding a breed that would fit her lifestyle, she jumped at the chance and now it's a mess and I think the situation is going to end up being cruel to the dog.

The dog is a poodle blue heeler mix. This means she's both extremely intelligent and super active. Remember when I said we don't have a fenced yard? (It's really like a cement patio) You can probably guess from this and the previously mentioned fact that we live in a townhouse that our housing situation is extremely inadequate for a dog, and it is. She used to say that the paths by our house would be good enough, but she hasn't taken her for more than a walk around the block. 

Not only do we not have the housing the dog needs, but my mom doesn't have time to care for the poor thing as is. House breaking is going horribly, and so is any attempts to get her to break her habit of biting and whining. I try to help as much as I can even though I told her multiple times in the first place that we probably shouldn't have a dog and that I don't really want one because it would stress out my cat who really hates other animals. I take her for walks during the day when I remember, but it's admittedly hard since I'm organising to apply back into my next semester of university and trying to find another job while already working one. 

Yesterday I found out that instead of taking the puppy out to her boyfriend's fenced farm property for the weekend where an intelligent, farming mix breed would flourish, she's leaving her at home because her boyfriend has a large aggressive dog that she's scared will hurt the puppy.

Clearly, my mom got this dog assuming me and my brother would take care of it while she's away, and I'm really frustrated because she works full days and is gone from Friday night to Monday, sometimes as long as Wednesday evenings. 
I do what I can, but it's not good enough especially for her particular mix.
My brother tries as well, but he has some mental health issues that get in the way.

I don't know what to do because I dont feel like I shouldn't be responsible for raising this poor puppy because I honestly don't think we're the right fit home for her. I dont know why she'd get a poodle heeler mix given her availability, and our inadequate housing for the dog's needs. 

It really seems like she's trying to dump the responsibility onto me and my brother, since at first she talked about it being 'her dog' but now says she's 'the family dog'. 

I want to talk to my mom about either making the time for the dog, or rehoming her, but she's spent so much money on the dog's food and supplies that I think she'd just get defensive and mad and brush me off. I dont know how to convey that my concerns are not just about me not having the time or not wanting to care for the dog, but go further into thinking it's not okay because we aren't going to be able to provide what this mix needs to be happy and healthy.

Tl;dr - My mom got a dog that we can't care for properly because she isn't even home for it. Shes dumping the responsibility on my brother and I who also have no time and didn't want a dog in the first place. I don't know how to talk to her about rehoming it. Please send advice.",17May2019,3
308,"Okay, I'm a religious person. I have grown up in the church, I have a strong love for Jesus, as does all of my family. Here's the thing, I know that God loves me no matter what. I know that I'm loved and flawed, but in his eyes, although I'm flawed he will never love me less. The same, however, cannot be said for my family. Or at least I think it can't. My mother is the only one I told. She told her mother (my grandmother) and they are both cool with it as long as they still get kids and great grandchildren. But I'm afraid of what my Father, step mother, brother, and that whole side of the family would do if they knew. Would they act differently? Would they try to convince me I am some sort of abomination? My dad often talks about how homosexuality and the gay rights movement makes America more like sodom and gamorra, and how gayness spits in the face of God. My brother throws the word faggot around like it's a greeting and is also very anti-gay. However, when I pray, the answer I get back is usually ""I'd rather you love too much than too little,"" and my very Christian mother said that after I came out it solidified her view she had on homosexuality not being the most wicked of sins and not worthy of being outcasted over. My stepmother is ignorant, but accepting so I dont fear her knowing my sexuality, but if I told her, my dad would know immediately and that's not something I want him to know. How can I deal with this? Do I only date men and ignore it, staying closeted? Do I date but not inform my family? Do I only wait till it gets serious with a girl before being open?

312,"She's a sort of childhood friend of mine since our families are close, even though we couldn't meet for more than once a year.

I like her, but sometimes she's frustrating to deal with. She interrupts A LOT and goes on and on and on with what she has to say without ever giving me a breather to say my own thing. I have to metaphorically fight to get a word in without sounding rude. But I know that she's not doing it to be cruel and has no idea that she's doing anything wrong or rude. What really made me suspect ASD were some other things did. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I think she's obsessed with cleanliness, from washing her hands frequently to always carrying hand-sanitizer, to wiping down the steering wheel of a Learner car every time she goes for a driving lesson. Then again she is a medical student. In a specific ward of the hospital where she learns she always grips the door handles with her sleeve because she swears she always feels a tiny electric shock from them if she grips them with her hands. I haven't felt it. I asked other medical students about this and they haven't felt it, and it's not as if this ward has any X-raying or chemotherapy going on. The one thing that was really a red flag for me was when she said that she didn't even start BABBLING until the age of 4.

&amp;#x200B;

Other than that, she's bisexual and tomboyish in her sense of fashion.

[previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bo9tme/talk_me_out_of_doing_something_dumb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

I ended up putting a letter in the door of main entrance to her building on a piece of paper, as that’s as far as you can get. Problem is as I said in some comments, something like 10-15 people live in the same building and I have no idea if it reached her / even got found considering it is an automatic door. 

Well today I was going through some comments on our unis meme page and noticed the friend she was with last Friday night (99% sure anyhow). Would it be too much to message her just saying something like 
‘I know this is mad, but I’m *me* from last Friday night. I helped you and *your friend* get home safe and then spent some time with *your friend* and am just wondering, if you wouldn’t mind, passing my number along? Thanks either way
*my phone number*’

Should I just let it go and assume the letter was found and ignored or take a final leap of faith? Thoughts? Thanks in advance",17May2019,1
317,"Hi Guys, was an average lurker who's starting to speak a lot, and I was hoping I could get help with my current problems.

I am a 26/m in South Africa and have always wanted to visit another country. I use my paycheck to help support my family, which stopped me from being able to study, but recently learned that it is no longer needed as my family has become mostly self sufficient. 

I am willing to try just about any country and I have work experience in Admin and Merchandising (from HO level to store level) and completed my first year's studies in BCom Industrial Psychology, and I am currently working as a junior merchandiser in JHB.

I am a few weeks away from being retrenched at work as the company is shutting down to create a new one, but I was warned that my position has become obsolete and I need to find employment elsewhere.

I figured that I might be able to go to another country while doing a work/study program which will give me the opportunity to chase my dreams.

Does anyone know how I would be able to apply for these overseas work/study programs?

318,"I'll tell you my story with this girl first.

&amp;#x200B;

I met a girl from Tinder, she asked me if we can go out sometime so I accepted, we met in Barcelona. (30 min from my house)

She is from Vietnam and she's trying to learn spanish in Spain.  

I'm Arab.

As you may think the first date was a bit awkward at the beggining but later it was really good! We were laughing a lot, I even grabbed her hand because she asked me for it and I was really happy, when we were leading to the metro station she asked me to kiss her, i was really surprised because I didn't know how to kiss but I tried my best and she really liked it and told me I kiss really good! (I have big lips so i think that helps). I asked where she lived and she told me she lives in a street 10 mins away from my house, WOW! That's good!

&amp;#x200B;

The day after she asked me to go to her house, and I was really nervous but I accepted and went at the morning, I was still a Semi-Virgin that moment (As it sounds) so i didn't have much experience.

So everything was fine I had protection, I even said her I like her and she also said she likes me so I thought it was some love between us, but little innocent me I didn't know nothing about her feelings..

&amp;#x200B;

She is EVERYDAY calling me to come over her house and be with her.

All day sending me messages to come over or if she can come over my house, even tho I say her I really can't because im busy doing my homework she still insists A LOT to the point where I end up going anyway.

I really like the way she is, like more personally, I just found out I don't like sex that much now.. I just lost my sexual apetite after I met her.

All I can say is that it wasn’t for the sex. There was “something” there, which I handled completely inappropriately. My boyfriend was everything I could have asked for, and my absolute best friend. It baffles me today that I could even dare to do what I did. I had hoped to keep it secret and move on, once it hit me what I had done. However, he found out, and we broke up. He insisted he wanted to keep me in his life “no matter what” and remain friends, but after a few months of trying that he “ghosted “ me. I tried to contact him once after that to say I just wanted my stuff and I would leave him alone, but he didn’t respond... so, I left him alone from then on.
 I was truly remorseful to an extreme extent, and to top it off, he was essentially all I had. My family relationship is abusive/non existent. My friends have almost always been exclusively male, and sort of come and go sometimes, depending on relationship status and who knows what else. The few that were true friends now live very far off since we left college. I'm also pretty shy. My ex just understood me better and was closer to me than anyone else ever has been or maybe will be. It was the greatest mistake of my life. He promised me he always wanted to have me in his life no matter what, so though I was devastated to not be with him, I never expected him to disappear completely. I was blindsided by it, and I never got the closure I needed. I want to thank him for who he was to me. I want to apologize to him, though I know he probably doesn't care or think of it/me anymore. I'm sure he has moved on, but I can't. The guilt and the pain have never left. He has a girlfriend and his own life. I feel like I can't reach out to him, but I also feel that I will never be able to move on if I don't get some things off my chest. It has put me in such a deep depression that I literally have my life on hold in a sense. Five years later, I am only just making some progress as far as my place in life, though slow. This is an unbearable weight for me. 

Can I contact him? How do I go about it? I don't want his girlfriend to think I am disrespecting or disregarding her. I'm not trying to make a move to get back. I have my own relationship.

The next year, me and a few other friends paid for his way up to visit us to stay for a few days. The only problem was I had to work in the evenings so I didn't get to see him that much. 

About one year after that, he met a girl online and moved to Texas to be with her. We had been friends on Facebook, so it was easy to keep in contact until he one day just deactivated his account. I haven't heard from him since early 2013. 

Just out of curiosity, I typed his name randomly on Google and one of those phony sites came up with information about him. I didn't believe it to be true until I typed in my own name. The only thing wrong on it is my email address. 

I'm really contemplating whether I should try the number that was provided and see if it's him. Although if he really cared about me, he'd do what he can to hit me up, but I don't want to think that way. Then again, we're all in our late 20s and a lot of us have moved on, so I definitely understand. I just want to know if anyone else would do something like that. Even if we never see each other again, it'd be nice to talk to him to see how he's doing.",17May2019,1

I’m not even thinking about or crying over anything in particular (that I know of). I don’t know why I’m feeling this way. Just now, another wave it beginning to hit me. Why would this happen??

Long story short, I cannot live in Belgium with him because he cannot provide for me since he’s still a student(in Belgium they request that for the spouse visa). I’ve tried finding a family to do au pair in Belgium for months and no luck. Until I found one and was all excited about it. However, one day they messaged me and told me that their current au pair wanted to stay for longer which means I couldn’t be their au pair anymore. I was devastated and since I couldn’t just sit there and wait, I found a family in Belfast for a month. I came to Belgium with a tourist visa and still trying to find a family here every day. A month after, I find one and they want me as their au pair. Everything was perfectly planned out because since I would leave the Schengen Zone for a month, I’d have enough time for my au pair visa in Belgium to get ready. Then, that family sent me a message and turns out they won’t need me at all. They offered to pay for the tickets I bought to Belfast. But the problem is, I don’t have much time left here and I don’t have enough money to go back to Brazil. I asked them to pay for it and they said that they talked to the au pair website staff and I cannot be an au pair in Belfast because I would need a student visa. However, this family KNEW very well that I was going as a tourist. I texted my mom and asked her to help me pay for it but she kept saying how much of a embarrassment I would be if I came home alone without my husband after she told everyone that I had gotten married so I’m really trying to avoid going there since she clearly cares more about her image than me. I don’t know what to do. My visa expires on June 30 and the family I’m supposed to be an au pair in only wants me in August. I also cannot stay at his house(he lives with his parents), because his parents are clearly sick of me which means I would have to find an Airbnb to stay BUT since he has exams soon, his mom doesn’t want me to stay there with him if that’s what we choose. The place costs a lot for me not to be able to even be with him there. This is insane so please help.

344,"We have been in an online relationship for 2 month and the main problem is how clingy he is

He's a neet, not doing anything his whole day and I have to go to school, leaving him alone for 4 5 hours a day, add to this my hours of sleep (he barely sleeps 4 hours and i sleep for 8-9) and he's missing me for 9-10 hours during weekdays (I spend my whole weekends and breaks with him).

All he wants to do, all day long, is talk to me. He even dropped his only outing which was going basketball just so he can have more time to talk to me. 

He prefers vcing over texting, which i REALLY don't (i hate having to be in call with someone all the time, it's very stressful to me) and wants me to spend all my free time talking to him.

&amp;#x200B;

Now here is the problem : I don't NEED to talk to him 24/7, I don't want to. I have my own hobbies (I like making beats, digital drawing, reading, playing video games, etc..) and I feel like being in this relationship prevents me to invest time in them. If I'm in call, I can't be focused on the other thing I'm doing, so either I don't do anything else, either I lose track of the conversation sometimes and he gets really frustrated. 

We just argued about this and I'm feeling very triggered right now.  He's annoying me and everytime I want to actually do something else than talk to him witout upsetting him I have to fake sleeping or pretend I'm going to school, otherwise he'll either get depressed that I'd rather not talk to him or he'll spam me and make me feel guilty.

I asked her if it was bad that she looked like this family friend and she told me she thought I would say her new hair looked nice rather than that she looked like/reminded me of someone else.

The truth is I just don’t think the new hairstyle suits her and she doesn’t even look like my Mum. Her natural hair colour is dark brown but her hair now has obvious blond streaks and it’s way shorter. She’s never gotten her hair done like this before.

I didn’t go so far as to say I dislike it but when she pressed me I said I preferred her older hairstyle. At first she laughed when I said I thought she looked like this family friend but apparently I took it too far because when I came back upstairs after moving my car, she literally had tears in her eyes and said “you think you’re funny but you’re actually quite mean.” I said I was sorry and I didn’t know she was legitimately upset about it cause she was laughing at the time. She said it was best we just don’t talk about it.

What do I do? Was I supposed to lie and say I loved her new hair even though I really don’t like it and I don’t think it suits her? I can’t believe this actually made her cry.

For context this is someone who choked her dog, tried burning her things, wrapped her up in a blanket and tried to set that on fire as well and broke up with her on ft laughing as she was crying. She told me to mute myself as she made the call 3 way. This part broke my heart as this girl is someone I consider a sister, She basically screamed through her tears that she’s scared of him begging him to leave that there’s nothing for them to talk about especially at 7 in the morning. He kept replying really calm which was fucking creepy tbh but he kept saying call the police if your so scared and to open the door. She kept saying no and I texted her to just ignore him and he’ll eventually get bored and go home. That was when he said to sit on her porch and talk that they’ll be out in public where everyone can see and that he’ll do nothing then he hung up. She said she was really wanted to go and I begged her not to but she just said I’ll call you back and hung up the phone.

After spending 6 years in our house, my wife has decided that she'd like to move closer to her family. I have no issue with this except that this home was supposed to be our ""forever home"". We've put in so much work, most of it DIY, added a new kitchen, bathroom etc. I know you can't predict the future and the move would benefit everyone. 


We've made a bit of equity on the place, but since we had our son, I stepped down to be a stay at home dad and now have nowhere near the same earning potential for a new mortgage. 


The current house we're in, is a tad on the old side and still needs a lot of work, there is constantly things that need doing and with the potential move on the horizon, I've lost all enthusiasm to do it. 


In the meantime, I'm an avid gardener and this year, every single one of my seeds have died. I put so much work into them and twice now they've died in the unseasonable heat. 

And then, yesterday, I get home and find out the bath in the new bathroom is blocked, with absolutely no sign of a clog. Taken the U bend off and snaked it, no sign of any issues, so potentially another bill for a plumber to come and take a look. 


My train of thought is a bit fragmented, I apologize if that shows in my writing.

361,"I need advice, I’ll have to give a backstory so you will understand. So I (16f) am in 10th grade and my school isn’t so great and doesn’t have a good reputation when it comes to the way the students are treated, swearing at them, bullying, physically mean and calling them out about personal shit ect just things teachers don’t need to mention. Well when I was in 8th grade I struggled a lot with depression and suicidal thoughts and I had absolutely no motivation to go to school, I would go maybe once a week every week and I had to FORCE myself to go on that one day because I couldn’t leave my bed. I never got help for this so whenever I did go to school I got a lot of shit from teachers and it was extremely hurtful them making jokes to me about my attendance especially one teacher who I have no respect for anymore because of him being so mean to me over it. Fast forward two years I eventually got myself together and made promises to myself I’d get back in school and go everyday which I did I only ever had a day off if I had to, this was all 9th grade. I’m in 10th grade and I feel scared to ask any questions or talk to any teachers or even miss a day when I have to because it gets thrown in my face that I’m never at school which is a lie I used to not go but I do well now but the comments really hurt and make me feel horrible about myself, here’s some examples. If I ask a question like I did today I always get “well if you showed up to school and stopped having holidays (we go on holiday for 2 weeks once a year) then you’d know the answer” and it hurts because they don’t understand how hard that time was for me and how much I’m trying now but they don’t help they just give me that when I ask a simple question, more examples Is my sibling used to never go to school and they talk shit about them and call them lazy and they take out their attendance on me as well like I’m the one missing school these days. I’m also bad at math and try really hard but they still blame me not coming to school years ago for not understanding a topic or question and it makes me not want to come to school or do any work because they just put me down anyways and no matter how hard I try they’ll always talk down to me like I’m some piece of shit who’s too feral for school, I just want advice because idk what to do to stop this i only want to be able to go to school and do well and have my teachers actually believe in me and help me when I need it not hurt me. Just to clarify I’m not a bad student I think I’m quite respectful and nice to my teachers despite the shit they give me. So what can I do to stop this or make it better?",17May2019,1

367,"I’m writing this post in sort of a fit of rage and don’t really know where to begin.

In short, my sister (youngest of 6 kids 19F) has always been spoilt. My parents never seemed to discipline her the same way we were discipline and as a result she has become entitled, awful and self-centred. It was one of those situations where she would hit and scratch and hurt you multiple times, and you would retaliate once but then get in trouble as you were meant to know better (Although apparently she has never been able to know better).

I’m the middle child (24F) and we are the only girls in the family. I’d always hoped she’d grow out of her ways and we’d become close like my friends sisters had but at this point I don’t even want a relationship with her.

When she was 16, she began self-harming. Now I suffer anxiety (quite severely) myself, so I am not one for minimising mental illness. Her self-harming appears to be attention based and used as a tool of manipulation over my parents. Whenever they would try and discipline her, she would self-harm in what appeared to be an act of defiance.

I was really on her side during this time of her life. I took her to get help, looked out for her, tried to be supportive etc. and she was looking at a road to recovery. She stopped self-harming for a few years.

Then my dad. My dad was diagnosed with cancer and it threw everything off. Shortly afterwards my sister began self-harming again. At first I thought this may be a coping mechanism to deal with the difficult time, but fresh cuts would always seem to appear as my dad was the centre of attention. My dad, on one instance, was going in for really invasive surgery and she visits the hospital, her sleeves rolled up to show off her freshly cut arms and became visibly annoyed no one was paying attention to her.

The last 2 years she has been nothing but awful to me in my attempts to be nice. I have taken her for coffee, driven her to her friends, stayed up and cried with her, held her hand when things were shit. And how does she repay me?

She has always stolen my clothes, expensive make up etc, but she has upgraded to straight up stealing money from me. And usually money I have received in a gift, or special notes of significance. Today I went to go to pay for a hair cut (I had $100 in my wallet) to have it all gone. Now I know I have not spent this money, as I had kept it specifically for this hair cut. 

When I confronted my parents about this, they simply sighed and shrugged as if to say, what can we do? 

I’m asking for advice because I truly don’t know what to do with her anymore. I have skimmed over a lot of her behaviour and our relationship but I honestly cannot stand to be around her. I know she is going through something mentally, but I don’t feel like this should be an excuse to shit all over your sister.

374,"Hey everyone, I don’t really know where to turn to. 
Here’s a little bit of a back story: I come from a family where both of our parents were alcoholics my entire life. My dad was a functioning one where he’d only get drunk once he came home from work, was incredibly emotionally disconnected and flat out a dick. He’d sleep, then the next day get ready for work, work, come home and get wasted. and every day was the same. On weekends he’d start drinking from 12 pm and drink himself into a coma on the couch, 
My mom, as beautiful as she was, she would get wasted and wake up so fucked up to get to work. She was a seamstress, so eventually she quit because I guess it was to much to handle all fucked up. She was amazing but as time went on her alcoholism got the worst of her. By the time I was maybe 11 I learned to pick the locks on the bathroom because she would pass out drunk in there. I used to have to drag her to the shower, bathe her, get her all set for bed and literally drag her into bed. This was my normal weekends until she started getting sick when I was 17. 
We grew up in a home where alcohol was always more important than us. Every weekend my mom would cry, and say sorry and that she would change. It never happened. She got really sick and passed away a few years ago. 
My dad only got sober once he got cancer and realized he couldn’t drink on chemo. He also passed away. 
My older brother had a substance abuse problem since as far back as I could remember. I think he started using drugs at 14/15. Luckily, he has now been 3 years completely sober, and while I’m not religious he has found Christ and is a boxer and he credits staying sober to those two things in his life which he adores. 
My older sister is my rock, my best friend, literally my everything, she has 4 kids who are like my siblings. She is the godmother to my own child, and she is the matriarch of what’s left of our family. She is so wise and beautiful, but now I really fear she’s become an alcoholic. 
I don’t know when this really hit its peak but last summer she had an episode where she was drunk in a bar at 3 am. My nieces were freaking out so I had to drive from a state which is about 45 min close to where they live with my kid in the back as I’m a single parent. On my drive down as cliche as this sounds I saw her getting into a car with some random friends HAMMERED out of her mind. I had to literally shove her inside the car. On the drive to her apartment she tried to grab the steering wheel, she opened the door at a traffic light and rolled out of the car. She slapped me, she tried to spit on me. When I managed to get my nieces to get her upstairs she hit my oldest niece saying that she hates her and regrets having her so young (she was 18) my niece is now 17 and has had a long history of depression, so she took this really personal. 
The next morning she begged all of us to forgive her and it’s like she manipulated us. If we were upset, SHE was mad. 
Well, she promised she would work on the drinking and it isn’t happening. She gets wasted and embarrasses my nieces at social events, she has gone missing for hours on end, she goes out after work with coworkers to bars and while I understand it’s nice to have fun, she’s a mother of 4. 
My youngest niece is now 12, and I’m so sad at the fact she’s now experiencing what I did  as a kid. My sister throws in their faces how OUR parents were ACTUAL alcoholics and how she just enjoys a few drinks every now and then. 
For Mother’s Day I went over to her house, I got a bottle of wine because I’m an idiot apparently, and thought we could relax and have dinner with a nice glass of wine, safe and at home together so she wouldn’t maybe leave because I knew Mother’s Day was going to be hard for her (due to our moms passing) 
She polished off the bottle while I had one glass. She then polished a second bottle off. Then she told me we should order beer. (The fact that she had the liquor stores phone number on her contact list really knocked me the fuck out) I said no, I’m fine I just want to relax and enjoy game of thrones later. She said to me “wow, you know mom would have wanted us to get drunk on Mother’s Day together. You can’t even do it for mom.” Then she got UPSET and was doing her best to try and guilt trip me into drinking. I finally got her to back down when I said fine I’ll have some. I ended up pouring mine down the sink when she wasn’t looking. 
That really hurt me. My mom died when I was 22, and I had to deal with her being an alcoholic alone for the most part since my sister and brother moved out when I was young. 
My niece texted me devastated at 1 am last night, my sister still wasn’t home from work (she left to work at 12 PM) 
I’m tired of seeing my nieces deal with this. I’m tired of dealing with this myself. This brings up a lot of PTSD in me, a lot of wounds I’ve closed, a lot of trauma in my life due to my parents being negligent alcoholics. I’ve since forgiven them and try to respect their memory and do good by their legacy, but her behavior brings up so much in me. 
Seeing my nieces suffering, being manipulated, being gas lighted by their own mother is hurting me. I’ve tried to talk to her about it but she’s so combative, it becomes a huge fight. To the point where my nieces BEG me not to mention anything because if I say “I know you made a scene while drunk again” she reprimands my nieces for saying something. She tells them “you love your aunt more than me.” When she’s drunk and i try to calm her down she says hurtful things like “you think you’re so perfect cause you don’t drink. You’re just as fucked up as I am.” 
I’m so lost. We’ve tried to get her to therapy. We’ve tried approaching her about it. I’m afraid of how this will impact my two youngest nieces. How can I help her, and my family? 

TL;DR: my sister is an alcoholic, and a mother of 4. She refuses to realize she has a problem. How do I help her?",17May2019,1
376,"So my next door neighbor is at war with everyone on our block over parking spots on the street. He has about 5-6 different cars and no job so he spends most of his time blocking out as many spots as he can. Parking like an asshole to take up two spots with one car when ever possible. 
His new thing is waking up at 5am to switch all the cars around since there will be no street traffic to interfere. Unfortunately my bedroom has a window directly facing the driveway side of his house. (We are in LA and the houses are right on top of each other) 
He has an old El Camino that he revs every morning and even blasts exhaust into our room if we have the window open.
I’ve confronted him about it but he’s acted like a stubborn asshole every time - refusing to acknowledge that he’s in the wrong.
Would love to egg his car or something but he has cameras facing every direction and definitely seems like the type to try and sue.
Anything advice on what I can do here?",17May2019,5

Dear all,

I grew up and still am a very beautiful woman with a killer body. I have friends, hobbies and I pursue a career. I am recognized as very intelligent etc. Through the years, I have come to a conclusion that a lot of people can't accept but a lot of nice looking women believe and we discuss regularly. I am a feminist and a fan of body positivity movement. I accept all people as they are etc and believe that everyone can be attractive irrespective of weight etc. However, me and other women have the bad luck to have worked with overweight women or women that have issues with their bodies/ weight. We all have trouble with them. They create a lot of problems to us and to the teams in general. Also, in life, all the gossip, criticism, harassment, betrayals to me at least have come from overweight friends or family members. For example, in my previous work, all the members of the team we were like friends an had good relationship with the boss. Then, woman X came who seemed sweet and was always on a diet and complaining about her body etc. In a matter of time the team was having problems and she was trying to steal project from other girls, snitching to the boss, in generally harassing everyone (mainly the women). In my current work, i had huge trouble with 3 overweight and not that attractive women. One of them was accusing me of wanting to have an affair with her supervisor in order to steal her project (omg!!!). The other was calling me a bitch! One of them told in front of everyone that if the new woman that was coming as a team leader was attractive then she would be called a bitch! Other friends of mine were harassed and bullied by fat female colleagues. A male friend has trouble at work with such a person that she complains to the HR that he is not that friendly with her as to other women colleagues ( she said he doesn't smile to her that often, she is - according to him - alazy person that wants him to do all work for her instead of being taught how to do things and take initiative). My boyfriend complains to me about not getting a job because a friend of us is taking constanly behind my back as a lazy person that doesn;t want to work. I just finished my PhD from a reputable institution, I have 12 years of professional experience working 15 hours per day 7 days a week, I have an IQ over 140, I had a burnout so i want some time off, to network, live a bit of my life with my boyfriend since I didn't see a ray of sun for the last 4 years! She insists to me that I have to find anything - even in a restaurant!!!! otherwise I am lazy! She hasn't worked over 3 years as I see in linkedin, she works as a teacher (very demanding) and claims to be able to do psychotherapy with just a certificate of one year of training!!! Not to mention that she is fat and unattractive! What is this hate of overweight women against all attractive intelligent women? She even hinted that with my breasts i CAN TAKE EVERY JOB I WANT! I am a recognised scientist that conceived and run a lot of projects by myself and never EVER anyone even hinted things like that EXCEPT FAT UGLY WOMEN! I am confused and I don't want them anymore! Anyone with same experienes (that was not an ally of such complexed human beings)? How can one deal woth the complexed bullies?",17May2019,0
378,"Hey reddit!
So i’m moving in a month to a new city. I can’t decide between renting a 750 sq ft 1 bedroom / 1 bath over a 375 sq foot studio.
One is too small but the other is too big.
All my life I’ve lived in big spaces. I’ve never lived in a small place. This will be indianapolis. I’ve always had many (useless possessions lol) Initially I said I’d like to try it to save money on utilities, but now i’m having a bit of a push back.
The pros and cons don’t even help
Studio pro:
-Saves money on utilities. 
- $210 cheaper than apartment
Cons
-tiny
-Windows are too high ( it is located basement level but not all the way down. I’m short so i wouldn’t be able too look out the window)

1bedroom apt:
Pros
- a lot of space
- large windows 
-wood floor
-more space to put shit
Cons
I think it’s too big for 1 person
-the bathroom must be accesses through the bedroom ( not sure if this will matter initially because i dont know anyone in the new city im moving to... so no guests at first)
- utilities might be higher. And an extra $200

I can afford both. My monthly salary is about 3,680. It’s a $2,500 difference a year. I first wanted the studio because of the $2,500 money difference but i’m not even sure if its worth it anymore

What’s your opinion? I’m so indecisively",17May2019,1

I have always gone to this festival for the weekend since I was little, all throughout middle School the fun part about this festival was staying up late on Saturday night and playing truth or dare or whatever. 
This year however, it's changed, one of my best friends and his girlfriend smoked weed this time, it doesn't affect me and it doesn't make me uncomfortable, but just this morning the parents of my best friend sent out an email saying that they did and the other kids may have too. 
My parents think I smoked weed cause they know I am easily influenced. I have stressed that I'm not about that and that it's not something I want to do. I also don't want to throw my other friends who may have done that under the bus when I. Trying to prove to her that I did not. It is stressful

383,"So I used to work for a less-than-reputable retailer. I didn't know how trash the company was until about six months in to my time there, but by then, I had made friends there and I was too good at my job to justify quitting. Anyway, early on there, I worked with a young lady who seemed troubled. She came in to work obviously high, lied to customers to inflate her online sales numbers, and complained about her boyfriend constantly. 

&amp;#x200B;

One day during the summer, I asked her for a ride home, because it was about 120 degrees and I had no car at the time. She said her boyfriend didn't like it when she ""pulled shit like that"" on him. I gave her a weird look, and told her it was no big deal. Then, my coworkers and I started a group text chat to shoot the shit about customers and corporate. I asked her if she wanted to join in, and she again said that her boyfriend wouldn't want her giving her number out to guys, and that she's not allowed to talk to men outside of work. I told her that seemed a bit controlling, and she told me to mind my own business. Fair enough. The next day, she fucked up our truck of freight by getting high and 'forgetting' to work on any of it, leaving me to pick up her slack and fucking over my sales numbers in the process. She was too high to do it, so she handled the customers while I worked on stocking. I told her she needed to get her shit together, and she told me not to worry about it. The day after, I get a call from HR saying that she had accused me of sexual harassment. I asked them if they had looked at the security tapes of our shifts, because if they had, they would see that I never did anything like that. They said that instead of doing that, they would just put us on separate shifts, and I would be written up for misconduct towards a coworker. I told them that I didn't want that going on my file if it couldn't be proven, and then the person I was talking to from HR told me to have a nice day, and hung up. I was never shown any paperwork on the matter, and I never saw her again. 

&amp;#x200B;

So that brings us to last night. I'm working at Target now, and I like it well enough. She came in, and started asking my coworkers for their snapchats and phone numbers. Then she stole someone's phone charger after asking to use it for a bit, and then she shoplifted some stuff. My coworkers described her as ""looking to be in a bad way."" Bad teeth, balding a bit, bruises on her neck and chest, big red bags under her eyes, and busted fingernails. After not getting any numbers or snapchats, she started asking about me. If I was working that night, (I was, but my coworkers covered for me) if I still had a girlfriend, when I was coming in next, and so on. They said she described me down to a 'T'. She remembered my ring, my eye color, my birthmark, a small scar on my hand, everything. She then told them where I lived, what my house looked like, my girlfriend's (now wife's) first and last name, what kind of car she drives, etc. All while stumbling and slurring her words. My coworkers were shocked. According to our security guard, she was soliciting sex to customers, and got into a customer's car after talking with him for a while inside. After we closed, three of my coworkers found me and started telling me what happened. I was mortified because there's no way she should know where I live, anything about my wife, and so on. And how did she remember all those details about what I looked like? I never told her where I lived, my girlfriend's name, or what she drove. The only explanation is that she's stalking me, because I don't have a Facebook.

&amp;#x200B;

So I found a girl online a few weeks ago (in online game), I viewed her profile and I found a link on her social media accounts. I checked her accounts if it was just a dummy and it look like legit to me. After the game I chatted with her asked if her account is legit and she said yes, she even sent me a selfie and a picture of her school ID so it convinced me that she's not an dummy account. We are getting closer day by day sharing common interest, personal matters etc.  I admit i'm not really good chatting with girls and sometimes I don't know what to reply to her because I really have no experience.

I asked my friend I needed some help on chatting because he's really good at it and I really don't have an experience, I showed him some of her photos because he wants to see her.

He has always had a very strong christian view, and I've never gotten into that topic with him because I didn't want to make a rift between our relationship. But one day, I felt I couldn't listen to him harp on about how great a Christian organization was, when I know how this company has actively attacked gay people's rights. So I made that point clear. To which we discussed the morals of the bible, specifically how some of them are archaic. He asked, ""Which ones?"", my example I used was ""Women should be submissive to men."" to which he responded with, ""Yes, Absolutely"". That got me going into the discussion, damn office civilities. I'm pretty sure I didn't get anything through to him, since I asked that he could confirm that he understood where I was coming from, and he couldn't. I left, not wanting to make the discussion worse, but he said, ""We can meet again at a different time to finish this discussion."" but I don't even want to see him again!

So last week we went out for dinner and we started talking about dating and how she dated a guy and it didn't work out and the same thing happened to me recently so we just shared and then she started talking about how she knows no one her age thats single and even if she did she wouldn't want to be friends with them because thats too sad. Then she said all the people from her highschool are married and have kids even the not so attractive ones and why not her and wondering what she did wrong. Then she mentioned how her sisters who are younger than her are married and then she specifically said ""this girl who I used to babysit who's 25 just got engaged and she's basically a child, like how does that even happen"" at that point my face did a ""wtf look"" since im 26 lmao so im sitting there thinking is she saying im a child too, and I think she noticed my look since quickly she said ""im calling her a child because I used to babysit her""

The culture in this country is horrible ( My opinion ) , no appreciation for the sons and daughters dreams ( they are basically the property of the parents ) , no acceptance for any opinion which their religion does not approve of , Pushing the sons and daughters into only 2 majors ( medicine - engineering ) wither they like it or not ( because the money is what the parents want their kids to produce for them later ) , No respect for Women freedom and independence , i can keep talking to tomorrow but let me just tell you that the religious mentality rules everything in this place and you can imagine the rest .

Since i become an atheist ( which is around 2 - 4 years ago ) , I changed my previous major which i was indirectly forced into choosing it , to another major which i love , and of course my mother turned into this untamed monster since i begin to take hold of my life and do what i want .

It become clear for me that she will never change and see the narcissism and ignorance in her behavior because what she is doing is the norm in this country , I begun to see life from a different perspective since my atheism , I know that finding a job may be harder with my new major than the previous one but I don\`t care about money , i don\`t want to be stuck in a job which i hate for the rest of my life , i want to study what i love and pursue my dream .

there are a lot of examples and stories of the mental and emotional abuse she is putting me through , but i cant include them in this post , you just need to know that i disagree with this society principles and my mother is narcissistic and abusive and religious .

the advice which i am asking for is what to do if you was in my situation ? leave the country ( Which is really easier said than done ) ? keep my atheism a secret until what ?!!! 

I don\`t want to live like this and marry a religious person and have their pathetic ""Typical life"" !!!!! 

Going out of the country is risky and life changing and i am afraid of the consequences of that , staying in this country my family would just push me to marry another religious person and i don\`t want that !!! I want to raise my children as free-thinkers and let them choose for them selves ! and this will be impossible if i married a religious person .

409,"What Would You Do?  

      Clicking around on a local garage sale site yesterday when the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. I recognized
(or think I do) a work by a locally famous painter.  It looked so similar to one that I own that I went into my living room
to make sure that mine was still on the wall. My painting was appraised at about $7K.  I inherited it,and it means more
to me as a personal memento than anything.  Some of the artist’s other works go for up to. $20K.  

The guy who is selling his painting is asking $6.  SIX.  Slashed the price because he had no takers at $12.  
I am meeting him later to pick it up.

My first inclination was to buy it, get it home where I could (with an artist friend) get the frame off to verify that
it is an original “Van Hoosits of the Tornado Alley School”  and then get it back to the seller explaining what he had.
.......But......
The kid (seller) is 21 and has been a reeeeeallll asshole to me.  I have already paid for the painting but am now 
less inclined to share what I know, so to speak.

414,"I am wondering how risky this is legally but it could save me $750. Should I do it?

I got pulled over in Nicholasville Ky for expired tags. I looked for my insurance card and the cop said keep looking i'll be back. When he got back I showed it to him and he said I took to long to find it and presented me with a ticket for no reg no insurance. 

Oddly enough I noticed my insurance was due to expire the next day on the photocopy I had. Turns out the insurance lapsed unbeknownst to me a couple of months earlier. I must have not gotten the mail or it was sent to wrong address.

The very next day I got my registration and new insurance. I called the county clerk and they said If I showed them proof of insurance at time of ticket the charges would be dismissed.

I have the proof of insurance photocopy. It says it expires 1 day after the traffic ticket. That's not true I found out it lapsed. Still my card says my insurance was valid.

If I present this photocopy to the clerk and they don't verify it or call the insurance. I just saved myself $750-1000 in penalties and court costs.

If I present it and they make attempts to verify with the insurance company and found out it expired. I could play dumb but if they don't buy it. I then could face a felony and jail time including perjury.

I have no idea if nicholasville clerk verifies this. For all I know they could take the paper, file it, and dismiss the charges.

I am poor but a nice attorney said he would take my case for $100. 

Would you hire the attorney and show up in court showing you purchased insurance the day after and show contrition.

Or

Would you show the clerk your invalid insurance card photocopy hoping she doesn't make verification attempts?

The thing that worries me is in the past whenever I updated my registration I could show them my insurance even if it has expired but the card said it was valid (like in this case). It worked every time.

Now I tried that earlier this year and both times the clerk told me they had to call my insurance to verify. I asked why and they said because now by law they have to verify if it is past 60 days of the effective date the insurance started. I asked why? She said so many people were showing fake or expired insurance that they had to crack down. 

This worries me. Maybe they will do this when I show the insurance card for the ticket? Then If I play dumb they can see I had 3 weeks to think about it and get new insurance. That is not the same as playing dumb to the cop at the traffic stop. Still worth it?",17May2019,1

I’m a guy and am 17, and more recently I have been developing very bad anxiety and its beginning to affect my daily life very much.

I really want to go out and see people because it will really benefit me, but my anxiety holds me back. It feels like I’m trapped in a box and can’t do anything. 

I am in the process if trying to fix the anxiety problem, which I am hopelessly lost with. I’ve told my parents that I feel depressed and they are trying to help me as well. I’ve only formally told my father that I have anxiety, which was hard enough as it was, and I’m unsure if he told the rest of my family members or not. I haven’t admitted to thoughts of suicide to anyone in my family because my brother has had problems with that before, and me admitting to that I feel will just cause more problems than any good. I don’t think I ever really will because my anxiety and the thought of my parents being disappointed or feeling like this is their fault, I can’t have them think that.

429,"Sorry for format to start, im on mobile. 

    Backstory : in early February i caught my wife messaging another guy on facebook talking about her going over there to hang out (clearly as more than friends, i read a few of the messages). She works with this guy, not in the same area but at the same place. She says they only talked for about a week and that nothing but talking ever happened although i have no way to confirm that is the truth.

Its been about 2.5 months now since it happened and i just cant shake this feeling crazy thing. Its driving me nuts. She deleted facebook that day as part of her solution so she hasnt been on it since. Messenger still shows her active sometimes but we all know thats inaccurate. She still has pintrest and snapchat as well, which brings me to my next incident. 

     A couple weeks back we were at a wedding and she gave me her phone to put in my truck (her dress didnt have pockets). I felt a little crazy/nosey about snapchat so i checked it and she had a message/had snapped someone with the same first name and last initial as the guy she had been talking to. I felt my crazy come out and confronted her about it and she showed me the profile which was to somebody she went to highschool with. She claims she had taken a selfie with a friend at the wedding and sent it to a bunch of people she used to be friends with in highschool, including several guys. She says thats normal for small towns but i think its wierd to send selfies to a bunch of guys (im from a bigger city). 

    We have been together for almost 4 years and married for almost a year and up till feb i beleived she would never lie to me. I trusted her completely and i want to trust her again but it seems like every time i turn around i see something that makes me feel nuts. And id just stop looking for things but i also hate feeling like im being made a fool of (my ex cheated too which makes getting over this even harder). Weve talked about how i feel on it when it happened but its to the point that when i bring up me feeling bad she shuts me down and says its me beating a dead horse and that if i trust her i should move on from it.

430,"So for starters, I'm currently 20 years old, have my high school diploma, and two certificates &amp; diplomas from a computer repair and networking class I took at a local technical school. When I was 13, during a basketball game, I suffered from a bulging/herniated disk in my spine, requiring me to have back surgery. The surgery was successful, but ever since I cant stand for very long, walk moderate distances, or really anything too physical in nature without my back hurting.  Because of that, I haven't had an actual job outside of currently helping a family member with their cleaning business. I never really mention my back pain to anyone though because I feel like they'll think I'm using my previous injury as an excuse to be lazy and avoid getting a different job. 


With that being said, I have no idea what to do in life. I'd like something better than my current cleaning job, but there isnt many options around me that are not physical in nature or require college degrees(which I cant afford to take).  I have thought about trying to start my own computer repair business but I dont even know if that would be worth it in my area.

431,"Hi,
So i‘m posting here since i‘m absolutely clueless and I feel like i‘m too stupid to take any decisions. I feel like my life is put on hold and all of my former self is gone.

I always was a good student in uni. I study computer science and I always was interested in it. A lot happened last year. I‘m not gonna put in major details since I don’t want to greet you with a wall of text, but I suffered a major heartbreak from a long relationship, my grandparents both died, I was diagnosed with burn-out and as a consequence failed multiple exams.

So this Semester my parents told me „to get over it“ and instead of listening to my BF who advised me taking a holiday semester and recover, I got guilted that it‘s my laziness who is faulty for my failed exams and the whole burnout thing didn’t even get noticed. So I decided „to get my shit together“ and tried the semester. Now i‘m 1 month prior the exams and I feel like accomplishing nothing.

I can‘t concentrate on anything and the brainfog is real. I‘m absolutely behind on the stuff I take a exam on. I often have days where I can’t really get out of the bed. The only safezone right now is when I play some video games or watch some tv shows at the evening. My BF still tells me to just take a semester off, but i‘m conflicted. I‘m already at the 8th semester and the regular semester count is 6. My parents always make me feel like it’s my fault and I don’t know how to tell them.

I have no idea what to do, please help me with a decision or what is good and wrong.",17May2019,3
432,"Long story short there is about a half chance I receive a caution, maybe just over half. There’s about a half chance or just under that no further action is required and in other terms nothing will go on my record. 

I made a mistake and in trying to do the right thing I committed something against the law. I was in a difficult place and I know it’s not an excuse. My best friend had overdosed recently before it, I’d been suffering with the worst depression of my life, I’d had attempted suicide myself just a few months before it. I was on heavy doses of medication including antidepressants and antipsychotics.  I was isolated, alone and I shared something on social media I did not fully understand to be illegal. This could have been due to the drugs affecting my decision making skills, my concentration etc. Just a quick, without properly thinking click of a button and I’m left with the possibility of a charge on my record. 

I’ve had no prior offences or issues with the police. I’m at a good university and have achieved good grades in all my exams. I feel regret and pain for what I have done, even though it was not meant to cause harm and it’s not like me at all. I could of never imagined myself capable of doing something like it but the ease of internet access and seeing something online that I never intentionally searched for made my brain and decision making skills mess up in some form. And I’ve found online it’s more normal than people would probably think.

433,"Need advice.

I've been together with my partner for 20 years-never married.

He's been unhappy with his job of which he's been there for 15 years. Back in February a headhunter contacted him to interview for a job in the Bay area. He did a phone interview and was one of the leading candidates. After a discussion with me, I shared I didn't have a desire to relocate based one the following reasons 1) I would be giving up my job of which I'm happy with and pays nice. 2) Living in NYC, I have no desire to go from expensive to more expensive. 3) I'm 52 so the idea of starting over doesn't have the same appeal when I was much younger. 4) I have a great community of friends and would basically have to start over. Although I could stay in touch by Facebook and phone- not the same as in-person and my last reason is that,

 I basically gave up my career and community when we first met as like today, he was unhappy with his job and wanted to move to NYC. I was much younger and adventurous and gave up a nice job and a theatre company which was getting a great rep along with a dedicated audience. Although I was able to re-build in NYC, I feel it was easier in my early 30's.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday he discovered the job was re-open and he expressed interest to them. They had the same interest and want to fly us out for a weekend. I have no desire as literally, no slam again the Bay Area, but I've been there many time for work and travel and although it was nice to visit, I don't have the same feeling that I get from living in NYC. As dysfunctional, crazy, crowded and temperamental as this city is, I've made it my home. Also my hesitation is that he struggles with depression and that may be a factor and it's not reassuring that they hired someone and within a few months the same position is now open. 

Looking for advice as I don't want to seem unsupportive. But very open to some other thoughts. Thank you in advance.",17May2019,2

439,"So my SO and I moved in with her cousin back in November. She needed a roommate and we needed a place to move in to as soon as possible.

Now let me get this straight, I like her cousin, she is sweet and for the most part besides what is going to follow I dont have a problem with her. I've had worse roommates and this all boils down to money (for the most part).

The total rent for our place is $1,600 a month. She is only paying $489. I am not sure how my SO allowed this, but she agreed to it, orally. If it were broken down equally, we should each be laying $533.33 a month. My SO said ""its $45, I don't mind"".

We were also supposed to split the Bill's. So far, out of the 6 months we have been here, she has given my SO one payment of $15 for a $90 power bill I'd have to sit down and go through our power Bill's, but at this point she owes us hundreds for the power bill. My SO says she doesn't mind at all, but this isnt right.

The thing that finally broke the camel's back for me, is the internet. The one bill that she is supposed to pay, she has continuously not paid. Every 2 months it has been shutoff for a week because she doesnt have money to pay it. Theres no responsibility. Before we moved in, she told us she was financially stable. She works doing sales for direct TV at Costco, its 100% commission. To me, I wouldn't gamble on that especially if I had all of these Bill's. She should at the very least have a part time job on side so she has guaranteed income.

My job requires me to work from home, ON THE INTERNET. So effectively she has hindered my ability to work due to her inability to be financially responsible.

Also I found out she is lying about how much she pays for internet. She told us she pays $80 a month, but when I was researching adding a new line to the house, theres only one speed available and its $45 a month. So on top of all of this, she's a liar.

She never has any food. For the past 5 days she has been eating cooked hamburger meat with rice. Every week we go out buy a metric shit ton of food. She rarely goes shopping cuz she doesnt have the money. So I am pretty sure they she sneaks food.

So I really do not know what to do here. We are going to get another internet line added to the house so that we dont have to rely on her for internet that she doesn't pay.

  


Am I the asshole here?

My workplace hired a guy about two months ago. He is the son of the lady who is in charge of our paychecks. Since he first started working, he has shown that he is extremely sexual and threatening.

He has shown fetish images that he draws. He has inappropriately touched female coworkers (including myself when he started playing with my hair), he talks about how he has a sexual fetish journal and how he writes about all of the females in the office, he also tries to secretly take photos of all the female coworkers without any of our consent, and he just talks about a lot of weird sexual shit that makes us all uncomfortable. 

He has also expressed that we don’t want to get on his bad side because he can become very violent. If we make him mad or upset, we will regret it. He also talks about how he has a lot of guns in his truck, and he watches us work from outside the building when he is not scheduled to work. He watches us leave work in his truck, and I am afraid he is trying to figure out where we all live. He tries to get us to go places alone with him, but luckily we are all smart and would never be alone with him. He also had said he will show up at my house one day. 

I think he also has a mental problem of some sort. He claims he has alter egos and is constantly talking to himself. 

I have reported him to my boss and so has several other coworkers, but he says he can’t do anything about it because he is a higher ups son. I don’t know what to do because I love and need this job.

I have good reasons for staying (family, friends (including ones moving back), a guaranteed (albeit not one I love) warehouse job I've been at for 3 years), and I don't have the usual reasons FOR moving, like for school or career.

445,"   So I don't really like therapists or trust or believe in them. I don't believe in talking to someone who is paid to listen to you or paid to care. I've come to the conclusion that I'm just miserable and nothing will make me happy. I've been trying to be a lot more positive and a lot less crazy since I got out of the mental health facility (for suicidal behavior) this time so that I can be judged less and people won't think I'm crazy, but I've come to the conclusion that I am crazy, and just a bad person that no one can stay around in my life too long cause of it. 
   I wanted to anonymously ask for help in hopes that someone may understand me.  Just turned 22, and I'm male so I get that  my mental health won't be taken that serious being an adult male but I hope to find someone who can take me serious for ONE TIME IN MY LIFE. I'm a male so I'm not supposed to show my emotions or be sad but I am. I am miserable. I'm taken for granted. I'm unloved. I have nofamily, friends, no actual home BC I've been homeless on and off for a few years now. When I got out of the mental hospital this time around I told myself i would focus on doing better, making friendships/hobbies, and trying to find a job that suits me(I don't work well with others so I try to find a job working alone which seems impossible) and just distracting my mind along with meds that have been prescribed to me. Nothing seems to work. I find myself lonely, and useless. I find myself losing the boy I was growing up as, making goofy faces,lauughing 24/7 and singing and dancing all over the place like a weirdo in my bedroom or mirror XD and just having fun with people and with MYSELF. The happy parts of me I've lost. Now anytime I do anything I enjoy I just hear ""what's the point??"" ""Why are you doing this?"" ""Why do you care?"" And I never have the answers, which results in me stopping, drooping miserably back to my phone, and wallowing in self pity about why everyone hates me and why I'm so alone. Or wishing that I had a family. I used to dream about getting to eat dinner at a dinner table with family  every night or just anything remotely close to being a normal family but instead I have no one. 
  Lately I've had a 'fake being happy mentality' about killing myself. Like act like I'm okay so that the few people i do have in my life won't be concerned or worried that I'm up to something like killing myself. Just chill out for a while and let things be calm. Try and act like I'm doing better and doing okay so tthat I can get myself alone easier without questions being asked or people trying to convince me that I'm worth my life and that ""things will get better"" but we all know that's bullshit. Things just remain exactly the same. 
   So I'm looking for answers before I attempt to do something stupid.... I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT ANSWERS IM LOOKING FOR!!!! I DON'T WANT TO DIE. BUT LIFE DOESN'T SEEM worth living!!! I'm sad all the time. I feel extremely unloved. Everytime I get some confidence or motivation I just remember the talentless styleless ugly slow weirdo I am who is broke and homeless. I'm not even worth a smile at a gas station I'm pathetic.",17May2019,1

448,"I am sixteen years old, female, living with my mom and dad. I don't go to school, but I get most of my work turned in and I do just enough to pass each year. I don't have a job yet, but I plan on getting one I found online that has proven itself legitimate. 

I have tried going to school all the time and it just doesn't work out, it's not who I am even though I am smart and can do all the work given a formula, plot, outline, etc. I tried working at a normal teenage job like at Rita's and it didn't work out for me. (Not sure if you know about mbti personality types but I just recently found out I'm an INTP, if that helps you answer my question.) 

My mom constantly gets on me about missing school and not having a typical job. She will never understand the way I want to live my life. Never. I gave her a million chances. Forgave her in my head a jillion times for the way she jokes about my views. 

What's worse is I even listen to her complaints about her own life. I give her advice and try to help her improve her own goals. Even though I don't agree with the way she lives her life, I still help her. She won't even listen to the way I feel. 

She isn't a terrible mother. She buys me vegan ice cream (the one part of my life she agrees with). Laughs and jokes with me. Takes care of me when I'm sick. Even drives me to school on the days that I do go. 

But she will never agree with the way I see my life going for me. She literally laughs at my plans. This will only hold me back. I need people in my life who will support me, who agree with my views and preferences. 

I am capable of paying for my own cellphone bill, food,   and clothes. I have the mental strength to survive without my mother because I do not let emotions cloud what is logically the better option. I would have no problem cutting her off, but I would love her underneath it all. But love is weakness, everyone knows this. 

My grandma is a lonely and needy woman who would love the idea of me staying with her until I am eighteen and can afford my own apartment. 

If I choose to stay with my grandma, I will cut my mom off from my life entirely. I don't interact with my dad much even though he stays with me, but if he didn't agree with my life he'd have to go too. 

So, should I cut my mother off?",17May2019,1

We go on dates and finally as soon as we are about to be together she does it again. I try to cut her out but he cheats on her and she comes back depressed and suicidal so I stick by her for a bit. After all that we have been incredibly close. Shes driven the hour to see me multiple times and comes to me when things go down. We have a weird partnership and even ended up tripping and having sex. Recently I found out she slept with someone else which is in her right to do but I was hurt stupidly enough. We've been ignoring the fact that we clearly want different things but care a lot about each other. I realized that if one of us gets in a relationship that may change our dynamic or be the end of ignoring the issues. I know there is a lot of bad actions and history in it but things have been great for the last year. I know it sounds stupid but I don't know what we do next.

453,"Hi Reddit, 

I'm at a weird point where after 5 years of marriage my wife decided she wants to have kids. We both agreed before we didn't want them. She changed and I haven't so we have agreed amicably to divorce. She might keep the house she might sell and we will split the money from that, but who knows. 

I have $5000 in savings and the only thing I owe money on is my Jeep. I have a well paying job and 10 years experience in my field. I have slowly been working my way further and further south in hopes to get down to Florida as I very much love the place. I feel like I have an opportunity to just flat out try to find a job and move.

455,"Hello
I'm 23 years old and I'm trying to decide if I should go study and try to get a bachelor's degree or go work in sales in my dad's company.
 I spent my first year after highschool volunteering and three years after in military. (I'm not from America)

I'm really torn because I have no idea what I want to do. All I know is that I should go with what I'm good at and I'm good at talking to people, that's why my dad wants me in sales.

On one hand I don't want to do a degree because I really sucked at tests and learning things that don't interest me in high school. And I hate the fact that I have to go study because society pressures everyone to do so.

On the other hand I'm not sure I want to be dependent on my dad for my success. Of course I will be responsible for myself and my own success in the job but I still feel that since he will be my boss I will be his employee for who knows how long.

For now my dad wants me to commit to at least two years on the job. So if I do decide I wanna study later I'd only be starting my degree at 25.

I'm also frightened of not having a degree or any kind of certificate that would promise me a job if something bad happens in the business one day...

I really want to leave to college but I am afraid that they won't get on their feet and they'll end up homeless again. It would be very hard going to school while my family is homeless, my other family members won't help either so I am stuck with this decision.

When you are reading this bare in mind things are better than perfect now

I was emotionally abusive (had therapy for this) and I didn't realise it, I'd dump my girlfriend a lot. And always immediately jump to tinder or something so it turns break ups into a pathetic game.

Anyway...
So on the particular day that gives me anxiety I told her it wasn't working out in the morning and then later called her to say why I can't be with her and uninvited her to my birthday. 

This was unquestionably a break up. Based on the place we were at in our relationship. 

We both went out and got with other people hours after the phone call.

That night, I kissed someone on my night out and almost went back to theirs for sex. 
My girlfriend had sex with someone.

I'm not bothered that she slept with someone and I didnt, that's ridiculous. 

Anyway fastward a year. Everything is better than it has ever been we literally never argue. But sometimes I get down about our past. I know it sounds ridiculous but the emotional part of me feels cheated on. While the logical side obviously knows the circumstances.

467,"I don’t do so well with physically talking to others when I’m in need of help. I just can’t ever seem to get words out in order to convey the way that I’m feeling. Just typing this on my phone doesn’t feel right and I’m already just internally telling my self to stop trying and ignore it. 
Often times, I’m the one who’s seeks out the negative in things. Not to bring people down but just to point it out and make it known. I usually have an opposition when someone suggests something or shows me anything new. Examples like refusing to see or participate in trending topics; Marvel, New cars, GOT, parties, Twitter, advise from friends and family, new toys or games, foods, fashion trends, Must be the contrarian in me I’m told..
anyways, after 5 years in a solid relationship, I’m getting the hint it’s affecting the ones around me and if I don’t change or do something, I’m gonna loose the little things I do find important. I fight with my self daily on all the wrong things I do, or are done around me and I can’t ever focus on positive outlooks. When i think about ways to correct it, I’m don’t motivate my self to do it, or I just forget until the next time I get upset about something. Then I look back and say “well it’s no ones fault but your own, why this happened.” I feel pretty worthless as a human and my outlook on “the meaning of life”, isn’t the greatest. We’re all just gonna die anyways, and I have no consideration for religion. I feel like I’m just some grumpy old man waiting to go and I’m only 26 dude. I have really good things going for me in life too but I still put my self into this depression about anything. All the new law issues, finical concerns, people from back home who shouldn’t matter, the idea of living when we’re all gonna die, constant murders and hurt that other people go through. I just put it all on me. 
Since I’ve noticed my actions one the ones around me, I’ve been faking excitement a lot more but I know this doesn’t solve problems just covers them up. I tell my partner the way I feel and I’m always getting support when I have an issue but i know I should be the one to make the change. She can’t fix everything for me. 
And to note for safety, I’m not on a suicidal point either because my one self belief is, we die when we die, don’t force it. I just come today to seek out what you find as a joy or happiness and why? Maybe hearing from a stranger a reason to smile, will help crack this stubborn mindset and just get over it man.",17May2019,1

I am a 28y/o female living in Philly, who is tied to gig economy jobs, with a 5 y/o akita/lab mix. My dog is territorial over me, food, our space, etc. It has made finding housing increasingly difficult (in a price range I can afford). I've worked with dog trainers and her main quirk of becoming uncomfortable (then lunging towards people with her teeth out and gnarly bark) in a seemingly relaxed situation has not changed.  She can be social with other dogs, but mostly just outdoors. She loves a few people, like family and a few close friends who she would never lunge at. City noises stress her out, and in the summer sometimes refuses to leave the house when the fireworks don't stop. We've made it work thus far, but we both need more stability. At this point I'm not sure if I can provide that for us in this city anymore.

My friends/community/support network is a big part of my life..and through that web I can probably link with similar people in other areas. I'm quiet but extroverted and seem to meet people fairly easy.

I am a crafty person who likes to pick up new skills and typically work outside, with animals, my hands, tools, bikes, etc.

I don't currently drive but am hoping to be financially capable of that within a year.

The idea of living on a working farm has been floating in my head recently, because thats what we originally did when I adopted my dog as a puppy. Open space and the choice to remove herself from uncomfortable situations works. To live in another city, that isn't as wild as Philadelphia is also an idea. As of now, I have almost no ties, except for personal relationships, but I'm not taking care of myself due to this stress and feeling of being lost and directionless. I am susceptible to drinking away my feelings and going further down that hole. I feel like I'm on the brink of something changing, but I need some help.

471,"I (28F) am a college lecturer.  I have a masters degree in Anthropology, so I’ve been in this field a while.  I love teaching, but it also means I have no free time anymore because it’s so emotionally investing.  If you aren’t thinking about your classes at all hours of the day, you’re honestly seen as a “bad teacher” or someone who isn’t really “invested enough” in teaching.  It’s not an exaggeration...truly, that’s how administrators and departments see you.  If you ask for a day off, you’re guilt-tripped, even in emergency situations (but the students are paying for this and need this class, so you need to get over it and make it work!).  As much as I enjoy teaching, I am so exhausted because my work-life balance is terrible.  I pretty much work every day of the week.  My day pretty much ends up being like this...leave at 7:30 am, teach all day, and get home between 5:00 and 6:30 pm, depending on the day.  Do some class prep and grading until 8:00 pm.  Make dinner and do chores.  Then I’m pretty much relaxing from 9:30 - 10:30.  Then I get up around 8:00 am on Saturday and Sunday and work until 2 pm-ish.  This is a normal week...if I have exams, essays, or it’s the end of the semester, the hours are even longer.  Not to mention, universities want you to attend events and work with other faculty members to promote the department, etc. without getting paid.  And you’re getting tons of emails from students constantly asking for more of YOUR time.

I barely take care of myself or put effort into my appearance anymore because I’m just so tired.  I used to have hobbies, but I don’t do them anymore.  All I really do is watch Netflix because I’m so drained.  And I’m not able to take time off or get breaks (other than winter break).  I at least have some vacation time, but not nearly as much as other people, that’s for sure.  I end up having to use my winter breaks to prepare for classes anyway.  I also don’t have health insurance or benefits.  I have some retirement benefits, but it’s not like I’m getting a decent salary.  

The problem I’m facing is that I’ve moved around between different jobs a lot in my past already.  I had jobs where I only worked a few months and left because I hated it.  These jobs were when I was in undergrad and grad school, so I was in the stage of learning how to function as an adult.  I was looking for jobs on Craigslist and always ended up getting in a shitty position where someone was taking advantage of me.  But I feel like I’d be an asshole if I quit teaching to do something else YET again.  

Not sure what to do and the thought of starting over is terrifying.  I just got married and am at the age where I’m going to be having kids soon.  I have 80k in student loan debt (being a college prof is not going to put a dent into this).  I don’t feel like I can go back to school at this point.  

My dream has been to make my own business, but it’s certainly risky, and I don’t really know if it’s something I should pursue over getting a job somewhere.  I did briefly have an academic services side business where I was making an extra $1000 a month.  I have successfully sold products on Etsy as well, so I’ve done my research when it comes to marketing and running a business.  But it’s a huge risk, and I’d hate to get myself in a worse position.  I also taught SAT/ACT classes as a grad student.  I have thought of making a tutoring business (and its probably a plus that I have experience as a college professor), but I just don’t know if this would be a realistically viable career.

476,"Hey r/advice,

I feel like I'm focusing on/thinking about sex to the point where it may be detracting from other parts of my life. I'm not really sure if this is normal for my age (27 year old dude, for context). I don't really know what to do/if I should do something about it, though.

When I'm home after work I'll usually masturbate once every 45 minutes or once an hour, sometiems more often. I usually also masturbate at least once throughout the day at work.

I'm currently single, but even when I was in what I considered to be the best sexual relationship of my life, I would still often masturbate at work, and I'd be lying to say I've never had urges to cheat for the sake of sexual variety (only ever acted on those once, felt like shit about it, would not repeat)

I'll very rarely (once every 6 months, if that) go to a strip club or something like that, which isn't great for my budget, but I'm in no way breaking the bank (My overhead is really low, and I don't make horrible money)

Anyway, I just feel like if I spent more time working on myself physically/mentally etc., I'd probably be a lot better off than If I spent all that time just essentially satiating myself, could probably also then find a good relationship to help with said urges.

Overall I guess it just feels like I'm wasting my time. I don't know if this is just normal for my age (I honestly feel more sex-focused than I was when I was like 18-19, which I find weird), or what, but yeah. Any advice would be appreciated.",17May2019,7

My mother is a helicopter parent (as a kid, I couldn't go outside to play, couldn't be driven by another kid's parents, couldn't check out library books, all sorts of ridiculous stuff). 

When I graduated college, I immediately moved about a 9 hr drive away, that was 3 years ago or so, and I haven't been home since. We email/talk on the phone. Next month, I'm going back to my home state to see a college friend. In email, I told my parents I would visit them, but now as the date approaches, I called them to discuss our plans, how many days I'd stay with them, etc., and just everything was the same, I could tell my father was shitfaced, belligerently saying he just wants to stay home, doesn't want to go downtown, etc. (he's also kind of a rural xenophobe that thinks cities are full of not white people, therefore dangerous/gross).

And I just don't want to deal with this. I can afford a hotel easily, I don't need their couch, but I also feel like if I renege now, drive 9 hours and don't see them, we'll never have a relationship again, after that disappointment and flakiness. (About 2 weeks til the trip). And I actually kind of want to see my mother. I hated her growing up, but now that I'm older, I wonder if some of her neuroses were a product of my father's unpredictable rage. I liked him growing up because after he would have an episode, the next day he would promise not to do that, buy me toys, etc., and that worked on 8 year old me. I'm a grown up, and I have a car, now, so I can just leave rather than cower from thrown shoes and take it...

...but like now that I think about my parents in a practical sense, I find myself vacillating between anger and tears, and I'm not sure this weekend will go down without an emotional blowup. But also, like, ""I'm never seeing my parents again,"" sounds so dramatic, but I'm not intending to go back to the home state again (as I'm moving probably 24 hrs away next year). 

I don't really know how a stranger can answer this for me, but if anyone farther out from their unhappy childhood can offer some insight, I'd appreciate it. 

Thank you for reading.",17May2019,1

482,"Sorry for the long post,I dont post topics or threads on reddit, but this conundrum is drilling a hole in my brain.  This happened yesterday, process is still ongoing.  Here I go:

&amp;#x200B;

My parents immigrated to Canada way before I was born.  My name is a Muslim name (not one of the common ones) so its not one you would hear everyday in a non muslim country. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I work for an insurance company as a liability adjuster.  The role is to asses our companies exposure when a third party gets injured as a result of our clients negligence or actions.  SPECIFICALLY, I deal with injuries to third parties in automobile accident claims where our clients are at-fault.  Due to the specific set of circumstances that need to happen for me to get a file, it doesnt happen often.  I had a new file and I left a voicemail for our client to call me back and discuss what my role in the claim is.  Then one day, our clients agent (the person that sets up the insurance policy) messaged me to GET (not ask for - that's important) a new adjuster because the client could not understand what I was saying and she already told the client she would get it done.

&amp;#x200B;

Now there are a few things you have to understand:

1) It makes 100% sense the client does not understand me due to the specific nature of my job.  I only left a voicemail so we have yet to have a conversation so I can address their concerns...this is basically the case with every voicemail I end up leaving.

2) we do not change adjusters unless there is a conflict of interest or I royally screwed up.  Period.  And the agent should know that.

&amp;#x200B;

So I tell the agent in many different ways that a new adjuster is not possible but when I do speak to the client, I will take all the time to address their concerns.  She ends up telling me its not the amount of information or the content itself....its my accent they cant understand.

I dont have an accent, like at all.  I have never spoken to this agent in my life and she is based in a different city.  But it upset me because her telling the client she would GET a new adjuster (again,  not the procedure and rarely happens) is validating what the client said. If my name was ""Joe Smith"" it would obviously raise some questions in her head.  But because my name is ""brown muslim guy"" she just assumed that I had an accent and promised the client she would handle it (again, validating what the client said).  I have no anomisty towards the client at all (although I have no idea where an accent came from).  My name is unique (maybe thats why lol), so things happen and clients say things  like ""oh you dont have an accent"" or ""cool, when did you move here?"" and I just brush it aside.   But the agent is a professional and should absolutely know better. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I call her out on it and we go back and forth (professionally).  She basically says she is just reiterating what the client said and she is not versed in my department so what else could she possibly do?  I tell her to maybe call me (about literally anything) and spend 1 second with me on the phone, not make promises like that to the client that she cant keep, or raise the concern with my supervisor (the proper channel) so she could tell you thats not the case.   We go back and forth some more and she asks me again ""well what was I supposed to do?"".   \*\*\*As I am typing out my response (again) she says ""stop, you are harassing me"".  I sent my response (to her question) and then saw she said that.  I said ""I apologize, it was not my intention, I was responding to your question"" and it ended there and I tell my superviser.  Not reading she said ""stop you are harassing me"" before I hit ""enter"" is my stupid mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

My superviser tells me today that this agent is now very upset that I ""harassed"" her (which by definition I did because I responded after she said stop, the problem is our messaging system logs messages and rounds it down a minute so I have no way to prove my response was that fast because its all inside the ""same minute"").  The way the conversation with my superviser is going (and she I know she has my back I dont want this to be about her) is that if I pursue this with HR, the agent will do the same.  If something goes on her record, it will go on mine (for harassment).  My superviser did not outright say this, but I could read between the lines.

&amp;#x200B;

This is absolutely crushing me because I know (in the spirit of my last few messages) I was just responding to her question and I was not harassing her (I also apologized which she didnt do, but that also might have been my mistake), but I cant prove it because she is saying she feels harassed.  I honestly feel she baited me into that and is going to clutch on to that point to the very end (because again, by definition, it is harassment because I responded after she said stop and I have come to terms with it).  She is like a 60 year old lady that works at a small agency with 10 people at most, likely with no ambition to do anything else until she retires.  I am 28 and work at the biggest office in the country and absolutely have ambition beyond my current role.

&amp;#x200B;

If I have to, I really want to take the hit so it gets on her record but logically, it doesn't seem like the smart choice for me.  What do I do?  Ive asked some close friends if I am making a big deal out of this and they say definitely not.  But they are my friends and I trust them, but they simply cant be as objective as internet strangers.

483,"Ever since I turned about 11 or 12, my parents treat me differently. An important thing that I want to add is that my parents do have a history of abusing me/abusing others around me and the cops had to be called one time because my dad tried to beat up a disabled family member. I'm 14 now and we fight like 6 times a day. I can't even look at them, I get so mad. They make me do all of their chores for them which I guess is kind of normal but then they also refuse to do things for me in return. They get so annoyed when they have to feed me or help me with anything so they just end up giving me like two pieces of bread and a few pumpkin seeds as my dinner. I'm not kidding, they actually gave me bread and pumpkin seeds as a meal because they just didn't want to cook for me. We can't even eat dinner together because there have been multiple incidents where I called them out for treating me like I'm less than human and my dad just lashes out, cussing at me, calling me a fucking bitch. He yanks me by my hair and drags me to my room because he ""doesn't want to see me anymore"" and my mom literally does nothing but watch. Sometimes I just skip meals because I know I'll get in a fight with my parents if we're in the same room together.",17May2019,1
484,"Hey there! Im 19F. 
I’m at a bit of a crossroads here that involves my future and both my mental and physical health. 
I have a guaranteed university position for September, as I deferred it to work for this year and save money. It’s my dream college and I got into my dream course.
However, I also need to have surgery on my nose to fix both the function and the appearance. My nose is huge (not an exaggeration). It has a huge twisted bump and the tip droops down as well. It’s so bad that I’ve been severely bullied over it, and I have ZERO confidence/self esteem. It’s so bad that I’m suicidal over it. I would honestly rather be dead than live with this nose forever. Because of a deviated septum, I have constant sinus infections, nose bleeds, sore throats- you name it, I have it. It’s getting to the point where it feels like I’m breathing through a straw filled with sand for nearly the entire year. It’s unbearable.
My problem is, I have gotten a letter from my doctor to send to a private surgeon so I can make a consultation and set up a surgery. I’m also on a public waiting list, but my doctor told me that unless I’m dying (and even if I was, it would be unlikely)- I won’t get an appointment to get my nose done for free on my medical card. (This is Ireland btw!) 
If I get my nose done privately, it could be anywhere up to €10k or even over it.
The amount of money I will be spending on my nose is the same I’ll be spending on my first year of college. I can afford either one or the other. 
It’s either go to college and go through absolute mental and physical torture, or give up that position to get my nose done.
Getting my nose done would make me so so happy and it would improve my quality of life. 
My question is, am I making a mistake if I get my nose done and give up my college position?
If I get my nose done, I will definitely go back to college at 23 as a mature student, but at that point I feel like I will have given up my “college experience” that teenagers/young adults get to enjoy. 
Any advice would be amazing- thank you!",17May2019,2
485,"Hello everyone! I just graduated from college and managed to land a big girl job! That being said, I’m going to move out of my parents house pretty soon and I would love to get a dog since my parents were very against having pets.

My dilemma is that I will be working 8 hours a day for 5 days a week. It would break my heart to leave a doggo alone for that long almost every day. I know many people own dogs and have full time jobs, so I was just wondering how I should go about getting a dog or if I should even get one in the first place. Thanks!",17May2019,0
487,"Hey,

&amp;#x200B;

I recently changed my job. After studying mathematics I worked as a teacher for 4,5 years. I always knew deep down I don't want to be a teacher for a longer period, but I kind of lacked alternatives. I kind of discovered my interest for artificial intelligence and worked in my free time on learning to code and reading into machine learning. That I did in the last 2 years.

For you to understand - I suffer from a ""medium"" depression (doctors statement) since like 12 years or so. I took prozac for 4 years and went to therapy for 5 during that time. It started when I was 19, went through a really bad breakup and moved out to go to university. I felt kind of stupid in university, failed my first classes. Somehow, through medication and therapy, I managed to improve my learning habits and didn't sabotage myself with thoughts. I even graduated with the best grade you can get in germany. I'm telling you that because I kind of feel the same right now, that I sabotage my own thoughts. While I feel like I learned how to deal with myself the new situation kind of is too much for me.

So, fast forward to now. I started a PhD position in engineering with a focus on machine learning I am 6 months in and although it's getting better, I feel so stupid and useless all the time. My boss (the faculty is more like a company) is really sparse with his information towards me. In the beginning I had some tasks (mostly making slides and writing/correcting texts) but right now I feel really lost. My group leader is pretty new himself and told my that I am ""on my own"" when it comes to my thesis after 1 month of being there which totally threw me off balance. 

The tasks I get I finish really fast and, according to the others, at least acceptable since they don't critique my quality. But there is no real positive talk there. It's only men and I feel like everyone wants to be the alpha male, wow, such tough.

So I am falling back to old habits. I read everything about engineering, physics, machine learning, and think: Fuck me, they are all so smart. I will never amount to something like this. They are so good, I am so bad. And the enviroment is perfect for that because no one ever tells me I did something good. And I just feel like I got into that PhD program by sheer luck, I never had any 'real' tasks like really analyzing data because the data is not there yet, so I am kind of ""waiting"" for the engineers. Then again I only did MOOCS and read books and feel like I only know a bit of theory and hate myself for not knowing everything. It's like I want to be smart so badly but something in me yells at me all the time that I am not smart. 

I am thankful for any advice, any suggested books or literature about problems like that.",17May2019,2
488,"Hi, I don’t usually post on here, but I’m completely stuck and don’t know where to go from here. A little backstory, I (20F) moved in with my boyfriend (19M)  a few months ago. I hadn’t had a job set up for when I moved, so I was still making the one hour drive everyday to work. The problem, I was spending nearly as much on gas as I was making. I figured the best solution would be to quit that job and find a new job closer to my new home. I had a very small amount of savings I was living off of and trying to help with the bills where I could. A friend of mine reached out and offered to get me a job at this place she worked part time at. She warned me it wasn’t the best but we both knew I needed the money, and so I sent in an application. I got the job and almost immediately started seeing problems. I’ve been there for a month and a half and have only made $140. I’m barely scheduled (10-15 hours every week or two tops) despite her asking for my FULL availability and often end up not even having to go into my shifts because she pulls me off the schedule last minute. Within a week of me getting hired there I received a call from my boss asking me to go to a corporate training program for a week in another state. Eager to try something new and excited at the opportunity to maybe really get somewhere with this job I said yes. She didn’t have any information other than what days I’d be gone. I was wary about that, but since it was a month away I figured she’d have more info closer to the trip. Fast forward to now 2 days until I fly out. She is just now getting me the information on where I’m staying, where I’m flying to ,and what all is happening. Also, come to find out I won’t even be getting paid for this training, and she also doesn’t have me even scheduled to work for two weeks after the trip. I absolutely cannot afford to go if I’m not being paid. The plane tickets are non-refundable, and she keeps sending texts about how she expects us to “be invested in this company for the long haul” and how “we need to be EXTREMELY reliable and devoted to her.” It doesn’t help we’ve had 3 people in the last week quit, so she’s on edge. I’m so close to quitting and telling her I can’t go on this trip because I just cannot afford it. I don’t know the repercussions of telling her I can’t go this close to the flight, and I truly can’t afford to not have a job right now. Do I go on this trip and just hope for the best, or do I tell her I can’t do this anymore and face the repercussions then find something else ASAP? 

Thankfully my boyfriend has been incredibly generous this entire time. He’s been patient and willing to work with me, but I can tell his patience is wearing thin. I’ve put him in a very tough financial position because I can’t afford to pay my half of everything. He already works very long hours and it’s hard physical labor. The last thing I want to do is add more stress for him. This job is putting a huge financial stress on my relationship, my living situation, and just myself in general. If I don’t get this fixed by the end of this month I lose everything. I recently got invited to do an interview for a seasonal position somewhere else, and I’m planning on going to that. I will continue to search for more jobs. In the meantime, is there anything I can do to make this easier on the both of us?

TL:DR 
I’m stuck in a job that barely pays me and I’m struggling to make my bills. I may get kicked out and lose my relationship because of it. Was misinformed about a job and a work trip that I won’t be paid for. I fly out in two days with barely any information on where I’m going and I can’t afford to not be paid. Want to quit and tell her I can’t go anymore but scared of the repercussions so close to the fly out date. Go on the trip and hope for the best, or gtfo and find another job ASAP?",17May2019,2

I also have a really big tongue (I can even lick my elbow) and it feels like it's always too close to the extraction site.

I just feel SO uncomfortable all the time and I feel like I need to try to constantly distract myself. I'm also in college studying biomedical engineering and it's so difficult to focus with all this annoying mouth stuff.

• She hangs around with bad people. Some of people she has hung out with have done illegal things, and one specific time she was so scared she called her mother crying that she wanted to go home. I’ve asked her why she went out with these people and she says her friends forced her into it 

• She has questioned her sexuality and told me she was bisexual, but recently she told me that now she only likes girls. There’s nothing wrong with that but I’m kind of confused, she doesn’t seem sure herself a lot of the time.

• She seems depressed and always puts things on social media, like 'no one cares till your dead'. It’s scaring me because I don’t know if she’s depressed, or just acting that way because some people think it’s a 'trend'

• She tells me all the time that she has no friends, although she has more than I do and many people want to be her friend.

503,"     Right now I live with my oldest sister (21 years old, we'll call her S) and my niece (now almost a year old :)). They're both my best friends and i love them so much, so that relationship is absolutely wonderful. 
But then there's the rest of the family.
S and I were raised with our sister (18, we'll call her B), but since I was unplanned and born prematurely I was treated not the best. 
B and I were very close as children, and we shared a room, since we were very close in age. S, being older, always spent time with her friends playing softball and just fucking around. Every night was awful. My parents would fight (not always getting physical for the first few years, but my father would mentally and verbally abuse my mother and I). 
One night was bad, I got locked in the basement. Now we were working on the basement at this time and everyone knew I had a fear of the basement. B let me out, and when we made our way back to our (shared) bed, she asked if i wanted to see something cool. She had found out earlier that day what masturbating was, and neither of us truly know that it was bad, but when she started putting her hands down my pajamas I KNOW i said 'no' because i felt afraid. But this continued for years. Escalating to the point where she had stuck something inside me and when i was crying about it being stuck she ran and i went to my mother who brushed it off. (If i ever had my child come to me with something INSIDE THEIR BODY, i would NOT brush it off as a ""normal 6 year old thing)((this all started when i was FIVE--- ending at 11 years old)) 
    My mother had caught B taking my underwear off one night and the next day after a shopping trip, B told me that if I EVER ssaid anything about what she was doing she'd tell our parents that it was my idea and that I (a now 8 year old, with her JUST turning 10) would be sent to jail. I felt afraid. (((thinking back on it, my mother knew something was going on, you dont tell your kids ""sex is for adults"" or ask one of them to please not tell their teachers what was going on))) 
    S and I grew very distant, there was an incident where she shoved a bed frame against me and it crushed me, and i know she still suffers from guilt due to that (and guilt thinking that she could've stopped all the abuse given). 
   We all moved out of our fathers home, lived in a 250$ a month apartment in a run down area, where I proceeded to get an opiate and drinking addiction at the ripe age of 13. One of these nights I drank an entire bottle if fireball and was carried out of the School (yes, school) bathroom to my best friends house where i told about the abuse. All. Of. It. 
    The school police officer talked to me the next day, making sure my mother and sister didnt know i had told, but that CPS would soon be involved. I was scared, 13, and felt alone until my best friend and her mom let me stay over every day for weeks. My mother didnt care (she only cared about B), S had moved out at 17. 
  The moment CPS was involved my mother told me to be quiet about the situation ""they will charge your sister and both of you will be in trouble"", telling me what i had done was horrible, that ME, I, would be the one getting charged. 
     A few days later, B's best friend came up to me saying I was a liar. That she had been through what im faking and that ""you dont just tell someone."" Right you are, B's friend, but what did YOU JUST do? I spent the nect nearly year being told i was a liar, that i was faking it, that i didnt matter.
    I felt trapped now. Alone. Even more alone. I turned 14 alone, my mother and B had gone out for dinner, and when they got back they had found S crying hysterically over me because (ding ding, opiates) i wasnt breathing. 
   I spent only days in the psychiatric wing, because my best friend, S, told me that everything would be okay, that she was going to get me through life to the point where I'd be happy. She cried. We both cried. She opened up to me about the abuse from someone she babysat for, and told me she wish she had stopped our sister from doing the things she did. 
   My mother said it was for attention, that she'd rather i 'have cancer and suffer'. 
   I struggle now, i dont open up about things because im genuinely afraid that I'll get in trouble for it. I dont let people touch me, but go through extremely horrible hyper-sexual phases that leave me confused and hurt. I have a horrible drinking problem (yes i know- its bad, but I'm getting help thanks to S). 
    I have so much anger and resentment built up for my family, mainly because they didnt believe me, and HAD they taken action as a kid maybe i wouldnt feel as bad as i do now?

    But part of me wants to reestablish (and fix) a relationship with my family. I want to be able to maybe learn to trust people in general but have NO CLUE on how to do this. How am I supposed to build a relationship again so that my kids can have some sort of ties to them? Is it bad that i have the feelings i do? Does anyone have any advice on how to fix all of this before its too far into life TO fix it?

504,"Ive been in pretty much the same position for the past three years, well since graduating high school. I'm almost 21 now and still feel the same way as I did when I was 17, feeling completely lost and confused on what I'm going to do with my life. I tried community college and dropped twice, pretty much completed my general courses but just don't know what to actually major in, or if its even worth it. I was studying IT and have a lot of knowledge about the subject, but I found it so boring and just uninteresting that I couldn't see myself doing it as a job. The only other thing I've been doing is working, I've had a ton of jobs in the past three years and have had a fair share of working my ass off, but I know I can't work crappy, labor intensive jobs forever. So I need to figure something out, but I don't know what to do",17May2019,1
505,"Backstory: My brother and I grew up privileged. I'm talking white, suburban neighborhood, with two working, well-to-do parents. Growing up, we were taught that if we didn't 'win' something (like a scholarship, college admission, a promotion, etc.) it was because of affirmative action. So essentially, the colored folk will always undermine the white folk. ""The system is rigged against the white people"". 

Why don't I agree with this ideology, especially considering our identical upbringings? Well, I have always been the black sheep of the family, so it makes sense that I rejected these ideas. My own personal struggles with finances, relationships, and mental illnesses (anxiety &amp; depression), has made me compassionate for all people with all struggles in all situations and environments. My brother, on the other hand, has no sympathy for anyone else. If you're poor, it's because you're lazy. If you're overweight or underweight, it's because you're lazy. Everyone's problems are their own faults, and people with problems are inferior. 

Recently, my brother was kicked out of nursing school. He was accused of being on uppers (he was), and having inferiority issues (because his superiors were women, who are also lesser than him). So getting kicked out of nursing school has become a huge conspiracy. The system was rigged against him because he's a privileged white male, and the system strives to undermine the white male. So now his life mission is to educated the public on the suppression of the white male and to reinstate the white male's elevated position within society. His life's purpose is to eliminate diversity (because diversity is the root of all the white man's problems) and establish the white race as the superior race. He idolizes Hitler. He celebrates his birthday, frequently recites his 14-word creed, and considers Hitler's death to be THE greatest tragedy in human history. Oh yeah, and he denies the Holocaust. It was made up by the Jews. For some reason, he ESPECIALLY hates Jews, more than any other race/ethnicity.

It gets worse. Remember the New Zealand shooter, who shot up mosques? Well that guy has become his hero. He talks him up like he's a saint. Whatever song he was playing in the car when we driving from mosque to mosque, has become my brother's favorite song, ""it just gets me so pumped up"". My brother talks about wanting to shoot people, even his friends. His friends have stopped associating with him, because he's angry and obsessive. (side note, I've brought this up to my family, and everyone has taken action to lock up their guns, and keep the keys in a safe-deposit box at the bank). It's still fucking worrisome. Do I REALLY think that he'll hurt someone, no. But when you hear about people shooting mosques/synagogues/churches/schools, everyone is surprised because they 'never expected that they could do something like that'.

So I'm at a loss. Nothing I say or do sways his opinions. He's obsessive. He spends every waking moment researching shit to validate his opinions. I've tried to get him to focus his time &amp; attention of hobbies, TV shows, novels, physical activities, to no avail. I've tried asking my family to talk some sense into him. I've begged him to see a counselor, but ""a counselor is only going to tell me that my ideas are wrong"". He refuses to do anything to change his beliefs, or become educated on the counter-argument. I want him to be committed somewhere to get a psych evaluation, but he would never consent to that. 

He's extremely angry at the world for conspiring to throw him out of nursing school. He obsesses over how he'll get his revenge. He seriously believes that the white race is superior and is going extinct. He's literally losing his mind. I'm worried about my brother. I'm worried about his white supremacist ideologies, his anger, his lack of friends, and his fixation with revenge. 

What can I do? How can I help him?",17May2019,1

511,"My Mom is a very honest person. I know that. If someone is cute she’ll say they’re cute and if they’re not she will say so. My favourite bands, she comments on their appearances, “he’s cute, he’s got a nice smile, “ etc etc.

She used to call me pretty ALL the time. She called me other things - smart, determined, etc etc. But pretty was something she wanted me to know that I was.

Now the only thing I recall her saying about my appearance is that I was ‘fine looking’ (and not as in ‘ooooh he fiiine’ as in that’s fine, like that’s okay, basically she called me okay looking), that my boobs were bigger than hers now (which they’re not, I practically pass as male based off my chest and she does not), that I have a very very round face and that I am dead white, and look like ‘the moon.’ 

I also used to get catcalled at school. I don’t anymore. I’m only fourteen, I was getting called pretty and being catcalled less than a year ago.

I have body dysmorphia thanks to my Mom, she would always tell me that I’m not skinny and the year after she would look at pictures of me the previous year and go, “awww look at how skinny you were!!” She’d always comment on skinny girls, Taylor swift and such, and go, “god, wouldn’t you kill to look like her?” I remember being ten and wanting to lose weight so bad. I used to think I wouldn’t have to worry about gaining weight during puberty because I was so fat anyway. 

Basically my mom raised me to think that skinny was good, and I wasn’t skinny. I might have been a fat ass bitch but I was still pretty. Now I’m fucking neither and I am really sad over it all. 

My mom is a recovered anorexic btw. I’m not anorexic but my body issues make life shitty and I know, when I have kids, I am not going to talk about weight to them.

512,"My buddy is worried about a traffic ticket and trying to get out of paying it. What should he do?

Posting for a friend. He got pulled over and didn't present his insurance quick enough so the cop wrote him for no insurance, no registration. Turns out although his insurance card said it was still valid it had in fact lapsed.

He said he was thinking about showing a photocopy of the insurance card which shows it valid at the clerks office to get the ticket dismissed alltogether.

I was thinking in the past this tactic worked but thought they could check nowadays. The reason I thought is this same clerk said she needed to check my insurance with my company once when I was updating my car reg. Something about laws requiring if its 60 days past the effective date. Anyway maybe they would check and he'd get in trouble.

If he gets a lawyers and goes to court he will probably owe lawyer a couple hundred, court costs, and maybe a $500 fine. He also got a no insurance charge 3 years ago it could be problematic.

Yeah he was irresponsible for this but he had some money problems no excuse though.

513,"I'm in the last year of high school and I'm studying for the final exams.
These exams consist in 3 'trials':
• A literature essay (I got 13 out of 20 during the simulation). This is definitely the subject where I'm weaker.
• A '2nd trial' made of 2 technical subjects (I got 18 out of 20 during the simulation)
• An interview with questions about those 3 subjects (literature + the 2 technical subjects), plus another technical subject, Maths and English (I live in a non-english country).

There are two people who have expressed interest in the two rooms, they have asked if they can move in on the 24th and both share the free room until the other one becomes available, I agreed to this before learning that the current tenant for that room has recently begun searching for a job.

It takes loads of work off of HR and allows people the freedom to take off, whenever, for how long they need. Supposed to be the BIGGEST perk of working here.

Well, recently, one of my coworkers started complaining that they never take off and haven't taken a day off in months while these new workers are coming in and using up the PTO policy, up to 10 days at a time. She doesn't complain to a manager but she pouts and complains to all of us at work.

Moved into a Condominium two weeks ago on the other side of town, household of 3

528,"My life feels empty. I'm really unhappy with how it went and how it goes. I used to have a friend with which I could talk about everything, but he was murdered by his ex-boyfriend a few months ago and now I'm keeping it all in my head and my heart.

I'm gay. I try to hide it as much as I can. I came out only to some close people and my mother, although sometimes it feels like many people expect me to be. These closed people used to by close, but I alienated myself from them over time...

I'm gay... and I hate it. Not because I have anything against homosexuality, but because it means a different life. Where I live its still an issue if you are gay, so its not something that many gays are open about. Sometimes I have to lie, avoid answers or just go with a talk as if i wasnt gay.

I've had these thoughts from time to time, but recently they invade my brain everyday. I work with many people, and so many of them are in happy, heterosexual relationships or have family. And as the time goes (I'm 27) it is becoming something that I would really like to achieve but I can't. I won't have a family. I won't have a wife and children. People around are talking about their wives, their kids, something that was forever taken from me because I am who I am.

My family and childhood weren't great. Ever since I've found out that the man I thought was my dad really isnt and that my parents divorced soon after my birth, I kind of moved away from my family emotionally. I think I was 10 when i found out? My secret of being gay also helped that. And even though I confessed it before my mother years ago and she kind of accepted it, I know she's disapointed in me. And the rest of family might suspect something considering the fact ive never had a girlfriend.

Throughout the years (or maybe I always was) I grew up to being kind of introvert. It's weird because I avoid contact with people, but when I'm finally with them I really enjoy their company. Recently I've had a business trip with my coworker and our boss, and even though I felt really depressed about that fact before we set off, it came out to be great experience. I've enjoyed their company so much and now, back at home, I'm rethinking everything about it and longing for these moments...

I'm lone and I feel alone. I've been through two relationships with men, one ended up with him cheating on me, the other with him losing any interest in me. I wasnt with anyone ever since. I'm not even sure if I know how to love anymore. I dont think I'm ugly, although I'm not a god either, I have an account on some gay dating site and in app, but rarely anyone contacts me. But my fault is not leaving home besides working... I dont remember having so many thoughts about family when I was in a relationship, and now after 5 years of loneliness... I dont even know what I want anymore? I want to be happy... I want to be important for someone, to be loved. I think spending so much of my time with hetero people only made me realize what I won't be able to get. Family. Home. Someone or something that I can announce to the whole world how im happy with them.

I feel like my mental is going worse and worse. I feel lonely, but Im avoiding people. I want to be happy the way other people around me are happy, but its not possible... what's the point of my life really? What will be the point in 20 years?

There is also a thing about my job. I've got an offer to advance and work in another location. It not big-deal advancement, but there at least is. I accepted it and will move to the new location soon, but now, after the business trip I have doubts. I dont think it was the right decision. I already started to miss my coworkers even though I didnt leave yet. Im literally crying when I think I wont be working with them anymore. And the thing is, they are nothing more than just coworkers. While we have good contact at work, there's nothing else besides that. I think my loneliness made it so even coworkers are a big deal for me. And now, when I should be happy about the advancement, I'm depressed about it.

Thankfully I dont have suicidal thoughts... although sometimes I wonder what would it be like if something accidental happened to me and I died. Im mentally exhausted and i lack the strength to move, to change my life in some way. It's just work then sitting alone in my room. Sometimes im praying for someone to appear in my life and help me change it, but it wont happen because of the way my life is now, and it became an endless loop. And throughout my life not many people cared about me...

I honestly have no idea what to do... with myself, with my life... has anyone ever had such problem? Is it petty? Am i blowing it out of proportion? I dont know. I have noone to talk about it, I dont have friends whom I can trust. Not anymore. The years pass, and im still the same useless person.",17May2019,1

530,"So I’ll try and sum up my life in a couple paragraphs but it will be a bit long. 

This post was triggered during a lunch I had with my mom and twin earlier today. My mom called me out for having no friends, and my brother called me out for having no job or money. Then my mom thanked us both for coming out to lunch with her, and then corrected herself and said “sorry, I meant to only thank dean (he’s my brother) since he’s the only one chipping in to pay for it”. I felt like crying but I just nervously smiled and brushed it off until I got home.

I’m 18 and graduated last year (decided to take a gap year). I have 0 friends, yes I said 0, and haven’t in a few years. I rarely even leave my house anymore. I’m not overtly ugly, or weird, or creepy to talk to but I have EXTREME social anxiety.

Back in middle school I was friends with everyone. Then towards the end of middle school to the beginning if high school something happened. It’s like all of a sudden I became socially awkward and petrified of social interaction. I narrowed my friend group of about 50 to around 10 (5/6 that I was close with). 

Although I’m not completely sure why, I presume that me being in the closet and being scared to come out and how people would react played a part. This is probably partly due to the stuff my dad would say about homo’s and how I tried to come out to my mom when I was around 10 and she just told me no and gave me a long speech until I gave in, mixed with the shit guys would say in the locker room and the whole negative connotation surrounding gay people amongst young peers.

Anyways, let’s continue my journey through high school. I slowly stopped playing most of the sports I took part in (dropped baseball and soccer in freshman and sophomore year) until only one was left. I also kept shrinking my friend group until after sophomore year when I ghosted all of the friends I had left. Said no to all the invites I got over the summer and avoided them during school. I either ate alone in the quiet hallway meant for studying or didnt eat at all and did work in the school library. I turned them away until they stopped trying to chase after me and be my friend. This was my life all throughout junior and senior year, and up until this point. Anyone who tried to become friends with me I would just push away.

Yes, I know I probably seemed like an asshole to them and it’s not that I didn’t want to be friends - I just dont think I could handle it anymore. I’m incredibly insecure about everything about myself. I would be up until 2 AM trying to plan out conversations I’d have with people the next day because I’d never know what to talk about with anyone so I’d just walk around with them and barely talk. 

I want friends, I really do. I hate being alone and having no one to talk to or hang out with but I get so nervous at the thought of social interaction that I start sweating and feeling light headed. And I’m not going to pity myself because it’s not like no one wanted to be friends with me. Most of the people in my grade tried and wanted to be friends with me.

I also want a job desperately and have been looking for remote ones that I can do online but have come to no avail. I’m too insecure and socially awkward and anxious to approach one in real life.


So now I’m going off to college in August and have orientation in July. I’ve had no friends and barely any social interaction, besides with people I game with online, for 3 years. I dont know how to carry conversations with people I just met and have nothing interesting to talk about since my life has been literally nothing interesting for years now. I still have extreme anxiety and am insecure about being gay, having mild acne and some chipped teeth. 

I dont want to be a loner in college. Idk what to do (therapy isnt an option. My family doesnt have money, doesnt believe in anxiety, and I wouldnt have the courage to even tell them about it without having an anxiety attack).",17May2019,1

The sister deleted comments and the boy posted on his instagram story about the sisters not allowing free speech. During this drama I was watching Netflix with my parents, the only time I saw what was going on was the initial WhatsApps and I also saw my friends story about what she thinks. By the dust settled my friend went on a blocking spree and blocked most people in my grade including me. I really do not know what to do. She helped me through a tough time in my life and I want to help but don’t know how. That boy has made me feel less than human sometimes. Could someone give my advice, I’m really scared I will say the wrong thing to her and lose one of my only friends.",17May2019,1

536,"hey, guys. first off, i mostly want validation that these are normal relationship issues. im 16f and hes 18m, but i drive and work as well as he does. we see eachother often.

getting into it, a few weeks ago i found out he lied about something he had reassured me that he wasn't lying about continuously over the course of a month. he lied to my face, but he said it was because he was basing how i could react off an ex and he knew not to do that now. he's been making up for it and showing nothing's being hid now.

previously he had also said he wouldn't do something... and then he did. he said he did it because someone else said they liked when he did even though he knew it'd make me sad. it was lying because he never informed me he wanted to do that now or anything, he just did it when he said he wouldn't.

he's nice, we've been together for a few months and im starting to see a future with him. other than that i can only think of when he rushed things a little at the beginning - not sexually at all, hes super respectful sexually; and every other way except for the lying. i told him if he lies about anything else I'm leaving, and i mean it.

sometimes he does manipulative things like saying "" this isn't important, only me caring about you is"" and ""you're making me feel terrible [by bringing up me doing ____] like im a bad person"" &amp; ""just leave i know you want to thats why you talk about this""

we've talked about this once before. i think I'm starting to feel a bit of resentment towards him too, sometimes, because of the way he lies and does things like that. i hope positivity here can help that. 

i know these are probably super small issues in comparison to an adult relationship, so I'm asking - is this as minor as it seems from a different prospective ? 

tdlr; boyfriend lied a couple times and comes off as manipulative. are the issues i listed above normal?",17May2019,1
537,"So I’ll try and sum up my life in a couple paragraphs but it will be a bit long. 

This post was triggered during a lunch I had with my mom and twin earlier today. My mom called me out for having no friends, and my brother called me out for having no job or money. Then my mom thanked us both for coming out to lunch with her, and then corrected herself and said “sorry, I meant to only thank dean (he’s my brother) since he’s the only one chipping in to pay for it”. I felt like crying but I just nervously smiled and brushed it off until I got home.

I’m 18 and graduated last year (decided to take a gap year). I have 0 friends, yes I said 0, and haven’t in a few years. I rarely even leave my house anymore. I’m not overtly ugly, or weird, or creepy to talk to but I have EXTREME social anxiety.

Back in middle school I was friends with everyone. Then towards the end of middle school to the beginning if high school something happened. It’s like all of a sudden I became socially awkward and petrified of social interaction. I narrowed my friend group of about 50 to around 10 (5/6 that I was close with). 

Although I’m not completely sure why, I presume that me being in the closet and being scared to come out and how people would react played a part. This is probably partly due to the stuff my dad would say about homo’s and how I tried to come out to my mom when I was around 10 and she just told me no and gave me a long speech until I gave in, mixed with the shit guys would say in the locker room and the whole negative connotation surrounding gay people amongst young peers.

Anyways, let’s continue my journey through high school. I slowly stopped playing most of the sports I took part in (dropped baseball and soccer in freshman and sophomore year) until only one was left. I also kept shrinking my friend group until after sophomore year when I ghosted all of the friends I had left. Said no to all the invites I got over the summer and avoided them during school. I either ate alone in the quiet hallway meant for studying or didnt eat at all and did work in the school library. I turned them away until they stopped trying to chase after me and be my friend. This was my life all throughout junior and senior year, and up until this point. Anyone who tried to become friends with me I would just push away.

Yes, I know I probably seemed like an asshole to them and it’s not that I didn’t want to be friends - I just dont think I could handle it anymore. I’m incredibly insecure about everything about myself. I would be up until 2 AM trying to plan out conversations I’d have with people the next day because I’d never know what to talk about with anyone so I’d just walk around with them and barely talk. 

I want friends, I really do. I hate being alone and having no one to talk to or hang out with but I get so nervous at the thought of social interaction that I start sweating and feeling light headed. And I’m not going to pity myself because it’s not like no one wanted to be friends with me. Most of the people in my grade tried and wanted to be friends with me.

I also want a job desperately and have been looking for remote ones that I can do online but have come to no avail. I’m too insecure and socially awkward and anxious to approach one in real life.


So now I’m going off to college in August and have orientation in July. I’ve had no friends and barely any social interaction, besides with people I game with online, for 3 years. I dont know how to carry conversations with people I just met and have nothing interesting to talk about since my life has been literally nothing interesting for years now. I still have extreme anxiety and am insecure about being gay, having mild acne and some chipped teeth. 

I dont want to be a loner in college. Idk what to do (therapy isnt an option. My family doesnt have money, doesnt believe in anxiety, and I wouldnt have the courage to even tell them about it without having an anxiety attack).",17May2019,1

540,"I had an ex who was crazy abusive, finally after two years I got out. He is getting off easy after having sent me to the hospital twice, he is only getting eight years of probation and some community service. I keep tabs on him because for my own safety I need to know where he is so I can stay far away (we live within 30 miles of each other) 

 Well I now have some friends who work with him and they are unaware that he is my ex. They tell me about this guy they work with who is creepy and makes them uncomfortable by hitting on them constantly. (I had them show me his picture- it’s him) They also told me that a sweet girl of 20 is currently seeing him. 
I’m worried for her because after talking to all his ex’s I’m not the first one he’s hurt physically.  He is scum and more than likely will do it to someone again. 

Would it be petty of me to print his mugshot and his charges and put them on all of the employees cars?? 

I dont want another girl to fall victim to this.  


Notes: No. I don’t stalk him. I am a victim and I get updated by the state when he changes jobs or moves. Also I haven’t told my friends he’s my ex because I’m terrified that he will use them to find me and contact me.",17May2019,1

Whether it’s “tragic” things that have happened in my life, death the loss of pets, failing things like exams, losing friends etc. have never really bothered me. I feel completely numb to most things and my mom has even gone as far as to say things like “I don’t know where I went wrong, OP I loved you so much as a child.” As to say I don’t love anything, which is partly true I have rarely ever truly felt “love” for instance I love my boyfriend and I guess to some extent I love things in my life but I don’t feel it as much as I should. I have felt like this for as long as I can remember and the only feedback I’ve ever gotten was my mother telling me I’m “not normal” or “something isn’t right” is this bad?

546,"Let me explain. I’m 14, Male. And since I was born I have always had a loud voice. It comes from my dad. Acting has always been a big part of my family so we all have a certain stage presence. 

In school, I have always been very curious. I take  all Pre AP classes. When we learn about something new I’m quick to ask questions or say why something doesn’t make sense to me. When I get a question wrong i always want to know why.

This, coupled with my loud voice, makes me come off as argumentative. I’ll get something wrong and I’ll ask why. When they answer and I still don’t understand I’ll ask why. I just want to know how things work, but many people assume that I want to prove everyone wrong.

It isn’t just in school, it’s just as bad with my family. When someone tells me something or asks me to do something i don’t want to do that I don’t have to I also ask, “why?” And they always reply “Because” I ask again and I get in trouble for arguing.

I never, ever, want to come off as mean and disrespectful to my family, or anyone else for that matter. I know I ask a lot of questions. I know I’m loud and I have a strong voice. But that doesn’t mean I’m ever trying to be rude and argumentative. I never want to come off as stubborn or arrogant. And yet people treat me like a jerk. I get picked on, my family yells at me, and every time I tell them that they say that I sound rude because of my “tone.”

I’ve noticed that trying to  make myself sound sincere or calm comes off as fake and forced. I’ve also noticed that people think I’m aggressive even though I’m calm. I’ve tried, but everyone’s perception of my voice and opinions seems to be different from mine. And it hurts. It makes me sad.

Now, all the sudden I have received an offer letter from NYC (which is far away from my location). Now I have a new set of problems, I have to be in the state by the 1st of July, but my employment will not begin for several weeks later.  I need on things such as dealing with my family,  and how to find a place to stay in NYC. I am basically on my own and I am at a loss for ideas, so I am asking others to brain storm. I am afraid the situation might boil down to me running away and leaving a note (which I really don't want to do) but I may have no other choice.

&amp;#x200B;

For context here was the original post,

**Thanks** for everyone for giving their ideas, and to everyone who posted before.

*I am a recent college graduate, I have no car, no credit card. I live in an imposing and unhealthy home situation. I would like to leave.*

*I recently got a job interview at a financial institution fifty miles away. I received much abuse for this alone. I was told frequently 'you will cause me to have a stroke', 'I will die' and expletives I don't want to repeat.*

*Family burst into my room spewing the most toxic rhetoric for almost an hour I was then forbidden from using the only vehicle I could use to go to the interview. It was demanded that I only work within a certain local area, and to not leave. I have been trying to find a way to leave for months.*

*I was forced to say that I would cancel my application, though I have not done so actually, at least not yet.*

*I am not sure if I go to the interview (somehow, likely with Uber) that I will get the job even though I think my chances are likely. There are many unknowns I am facing if I defy my parents' wishes, I don't think in that instance that I would want to return home if I do. I do not know people in the area where the job is that could help me.*

*EDIT: I should point out that if I do go to the interview they will be in a flying rage as they I think I already canceled, I think I would have to leave a note and run out the door. Possibly not come back.*

*One of my associates believes, that I will have to get a full-time job in my present location given the circumstances before I eventually leave, another one of my associates think I should leave as soon as possible no matter the cost.*

*I need honest advice, things to do or consider if I do the interview anyway, or things I can do if I choose to capitulate on this issue.*",17May2019,1

562,"Alright, so currently I am a male high school student in a Middle-Eastern Country, countries here are very strict on mixing between genders, even communicating in any form to a member of the opposite gender is scrutinized. So some backstory, ever since I was in 1st Grade I was a very anti-social kid, I was introverted and had little-to-no friends at any given moment, and the thing is I never liked being alone but I did not have it in me to start making friends and start going out with people, I am not shy, I have no fear of public speaking and have no problem talking to people, just the “making friends” part is what I had a problem with. So earlier this year I started talking an interest in certain extra-circulars, mainly Model UN, this allowed me to meet many new people, including members of the opposite gender, since these things are run by very young open-minded people. So then a few months of these activities allowed me to make some new friends, some of whom are female, mow my parents were happy that I was going out, but they suspected I was hanging out with females, so they confronted me and told me that I can’t hang out with females, thus losing a lot of the friends who I have made and who I have a lot of fun with. So soon I have been invited to hang put with some females and some males, should I risk and have fun, but threaten getting severely punished by my parents, or should I just not go?",17May2019,0
563,"My girlfriend [19F] went to Europe for the summer and I [21M] haven’t seen her since the end of the semester about a month ago. She’s a terrible texter so before the end of the semester we agreed to pause our relationship over the summer (basically an open relationship) but I did hope we would keep in touch a bit over the summer as our plan is to be together again in the fall when school resumes. 

Basically, I hear from her so rarely that it feels almost like we broke up already and now I’m missing her less each day. If we had actually broken up then getting over her would be a good thing, but since I want to reunite in the fall, I am worried I’ll be  completely over her by then and not able to make myself like her again when I see her. 

Does anyone have experience with this? One friend told me not to worry because all my feelings will come rushing back as soon as I see her but another friend said probably not.

She doesn’t have great WiFi or connection but she posts on Instagram a fair bit and I think she has connection more than she tells me

I’m pretty sure she does actually like me. It would be a lot to explain why but let’s just assume that’s not the problem.

564,"So yesterday I went to Black Angus to take advantage of the $10 lunch coupon. I didn’t want to go to a steakhouse and just order a burger so I ordered the Steak sandwich. I thought it would be nice to have something different with onions and blue cheese. 

Unfortunately when I first into the sandwich, the blue cheese hit me immediately with a super pungent taste and almost made me gag. I thought the blue cheese would be a lot less strong like the dressing. 

Having work in customer service I didn’t want to be a burdensome customer so I scraped off the cheese and doused it in steak sauce. It was still good, but I was disappointed in my mistake.

so today after being stuck in a room alone and silent for testing the first half of the day, I had some time to think. I started getting scared that my boyfriend didn’t love me anymore, because since I have anxiety, I always think of the worst outcome of everything. After we were released for lunch, I was in the midst of a mental breakdown, I said some shitty stupid things I didn’t mean in my hysteria. (like legit, I said to his face, “did Thanos snap away your emotions or something?” I’m an idiot) and then I had 6th period to think on what I’d done. I wrote him a rather frantic apology letter, and after a gruesome 50 minutes of being lost in my thoughts, I went up to him in the halls on the verge of tears. he couldn’t hardly look me in the eye. I started streaming out a string of “I’m sorry”s and handed him the letter. He cut me off by saying, “it’s okay, we’re just friends anyway.” and I felt my heart drop to the floor. My body temperature lowered a good 5 degrees. “W-what did you say? that’s not even true though, haha,” and he just replied “you know what I said.” and sped off. I was in a daze and I walked to 7th period. Took 10 minutes of being sad and frozen to think of this subreddit and come load my problems here. Honestly I don’t feel any better, even after getting it off my chest, but hey, if anyone’s got any advice to remedy this, I’d appreciate a little hope.

But since I have been spending more time with my conservative catholic batshit crazy family, and lost contact to my very logical, atheist boyfriend, things got mixed up and I have troubles with myself, world perception and everything. I feel like I lack something that was there before I met my boyfriend in university and got messed up in my emotional weird state afterwards. I had moments where I was afraid I couldn't even able to rationalize simple scientific rules, like why vaccination is necessary or things I have learned that were super clear to me just before he broke up with me. He has moved on now, is opening a company, while I'm struggeling to learn simplest things. I feel like the looser. I have the feeling that most of these things are just some form of anxiety or fear rather and that I made all these problems myself .

I heard today that I was accepted and received a $10,000 scholarship. I am torn, between moving or not. I have talked to my girlfriend about a long distance relationship and she said absolutely not.

I already had one friendship ruined in the past after a confession. Friend of mine confessed to me and i just didnt feel the same way. We decided to stay friends but talking became more and more awkward and now we dont talk at all.

And im afraid the same thing will happen if i confess to my crush. Im fine with being rejected, so that's not the problem but i really dont want to lose her as a friend. I like hanging out with her and as i said its hard for me to make friends, so now shes basically my closest friend. I dont mind being just friends but i also felt something more towards her for a while. Is it worth it confessing to her? If so how should i approach it, so its not so awkward and she doesnt feel pressured to not reject me or feel uncomfortable in any other way?",17May2019,1

582,"Ok so, lemme explain this properly. I’m a business student in Brazil, currently looking for an internship. A really big bank, let’s call it Bank A, offered me a really good internship position, exactly what I was looking for and good money. I would have to work from 9:30am to 4:30pm, not a problem. 

My uni, however, won’t sign an internship contract that has conflicting times with my study period. What does that mean? I study in the morning, classes from 7:30-11am. Internship would start 9:30, but only in June, when I’ll be done with classes, but not done with the school semester. However, technically it’s all good, I’ll be done with school, and next semester I’ll transfer and study at night. Start working as soon as I’m done with finals. 

But no, college offered a summer (winter down here) contract going from June 17 to July 31, and said they would change it to a permanent contract once the next semester starts because they can’t sign a contract that has work hours in the morning given my study period is in the morning. Bank A doesn’t accept that and will only sign a normal, 2 year contract (“permanent” contract). 

Monday I’m going to sign and talk to the heads of internship and business adm course in my uni.

I want to play piano and gutiar and drums and all sorts of instruments. I want to be multilingual as languages have always fascinated me. I want to speak German, French, Spanish and Italian as well as English. I want to get books published before I even leave school. These goals seem crazy but I'm normally such a determined person I can achieve these goals. Now I just literally...can't. I want to, but I just can't be arsed.

587,"My partner(29 Let’s call them P) and I (24) have considered getting an apartment with a family friend (20 we’ll call them FF). We are all university students. 
P and I have lived together for 4 years with no issues. Our current one bedroom is nice, but slightly out of our price range. 
FF’s roommate recently moved out and FF now lives alone. I asked FF if they couldn’t find a roommate if they would like to live together. FF initially said no. A few days later FF’s mom called and said FF would like to live with us. 
FF is shy. Doesn’t pay for their rent. FF’s mom does everything for them. We viewed FF’s place and it wouldn’t work for our needs. We suggested finding a different place, possibly together. 
FF’s mom is insisting we each pay a third of rent and all utilities. FF’s roommate used to pay half. Currently deciding to apply for a new apartment with FF. 
P and I would be losing privacy, moving into a shittier place, and losing several amenities (laundry, closet space, quiet suburban neighbourhood) while only saving $50/month each by moving to the new place with FF. Would also be sharing 1 bathroom between three of us. 

P ask their parents for advice. P’s father said paying thirds was unfair because we only get one bedroom and FF gets their own. 

P suggested a 40/60 split in rent and utilities split in thirds with FF’s mom. FF’s mom flat-out refused saying FF should then get the larger bedroom. OR we move to a much more expensive place that would cost us each the equivalent of FF’s 40% of the rent. 

P and FF’s mom can NOT get into a fight. My family and FF’s family are reliant on each other. FF’s family is loaded, but parents are very frugal. They are willing to pay for FF to live alone in her current apartment. 

P, FF, and I all get along; I’ve known FF their entire life.

Knowing there was no way in hell I could pay that off in time for the next semester I decided to transfer to a community college. 

I was able to get my transcripts for all of my classes with the exception of the ones I took that last semester. After a very successful semester at community college I decided to pursue a degree in nursing.

After finishing all my prerequisites I applied to a few nursing schools and found out that I need *original* transcripts from *each* school I have attended. I obviously can't get that until I pay off the university I attended. I have paid a bit here and there when I can so I owe about $3,800 as of now. I work a shitty job waiting tables and not making much (I don't have a car so my options are limited as I have to walk to work) so I won't make it to the spring 2020 application deadline in August. I can however see myself paying it all off by January 2020, the deadline for fall 2020 admissions so I'm looking at a lot of time off from school with my most recent semester being fall 2018.

Is there anything I can be doing in the meantime? I have completed all of the classes I can complete without being in the nursing program but I was thinking of maybe repeating a few to keep my brain working and maybe even bring my GPA up a bit. I would only be able to take a couple classes to keep my schedule open so I wouldn't be able to receive financial aid (classes are about $600 a piece). 

Should I do it? Or would it just be a waste of money in the long run? I'm really torn so any advice at all is greatly appreciated.

601,"Hello, I am seeking advice to know which one is more realistic. Let me start off by saying that me and my bf are 18 years old. We have been dating for almost two years now and love each other so much (I know some people say teenagers can't love but seriously) and we have been doing great, we are long distance right now about 3 hours away. I go to my hometown (where he lives) every weekend to see him and walk around town. We have known each  other since we were kids. Me and my BF have been wanting to move in together for half a year now and we have been collecting everything we would need except big furniture so far. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I am in foster care and because of that I get extra support, scholarships, housing help, rent help, etc. This comes into play later. I have been wanting to go to the community college in my hometown (I got accepted and it's all payed for, yay!) I still have a few more weeks until I graduate high school, yet my BF has been out of school since March since he went to a continuation school. We have been looking into apartments back over there and found a few that would be great. My BF wants to move out because his dad and great grandmother are physically abusive, hitting him with the house phone or screaming at him he's a failure. They guilt him into spending his money for them or steal from it no matter where he puts in, I have seen this happen with his dad personally. When my BF got birthday money from his aunt and his dad made him buy his dinner with it.  We both want him out of there.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem arises with my boyfriend's job troubles. He has been trying to find jobs on Indeed but nobody replies to him back ever. Because of this fact that he hasn't been able to make any money we've had to push back our moving date from June to July, and we can't push it back any further. His dad's girlfriend works at the local Walmart and my Bf asked for a job and she said yes, and has been telling my Bf he will start soon, but she keeps telling him different things so we are not depending on her. I told my BF that if we can't get a place soon I will not be able to go to the college I already got accepted into and have to stay in a group home type of place or with my current foster mother (which I would absolutely not like, me and my FM hate each other)  so that wouldn't be a good option. My BF did not take this news well and started to cry, saying after all I've been through I shouldn't have to keep living like that and that he failed me. I reassured him and told him we need to keep our hopes up. I wasn't trying to abuse him or anything, he asked me what would happen if I didn't move back to my hometown with all that I have been setting up the past few months. I have been saving up great amounts of money and working part-time through my school.

&amp;#x200B;

Since we planned to move in together in July, we decided he should work beforehand for two months to get enough pay stubs for the landlord to approve us. He would be working full time while I would be going to school full time (foster care sends me almost $1000 a month for rent, I live in an expensive part of Cali so that's maybe 70% of rent and utilities) so I would not be a non-contributor and not have all the stress on him financially. I am extremely worried he won't get a job in time by the first week of June. If he doesn't, I will have to contact my social worker to put me in a program where I have  to live with a roomate they choose, somewhere in the county, which might not even have availability at this point where my hometown is. I have been having panic attack after panic attack worrying about it so much. Please Reddit what advice would you have for us?",17May2019,1
602,"I’ve known her (21) for about a year now, and it took me (22F) a while to realize that she’s not the kind of person I should be around. She has been through a lot of difficulties in the past, with her parents (they’re horrible), being bullied and had friends abandon her, depression (one attempted suicide), and eating disorders. She is still struggling with most of these aspects and I try to help her as much as I can. I’m always available to her, she calls me and I’ll talk to her for hours, I’ve been trying to get her into therapy, I went with her to visit her parents so she didn’t have to go alone, and help her with everything from shopping to university work. 

I’ve always been unable to turn down anyone who’s been struggling, especially with mental illness, because I struggle with depression and anxiety myself and have been through my fair share of pain. It used to be a huge problem for me to the extent that my parents noticed I wasn’t taking care of myself, but rather everyone else, and sat me down. It didn’t do much, and I continued prioritizing other people over my own mental health.

Right before I moved away for university (almost 3 years ago) one of my best friends committed suicide, and since then I’ve stayed away/cut contact with people who were wearing me down with their issues or were suicidal because it caused me so much anxiety. I am scared to death of loosing another person that way and for that reason try not to get close to people who seem at risk. I did well in this sense, and made new friends (who also have struggled heavily in the past/still struggle but are functional and cope well) who don’t suck the energy out of me, but rather energize me and are helping me as much as I help them. Ive learned to prioritize myself and be more selective with who I let in my life. 

But, I made the “mistake” of getting close to this girl who now is becoming exhausting and heavily relying on me with most issues. It’s not mutual in the sense that I don’t rely on her (not her fault, I just don’t feel it helps me to talk to her about my issues and I generally prefer dealing with stuff myself). I’ve also realized that I’m not a big fan of her as a person.. we don’t have much in common and I noticed that I’ve become  increasingly more irritated at her over the past months. She exaggerates her issues, lies about things, and seems use her issues for attention. She will make her eating my responsibility and say things that make me feel shit if I don’t have time for her. 

I don’t want to continue the friendship as it is now, but given how many people have abandoned her in the past, criticized her, and her overall sensitivity, I’m scared of how it’ll impact her and what she might do. I don’t want her to feel abandoned or less than, but at the same time I feel like a fake person being friends with her. She’s noticed that I’ve pulled away, and still, I’m not able to just tell her how I feel. I don’t like being this person, and need some advice as to how I can handle the situation.

604,"This might be long but I need to vent, hopefully get some advice and let it out because it kind of hurt me. We’ve been best friends since freshman year of high school up until late sophomore year/early junior of college. She started hanging out with people who had issues with me for whatever reason, I never hung out or talked to them so beats me why they had issues with me. It doesn’t bug me that you have other friends but being friends with people who talk badly about me and threaten to “beat my ass on sight” is just weird to me. But whatever I didn’t want to stop being her friend because of that. But I noticed how we couldn’t joke the same way and stopped talking almost everyday. When her birthday came up I told her to let me know if she was going to do anything and she said she would. She didn’t. But she did invite those friends who hated me for no reason. Her birthday dinner was down the street where I live and I didn’t even get a single text. I shut her out a bit after that. But on my birthday I had some hope she would wish me a happy birthday but she didn’t so I finally unfollowed her everywhere and never reached out to her. It just hurts me to realize that maybe she wasn’t a true friend to begin with. I started analyzing our friendship over the years and I realized that I was probably being used. I was the first one to drive in our group and she would always ask for rides and once she got her car and license, she stopped. Once I become not useful I believe that’s when she started backing out. Another friend noticed that this friend did this with her too. She wouldn’t talk to her unless she needed something. It’s sad that our friend group will never be the same. What do you guys think I should do? Should I reach out get some closure or just leave it? Again, sorry this is so long and probably all over the place.",17May2019,3
606,"I (24 F) recently moved to a completely different state for my dream job. 

My job itself has been fun and I really love the work and experience. 

My issue is, it’s been several months, and I have yet to make any acquaintances at work. 

I am the youngest in the group by a couple years, but that has never stopped me in the past. 

I would consider myself fun and easy to get along with. In fact, I’ve never had this problem of not being able to “connect” with people. 

I am definitely more reserved at work vs. real life, but I am still friendly. 

However, my coworkers often don’t speak to me (unless I speak to them first, and even then, it’s short responses), don’t really include me in conversations with each other (sometimes they’ll have full blown conversations while I’m in the same room), and will sometimes just stop talking when I come in. 

It would be a lie if I said it didn’t sting a little. I often hear them talking about their plans after work, on weekends, or what they did during the week. 

I don’t really know what I’m doing wrong. 

I’m friendly, i try and start conversations on things I know they enjoy, I smile, I say hello, good bye, etc., but I guess I’m just not appealing?

It’s been tough, mostly because I’ve never had this problem before. I usually get along very well with classmates and coworkers and often grow strong connections. Not to kiss my own ass, but I was also very well liked at all my previous jobs and in classes. 

I’m looking for advice on how to connect with my coworkers, or at least make the environment a little less cold or unwelcoming. 

Thanks!",17May2019,1
607,"So my district got a new District manager a couple weeks ago. He tells us to do some shady stuff, as well as uses highly inappropriate language towards us. He thinks of himself very highly, but then when he senses he said something that made us feel uncomfortable, he tends to back peddle.

A few examples of the “jokes” and things he has said to us at work, and during meetings.

“Buffet stands for Big Fat Fuckers Eat Together”

“There are a lot of chicks with dicks in this area, and I absolutely hate them”

“You suck them in, we suck them off”

He also had to audacity to ask two of my co-workers “which way does he swing”, referring to my third co-worker, just because of how he looks. Which by the way, he looks completely normal, nothing wrong with him, no feminine qualities or anything like that. 100% straight, lol. 

Anyways..

He was also seen at the strip club by my manager, and was also allegedly heard talking about some involvement with consuming cocaine.

This is a married man with two daughters, and it’s just unbelievable with what he says to us.  I can get over the occasional swear words, I’m an adult for crying out loud, but with his constant inappropriate “humor” it’s like what the hell. My co-workers and I all feel sort of uneasy about it, like it is very unprofessional.

He also tells us “legal” ways to tamper and add unwanted services to peoples accounts just so we can make more profit. The way he explains it, it is totally legal, it doesn’t break the law or company policy, but it is highly unethical and very shady.

609,"So I went to an auto parts store for rare parts that I’ve been looking for all day. The store was in the hood and everyone in there was very sketchy. The guy said they didn’t have it, but called some guy/other auto part store, and he had me pay him in advance claiming he would give me a call once the guy came through with the parts. I was given no receipt and have no proof I ever paid him. I was being an idiot in the moment. Now I feel like shit and am almost certain I was robbed. The store closes at 7 and he said that he would give me a call around 7. I can’t afford to lose money, and I feel so disrespected I’m not going to just take the loss. What should I do? I feel like there’s a 10% chance he will actually call me, the parts costed 4x as much they should(didn’t realize till after I paid and looked them up online), and the guy was saying how they could install it for a certain amount once the parts came in, those two things are the only indicators that it’s possible I didn’t get robbed.

610,"I REALLY need multiple opinions on this. 
I know there are more important things happening on r/advice, but this is driving me absolutely insane and bordering on obsession. Please someone help.


So, about 5 months ago, i fell into an extremely dark depression. Quit my job, slept 15+ hours a day, fed my alcoholism, didnt talk to anyone or really see anyone. This went on for a good 3 months. The only thing i was able to force myself to do consistently was go out to comedy open mics, i have wanted to do stand up my whole life. I would go by myself every week to multiple mics. Eventually some of the comics started noticing and would talk to me. The first person to ever speak to me was “Him”. He hosted the mic i never missed at my favorite bar, he also worked at said bar. He encouraged me to go onstage every week after our first convo. We wouldn’t talk in depth, he would just ask if i was going up and i would say no, he would say something along the lines of “you really should”. Make a few jokes back and forth. He was very awkward around me for some reason...almost like he was nervous. I asked the bartender about him and i was told he had a serious girlfriend, she was always at his mics to support him. 

Fast forward about a month, I start feeling good enough to find a job. One of the first places i put my resume into was that bar, and was basically hired on the spot (i’m a regular there and the bartenders love me). Next week i finally perform my first set. “He” starts talking to me more, and i find out his girlfriend recently left for an internship several hours away, and would be gone for 6 months. 

This is where things start getting very complicated and confusing. 

I sometimes would opt out of doing mics out of a relapse of fear. I would still attend, just not perform. He would be very pushy with me and sit around and basically beg me to go up. Like not just a lil encouragement, we’re talking like full blown 10 minute lectures about how i need to do this and i’m funny and blah blah blah. Like he was extremely invested in my success, and mind you we really weren’t “friends” yet at this point. This is also interesting because he is actually an extremely dismissive person, a bit of a loner, dislikes most people (as am i) l, and i have never seen him give a fuck about whether a comic wants or doesn’t want to perform. I have never seen him encourage any other new comics in my time on the circuit. I finally asked him one day why he cared so much, and he basically just said “i don’t know, i think you’re good”.

About 3 weeks ago, we somehow became pretty good friends (probs because we see each other a lot, now we work together and do stand up together) he would hang around with me for a lil while after work and his moc sometimes. I noticed he wasn’t attending mics outside of his own anymore, and heard he was extremely depressed that his girlfriend isnt around right now because he loves her. I saw him kinda moping around one day and started begging him to come out to a mic and do it, like he did with me. I offered to drive him there and back, convinced him he was funny and that i cared about his success. I knew he was doing a lot of sitting alone at his house getting drunk by himself, he admitted this to me while i was trying to convince him to come out. 

So, this past tuesday, i brought him out.

We hit it off immediately and realized we had so much in common. Personal issues, mental health issues, views on life, general brooding distaste for most things, kinda being assholes. We challenged each other a lot and had a lot of deep intellectual conversation, and even worked through some of our issues together. We got very personal very fast. After the mic which ended around 11, we stayed out til 2 am at one of our shared favorite dive bars. The next day, he texted me to ask if i was going to another mic that night. I ended up meeting up with him again, this time things got a lil weird and kind of intimate. 

We drank whiskey together in dark alleyway, general crazy drunk shit. When 2 am hit and the bars closed, he asked if i wanted to come over to his house. We stayed up til 5 am non stop talking. He was touching me and hugging me a lot, at one point he thought i was cold and without asking me went inside, got a jacket, literally put it on me and zipped it up for me. We had one of those moments where we kinda looked into each others eyes and that “thing” happened. At least i fuckin thought it did, maybe i’m an idiot. 

He asked to see me without glasses, also said “there’s something about you” while looking at me, and i caught him staring a few times. He admitted to me that he thought about how much he liked hanging out with me after i had left the previous day, and said i am one of the few people he has ever enjoyed being around that much. 

The next day (yesterday), same fuckin thing. Open mic, stay out til 2, go back to his house and shoot the shit. This time we watched the sun rise together. I was way too tired to drive home and was gonna just sleep on his couch for an hour so i could drive home safely. 
He ended up staying out with me on the couch and we talked even more. I tried sitting next to him and putting my head on his shoulder, asked him if that was too much, he said yes, and i stopped. We also got on the topic of straight men and women being friends, and i eluded to the fact that at least some kind of romantic chemistry will always exist in friendships like that, kinda hint at us, and he basically completely shut it down and was like no there’s absolutely nothing here at all. Eventually he gives in to sleep depravation and goes into his room, and actually TUCKS ME IN. Like super cute, puts blankets over me, tucks them in all along my body. 

Fast forward to right now. I’m fucking losing it. I have been interested in this dude before he ever even spoke to me. The crush became extremely serious when we started working together. I’m borderline obsessed (not like clinically, just been thinking about this and him way too fuckin much the past couple months). I know he has a girlfriend, i am not interested in helping him cheat on her and i dont want that at all (him cheating on his gf would honestly be a huge turn off for me). She will be back in 5 months, they are planning on moving in together, and have been dating for about 7 months. Also what you must know is most of his friends have been females. I don’t know if it’s on the same intimate level like what we have experienced.


I don’t fucking even know what advice i’m seeking. What do i do? Someone please give an opinion on what you think is going on? What the fuck? Anything? Please for the love of f someone say something.",17May2019,0
611,"In order to understand my situation I have to give a little background info: 

Last spring I \[16M\], now \[17M\] developed really strong feelings for this girl. We went on a few ""dates"", and things were looking really good but she ended up friendzoning me. I honestly don't blame her for this because I think she deserves someone better than me and I'd feel inferior to her in every way if she hadn't friendzoned me. I was in ninth grade at the time and once ninth grade ended, I lost all contact to all my friends because everyone went to different high schools. Ever since last spring, I've had no friends, no social life, and It's been a year now but I still haven't gotten over this girl despite trying extremely hard to focus on other things like self improvement. It's gotten so bad that I started having daily recurring suicidal thoughts about 8 months ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

We met up for the first time in almost a year about a month ago. She asked me if I wanted to go to the movies with her, and despite knowing that I have no chances with her, I of course went. We had fun, and when she left she told me to hit her up sometime. I've been trying to think of something fun I could do with her but I just can't think of anything and deep down, I know it doesn't even matter since I don't even have a chance with her to begin with, but a part of me still hopes that some kind of miracle will happen. Despite wanting to cease to exist, I know I'm not going to kill myself because my parents wouldn't be able to handle it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so stressed because I can't think of anything to do with her and therefore, haven't contacted her since our last meetup. I've lost so much sleep over this because every night I keep trying to think of something to do together and then I panic because I remember how long it's been since we met up and how I still haven't contacted her. As a result, I've only gotten around 5 hours of sleep every night this week. My suicidal thoughts were already bad before our meetup but after we met up, the got amplified ten fold. 

&amp;#x200B;

I need t think of something to do with her but really, is there even any point? My chances with her right now are close to zero. I've been saving up money for plastic surgery which I can hopefully get before I go to university. That will be my final attempt to ascend and to become good enough for her but until then I'd like to at least maintain my friendship with her. What do I do guys? All the ""date ideas"" online, even though what I'm going on isn't really a date, are all really awkward and bad. I'm good friends with her now and I don't want to ruin that.",17May2019,1

614,"So, I recently transferred in my job from one store to another due to harassment by my employer.  My new employer is great, but I keep receiving calls and voicemails from the previous assistant manager at my old building, begging me to come back.  When I told them that it was my parent's decision that I don't come back, the old assistant manager began to talk badly about my family.  She called me again today and I politely told her that I would talk to my dad again about transferring back, when I have no intention of doing so and just wanted her to leave me alone.  This had the opposite intended effect as she said that she was going to talk to the manager (the one who harassed me) to tell her that I am coming back to their store.  This is getting to be such a mess and it's really impacting my mental health because I feel as though I am constantly being guilted, and I am getting uncomfortable with constant texts and phone calls from people I don't work with anymore.  When I don't answer the phone, they leave me voicemails and are trying to talk their supervisor, who is also still my supervisor, into bringing me back to the old store.  At the end of the day I just feel like crap and want to cry because I feel like I'm letting them down, but at the same time, I feel like it's rude to quit suddenly, but I don't want to take another two weeks of this and it's causing me mental health problems.  Do I quit so that they don't keep asking me to come back, or tough it out?  I don't like the new store very much anyways, but I especially hate being guilted by the other store at the company.  I have very little experience in the workforce, so I could use some suggestions as to how to deal with old managers constantly bothering you.   I mean, she was really laying on the guilt with phrases like: ""You have to come back, I can't stand working here without you"", and texting me asking for jokes or to complain about their store, or especially to tell me how much the old manager has changed and that they're completely different now.

I started dating a girl in December she had bipolar disorder and anxiety and has a generally fucked up home life that I helped her get out of. 
I learned a while ago that she has attempted suicide before I started talking to her. Bleach plus a bunch of different medications. On all accounts she should be dead but miraculously survived it. However ever since then her stomach hurts very often. She doesn’t feel hungry and has to use other clues (lightheadedness etc.) to know when to eat and overeating makes her feel horrible 
I’m trying to convince her to see a doctor about the stomach pain but she is scared about her parents finding out about it. And all the other consequences of people knowing you attempted suicide. 
I understand that something serious could be going on but am having trouble convincing her cause she’s so damn stubborn

618," 

First a bit of background; I’m a 17-year-old male, live in a relatively large city at home with my mother and younger brother. Both my mother and divorced father are doctors, however, my father stays in relatively good contact and is financially supportive. My two older siblings are both through college.

With that in mind, I am a 17 soon to be 18-year-old that dropped out of high school when I was only just about 16. I dropped out from a mixture of bad social anxieties and a lack of interest in the subjects I was learning. Up to the few months where I started skipping classes and eventually dropped out, I was a good student that usually got high grades. I’m now at a point where I have been out of school for 2 years, and my family believes that I have been getting credits another way. I had never planned to stay out of school this long and I’m starting to realize that the stress of keeping this lie, which I have devoted so much time and energy to, is making me stressed and anxious to a point that it has affected my health. I am looking for advice about how I can resume my education and get my high school diploma in a timeframe that wouldn’t leave me more than a year or two behind that class that I entered high school with. I am an intelligent person and can accomplish goals quickly when I apply myself, but the inability to discuss this issue with anyone around me has stopped me from pursuing opportunities to fix it. I do most certainly plan to speak with my family about this at some point, but I don’t think I can bring myself to do it before I get my bearing and am moving solidly in the direction that I want to be. Any advice about my situation would be much appreciated. Feel free to ask me questions I will be reading all comments.

Tldr: I dropped out of high school in sophomore year. Now at the end of my would be senior year. Looking for advice on resuming my education and getting my high school diploma.",17May2019,2
620,"So, I’m not 100% sure at all and that’s why I’m coming to reddit. My dad is an extremely private person, but the from the little he’s told me about his childhood, I’ve gathered that he grew up in a heavily catholic boarding school and basically lived there as if it were an orphanage because he was orphaned at age 12. He absolutely despises the church, particularly Catholic Church and whenever anyone mentions it at home he’s extremely quick to mention the catholic church’s corruption and tendency to abuse children sexually (stereotypically, I know). And my dad’s an extremely rational and cool headed person (also highly conservative and again not to stereotype but not really one to care about sort of stuff like human rights and equality etc) but when he says these comments about the Catholic Church and chid abuse each time he says it with such undying bitterness which is unusual for him to harbour such strong emotions. What do you guys think? Am I just being completely paranoid and jumping to conclusions or could there be something behind this? 

Side note that I’ve remembered: he once told me a story of one of his teachers at this school who had a “star student” of every week and as a “prize” for being the star student they would go and take a bath in the teachers house. This makes me utterly sick to the stomach and completely dread and feel for what may have happened to these boys. He said one of his friends went to the teachers house and his intuition was telling him something was wrong and just felt uneasy. So maybe I’m not being too jumpy to conclusions??

i currently do not have a drivers license and am not enrolled in college, no job either. i have one friend (met him way back in middle school), and i dont really do anything right now but sleep most of the day and then waste time online. not currently living in a house, disaster “relief” fucking us over, me wanting to kill myself for the eleventh year in a row probably, etc.

i’d like to study to one day be a physics phd or perhaps an MD, things i’ve always wanted to do. but i feel like i’ve already fucked that up because i haven’t taken any steps towards it and by the time I finally do I’ll have lost any motivation.

i’ve never really gotten to live out the life that a child/teen should. i’ve missed out on mostly everything until now. i was hoping to maybe make more friends one day, party sometime, take a few girls home, and actually experience something for once. but i’m already 19, won’t i basically be an elder in the “ages you can be social?” by the time i’m studying, working, and meeting people, won’t i be isolated from that community? i’d like to live this magical “social life” that i’ve always heard about but i’ll be an old man soon in that department

Sometimes when I think. I plan how to end myself, which is unfortunately common. I know I'm not strong enough to commit to it with how others view it as cowardly and painful.

Usually buy some sleeping tablets and overdose myself for a more peaceful rest. This is only when I feel an massive amount of stress or dread about something. Like if I'm in a terrible situation or that things are starting to fall apart. 

I can't tell any of this to my family. Since they're probably won't understand how I'm feeling. I just wanted to be gone from all of these. I just want things to go well. I don't know where to find help or how to without either paying or having my family question me.

I really wanted to just vanish. It's easier, with this growing fear I had in me. Like how I felt like I didn't matter or never made a impact in anything.

I have friends and family that care about me. Though it still have this sense of being someone people can rely on. I care too much and I get overly emotional in crying when I shouldn't if I get overloaded. I'm pretty bad in sports and learning languages so I give up on them. Sometimes hating myself for what I do or am. I should know certain things to live a good life. But I always except someone to help or teach me when I should of researched this myself. Afraid of having a relationship since I'm a terrible boyfriend and don't want to waste their time. I don't know what I should do with everything. I'm lost. 

I have this sense like I'm not good enough for anything and that things keep reminding myself how truly flawed I am. Comparing to people I know who are doing much better than I am. It's almost if it wouldn't make a difference if I was there or not.

Well, the new job has called me and I’m not sure what to do. I had a phone interview and it went well and now I am set up for an on-site interview (Thursday).

633,"I have a friend of 8 years and I notice she would ghost me every so often whenever I had a problem with her I wanted to address. Whenever I mention it's a problem I have either about her or me, if it's about me toward her I ask her questions on how I can be a better friend to her when I notice her attitude toward me. She doesn't respond to it and talks about something else. The last few conversations I had with her were that she needed a new car and that I told her I would try and help her even though I have no money... The last conversation was me pointing something out about her that she didn't like and didn't bother to resolve it with me, instead she just gave me attitude... Another conversation I remember I had with her was when I told her I finally made a new friend since I moved and she told me to use him when I mentioned he had money because he would spend it like it's not a problem on me. (It's a different story and explanation on the new friend part) To be honest, I know she's used people in the past and I'm wondering if she's just using me just like how she talks about other guys she's used as if they were nothing... She even told me we are a lot alike but we really aren't... She's told me a lot of deep things she told me that she's never told anyone else and I'm just thinking after a while and all the times that she's ghosted me for endless weeks, months, even to over a year... But I really don't know. Even when I try to contact her now she doesn't bother to respond. I can't even tell if she's done with me, because the last conversation we had about breaking our friendship is when she was afraid and thought I was going to stop being friends with her when I was changing my number for a different reason. When it comes to friendships, I always like to stay true and loyal to the person. I'm not the type to just leave them. And I'm not the type to use them. She told me that she literally has no one and that I'm the only person she is talking to. I don't want to reveal any personal information with what's going on with her but it's pretty bad...

634,"My boyfriend has recently told me that he doesn’t care to have sex with me anymore. We used to have sex 2+ times a day. He’s said he now feels pressured and forced to do it, because I ask, or try to initiate it. We’re both in our 20’s. I’ve tried to spice things up with toys/Lingerie. He agrees, but ends up not doing it, or only using the lingerie once. I know relationships aren’t all about sex, and it’s not realistic for couples to always have sex. But I’ve expressed to him how it makes me feel constantly getting turned down, or giving me his word on something but not going through with it. He and a close mutual friend have expressed to me how he has always “enjoyed having sex, and he doesn’t do it just to satisfy himself, he does it because he genuinely enjoys it” but I’m seeing something else. I just don’t know what to do, I don’t know if I’m asking too much? We used to be FWB before we started dating, so our relationship was kinda based off of sex in a way. It’s just one of the many problems that we have going on. And I’m at a loss for what I can do? My self confidence has fallen to basically nothing because I’m always getting turned down, and then getting made to feel weird whenever I try to just satisfy myself. Any advice would be very helpful.

I am one of the biggest and strongest kids and in my school and a lot of coaches offer me spots to play on their team even if I have never played the sport. So anyway I was about to leave my English class when my teacher (my teacher is the varsity football coach) told me to come to talk to him. He told me that he has a spot on the varsity football team for me as a quarterback if I'm interested. I told him I would have to talk to my parents and he said ok. I'm not sure if I should take his offer especially since I dedicated my summer to work on getting better for baseball and I feel like football would contradict that.

641,"So this girl let's call her Amy had a crush on me and well so did I so naturally we began dating and it was the best time of my entire life. But after the first month she grew distant from me which worried me cause I loved her, even told her that to which she replied ""that's a bad choice"" now she may have been talking about something happening on TV but idk. 
Anyways she broke up with me in March and initially was a bit hostile towards me even though she was the one to break up with me because she lost feelings.
 Although after a couple of weeks we were back to normal but she kept giving me signals that she still liked me e.g. very, very close proximity to me whilst walking so much so that our hands clashed, various sexual jokes, then touching my shoulder (this is something that I've been told is a thing girls do when they're into you, and she done it prior to us dating). But when I text her she sometimes just won't reply, for instance I asked how she got on in her exam and how her work was but I didn't get a reply which was odd because she would normally reply. 
This has all left me rather confused as she seems to be sending mixed emotions which toys with the feelings I have for her because a part of me still loves her but I just don't know what to do about it and it's kinda leaving me in a pretty crappy mood.

I'm lacking motivation and discipline, so I keep searching for excuses to put everything off till tomorow, and in the end I end up doing everything last night. I failed my last tests week because of this, and now I have to retake them again, but even with my study on line I couldn't bring myself to change.

I've read and watched some motivational stuff, but they always say: ""If you want to become a better person and achieve what you always desired, you will have to study hard."" But I developed a weird view on the world that everything seems like a burden to me. Like yes I could go hard and spend a lot of my time studying, but then I feel like I'm wasting my lifetime on things I don't really enjoy. And then I start questioning myself what's the point of living anyway. (No, i don't mean I'm suicidal lol, I hope you get what I mean)

I'm really clueless, I just want to do the things I'm really passionate about, like video games or going to gym (yes, I'm silly) Deep down in my heart I do understand that it's not right and that I'm just trading long term happyness for short term satisfaction.

She swears he would never do anything but has stated she is concerned that in a fit of anger that he would possibly kill or hurt himself. He has stated to me that he knows he is depressed but he also will not attempt to seek help and has stated he doesn’t see what talking to someone will do any good for him.

650,So I live in Detroit where there are stray cats everywhere you look. There is this one stray cat that had babies last year and only one has survived. The mom stray cat also kind of has a home two doors down from me. I hear them call her by a name and they feed her and put a little home for her on their porch. Now it’s a new year and she just gave birth to five more kittens and they were living inside my cement front porch stairs. So I had a friend that works for a rescue facility come over and it took two days for us to retrieve all of them and she took the momma cat because they were still nursing. Now all the kittens have all gotten homes and she asked if it was okay for them to try and find the mom a home instead of bringing her back.

Also there is a guy who has came back for a month that apparently I replaced because he is doing my job (aquatics) usally while I’m on front  end. What do you think? Am I overthinking it?

652,"I've been friends with this girl for years. We dated 3 years ago and it ended badly (she left me for an ex). About a year later we started being friends again on and off. She's been through multiple failed relationships throughout the years, they've all fucked her over and cheated on her, except for me. For the past 2 months we've been hanging out again and have gotten very close again, she considers me her bestfriend. I still have very strong feelings for her that I cannot shake. She is everything to me and I want nothing more than to be with her. I literally do anything and everything I can for her and I do admit, I love being her friend, but I have so many romantic feelings towards her that I constantly have to hold back out of fear she will yet again reject me. Well, today it turns out she is still talking to one of her other piece of shit exes who may actually have mental issues as he constantly causes fights with her and it got to the point where she called me at 2am the other night to pick her up from his house.

653,"My husband and I bought a mattress a month ago. It was not in stock but we planned on picking it up when it was. On April 25, the Brick called to try to arrange a delivery. I asked them if the mattress and the box spring were there to which they responded no. I proceeded to tell them that we are picking it up and they told me that both items would be ready on May 9th. I informed them that we will pick it up on May 13 on my husband's day off. 

Fastforward to May 13. We went there to pick it up. Thinking it was going to be a quick one, I sat in the truck with our sleeping baby. Then my husband calls and tells me I should go into the store. Upon arrival, I find out that there is no mattress because the CSR insisted that we already picked it up. I assured her that we did not. The sales manager goes on to accuse us of getting a friend/family member to pick it up. I asked to see the signature on the invoice. It is neither mine nor my husband's nor anyone we know. Thinking of the possibilities, I suggested a mixup in paperwork or fraud. The manager refuses to think of any other possibility other than the fact that someone we know picked it up. 

She accused us of mentioning the purchase to someone (which we did not). She insisted that they follow the Brick's corporate policy as guidelines and that they have their own store policies as well. That policy includes releasing items to anyone with the same last name as me (highly unlikely since I have yet to meet anyone with the same last name who isn't a part of my family) as well as to anyone who can give the phone number or the address of the purchaser. The store has security footage which she has said that she will show us (she didn't) and after watching it, she said that a man in a hat that looks like he could be my husband came to pick it up. In a hat?!?!?! Lots of people wear hats. So the store released it to a man despite the invoice showing a woman's name on it. Furthermore, corporate policy states that they need to record the license plate of the vehicle and they did not. According to her, it is ""impossible"" for the store to make an error such as this. FYI, she kept using the word impossible and we told her it IS POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT HAPPENED!!! 

Outraged, I told her that we will call head office to which they said that they won't do anything. Then I said that I will cancel the transaction with my credit card to which she said that can't occur either because she has solid ""proof"" that we picked it up. At this point I was utterly disgusted with her treatment of us. We tried to suggest other possibilities and to provide evidence that we were both at a town 2 hours away during the pickup on May 4th and we tried to name other avenues to resolve this situation. All to which she rejected. 

Because of her ever so graceful cooperation (obvious sarcasm), we took this to social media. Headquarters responded quickly and contacted the store. We were informed that the store will contact us on Tuesday. They did not. We waited on Wednesday. No call either. Finally on Thursday my husband had to call the regional manager to tell him that the store has yet to call. 

After that, the owner did call. He offered to deliver it to us (we live about 2 hours away) or to refund our money. That is it. He spews some BS about how sorry he was and how he is also a victim. In my opinion, if he was sincere, he would have resolved this ASAP. He would also give us some other compensation. When I told him this, he said that he couldn't because he already got scammed. I told him he lost a customer for life and he said he is sorry to hear that but I know he just doesn't care because it is only one household. After telling this to the regional manager, he said that they can only offer free delivery or a refund. 

My issue with this was how we were treated by the store. If they were willing to believe us instead of accuse us, we would not make such a stink. I still feel like the big corporate company and the store wronged us and that they should be able to do more. After all, they were the ones who made the error. I should say that the sales manager is a part if the owner's family so she will likely keep her job. How should we proceed? 

PS I already called my credit card company to cancel. The signatures do not match so I feel like I have a very strong case for that. I also filed a police report as per their suggestion.

654,"Forgive me if  this isn't the correct term for it. My GF (19) told me that for the past few months or so she started dieting and exercising. At first I was super supportive (because diet and exercise is obviously healthy) but the more she told me about it the more worried I became.

There are days where she refuses to eat or only eats a single granola bar because every time she eats it gives her a ton of anxiety. She had ice cream for the first time in months the other day and cried for nearly an hour because of it. She is terrified that anything unhealthy or at this point any food at all is going to make her fat.

For reference she is a very healthy weight but I am afraid that if she continues to reject food like this than she is going to become unhealthy.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in my final year of a 3 year maths degree in the UK, and my final exams start next week. I did alright 2nd year, getting a 2:2, but my level has really dropped this year, I've been to probably only 50% of my lectures and my work has been poor (my course is mostly exam based but with lots of homework). I completely tanked an exam in January, and if I were to resit it I'd have no chance of passing because honestly I don't think I'm good enough to do so, no matter how much work I put in.

&amp;#x200B;

I only signed up for uni because I had no clue what to do next after my a-levels, and uni seemed like the natural next step. That said, I did want to go to uni and was excited to start. But in the first week already I felt completely out of my depth, everyone seemed to get it and I just didn't. My mum said to stick with it until at least Christmas of first year and if I still didn't enjoy it then we could re-evaluate then. So I stuck with it and once I got into a routine I started to enjoy it. No major problems through the rest of the year or second year, bar 1 or 2 resits.  Then about a third of the way through my final year, I lost all motivation to do my studies or even go to lectures. My work was difficult, and I felt out of my depth again and like I was too stupid to get anything right. I really wanted to drop out  but convinced myself otherwise because I had worked pretty hard the first two years, and that I had \\\*almost\\\* finished, and also because I was enjoying the independence of living away from home.

&amp;#x200B;

So I kept going but pretty much stopped going to lectures and doing the work, I had absolutely no motivation to do so and was just hating every minute.

&amp;#x200B;

Now my exams are coming round I feel like I have no chance of even passing my course, in part due to my failed exam in January (I am revising pretty hard for these upcoming exams but don't think it will make a difference). I've lied to myself and to those around me that I've been doing my work and that I feel confident of doing well. I want to take a year out and do some travelling and volunteering after my studies, because I feel like I'll never get the chance again if I go straight into work, and on top of that I have no idea what I want to do as a full time job/career.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have a part time job which I enjoy and is decent pay, and I have some money saved up. But I'm worried that if I fail my degree that taking a year out could ruin any chances (however already slim) of getting a decent job, and now I'm stressing that I'm going to be a complete failure my whole life, even though I know I'm young and in 10-15 years time this might not matter all that much.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure why I made this post, I guess just to get this off my chest. I'm not looking for sympathy, because the situation I'm in is completely my fault, I should've been more honest to those around me and worked much harder the past year, but if anyone has been in a similar(ish) situation and has any advice of what to do next, I would really appreciate it.

656,"I (21 / M) am desperate to take this degree, the only issue is, In the current circumstances with my s/o (20 / F) I wouldn't be able to take it without moving away for 4 years. Ofc with visits being made as often as possible (it's only 3 hours away) 
Me moving away would result in a lot of financial moving for them, but ultimately they would have enough to support themselves comfortably. I would move back to my parents to take said degree and move back as soon as I'm able.
We currently recieve government funding to live, and whilst on that funding, I can't study, hence me moving out for 4 years and supporting myself in that time.

Is it worth testing my relationship, working through financial sorting, long trips back to see them often, to take the degree I've wanted since childhood? Or do I stay, and hope that we can earn enough one day to be able to take the degree at some point?
The degree would be funded by student loans and I'd support myself with maintenance loan. S/o would be able to move to a single persons claim of Govt support, and would have enough to not move home or change their lifestyle.

She said she got to my house by going on yellow pages and searching for people with Mexican sounding last names and hitting up that area. Right away a lot of things didn’t add up to me, for one, although I am Mexican, my last name is on the lease, not on the deed of the house. My name would not show up on yellow pages. And the actual owner of the house does not have a Mexican last name. Not only that but after the fact, we checked and the house isn’t even LISTED on yellow pages. I spoke to her and told her that I didn’t speak Spanish (lie) and that she had to look elsewhere. I left to go run some errands and i also went to go visit my parents. While I was there I filled them in on the strange but rather insignificant encounter I had with that lady and after an hour or so I left. Not even thirty minutes later my mom calls frantically saying that she think something is SERIOUSLY wrong. She said shortly after I had left, two ladies had come up to her door and asked her the same thing, and when she described one of the girls I was able to confirm it was the same girl I saw earlier that day. Now that freaked her out because my parents don’t live too far from me but they live far enough that it was strange to see the exact same lady come to her door. I didn’t want to freak out, I assumed it was just a coincidence so I asked my neighbors if anyone knocked on their door. Nothing. I asked my godparents who live five houses down on my same block and are also Mexican and who for sure have their names on the deed of the house but no one stopped by their house either. 
That incident although very creepy, I chalked down to just strange behavior but I still ended up having someone stay with me for a week just to have an extra body around the house. 
Things stayed quiet until yesterday. Yesterday my nephew was with me and when he was in his room he screamed that someone was staring at him from outside. When I look out the window I see two people in a SUV parked outside my house and they’re just STARING at me. I thought maybe they were visitors for my neighbor but when my nephew left to go home, he texted me that the ladies had gotten out of their car and approached him asking him the same thing they asked me. He blew them off and walked away and when I checked they were back in their car and they were just WATCHING my house. They kept trying to look in and every time I would go to a different room in my house to peep through the window, they where right there, watching me. It took them about ten minutes or so of doing this before they left. 
Now it’s very possible that because all of this is happening to me, that I can’t be clear minded and see the situation clearly. Maybe none of this is strange and I’m overreacting. Maybe there is no reason to be paranoid, maybe it’s just me living on my own that’s scaring me but I just have a strange feeling. I don’t know what to do. I was paralyzed with fear and I’m so upset about it because it wasn’t until they left that I thought about writing their license plate down so I have no information on them. Any and all advice I’d greatly appreciated",17May2019,0

I'm 26 and I'm starting to feel like it's getting really late to still be trying to figure out what I want. I know it's not entirely true, but despair has gotten the best of me. It just seems like there is nothing I fully give my attention or interest to. And still I feel like there's so much I've got to give. But it's not directed at anything. Yet I'm still here, wasting time on a job I hate, in a place where I just don't want to be. I've had so much time to think, I even traveled to beautiful places in Asia. But I always come back to this 'nothingness' that seems to be me. Don't even know what to talk about with other people. I'm just moving through the motions of my daily life without any goals. It is very much a luxury problem I guess, because there are many people out there who are far far more worse off than me. But still, I hope to find some support or something from someone.

Two and a half years ago they moved away for college (about two hours away) and we kept on touch regularly, it became less regular but we were still really close. 

Recently they never take the initiative to chat to me, they wait for me to text and then generally leave me on seen. The only time in the past while they took the initiative to text was to ask a favour and then they didn't even say thanks. They didn't even message me on my birthday or afterwards.  

Anytime they call me I know before answering that it's because they're back home and want to meet up (because I'm their 'best friend' here). 

I know they have been through a tough time recently with personal stuff but it still makes me feel like I'm completely being taken for granted and I think they think that they don't have to work for our friendship at all. 

It's just so hard to bring it up because when I see them I'm so happy to catch up and I find myself pushing it aside.

669,"I have 9 days of school left. I've had a crush on this girl the entire year, but I never got a good chance to talk to her. I was able to ONCE, which at least got her to not hate me, or maybe even like me (in a friendly way, anything else is ridiculous).

Here's the current situation- there's a place by my school that's popular with students (won't go into specifics just in case she uses reddit) with a waiting area where people, including her, often sit. It's comprised of two couches facing each other.

Just today I had an encounter where she sat on the couch opposite of me. I was ready to say something the entire time, but I worried since there was a bit of a distance between the couches. I ended up sitting for a half hour and leaving. She may have looked up from her phone once or twice, so she wasn't interested in conversation. 

The only time I see her otherwise is before PE, after we had changed. She goes every morning and talks with her friends, which prevents me from talking to her, because I don't want to intrude. I am, however, acquaintances with one of her friends, if that's useful info.

I was in a relationship at the time but we were just to different and i could not help her, partly due to the distance and that i did not understand what she was going trough, so it fell apart, i dont blame her people grow apart but it hurt. In the mixture of keeping a long distance relationship and trying to become a soccer player my school took a big hit, i dont have any warnings but poor grades amd now im trying to pull myself together. In terms of soccer before i was injured, a trainer from a team in Sweden that plays in the the highest tier for u17 wanted me to come to them but because i was the only goalkeeper at the time my trainer rejected it, and when the original goalkeeper who played before me in the team came back i found myself on the bench (i have been playing for 3 years) Now i was promised gametime but still i dont get the chance for 5 games in a row. Now i dont really know what to do, because i know sports for me is a way to go to fight thesse intrusive thoughts and depression, i was thinking a combat sports where i could learn to protect myself, but also something where i can compete on high level, due to this i drank a lot on my own 2 weeks ago until i got bombed on a party and thought i should, today i found myself drinking again.

676,"I am using a throwaway and keeping this as vague as possible to avoid my family finding this. I know the title may make me come across as ""I'm 18 so I can do whatever I want,"" but please read the whole post before you comment.

I'm going to summarize my family background to provide context for my motivations. I grew up in a dysfunctional household, to put it bluntly. My father has been emotionally and mentally abusive pretty much my entire life (and I think he may have been borderline physically abusive at times). He was the catalyst for me to start having suicidal thoughts (on my 16th birthday, no less), and I attribute my anxiety disorder to him. Though I love my mom, I can't deny that she is an enabler. It has taken years for her to acknowledge the effects of his actions, and I think it took me moving out at 17 for her to realize this. Prior to that, she had her head in the sand; an example of this is that she (and my dad) would not let me go to therapy because ""I didn't need it,"" and it took my aunt's intervention several months later for me to get the help I needed. (That was more lengthy than I expected, but I think it gives you a picture of my home life.)

I'm now in my senior year of high school, which obviously entails applying for colleges. I didn't get into my school of choice (I didn't meet the prerequisites), but I have been accepted to a local college. My parents are big fans of this choice, as it's a pretty renowned private school in this area, and it is likely that I will be able to go there with a full ride.

The problem lies in the fact that, given my history, I do not want to stay in this area; I am in the process of moving on from my childhood trauma, and I doubt I can when I am in such close proximity to my family. In addition, I've realized that I don't want to study what I will be majoring in at this university (it's similar to what I want to study, but it has a different focus). However, I thought I'd found a potential solution for myself in an out-of-state college: it offers a degree much closer to what I want to study, and the area it's in is much more to my liking. I am also certain that I would be able to pay for my tuition and housing with the help of scholarships and other resources; it is not a situation where my parents would have to take out loans or help me pay for anything.

Unfortunately, my parents do not support my idea, my mom especially. At first, she was trying to persuade me to go to my local school. She escalated further today in the car, outright telling me that I cannot go to this school. Her reasoning is as follows:

1) I have worked too hard to miss an opportunity like the one the local college is offering me.

2) The school is too far away (think the other side of the US), and I wouldn't be able to receive help from the family in an emergency.

3) Moving would be too difficult, especially since I would be taking my own cat with me.

4) She wants me to be happy. She ""wants what is best for me.""

I understand her concerns, but I feel that only point 3 is truly valid. The out-of-state school could provide me a full ride, and I would have the opportunity to study what I truly love. I understand that moving can be logistically difficult, especially with how far I would be moving, but I feel that she might be exaggerating slightly to dissuade me from going; I would not be bringing many things with me, and I am willing to put in the effort to move.

I want to address points 2 and 4 together. While she only stated that she just ""wants"" what is best for me, her previous statements suggest that this is what she knows what is best for me. I'm going to bluntly call bullshit on that: as the previous therapy example highlights, she has not always made the best choices on my behalf; I was the one to recognize what I needed, and it is me that made the positive changes in my life to better myself. Also, I rarely go to them for emotional support anymore, as they have shown me that I cannot trust them. My guess is that by ""support,"" she means financial help; I admit that they currently pay for where I live, and I will be forever grateful for that, but I will not need as much help there when I move.

Despite what she said, I have been continuing forward with my application. Naturally, this is just what I think I should do. Please tell me what you think.",17May2019,1

680,"So as for some background, my parents got in a divorce about 2 years ago (due to my father leaving her for another woman) and he ended up getting kick out of the house. He needed somewhere to go and decided to rent an apartment in the same area as to stay close to home for my younger brother. What I did not know at the time was that he had a terrible credit score and signed my name as a co-signer to rent this apartment. He ended up being there for about a year and then closed on it and left to California to live with this woman permanently. 

Fast forward a few months and in Sep. of 2017 I got a call from a collecting agency demanding $10,000 be paid for an apartment I lived in. I’m only 19 at the time so I have no idea what’s going on or why this is happening. I decided to look into it and discovered that my father had stopped paying rent and moved out with a $10,000 debt behind him. 

I’ve been trying for over a year now to get him to make payments on it and attempt to get my name off and he hasn’t done anything about it. He is an airline pilot and makes close to $200k a year but spends all of his money on lawyer fees, vacations, and alcohol. I’ve had heart-to-hearts, long arguments, and even tried getting his family to help. He even stopped paying for my tuition at school, my phone bill, and my Insurance’s. Nothing is working. 

I got my first big boy job at an amazing tech company and have been putting money away for a while now. I haven’t been able to get school loans, credit card increases, places to rent or anything because of this debt so I finally decided to take action and put some money towards it because I do not think my dad ever will. 

I am now 21 and today I made a huge payment and brought the total down to $3515.15 but I am basically out of money and it would take another 4 or 5 months to save that money up only to put it back towards a debt I didn’t incur. I only make $14 an hour and am I full time college student as well. I was hoping anyone could point me in the direction of how to pay the rest of this off quickly?

I can’t qualify for any personal loans, my mother can’t help, my dads family is unable to help, I’ve tried to dispute it with no luck, and I just feel so stuck and frustrated. I’ve put so much time and money into this thing and I desperately want it off of my name.

681,"hello! to give a quick run-down i’m a really introverted person in a very extroverted friend group and i just made a new friendship with this person who shares the same experiences as me and makes me feel my best and they think the same way too.

so recently we’ve been talking to each other a lot and hanging out which i’m really happy for but i kind of wanna just distant myself from the people in our extroverted friend group, it’s really rude of me to say but i do have reasons.

-they have this tendency to make plans in front of me but not invite (which isn’t a problem to some but it makes me feel insecure)
-they don’t really acknowledge me whenever i sit at their lunch table so when they talk to their other friends (at another table) they all leave the table leaving me there by myself
- they sometimes just push me to the side which hurts sometimes
-i’m always the last to know everything like they’re always up to date where as i’m not
- i’m always in their shadows, these people are very popular where as im just an “extra” as most people call me or “oh hey you’re ______ friend right?” 
-they don’t make me feel comfortable as they did before i feel like an outcast with them and that our friendship has drifted very far
-one of the girl’s in the group really loves talking crap so there was this time i sat with my other friend for lunch so she said “she’s so fake” blah blah blah
-the same girl ^ also said this awhile ago that i always follow them and stuff like that it really hurt my feelings for her to say that to me when i’m loyal to her as a friend 24/7

682,"Okay, I'll try and keep this short but provide as much detail as I can. Sorry if it's long.

I've been friends with this girl for over 20 years. I thought of her as a sister. I adored her. We practically grew up together, but we've begun to grow apart recently. 

She's always been confident in herself, and I always admired that about her. She'd always say she wouldn't change anything about herself because she loves her body. She's always had lots of male attention, and her family and husband are the most supportive of her. They're always telling her how beautiful, talented and wonderful she is.

I'm the total opposite. Grew up hating my body and everything about myself. She was kinda like my idol, in a way. 

She recently moved in with her husband in the past year, and since then, her behaviour towards me has totally changed, and I'm not sure why, or how to handle it, and I wondered if anyone has any advice.

There have been a few occasions over the past year where she's made snide remarks at me, or casually thrown into conversation how amazing she is at something. For example, i baked my husband a cheesecake for his birthday. She baked one too - her first time. Nbd, he loves cake, but she hadn't quite mixed the base properly so melted butter was swimming under the base and leaking out, like grease. It wasn't particularly appetizing but we were both polite enough to thank her and say it looked wonderful. When it came time for dessert, my husband asked for a small slice of my cheesecake because he didn't think he could eat anything else (and said he'd have a slice of hers when he had some room later.) When I cut a slice, she made snide remarks about how my base was hard, questioning what cheese I'd used and saying hers was better. I didn't mind, but i thought it was weird at the time. Or, as another example, we were talking about something stupid, like America's got talent, and she suddenly told me about what a good singer she is, how her neighbours heard her sing and thought she was two different people because she was just *so* good. She's started performing karaoke and singing in public. Her family are always present and cheer her on, saying how fantastic she is and what a good singing voice she has. Don't get me wrong, she's not a bad singer, but she's definitely not as good as she thinks she is. She throws her head back and belts out the notes as if she's whitney houston, expecting everyone to be awestruck. She can sing in tune, but that's about the extent of her ability. And it doesn't bother me if she likes singing and wants to do it, but, like almost everything else she talks about, she doesn't stop talking about how she's the best at it. And she's not. 

 I talked about a level on a game I found difficult, she couldn't resist telling me how she played it on the hardest difficulty and it was *sooo* easy. Or that film I enjoyed? She's seen it 10 times already and knows everything about it. 

She's also started dressing like me. Exactly like me. Same colours, cut her hair the same, dyed her hair the same, except she wears much more revealing clothing (with her husband telling her how gorgeous she looks) and constantly talks about how perfect her body is. She's recently become active on Facebook and posts at least 3 new posing selfies every day of bikini shots or her cleavage on display. The only people that like them are her family and her husband. If she goes to the gym, her husband tells her everyone is looking at her because she's so attractive (I'm not there, so idk if this is true.) She can't stop telling me about how everyone in her workplace has a crush on her. How she got hit on at the nightclub, etc.

There's also been further issues. Because she's become so comfortable in her body and showing it off, she approached my husband with the idea of playing strip poker together (all four of us). She works at the same company as my husband, so they see a lot of each other. I found this super inappropriate to ask my husband, rather than me, if she wanted to ask. It really upset me. I never told her though.

She's been bragging about a recent promotion and everyone told her she deserves it because she's worked so hard. It wasn't an actual promotion. Someone in her team left, so they all moved up. She told the person below her that she didn't think they could do her job, because she's the best at it. He almost quit when she said that, but hes done just as good a job. 

She's recently been pressuring her partner into children. He doesn't want any and is very firm on this, but she's been very persuasive and is starting to convince him he wants children. He has problems controlling anger and regularly smashes up their home (he's on medication but can be unpredictable. He's never hit her though.) They couldn't afford a child on one wage and she earns the most money, so she said he would have to work nights. When I questioned how this would work, with her at work in the day and him at night, when would they sleep? Would her partner be okay spending hours alone with a screaming child? Children can be frustrating at the best of times, so did she feel comfortable her husband's anger wouldn't be an issue? She became very upset at my questioning and dismissive of my concerns, and didn't want to talk about it anymore. I then discovered her family are encouraging this idea, because ""that's how they coped."" Theyre encouraging her to just have a baby, because then she can go on benefits and have ""her bills paid for her"". This plan wouldn't work, because even on one wage, their income wouldn't qualify them for the same benefits as her parents 30 years ago, and they wouldn't get enough financial support to keep their home, if this was the case. She didn't believe me. It was as if, I wasn't feeding her fantasy, so she didn't want to listen.

Now, I appreciate this post might come across like I'm a terrible friend for not supporting her, but she seems so delusional compared to the reality. She can carry a tune. She is probably good at video games and knows a lot about films. I'm sure she'll be a good parents, and I'd be happy to support her in all those things, but she reality doesn't match up with her fantasy. Her husband and family constantly feed her ego, telling her how beautiful, talented and special she is, and i think it's so embedded in her that she now doesn't like when she doesn't get that from the people around her now.

I'm worried for her future, for the future of her relationship, her children, and the future of our friendship. I feel this is a very one-sided friendship now, and don't know where to go. 

I don't think confronting her about it would go down very well at the moment,  and I don't want to not be her friend, but her behaviour has become extremely annoying and i feel like I dont want to be around her anymore while she behaves this way. It's not the friend I've known for the past 20 years. Idk if it's insecurity masking itself as egotism, or just genuine egotism. Whether it's a phase or just who she is now. Idk.

Does anyone have any advice for dealing with egotistical friends? Or any suggestions for how I can learn to accept it?",17May2019,2
683,"I'm pretty sure a lot of people have been going through this, but I feel really terrible at this point.

Me (17) and my dad argue almost every day. Other days we don't talk at all. (With my mom, however, we are fine, even though we argue a bit, we come to an agreement at the end, like normal.) Every time we argue, whatever I bring up to him, he neglects it. He does not appreciate anything I do, he insults me with unimaginable ways (my close friends who I used to talk to about this used to say that) and he does not listen to my mom either. We as a family are not poor, but we don't have a big saving account either since we recently moved to Canada. Whenever my dad is angry like that he leaves the house to do Uber, and me and my mom talk about the situation. My mom tells me my mistakes, like ""playing too much video games"" (they see 1.5 hours a day as too much). But she always agrees with me that my dad needs some kind of teraphy. She brought it up a few times but my dad says things like ""You were supposed to fix me in the last 20 years"" or ""I don't need therapy, you just need to change yourselves first."" My mom is really stressed, and she wants to divorce, but she thinks it will affect my sister badly. (My dad is not that harsh on my sister yet.)

If this continues this way, my parents will probably divorce, and I am afraid my sister will not turn up great. (My dad is the strict one, with him gone, I don't think my mom can keep her under control.)

We just had a major argument, and my dad said I have to ""be like a family member"" and get out of my room (Every time I go downstairs he starts an argument \[and my mom agrees with me\] so I don't want to go downstairs anymore.) or he would take away everything (including my car, which I pay the gas for, and he pays insurance, and which I drive every day about 40 minutes to get to my coop place in school).

I do not know what to do. Anyone who had similar issues, or knows something I can do, any help would be appreciated.",17May2019,1

685,"So, I started juuling upon entering medical school.

I had never done any drugs before but I found that it really relaxes me while studying. It also helps me cope with the immense stress I feel. I only do it while studying, I review lectures for like 1-2 hours straight, go take a piss and a smoke, and go back at it.

It's now as common as my cup of coffee, and I'm not a total fiend. I go through a pod every 2 weeks, so that's equivalent to a pack's worth of nicotine every 2 weeks.

I just take 1-2 light puffs every 3-4 hours, it's great.

I'm relatively healthy as well. I run 5 miles every morning and go to the gym every other day in the morning as well. I'm ripped as shit since I've been doing it diligently since freshman year of college.

Life is good, but she just doesn't like it. I tell her nicotine on it's own is no worse than caffeine but she doesn't seem to understand that the main carcinogenic effects were from the TAR/combustion of the nicotine and filler itself, which JUUL vaping doesn't have.

688,"Hi, this is my first post so please bear with me. Thanks!

So let's get straight into it. I won't go into too much details about the relationship but I've realised in retrospect that he was controlling and manipulative. After I broke up we decided to stay friends and only a month after I moved to uni which was far from home and closer to where he is. Long story short he stayed with me the first few days (it was dumb, I know, but I struggled with anxiety and he was manipulative). It was my birthday and start of uni so he said we'll go out. I suspect I got too much alcohol or something else that night because he had to half-carry me home and I've never been so ""out of it"". 
We had sex. 
The thing is, I didn't want to. For DAYS he's been asking for us ""to just have sex"" and ""we've had it before, come on"", I turned him down, told him I didn't want to. I even woke up to him 'ping me', trying to kiss me. I don't remember everything that evening but I remember just laying on the bed thinking ""fuck..."" Not being able to move. I remember crying into the pillow just wishing it was over. I remember throwing up and saying ""I just want to sleep"" and him saying ""just a bit more"".
Apparently he had asked me several times if I wanted sex (what he told me) and I said no repeatedly until I said yes once. I don't remember this. 

Thinking about it makes me so sad even months later. I don't enjoy closeness anymore, it makes me uncomfortable. And I don't know what I feel is ""legit"". He was drunk, I did say yes (according to him). I just feel so.... Alone. I haven't told anyone because I don't know what to say.
Was I sexually harassed by him or am I just overreacting? How do I get past this event?",17May2019,0
689,"Hey Reddit,

I am in serious need of guidance because what me and my small brain can come up with clearly isn't enough.

The school I applied to for 2019 fall semester was an early decision application. It is the school of my dreams and has everything I wanted in a University. I got accepted, paid enrollment fee a while back, but the financial package didn't come out until later on. It is now the 12th hour and my family and I are just now finding out we cannot afford this school because they did not give us nearly enough financial aid. (expected to pay 33k, can only truly afford 15k)

Because this is early decision and late in the game, I retracted all other applications. I asked to file an appeal with the school to have the counselor tell me it would be a waste of my time (a.k.a. wouldn't cover anything). 

Am I being scammed? Is this common? How do I work around that? HELP!",17May2019,2

693,"Hey guys,

I have a coaching company, with my last name and coaching below it, so lets call it Rundell Coaching for reference.

So we are specialized in lifecoaching and personal training, but i'm almost done graduating for my physio degree - and planning to open my own practice, but here comes my problem.

&amp;#x200B;

We already have our own instagram page, merchandise and official logo with the name Rundell Coaching, and I was wondering how I could fuse the physio part with it.

If I have to change the name, it would cost me alot of money to make new merch, pay a designer for a new logo and I'd have to change all instagram posts..

I was thinking to keep everything, and just own Rundell Coaching with a headliner text below saying Physio - Lifecoaching  - Personal Training

Would this be OK or would it not attract physio clients?

I'm kinda lost in my thoughts and would appreciate any advice. 

Thank you in advance guys, looking forward to your comments.",17May2019,1
694,"Today was my first day working for a newspaper, and I’m in love. The atmosphere’s exciting, the pay is decent (but mostly commission based), and everyone is incredibly friendly. 

Today, also, another company I’ve been trying to get in with for a long time now asked me to meet with them for an interview. It’s a university who’s compensation and benefits are off the charts. What’s especially appealing is that they offer employee’s free entry into a master’s program of their choice. 

The thing is, I love my new job and I’ve wanted into this field for quite some time. Also, the only plausible way I’d be able to meet with the second company is by taking a half day or calling in sick on my first full week.

my mom got really suspicious about it and is rather strict about gore and language, so she won't let me buy any more of the books, and i want to start the show, but i tend to get serious guilt about doing things i shouldn't. jojo is MA, and i'm not exactly supposed to watch MA stuff, but i finished reading phantom blood and want to see the rest of the series. i'm considering watching it on funimation, but i don't want to suffer with guilt.

so i'm torn:

either sit around and let jojo keep going and just move on and find something else (which i *seriously* don't want to do)

or break the rules and watch the show.

696,"i'm 18 years old (F). I have had a small skinny body since I was a kid. i wouldn't gain weight much so I'd eat whatever I liked. Food ended up being a coping mechanism for depression, which I was layer diagnosed with. I hate my figure. I have hip dips and my overall sillhouette is anything but curvy or proportionate. My arms are sueor skinny but my belly is big in comparison. I look comical unless I hide it. People say I have a nice body sometimes but I couldn't disagree more.

When I hit puberty the food I ate kind of caught up to me. I have to admit I have it better than most people because my metabolism keeps up pretty well with my compared to other people. But if it weren't for my good genes I'd probably be obese. Every day I watch myself slowly gain more and more weight. I'm slowly outgrowing all my clothes... I hate myself for it.

I can't stop eating horribly and even if I eat healthy I'd still be eating too much. I need to stop but I can't. It's what makes me happy when I'm sad. I eat for the taste, not to just to give nutrition to myself. I often get to the point of feeling sick from either eating too much or eating too unhealthy; whichever comes first. I hate how I look. I'll never be happy with my body and I want to get surgery someday to fix it to have real curves.",17May2019,1
698,"My thoughts are all a mess right now and it's 2am so I do apologise in advance if I'm not coherent at any stage, or if this ends up longer than it needs to be.

Allow me to set the background up a bit: I (16M), have known this girl (also 16) for almost a year now. We really hit it off when we met and through the magic of technology, we managed to keep in touch. Fast forward a few weeks and we've had conversations longer than a book from the Eragon series. Over that time we became quite close and to make things shorter, albeit much less suspenseful, she confided in me that she had an eating disorder. 

Now that was around September of last year. I genuinely cared about her well-being as I considered her a really good friend, so I looked up as many articles and went to as many forms as I could on people with eating disorders and how to help them. In hindsight I should have told her parents but she mentioned that she trusts me more than anyone (I don't want to come across as if I'm tooting my own horn but it's true, she vents to me about things that no one else knows) and I didn't want to risk distancing myself from her.

Just to clarify before I go on, I'm not posting this for advice with the eating disorder, we've dealt with that grim downward spiral and now and it's a thing she's promised not to ever fall back into again.

She trusted me a lot, and vented to me about issues with her family, friends, school, and so on and so forth. According to her I made her ""feel happy"", and that I distracted her from what was bringing her mood down. I was even dubbed her ""seratonin giver"" haha.

But as sweet as that all sounds, it wasn't the case for long. From around November she started slowly drifting away, we spoke less and less until it all just stopped and we had an argument about things unrelated and fell out completely, although in hindsight I could have dealt with the situation in a much more mature way.

We more or less didn't speak until about two weeks ago, when she reached out to me saying how she was feeling down again and how she didn't know anyone who would just listen and comfort her as well as I could. I was touched by all that and while I believe there are much better listeners than me, I accepted her call soon after her texts and we spoke for hours and hours catching up.

Now she's had a very socially awkward childhood, and she had a bit of baby fat, if that's not rude to say, and that on top of her old friends not being the best at looking out for her I believe have caused her to be the way she is today. Don't get me wrong, she's a beautiful soul and is easy on the eyes too, and I genuinely try and help her by listening to whatever she has to say whenever I can, and when I can't you better bet your socks I make time for her. But sometimes things like this happen and as much as I try I feel like I'm doing something wrong:

• She sometimes shuts down emotionally, as in complete shut down and nothing I can do helps and it's just so confusing that I just don't know what to do.

• She breaks down into tears to let it all out, which is alright on its own, but I just want to make it stop for her

• She feels alone in her friend group even though she's aware that she isn't; there's the 'voices' that tell her otherwise

• She's really insecure about herself, which stems from her unfortunate childhood and family situation. To clarify, her parents are lovely, just that there's arguments going on in the household regularly between them and her sisters and sometimes she gets caught in the crossfire. Also her sister occasionally lashes out at her.

• Sometimes she says I can't ""fix"" her but I say I don't care, I'll be there for her no matter what. But I'll be damned if it down sting when someone you care about says that. But she also says I make her happy, which I can tell it's true, because her mood when she leaves a call with me is quite different from when it starts. And I dunno, her being happy just makes me feel really happy too.

I don't even fully know why I'm writing this; maybe to get it off of my chest but I would genuinely appreciate your advice on how I can help her more.

Thank you.",17May2019,1

701,"There's a local festival that has free events/taster seasons in the evening/night.   
A few things I'm interested in - an art tour, two creative events, and one dance class.

The problem is I don't feel very motivated to go...I've no friends locally so I'll be going alone, I'm beyond fed-up of having to go everywhere on my own as it's no fun to do these things alone and you feel like a loser. I'm anxious about showing up to these events and being the only one there, or getting there early and having to hang around awkwardly - this has happened to me far too many times, seems not many people actively look for events to do like I do. 

I'm also concerned about trying to fit everything I want to do in within the few hours I'll have and as there's some travel between different venues I may end-up turning up too late for some things. I only realized last night that this event was on this weekend, so it feels like I've not had the time to mentally prepare myself and it's last minute. 

But if I don't go...I've nothing else to do, in fact until a doctors appointment on Tuesday I've no reason to leave the house at all. I've no life and suffer depression so I need to get out the house, I don't have much disposable income to try new things or go to paid events, thus it feels like I'm obliged to go to these events for my own good.",17May2019,1
